1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,334
[Oliver] <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,753
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,922
I'm recommending he be
transferred to a facility

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,298
that can provide the care that he needs.

5
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,092
-Where's my dad?
-Have a seat.

6
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,262
He's gonna be okay,
but I need to tell you about it.

7
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,640
You wanna keep going,
or are you gonna testify?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,561
We're leaving.

9
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,147
You've seen what having Felicity
in my life has done for me.

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,899
You deserve that same kind of happiness.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,031
I've located the Heir of Ra's al Ghul.

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,627
-So, where are we going?
-Wherever you want.

13
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,212
It's up to me?

14
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,048
I'm the well-traveled man. I've been
every place in the world there is.

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,842
But you want to get out of here.

16
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,555
Because if the police know
you're alive, they'll come after you.

17
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,639
The Arrow, too.

18
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,310
Yes. If someone knew where I was,

19
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,521
it would be unfortunate for both of us.

20
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,648
So, why did you reach out to me?

21
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,735
I don't want to hurt, or get hurt.

22
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,695
Never again.

23
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,198
I can teach you to be strong,
in heart and body.

24
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,367
I can teach you to protect yourself,
so, no one will ever hurt you again.

25
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,369
That's what every father
wants for his daughter.

26
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,059
Malcolm Merlyn's legacy lives on.

27
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,561
This is a new dawn.

28
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,732
Al Sa-Her was going to bestow on us
a new golden age,

29
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,111
and lead us into the realm of Thanatos.

30
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,448
Yet for what greatness
Merlyn possessed in his soul,

31
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,285
he lost in his heart.

32
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,539
He swore that our great journey
would be nothing

33
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,833
without his blood legacy at our side.

34
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,585
And thus, before he gave up his life,

35
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,755
he made sure this journey
could not commence

36
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,007
until his beloved was ready.

37
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,846
Step forward.

38
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:32,360
I have to say,
the new uniforms do not impress me.

39
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,489
We've cleansed ourselves
of your father's sins

40
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,660
for our rebirth, which couldn't be
further from your fate,

41
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,871
daughter of the Demon.

42
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,708
I would so relish
slitting your throat, Athena.

43
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,127
One thing we have in common.

44
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,046
Except I've grown a taste
for the contemporary.

45
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,050
Such as plastic explosives.

46
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,756
Oh, my gosh!

47
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,508
{\an8}You'd be in so much trouble
if your dad saw you doing that.

48
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,886
{\an8}You're lucky you have such a cool aunt.

49
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,222
{\an8}You know, who approves of bad behavior.

50
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,058
{\an8}-I'm gonna miss you.
-I'm gonna miss you, too.

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,102
{\an8}Just promise me that you're gonna
watch over your dad, okay?

52
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,187
{\an8}But he is the Green Arrow.

53
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,939
{\an8}You know, before he was the Green Arrow,

54
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,024
{\an8}he actually used to be
really afraid of the dark

55
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,694
and he needed a night light
in his bedroom till he was what, 16?

56
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,365
It was not a night...
It was not a night light.

57
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,492
I couldn't sleep
with it being pitch-black.

58
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,411
{\an8}By the way, I did see that.
Go get a fork and a plate,

59
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,455
{\an8}and get yourself
a reasonable slice of cake.

60
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,499
{\an8}Yes!

61
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,087
{\an8}Thank you for doing this.
It's actually pretty cool.

62
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,546
{\an8}Why do you sound surprised?

63
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,092
{\an8}I don't know. I just thought that maybe,

64
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,636
{\an8}you'd be a little more anti me going.

65
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,846
{\an8}I'm the one who encouraged you
to go follow your heart.

66
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,225
{\an8}I know, I know. It's just that,
now, that it's all real, I just...

67
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,562
{\an8}I thought that maybe you'd be like
a tad less supportive.

68
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,106
{\an8}I'm completely supportive

69
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,441
{\an8}of anything and everything
that makes you happy.

70
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,819
{\an8}Speaking of which, I did tell Roy

71
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,071
{\an8}that the two times
that I shot him with arrows

72
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,781
{\an8}would be nothing
compared to what would happen to him

73
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,950
{\an8}if you end up unhappy.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

74
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,494
{\an8}-Yeah.
-I spy an overbearing big brother.

75
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,746
{\an8}Again, no, no, he's never been like that.

76
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,831
{\an8}Never?

77
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,126
{\an8}I know we've said it a million times
but we're gonna miss you,

78
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,461
{\an8}we're really gonna miss you.

79
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,630
{\an8}You guys have to come visit us
once we find where we're gonna land.

80
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,173
{\an8}Where do we think that's going to be?

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,303
{\an8}We don't really know exactly,
but that's kind of the best part.

82
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,306
{\an8}I mean, we're gonna figure it out
as we go along.

83
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,933
{\an8}Aw, that's so spontaneous and romantic.

84
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,311
{\an8}As long as we're together,
that's really all that matters, right?

85
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,147
{\an8}So, how's your new roommate?

86
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,232
{\an8}She's just as messy as my Laurel,

87
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,609
{\an8}but surprisingly, she's a better cook.

88
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,112
{\an8}You trust her, Lance?

89
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,990
{\an8}I'm not stupid, you know. I know
who she is, I know what she's done.

90
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,535
{\an8}But she says she's trying to get better,

91
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,789
{\an8}and, well, that intel
she gave you last week on Diaz,

92
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,082
{\an8}that panned out.

93
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,669
{\an8}-Yeah. He still got away.
-Don't they always, though?

94
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,255
{\an8}I'm sensing a work conversation, so...

95
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,883
{\an8}Where are we with the SCPD?

96
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,843
{\an8}Well, Dinah and Curtis,

97
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,054
{\an8}they are growing a list of
possible cops on the take,

98
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,680
{\an8}but that could end up being
the least of our worries.

99
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,641
{\an8}-How so?
-The DA's office refusal

100
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,643
{\an8}to drop your case without Roy's testimony,

101
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,978
{\an8}that doesn't sit right with me.

102
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,646
{\an8}And who's to say that the SCPD

103
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,607
{\an8}is the only part
of the city's power structure

104
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,317
{\an8}that Diaz has got his fingers in.

105
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,403
{\an8}Yeah. Oliver, you let me worry about Diaz.

106
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,988
{\an8}You spend a little more time
with your sister

107
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,198
before she gets out of here.

108
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,741
[chuckles] You think this guy's gonna

109
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,534
stop worrying about things
all of a sudden?

110
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,369
Well, ever since
he trusted me to take over.

111
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,705
If that's still on the table.

112
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,833
{\an8}I'm gonna go, grab some cake.

113
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,922
{\an8}You brought this up last week.

114
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,131
I don't know, man.

115
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,051
I thought we were clear,
you wanted out, I wanted in.

116
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,096
-Has something changed?
-Yeah.

117
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,056
Yeah, it's just you and me.

118
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,935
And we don't know
what Diaz has, what he doesn't.

119
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:39,065
And bottom line, I don't think
that it should be just you.

120
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,740
This is definitely one of the jerks
who beat Roy to a pulp last week.

121
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,327
I wonder what food they're serving
at Thea and Roy's goodbye party.

122
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,663
Pizza, apps,

123
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,415
maybe like some mini-desserts,
that's this new thing.

124
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,334
Like you go to a party
and then they serve you

125
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,461
these desserts like mini-donuts,
and you just dip them in the sauce.

126
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,879
That would be reason enough
to crash a party,

127
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,048
not that I'm saying we crash a party.
I'm not expecting to be invited,

128
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,593
-but Felicity's my business partner...
-Curtis, focus.

129
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,428
We need to find out
how many of these cops are dirty.

130
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,181
-Well, Officer Hester makes ten.
-Yeah, and counting.

131
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,809
The more cops who are dirty,

132
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,853
the harder it is to believe
Captain Hill didn't know.

133
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,937
Who's next?

134
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,566
Nick Anastas.

135
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,944
More like hot Anastas. Wow.

136
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,362
Just because you've the hots for him

137
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,156
doesn't mean he's not on Diaz's payroll.

138
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,615
All his stats check out.

139
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,909
He hasn't had any influxes of cash
into his account,

140
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,369
no pressure points for blackmail.

141
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,788
Look, I'm just saying,
you never mentioned to me,

142
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,833
that you worked
with such a hot police officer.

143
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,126
Not even once.

144
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,669
I guess I never noticed.

145
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,297
Yeah, just like you don't notice
beautiful sunsets and rainbows.

146
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,841
You just don't. You see, beauty is...

147
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,177
Hey, Z. How's school?

148
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,804
-Good. Hi, Dinah.
-What's up, Zoe?

149
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,681
Feeling like some mac and cheese tonight?

150
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,601
-Again?
-Can you get sick of mac and cheese?

151
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,227
Definitely getting there.

152
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,147
-Come on.
-Going to my room to do homework.

153
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,357
[chuckling]

154
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,277
You two seem to be getting along well.

155
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,071
Yeah. It's almost nice
having a little Munchkin around.

156
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,867
I'm sure Rene appreciates somebody
he trusts taking care of her.

157
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,077
Yeah, you know,
he should be starting rehab soon.

158
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,246
Hopefully, he'll be back to normal ASAP.

159
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,874
-I really, really miss that guy.
-Me, too.

160
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,460
-[cell phone chiming]
-Hey, it's your boyfriend. Anastas.

161
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,670
Homicide, gotta go.

162
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,965
You keep digging. I got to find out
who at work I can trust.

163
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,926
He's not my boyfriend yet.

164
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,386
I'm on it.

165
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,769
I can't believe we're actually doing it.

166
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,312
Yeah, I can't believe it, either.

167
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,731
Happily ever after.

168
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,901
Yeah, ever after.

169
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,364
-Okay, that wasn't so convincing.
-Hey, I'm thrilled.

170
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,491
I just... I don't wanna jinx it.

171
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,410
Okay, since when
do you believe in superstitions?

172
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,914
Well, ever since I met your brother,
there's not a lot I don't believe in.

173
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,667
-[loud thudding]
-[tires screeching]

174
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,925
Okay, now, I may believe it, too.

175
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,302
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

176
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,516
Please tell me you've packed
some weapon somewhere.

177
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,730
Follow me! Hurry!

178
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,402
Nyssa, what...

179
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,696
-What is going on?
-We need to move.

180
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,448
-What, are there more coming?
-Many more, these were the scouts.

181
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,284
They look like the League of Assassins.

182
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,869
No, the League of Assassins
was disbanded, this can't be them.

183
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,414
Nothing stays dead forever.
Your father made sure of that.

184
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,876
Okay, well, I don't care.
I'm sorry, this is not me anymore.

185
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,837
I've nothing to do with this.

186
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,798
Like me, you are an Heiress to the Demon.

187
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,092
That is something
you can never truly run from.

188
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,518
Hey, what happened?

189
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,980
-Thea, are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine, I'm okay.

190
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,774
I'm doing pretty fine myself,
thanks for asking.

191
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,985
They weren't even out of city limits
and they got attacked.

192
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,779
-It's because she jinxed it.
-[Nyssa] Superstition played no part.

193
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,906
I hear you've taken my husband
as your own.

194
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,620
Yeah. Well, we can talk about that later.

195
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,497
In the League, such talk would take
the form of mortal combat.

196
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,249
What the hell is going on?

197
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,294
Apparently, my dear old dad decided
to recruit some loyalists

198
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:32,256
-before Nyssa disbanded the League.
-For what?

199
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,675
To start his own. The Thanatos Guild.

200
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,469
Began hearing whispers about them

201
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,262
shortly after we all returned
from Lian Yu.

202
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,473
He couldn't have lived for long
considering he didn't leave the island.

203
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,309
Moses never entered the Holy Land,
and yet, his legacy endured.

204
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,020
His second-in-command,
Athena, took charge.

205
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,980
A contemporary of mine, and a rival.

206
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,400
Her involvement alone suggests
a very dark purpose at work here.

207
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,445
Why would this Guild attack Thea?

208
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,614
Before Merlyn gave up his life,

209
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:00,493
he discovered a map that leads
to something ancient. Powerful.

210
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,577
I do not know what it is,

211
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,287
but I do know that he yearned for Thea

212
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,039
to be at his side when he unearthed it.

213
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,999
It's really funny he never mentioned this.

214
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,167
Because he knew you were not ready.

215
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,379
Athena believes Thea to
either be in possession of the map,

216
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,756
or at the very least have knowledge
of its whereabouts.

217
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,634
Well, you have fun
on your treasure hunt, okay?

218
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,928
I told you, you cannot run from this.

219
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,889
[sighs] Watch me, okay?

220
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,393
Roy and I are getting out of here
and back to our lives.

221
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,977
I need your help obtaining the map.

222
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,773
You cannot deny your father's legacy
anymore than I can deny mine.

223
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,775
They will find you.

224
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,068
What do you want from me?

225
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,320
[Nyssa] Merlyn
had an associate in Star City.

226
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,906
If he shared the map's location with
anyone, it would've been with her.

227
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:39,990
You haven't spoken to her?

228
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,202
She does not care for me.

229
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,328
[scoffs]

230
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,789
[coughs]

231
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,167
But she would not deny Merlyn's daughter.

232
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:56,257
Okay, fine.
I'll go with you to talk to her,

233
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,968
we will help you find your map.

234
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,305
And then, that's it.
I'm done for real this time.

235
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,894
Drug deal gone bad.

236
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,439
Very bad. The man was shot
over a dozen times.

237
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,566
Maybe he pissed off the competition.

238
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,485
I'll take it from here, Lieutenant Drake.

239
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:20,114
Captain, this is a drug-related homicide.
Isn't it a little below your pay grade?

240
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,366
It's part of a larger,
uh, sting operation.

241
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,617
I wasn't aware of a larger...

242
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,495
You aren't aware because it's
above your pay grade, Lieutenant.

243
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,832
Well, we'll head back
to the station, then.

244
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,088
Hey. You can leave the evidence with me.

245
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,511
Of course.

246
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,446
Now I see why
you didn't want the boys to come.

247
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,073
That is Tigressa.

248
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,330
Looks like the only thing
she knows how to kill is vodka.

249
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,624
[Nyssa] She has over 200 confirmed kills.

250
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,294
One of them being her own brother
because he matched her quote.

251
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,635
Al Ghul.

252
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,056
I should take your hand
for what you did to Al Sa-Her.

253
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,975
I never understood
your affection for Merlyn, Tigressa.

254
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,686
But I always respected it.

255
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,564
-This is...
-His spawn.

256
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,651
You think I wouldn't recognize
Malcolm's own blood?

257
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,111
Your father had much faith in you.

258
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,073
Yeah, well, but that new league
he created running around,

259
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,574
I can't say the same for him.

260
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,493
So, you've met Athena.

261
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,664
She is not the leader
your father desired. You are.

262
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,834
Yeah. Well, I'm sure death has
cured him of his disappointment.

263
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,462
Look, the only reason
why we are here is because

264
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,715
Athena thinks I can open some map for her.

265
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,009
And with good reason.

266
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,345
Your father made sure
you were the only one

267
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,389
that could actually unlock its secrets.

268
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,099
Of course, he did.

269
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,394
And that is why Athena needs you.

270
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:20,317
Your father secretted the map...

271
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,070
Here.

272
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,323
And why didn't you just take it?

273
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,658
[chuckles]

274
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:32,288
I rejected the path of the League
of Assassins a long time ago.

275
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,877
One day, you're gonna have to tell me
how you did that. Thank you for this.

276
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,379
When you find it,
you may not be so grateful.

277
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,214
I was being polite.

278
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,220
We should contact your brother.
There's safety in numbers.

279
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,515
Overwatch, are you sure we're alone here?

280
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,435
Yes, it's just the five of you.
No other souls for two blocks.

281
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,895
Copy.

282
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,695
Be cautious. Merlyn would have
laid traps to protect this place.

283
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,113
What kind of traps are we talking here?

284
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,616
Are we talking<i>Raiders</i>
or <i>Temple of Doom</i> kind of traps?

285
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,744
-[Roy] You okay?
-I will be once this is all over.

286
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,828
Yeah, me, too.

287
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,330
[Nyssa] Get down!

288
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,501
A trap. Excellent.

289
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,339
-"Excellent"?
-We must be close.

290
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,134
[John] Thermal imaging is showing

291
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,761
that what we're looking at
is what we've got.

292
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,137
No hallways, no doors.

293
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,097
Malcolm had a secret chamber
in his office.

294
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,933
He might have something here.

295
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,393
Clever.

296
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,442
[sizzling]

297
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,238
Iodide diazonium.
A component magnetically attracted

298
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,367
to the same type of steel
my father used to encase relics.

299
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,095
Okay. That's not a map.

300
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:15,099
The map is inside.
It's an ancient League cipher.

301
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,810
-Does it need a code?
-Try my birthday.

302
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,603
Eighteen digits across, three alphabets.

303
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,480
Okay, so, it's not my birthday.

304
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
[Nyssa] Tigressa.

305
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,655
Guys, about you being
the only souls for two blocks.

306
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,156
Funny thing about those ninjas.

307
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,035
I want Al Sa-Her's daughter, and the map.

308
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,956
I'm always merciful
when I get what I want.

309
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,833
I know you better than that.

310
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,169
Stand down. I'm not gonna ask twice.

311
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,012
Come with us,

312
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,514
and we'll let your friends
continue to draw breath.

313
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,434
Stay where you are,
and blood will be shed.

314
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,314
We'll go with shedding blood.

315
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,400
Except, it'll be yours.

316
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,569
Take this someplace safe. Go.

317
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,196
Exit's kind of blocked right now.

318
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,865
We can help with that.

319
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,703
[grunting]

320
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,843
You've had the same footwork
since you were eight years old.

321
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,523
[Roy] Thea!

322
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,449
Held my own. Barely. Let's go.

323
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:14,218
Make your father proud. Come with us.

324
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,222
Felicity, I know you were wondering.

325
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,723
[panting]

326
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,727
It's from <i>Raiders...</i>Kiss the floor.

327
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,734
[Roy] <i>I've got Thea and the map.</i>

328
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,027
Let's move.

329
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,454
Here, let me help you.

330
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,125
Okay. God, that bitch
has a really powerful kick.

331
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,877
I think she might have
broken one of my ribs.

332
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,380
I assure you, that will be
the last time you have to face her.

333
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,298
Yeah, you'll get no complaints from me.

334
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,968
This Athena doesn't seem like
the type who'd give up easily.

335
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,053
I intend to take
the choice out of her hands

336
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,389
by taking Merlyn's map far from here.

337
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,142
I know the toll
a father can have on a child.

338
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,520
Even long after he's gone.
This is my burden, not yours.

339
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,731
You didn't tell me that this
was the box from <i>Hellraiser.</i>

340
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,983
Take care of each other.

341
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,776
That was a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

342
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,820
Okay, wait. Now, how're you gonna open it?

343
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,322
I'll find someone
who can unlock the cipher.

344
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,366
My people invented mathematics after all.

345
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,535
Yeah, no, no, no.
Not this type of mathematics.

346
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:25,539
Wait. Look, you can't
go out there by yourself.

347
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,249
Not with Athena's assassins
looking for you.

348
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,959
She said that's what
she wanted to do, Thea.

349
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,336
-Yeah, it's not what I want.
-Speedy.

350
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,881
You made it clear once I acquired the map,

351
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,508
you'd have no interest
in your father or the League.

352
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,428
And you made it clear that this map,
it leads, to what,

353
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,680
something ancient and powerful?

354
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,267
Okay, you cannot take this on by yourself.

355
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,521
Plus, we have the world's
greatest mathematician right there.

356
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,816
And the protection that you're gonna need

357
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,194
to keep that thing safe,
while you try to open it...

358
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,987
I appreciate the gesture.

359
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,157
Can you do it?

360
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,826
Well, in my experience,
anything locked can be hacked.

361
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,245
Usually, by me.

362
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,873
Thea, are you sure about this?

363
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,209
[Oliver] Nyssa's right.

364
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,545
You did say that you wanted
nothing to do with Malcolm's legacy.

365
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,671
I know, okay.

366
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,799
Look, I can't believe
that I'm even saying this,

367
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,721
but after seeing those assassins, I...

368
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,099
This all just became too real.

369
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,228
Nyssa gave you an out.
I don't know why you don't take it.

370
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,522
I don't know how to explain it to you
right now, okay.

371
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,859
I just... I need you to trust me.

372
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,404
[sighs] All right, you ready?

373
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,574
To go to prison for stealing
evidence? No, not really.

374
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,077
I'm doing the stealing,
you're doing the hacking.

375
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,621
Something tells me the police
don't make that distinction.

376
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,670
This could be the last time I'm here,
not as a suspect.

377
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,797
Okay, but how long is this gonna take?

378
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:03,011
-My worry is 25 to life.
-Come on.

379
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,598
-Okay, keep watch.
-What!

380
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,183
I thought you said
no one else is gonna be here.

381
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,893
We are here, aren't we?

382
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,526
[Dinah Drake] Ooh.
This might take a while.

383
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,445
[door closes]

384
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,822
Crap.

385
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,865
Come on.

386
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,327
This is police access only.
What're you doing here?

387
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,623
Nick Anastas! Hey!

388
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,919
-It has been a while.
-Do I know you?

389
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,716
Yes, of course. Curtis Holt.
We met through Dinah Drake.

390
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,345
She's my friend and your Sergeant
or Lieutenant, or was it just Detective?

391
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,015
Either way,
I'm meeting her here for dinner,

392
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,102
but I kind of got lost
in this new building.

393
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:57,065
I mean, I really haven't seen
this place since it was blown up.

394
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,608
I can give you a tour if you want,

395
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,652
while you're waiting for Lieutenant Drake.

396
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,030
She usually doesn't show up
for her shift for another hour.

397
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,616
Totally Dinah. She's a major slacker.

398
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,617
[chuckles]

399
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,953
-Come on.
-Yeah.

400
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,633
Gotcha.

401
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,473
-Nyssa.
-Husband.

402
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,142
[laughs nervously]

403
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,518
You got to stop doing that.

404
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,688
I do have a wife now, and, um,

405
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,357
she doesn't like it.

406
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,401
But that's the fun of it.

407
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,113
Thea might want you to stay,

408
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,825
doesn't mean you have to.

409
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,369
The point about Felicity's utility
was well taken.

410
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,371
So was her point about wanting
nothing to do with Malcolm.

411
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,332
It's her life
and she must find her own truth.

412
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:59,044
I think her truth is a new life,
that she's earned.

413
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,756
She's earned your support for
her actions, whatever those may be.

414
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,801
I can understand why she would be
conflicted with Malcolm.

415
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,554
He was her father.
I am not conflicted. He was evil.

416
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,141
And Thea should not be charged
with righting his wrongs.

417
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,143
My father was also evil.

418
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,480
And I've dedicated the rest of
my life to righting his wrongs.

419
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,316
From what I understand,
you've done the same.

420
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:26,196
But my father asked me to.
With his dying wish, he asked me to.

421
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,698
Back on Lian Yu,
Merlyn gave up his life for Thea,

422
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,118
just as your father did for you.

423
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,537
I believe Thea owes him the same debt.

424
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,956
Well, it is convenient for you
to believe that.

425
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,584
Because Thea gets you closer
to what you want.

426
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,879
So, do not pretend that
you're selflessly supporting her.

427
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:48,135
And never ever lecture me
on what I owe my sister.

428
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,303
-If you think I would...
-[Felicity] Nailed it!

429
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,182
I nailed it, I got it. Whoo!

430
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,059
-You've unlocked the map?
-No.

431
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,477
Okay, so, what do you mean by "nailed it"?

432
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,188
I figured out how to unlock
the <i>Hellraiser</i> cube,

433
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,690
but I just thought
you should do the honors.

434
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,608
You've heard of the
Fibonacci sequence, right?

435
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,901
Let's assume not.

436
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,028
Fibonacci sequence
is a mathematical pattern

437
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,907
dating back
to Pingala's formula in 450 B.C.

438
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:11,992
-[Roy] Wow.
-Yeah.

439
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,660
When you said "ancient,"
you were not kidding.

440
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,744
I never kid.

441
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,413
Except where my marriage
is concerned, apparently.

442
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,624
The Fibonacci sequence.

443
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,210
Every number is the sum
of the two previous numbers,

444
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,422
so, finding the two starting ones,
that's the tricky part.

445
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,756
What are the starting numbers?

446
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,176
-Ten and thirteen.
-Is she right?

447
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,261
1013 was the year the League was founded.

448
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,431
-And Malcolm's birthday.
-Okay, sit.

449
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,145
Try 10, 13, 23.

450
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,063
-Thirty-six.
-Fifty-nine.

451
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,190
Ninety-five.

452
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,068
-I was always good at math.
-That's right.

453
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,281
[clinking]

454
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,202
Hmm.

455
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,836
What does it say?

456
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,132
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

457
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,802
[sighs]

458
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,391
Why're you burning it?

459
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,852
She's heating it.

460
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,813
The League writes in hidden text that
can only be revealed through flame.

461
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,234
-You don't remember?
-I don't want to.

462
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:35,158
I don't know what's going on with him,
but just keep working on it.

463
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,870
-Why isn't the flame working?
-There's two possibilities for that.

464
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,457
Either Malcolm was using
a different type of invisible ink...

465
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,708
Or?

466
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,336
Or there's nothing on this
and we're wasting our time.

467
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,505
What's this?

468
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,424
I thought since old-school wasn't working,
I'd try some new-school.

469
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,428
The scanner can make
a 3-D voxel-based recreation.

470
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,181
I didn't start using a computer
until I was 25.

471
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,599
That explains a lot.

472
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,022
If I can duplicate the map digitally,

473
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,275
there might be some hidden markers
on there that we can trace.

474
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,695
-Sounds complicated.
-It is. Very.

475
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:19,703
So, it would be really great
to not be distracted, you know.

476
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,579
Very true.

477
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,749
I'll stay here to make sure
you remain uninterrupted...

478
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,628
-Sister-wife.
-Okay.

479
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,679
Okay, so, somebody is grumpy.

480
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,308
I'm sorry. I'm trying to be supportive.

481
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,559
But?

482
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,396
But I don't understand why you think
that this is your responsibility.

483
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,231
He died for me.

484
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,526
Okay? I don't know what it is,

485
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,029
but ever since
I found out about this, I just...

486
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,616
I feel like I can't run away from it yet.

487
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,452
No, you see,
that's where we are different.

488
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,955
You see this
as us running away from something,

489
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,249
but I see this
as us running towards something.

490
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,001
Something way better.

491
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,879
You know just, I don't know.
I just feel like

492
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,131
recently, you've just been finding
any excuse you can

493
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,466
for us to stay here.

494
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,344
Unlike all my boyfriends in the past,

495
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,557
I do find it kind of cute
when you're being insecure.

496
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,561
I just don't wanna lose you again, Thea.

497
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,400
That map is not my future.

498
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,573
You are.

499
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,000
I love a good old murder board.

500
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,713
Yeah. Feeling very Alan J. Pakula.

501
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,758
Sometimes, I forget you're not Felicity.

502
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,595
Now, look. I know this has probably
already occurred to you,

503
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,515
but all Hill did was
take the evidence from your hands.

504
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,350
That's not necessarily proof.

505
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,435
Not to mention, her name did not pop up...

506
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,772
-She's dirty.
-Are you asking me, or telling me?

507
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,608
You tell me if these drugs
are the same kind Diaz pushes...

508
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,361
If Hill took it off your hands,
that would be pretty damning.

509
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,738
And the fact that so much
of this department is so crooked,

510
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,866
would make a lot more sense
if it was rotten from the top down.

511
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,036
So, are they Diaz's drugs?

512
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,580
I don't know yet.
Maybe we should just try it.

513
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,542
Or we can read the analysis.

514
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,298
-Oh.
-What?

515
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,884
-It's Vertigo.
-Vertigo?

516
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,596
I heard of this back in Central City.
It's a hallucinogenic, right?

517
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,350
Yeah, but the good thing is that
this isn't Diaz's drug of choice.

518
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,811
-So, Hill is clean.
-Looks like.

519
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,065
You actually look disappointed.

520
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,068
It's 'cause it means
we're back to square one.

521
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,153
Yeah.

522
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,450
Thinking about taking that thing with you?

523
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,161
[sighs] One hundred percent no.

524
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:11,207
-You okay?
-And why wouldn't I be?

525
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,793
I mean, Roy only thinks
I'm gonna leave him

526
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,504
and a bunch of crazy assassins
that my dead dad organized

527
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,550
are trying to kill me,
so, my life is just great.

528
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,428
You know, Thea, you don't have to do this.

529
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,472
You don't have to leave
everything to Nyssa.

530
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,476
Myself, and John and Felicity,
we will stop Athena.

531
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,648
You can go, you can live
your happily ever after with Roy.

532
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,735
Here, I thought
you were supposed to go live yours.

533
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,698
Felicity, she told me you stopped
being the Green Arrow.

534
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:49,245
Yeah, that was the plan. Life interfered.

535
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,956
-John got hurt.
-He did.

536
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,458
But he's not hurt anymore.

537
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,295
I worry that he would be in over his head,

538
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,755
going up against Diaz alone.

539
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,591
I don't think anything's over John's head.

540
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:06,429
You might be right. I don't know, I...

541
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,059
I gave it up because
I wanted to be a better father.

542
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:17,649
But William accepts the idea
that I'm the Green Arrow.

543
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,985
Plus, I don't want to give it up.

544
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,989
-I don't know why.
-I do.

545
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,786
Because being the Green Arrow
is what makes you feel complete.

546
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,079
Hmm.

547
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:35,917
For some reason, when you put that
hood on, it enables you

548
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,586
to become the best version of yourself.

549
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,421
We're supposed to be talking about you.

550
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,592
Maybe we are. I don't know.

551
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:50,515
Maybe that's the reason why I can't
seem to give this life up. I...

552
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,851
[sighs]

553
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,647
I don't know, maybe I'm hoping that
somehow, I'll get the same thing,

554
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,736
and find the best version of myself,
whoever she is.

555
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,615
Athena's group of assassins, found them.

556
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,663
-Where are they?
-Star City gas plant.

557
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,206
It holds the city's entire supply.

558
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,166
-At worst, they could blow it up.
-Why?

559
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,251
It's not their MO.

560
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,087
It is if they're using the plant
to leverage us into giving up the map.

561
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,922
Clearly, Athena
doesn't know you very well.

562
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,259
Yeah, too bad it's not
Ollie's choice. It's mine.

563
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,677
You can't give in to them.

564
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,930
I can't let them hold the city
hostage, okay. This is still my home.

565
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,476
So, what, am I going alone?

566
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,652
Overwatch, you have eyes on the Guild?

567
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,697
No, not yet, but I'm reading
a frequency spike,

568
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,240
which means they just activated a bomb.

569
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,534
Athena's way of putting pressure
on our negotiations.

570
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,077
Fan out and find the bomb.

571
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,954
Multiple heat signatures.
Guys, they got you surrounded.

572
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,748
Head on a swivel.

573
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,792
-Where are the new assassins?
-Everywhere.

574
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,339
You want your map so bad? Come out.

575
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,763
Let's talk.

576
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:15,016
[Athena] Perhaps your father taught you
some sense after all.

577
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:19,103
But you're mistaken if you think
that all we want is the map.

578
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,314
[groans]

579
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:28,029
The map is meaningless
without spilling your blood.

580
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,035
You're really starting to piss me off.

581
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,663
[grunting]

582
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,634
Your father spoke often about you.

583
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,803
He was always ashamed of your weakness.

584
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,057
[grunts]

585
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,031
Don't forget, guys,
we still have a bomb situation.

586
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,742
There's always a bomb situation.

587
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,411
I can trace the frequency root
of the detonator,

588
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,537
it is 17 feet to your right.

589
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,165
-Lead the way.
-[Felicity] <i>Up.</i>

590
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,801
Merlyn said
he tried to teach you to be strong.

591
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,221
-Clearly, he failed.
-I'm not my father.

592
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,391
This isn't working.

593
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,393
I know. It's a collapsible circuit.

594
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,728
I can freeze it. I have done it before.

595
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,064
No! No, it's a mercury switch.
That will definitely set it off.

596
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,190
What do I do?

597
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,651
You can... short-circuit it.

598
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,320
I'm out of electricity arrows
right now at the moment, Felicity.

599
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:52,947
[Felicity] <i>Green Arrow?</i>

600
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,743
On its way!

601
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:00,955
Got it.

602
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,294
Woo! Nice work.

603
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:09,797
Thea!

604
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,258
[grunts]

605
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,690
You've lost.
It's as clear as your imminent death.

606
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,942
You don't know what you're talking about.

607
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,695
I know that you bleed. I win.

608
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,448
You don't want to do that.

609
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,577
[straining]

610
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,044
Are you all right?

611
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,046
I learned a few tricks from Merlyn.

612
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,176
Wait. Where did she go?

613
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,972
That woman is hard to kill.
Were you really going to burn it?

614
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,725
To ashes.

615
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,269
The other assassins either fled
or they're wrapped up.

616
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,854
I really didn't miss those guys.

617
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,980
Speedy, the map.

618
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,819
They were being literal.
They needed your blood to spill.

619
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,071
That's definitely not "X" marks the spot.

620
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,782
Where does it lead?

621
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,367
I believe I know where.

622
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,497
Nanolithography, the map
is printed with bacteria.

623
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,915
[Roy] Ugh. That's gross.

624
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,584
[Felicity] When exposed to the enzymes
of Thea's DNA, it reveals itself.

625
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,128
Ancient League secret?

626
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,712
No, no. This is bleeding edge science.

627
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,048
This requires an atomic force microscope.
Leave it to Merlyn.

628
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,384
Nyssa, you said you know
what this map leads to?

629
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,718
These are ley lines.

630
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,846
Great. Ley lines. You've only seen
those with Damien Darhk.

631
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,139
These are different.

632
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,516
I thought they only intersected
on one place on Earth.

633
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,767
[John] Doesn't look that way from this.

634
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,853
[Nyssa] Indeed. These lines are global.

635
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,105
This suggests the existence of
three intersections

636
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,315
of a kind I thought
only existed on Nanda Parbat.

637
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,776
Right, but what only exists
on Nanda Parbat really?

638
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,195
I mean, besides really depressing decor.

639
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,532
I know now why Merlyn called
his new league the "Thanatos Guild."

640
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,200
Thanatos is the personification of death.

641
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,702
-In Greek mythology.
-[Nyssa] Exactly.

642
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,997
I believe these lines suggests
the existence of three installments.

643
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,165
The three what?

644
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:11,127
Your father discovered the existence
of three Lazarus Pits.

645
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,004
Of course, he did.

646
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,714
Thea, come on.

647
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,592
Hey, Roy, just...
Let's give her some space.

648
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,597
Thank you, sir.

649
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,101
Oh. Officer.

650
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:32,398
Nick. Or should I just call you
"Officer" because we're at work?

651
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,484
Nick's fine. You're becoming
a regular around here.

652
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,528
Yeah, well, you know,
I just stopped by to...

653
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,738
See Lieutenant Drake.

654
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,407
To ask you out. To dinner.

655
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,910
Or drinks or like just coffee,

656
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,369
or we can just
walk down the street and talk...

657
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,788
-Yes.
-"Yes"?

658
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,833
-I get off work tonight at 7:00.
-Yeah.

659
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,377
So, should we say 8:00?

660
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:57,215
8:00 is awesome. 8:00 is perfect.

661
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,384
Yeah, I'll make reservations,
and I'll text you.

662
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,679
-Sounds like a plan. See you tonight.
-Okay.

663
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,188
-Hey.
-What're you doing here?

664
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,523
Getting back on the horse, D.

665
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,152
Back in the game, back in the saddle.

666
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,572
I'm gonna get really
right into... What's wrong?

667
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,992
I checked intake and evidence lockup
for any Vertigo-related cases.

668
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,411
-And?
-There aren't any.

669
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,705
Is that not a good thing?

670
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,833
There aren't any Vertigo cases
because they've all been kicked.

671
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,128
And the evidence released by Captain Hill.

672
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,924
So, she's dirty. She did it for Diaz.

673
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,842
Ricardo Diaz is pushing Vertigo.

674
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,686
-Hey.
-Hey.

675
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:57,024
Look, I'm sorry
for storming out last night.

676
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:02,196
I just really needed some space,
but it really had nothing to do with you.

677
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,614
It's fine.

678
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,784
I'm just trying to figure out if you
packed that bag to come with me,

679
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,868
or Nyssa.

680
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,871
I mean, it's pretty obvious she wants
to destroy the new Lazarus Pits

681
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,665
just like she did with the original one.

682
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,292
I mean, can you blame her?

683
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,795
What would happen if the League
or the Guild,

684
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:21,465
or anyone got their hands on it,
how dangerous that would be?

685
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,468
So, you are gonna go with Nyssa?

686
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:29,265
Look, last night,
Ollie and I were talking,

687
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,978
and we were talking about how when,

688
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,024
you know, he becomes the Green Arrow,

689
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,861
he feels complete.

690
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,864
And I was thinking that maybe
that's because when...

691
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,242
When he puts that hood on,

692
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,496
he gets to right our fathers' wrongs.

693
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,750
And maybe this could be my calling,

694
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,462
this could be what I've been looking for.

695
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,088
So, you've made up your mind.

696
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,467
You know what,

697
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,678
so have I.

698
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,141
[exhales]

699
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,809
[chuckles softly]

700
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,687
-I'm gonna go with you.
-What?

701
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,524
-No, no, you don't need to do that.
-Yes, I do.

702
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,694
I told you, it doesn't matter where we go,

703
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,112
as long as we go together.

704
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,282
God, how did I get to be so lucky.

705
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:32,495
Hmm... I think it has something
to do with a stolen purse.

706
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,496
[chuckles]

707
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,832
[Oliver] Please, just

708
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,835
be careful, all right?

709
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,962
And if you need anything,

710
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,757
or if you don't need anything,
just call me.

711
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,305
-Keep her safe.
-You know I will.

712
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,856
You drew them back into this, Nyssa,

713
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,443
that carries with it
a certain responsibility.

714
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,363
Thea is your sister
and the daughter of Malcolm Merlyn.

715
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,741
She's less in need of protection
than you think.

716
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,331
This is a Horchus dagger.

717
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,125
In the League of Assassins,

718
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,710
it symbolizes
the cutting of marital bonds.

719
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,340
I hereby annul our marriage.

720
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,800
[laughs]

721
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:33,305
Nyssa, as wedding gifts go,
this isn't half bad.

722
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,015
Be well, Oliver.

723
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,565
Well,

724
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,317
this is it.

725
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,154
Thanks for clearing
a few things out for me.

726
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,613
Of course.

727
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,576
-One more piece of advice?
-Sure.

728
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,744
If you're gonna wear the hood,

729
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,914
you shouldn't string John along anymore.

730
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:04,003
I thought I was the one who gave
that wise sibling advice.

731
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:08,257
Nope. That has never been the case.

732
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,553
I'm gonna miss you so much.

733
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,347
You'll be with me the whole time.

734
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,244
Goodbye, Speedy.
