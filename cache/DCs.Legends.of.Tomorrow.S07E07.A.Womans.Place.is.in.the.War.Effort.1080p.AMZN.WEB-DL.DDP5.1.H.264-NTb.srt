00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,653
2 inch I-beams, copper wire.

164
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:17,872
If I can just find
a welding station,

165
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:19,526
won't be a problem.

166
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,962
- Excellent.

167
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,533
- All right, as long as we get
on the factory floor,

168
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:29,623
everything will be easy
as apple pie.

169
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,668
- You ladies are the new hires?

170
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,844
Good, we need all the help
we can get.

171
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,064
- Well, that was easy.
- Hmm.

172
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,632
- You two gals,
hit the assembly line.

173
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,285
- Okay.
- You got it.

174
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,510
- And you, my secretary
just quit on me.

175
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,816
How fast can type?

176
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:51,601
- I can process over
a million words a minute.

177
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:52,602
- Sure.

178
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,648
My office is down the hall.

179
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,650
Start the coffee.

180
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,260
- Oh.

181
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,744
- What about us?

182
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:06,181
- Janitorial is that way.

183
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,530
- Excuse me?

184
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,532
- No coloreds on the floor.

185
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:15,146
- I am getting really sick
of this century.

186
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,626
- Whoa.

187
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,511
- Hello again, name's Abby.

188
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,903
Now, we run a tight ship

189
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,166
and turn around a new
Cat bomber every 48 hours,

190
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,604
but if you follow my lead,
you'll do just fine.

191
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,217
- Sweet.

192
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,827
- The factory wasn't built
with women in mind,

193
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,350
but I could draw you a map

194
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,048
to the port-a-johns outside
if you need one.

195
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,354
- Oh, I'm sure we can find it.

196
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,618
There are a few men here
who were too old to be drafted,

197
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,359
but it's really us ladies
who run the show.

198
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:57,275
- Huh, how empowering.
-

199
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,581
Hey, Abby!

200
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,757
If you were a fruit,
you'd be a "fineapple."

201
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,585
- Very funny, George.

202
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,195
- And I spoke too soon.

203
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,675
- Yup.

204
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,982
- We're gonna start you
on bolts and washers.

205
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:10,419
Now, don't let a bolt go by
without a washer. Got it?

206
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:11,551
- Got it.

207
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,988
- Good.
Now I better get back to it.

208
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,772
- Oh, hey, thanks
for showing us around.

209
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:16,904
- Of course.

210
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,427
Us ladies got to stick
together.

211
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,302
- How the hell am I supposed
to build this thing

212
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,653
if we're not even
on the factory floor?

213
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:34,356
- First day?
- Unfortunately.

214
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,054
- With that attitude,
we can make it your last day.

215
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,622
- What is the point of us
staying?

216
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,363
- Look, I'm with you.

217
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:42,494
This sucks.

218
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:47,195
Or we might've
just been handed a gift.

219
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:48,936
- You have a sad definition
of gift.

220
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,677
- No, we can build the parts
we need here.

221
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,853
We need to smuggle them out.

222
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:56,030
We just got handed
our Trojan horse.

223
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:58,685
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.

224
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:07,694
- Good.

225
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:10,044
Shift starts at 8:00,
ends at 8:00.

226
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,567
- What about breaks?

227
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,525
- Take that up
with the complaint box.

228
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:14,962
- Okay, Where's that?

229
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,355
- Right next
to the champagne fountain.

230
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,798
- What the hell is this for?

231
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,147
- I don't know
where you're from

232
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,540
with that city attitude
and country hairstyle,

233
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,455
but here, we're professionals.

needs us to do,

while we're doing it.

- Me too.

Congrats on the big move.

All the ancestors
are super pumped.

242
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,572
- Uh-huh.

243
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,705
- Well, most of them.

244
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,185
- Who's not pumped?

245
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,187
Uncle Arjomand.

246
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,841
- Oh, come on, guys.

247
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,191
Haven't met
an uncle I couldn't schmooze.

248
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:12,933
- Yeah, see, Amoo Arjomand--
he's like 400 years old.

249
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,370
He's essentially unschmoozable.

250
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,588
If he doesn't like you,

251
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:19,113
he could have you kicked
out of the totem.

252
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,244
- Is that legal?

253
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,724
- I don't know or understand

254
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,726
the rules of the totem,
so, yeah.

255
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,380

So what do I do?

256
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:26,947
- Show him respect.
- Okay.

257
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,731
- How much do you know
about Persian culture?

258
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:29,776
- Full disclosure, eh.

259
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:33,127
- Hello, Legends?
I'm parched.

260
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,868
Can someone bring me
some water?

261
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,739
Preferably sparkling?

262
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,480
- Is that?
- Long story.

263
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:42,092
Bishop dropped in
and--and hold up.

264
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:45,400
This could be the perfect
ta'arof teachable moment.

265
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:46,793
- What's ta'arof?

266
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,882
- Ta'arof is an Iranian custom,

267
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:51,145
the heart of Persian etiquette
and hospitality.

268
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:53,451
Having a guest in the house
is the perfect opportunity

269
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:54,757
for you to learn all about it.

270
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,716
- Okay, regular water
will be just fine.

271
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,108
Well, regular ice water

272

with a pinch of salt
for electrolytes.

273

this quite a challenge.

Good luck.

2-inch I-beams to you?

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,690
- Maybe.

277
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,560
- I wanna snag one
and bring to Spooner.

278

Can you handle this?

279

00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:26,126
- Okay, get in there
and do your thing.

324
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:30,043
- I will cover your shift.
- You sure?

325
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,261
- Just get me home.

326
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,133
- I got you.

327
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,095
- When Bishop gets out
of the shower,

328
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,923
we will offer him some tea.

329
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,446
Big part of ta'arof
is making your guests

330
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,926
feel welcome in your home.

331
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,015
A real
"mi casa es su casa" vibe.

332
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:49,410
- But what if you're the guest?
- Good question.

333
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,455
When your host offers
you something, you must deny it

334
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,631
at least three times
before accepting it.

335
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,111
- That's not insulting?
- No!

336
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:57,984
It shows respect and
consideration toward your host.

337
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,290
You don't wanna be imposing
or seem expectant.

338
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,249
- Okay, if I'm being
totally honest,

339
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,729
it just seems like
you're all lying to each other.

340
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:07,167
- Yes, you're starting
to get it.

341
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,909
It is all a performance,
except in this case,

342
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:13,651
you're both
the actor and the audience.

343
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:17,742
I know it's supes confusing,
but that's how it's done, so...

344
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,919
- Nate, would you like any tea?

345
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,050
- Oh, tea.

346
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,183
It's like you read my mind.

347
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:24,924
Two sugars.
Don't steep it for too long.

348
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,144
- I just smuggled
those back from the totem.

349
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:31,017
That's 600 GSM Egyptian cotton.

350
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,149
- No wonder my hair's
still wet.

351
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:35,760
I usually use something denser.
Oh.

352
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,110
- If I may.

353
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,071
- Mmm.

354
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,204
Nope, I forgot to say
I can't drink caffeine.

355
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,989
It makes me jittery.
Do you have anything herbal?

356
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,078
- I can arrange that.

357
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:50,906
- Great.
Just bring it up to my room.

358
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,908
Definitely invest
in some 800 GSM towels.

359
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,910
You won't regret it.

360
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,218
- Great job, ladies.

361
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,523
See you in two days
for the next one.

362
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,134
Keep up the good work.

363
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,661
- We have to make a new one
of these every two days?

364
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:09,098
- I hope Esther and Spooner
are making progress.

365
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,324
- I did it.

366
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,021
- Don't we need,
like, 18 of these?

367
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,805
- Yeah, well, 17 now.

368
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:23,243
- We are never getting
out of here.

369
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:26,159
- Sir, the First Lady's office
called again.

370
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,987
She's insistent about seeing
the factory in action.

371
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,162
- Tell them I don't need
a babysitter.

372
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,251
- The injection molder
is down again.

373
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:32,948
But I have the work order
right here.

374
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,558
It just needs your stamp.

375
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,082
- I don't know what you girls
keep doing to these machines

376
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,171
that I have to keep
fixing them all the time.

377
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:39,476
You know that costs money?

378
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,175
- Of course, sir.
We're all doing our best.

379
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,785
- Just wish it was
a little better.

380
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:46,440
Give the order to Ms. Godfree.
I'll get it in the morning.

381
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,272
- Hey, what does
an injection molder do?

382
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:55,101
- It makes custom metal parts.

383
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,494
- Like this?
- Hypothetically.

384
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,540
- So with one stamp
on one work order,

385
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,237
we could have a machine
making all of our parts

386
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,152
and get out of here
in less than 48 hours.

387
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:06,068
- What about being invisible?
- Oh, come on.

388
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,853
What is the worst
that could happen?

389
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,163
Warn me if he comes back.

toward me, and poof.

- It wasn't a spell, exactly,
more like a--a feeling.

418
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,388
- And any idea when
it's gonna wear off?

419
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:49,824
- Nope.

420
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:53,219

things easier on us.

- How?

422

- His job is to
run the factory, right?

423
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:57,310
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:58,441
- Well, now that's our job,

425
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:01,009
which means
we get to make our parts.

426
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,793
And as long as
we stay on schedule,

427
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,447
we won't alert Evil Gideon.

428

gonna be a very long day.

We should get some food,
get some sleep.

If we're gonna run a factory,

one of us should probably
figure out how.

This is my mess,

So retro.
- Yeah.

436

Pastry Smash?

437

I love that game.

438
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:35,391
- Here's
another important lesson.

439
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:36,914
When a guest
compliments something,

440
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,221
it's customary for the host
to give it to them.

441
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,702
It shows equality
and mutual respect

442
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:42,790
between the two.

443
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,139
- No.

444
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,708
- Now, you got me
wanting to play.

445
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,843
- Sure, just don't run
the battery down.

446
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,454
Thank you.

447
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,282
- Oh, my goodness,
I'm starving.

448
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,980
What did you guys make?

449
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,416
- Why is he down here?

450
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,504
- I'm learning
about Persian culture

451
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,376
so I can win over
cranky uncles.

452
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,726
- Bishop's my teachable moment.

453
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,684
- You're lucky I love you two.
- Aw, I love you.

454
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,686
Here's some
complex carbohydrates.

455
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,472
- Oh, thank you.
- Salad.

456
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:14,474
- You eat food?
How human are you?

457
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,563
- Biologically, I'm 100% human.

458
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:18,391
- Well, so then, how computer
are you?

459
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,479
- Also 100%,

460
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,263
which is confusing
mathematically,

461
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,699
but accurate metaphorically.

462
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,353

463
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,704

You've done it.

464
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,663
Fantastic work, dear girl.
Fantastic.

465
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,404
- Yeah, don't sound
so surprised.

466
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,492
- All right, Master Green.

467
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:34,363
If you'd be so kind as
to locate us

468
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,452
a pair of torch lights,
we shall proceed presently

469
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:38,454
to the woods,
where we shall begin our work.

470
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,282
- Actually, no need.
Astra's got you covered.

471
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:42,284
Wait until you two see
the workspace

472
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,025
that she locked down for you.

473
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,592
- Good morning, boss.

474
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:49,204
Sarah told me to tell you
that the Eagle has landed,

475
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,597
which is secret code
for "Gary and Gwyn

476
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,078
have set up the time machine
in the loading bay."

477
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:55,819
Why do humans
have secrets anyway?

478
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,691
- Because there are some things
people don't want

479

Without those women,
