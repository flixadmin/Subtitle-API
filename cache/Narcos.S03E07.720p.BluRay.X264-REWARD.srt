On the road from Galilee,

2
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:41,834
Christ came upon a beggar
who had thrice been denied alms.

3
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:49,592
Christ asked him if he'd taken before
that which wasn't his.

4
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,719
"Yes," the man said.

5
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:57,349
He'd taken what he felt
hadn't been given.

6
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,937
Christ asked him...

7
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,985
Christ asked him
where had it left him...

8
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,217
Give him some.

9
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,908
Boss, I think I know whose car this is.

10
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,979
My name is Pacho Herrera.

11
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,442
I want Gerda Salazar
and her fucking sons delivered to me.

12
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:34,989
Until that happens,
nobody in the North Valley is safe.

13
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,615
Is that clear?

14
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,619
Make sure Orlando Henao
gets the message.

15
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,748
And now... pray.

16
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,127

Why haven't you arrested him?

It's not that simple, Jorge.

67

Very few. And nobody knows your name.

We're gonna arrest
Miguel Rodríguez, all right?

69
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,317
And you can put all this behind you.

70
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,154
- Can I ask what your plan is?
- Small team, just before dawn.

- When?
- Zero-four-hundred. Tomorrow.

No, that's not gonna work. Miguel has
rotating security around the building.

74
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,540
They see anything unusual,
a call goes out to Fercho Castillo.

75

That's Miguel's assistant.

76
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,710
They'll be out of the house
before you get through the lobby.

77
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,004
So then help us find
a blind spot in the perimeter.

78
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,924
There's no blind spots.
These people are professional.

79

- We overlap shifts because of that reason.

Make a turn at <i>Avenida Siete.</i>

84

I'll post a man there
that's gonna let you guys through.

85

You're putting a lot of faith in this guy.
You sure we can count on him?

86
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,293
I'll be the man posted there,
but if you don't get Miguel,

87
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,254
they're gonna fucking kill me.
Do you understand that?

88
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,131
- They're gonna kill my family, my kids.
- We're not gonna let that happen.

89
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:12,010
Next time we see you, we're putting you
and your family on a plane to America.

we're dealing
with a different kind of cartel.

93
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,105
Then maybe you
shouldn't have arrested his brother.

94
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,400
This operation could significantly impact
the cartel's day-to-day,

95
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,484
stop the bloodshed.

96
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,070
Based on information
you're unwilling to share.

97
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,823
- Well, due to the sensitivity...
- Yes, you've said.

98
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:36,660
But gentlemen, to ask me to sign off
on this operation blindly?

99
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,538
You haven't given me anything
other than a code name.

100
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,709
How much can you trust this informant...
"Natalia"?

101
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,421
Or is that too much to ask?

102
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,381
I understand your frustration.

103
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,135
But I've been assured
that this intelligence is viable.

104
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,349
If you won't tell me what you have,
then please, get to what you need.

105
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,478
- A small team. No more than ten men.
- Contact General Vargas.

106
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,190
- I'll authorise him to provide you one.
- Actually, sir,

107
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,485
we were hoping you would provide
somebody independent of General Vargas.

108
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:16,617
If you would
just indulge us this one request.

109
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,289
Shall I assume you have someone in mind?

110
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,542

...another setback and I won't be able
to help you, nor will I want to.

113
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,268
The case for the surrender deal
will only be strengthened.

114
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,270
And you and your team will be gone.

115

00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:35,982
Any chance God's bestowed
the right men to pull off this operation?

157
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,527
God has many soldiers.

158
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:44,115
Mine are honest men who answer
to higher powers than you or I.

159
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,786
I'm not concerned about them.
But I'm worried about other issues.

160
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:51,081
Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
has led to new stipulations.

161
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,583
From now on, any warrant I sign

162
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,295
has to be filed
with the local <i>fiscale</i> office in Cali.

163
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,131
Which the cartel will know about.

164
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,883
Possibly.

165
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:06,429
Truth is, your tactics
won't be allowed a second run.

166
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,932
Just have to find new ones, General.

167
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,936
Your men, General,
where are they now?

168
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,813
Awaiting their orders.

169
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,649
The target is Miguel Rodríguez.

170
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,655
Our operation will succeed
because you fulfil your duty to your God

171
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,324
and to your country.
Understood?

172
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,909
Yes, sir!

173
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,162
The operation from a strategic
point of view is a nightmare.

174
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,665
There's a security perimeter.

175
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,128
As soon as the lead team hits the lobby,
the target knows we're inside.

176
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:42,757
Agent Feistl and I will be
right behind you, arriving by helicopter.

177
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,469
We'll land on the roof
and come in from above.

178
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,055
- We're going to box them in.
- Yes.

179
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,640
We have an inside man.

180
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:54,769
He'll be posted right here,
giving us our best way in.

181
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,446
Which one do you want?

182
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,907
- This one!
- Okay. Perfect.

183
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,742
Girls, please get ready.

184
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,623
Paola... you can't do this.

185
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,918
- I'm taking the girls to my parents'.
- Paola, you can't do this.

186
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,628
Especially with what's going on
with the cartel.

187
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,463
What? What are you saying?

188
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,592
Are you telling me I can't protect
my daughters? Is that what you're saying?

189
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:30,138
No. What I'm saying is that we need
to act normal, like everything is fine.

190
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,516
Everything isn't fine, Jorge.
Everything isn't fine.

191
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,560
They could be watching you, me, the girls.

192
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,104
Miguel's become paranoid.
Do you understand?

193
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,735
I'll call you in a few days.
The girls will want to hear from you.

194
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,238
Paola. Please.

195
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,785
The Americans are going to try
to arrest Miguel.

196
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,704
I'm going to make sure they succeed.

197
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,707
Tomorrow, we will be on a plane.
You, me, the girls.

198
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,670
- We're leaving Colombia.
- Who told you I want to live in the U.S.?

199
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,633
Who told you our girls want to leave
the only home they've ever known?

200
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,635
So we need to disappear.
Is that your plan?

201
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,513
Explain to me again
because I don't get it.

202
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,682
What happens if the Americans fail?

203
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:23,024
Paola, please. Please... wait.

204
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,748
Don't leave.

205
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,711
We weren't poor, Jorge.

206
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,549
We always had choices.

207
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,971
This was your choice.

208
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,486
What about the warrant?
You still haven't filed the paperwork.

209
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,197
And I can't authorise this raid
without it.

210
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,991
We're bringing the <i>fiscale</i> with us.

211
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:16,911
Until we're on-site,
no one else knows the real target.

212
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,705
Arrest him quickly.

213
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,207
Because if word of this gets out,

214
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,626
they'll try to stop us
with everything they've got.

215
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,671
General...

216
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,799
General... one more thing.

217
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,345
I'd like to ask you to remain in Bogotá.

218
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,892
Those are my men.
That's my signature on the warrant.

219
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:42,020
Which puts your name on the line, sir.

220
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,439
If anything goes wrong,
and we look like...

221
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,483
Like what? Like idiots?

222
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,778
It wouldn't be the first time,
as I understand it.

223
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:55,950
You don't trust me.
But you can't do this without me.

224
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,871
That's true, but I know the system
we're up against.

225
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,541
With your name on the warrant...

226
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,045
...there's no doubt
the cartel's watching you.

227
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,139
As soon as you make the arrest,

228
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:23,311
I'll be the one to lead Miguel Rodríguez
into custody when the press arrive.

229
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,272
I'll stay here praying for your success,

230
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,776
because there's no doubt
it's your reputation now on the line.

231
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:16,114
Hi, boss. What's going on?
Getting a little late for you, huh?

232
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,366
Just checking in.

233
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,035
You run those taps over in El Lido

234
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,745
- like I asked?
- Yes, sir.

235
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,873
- Perfect.
- All right. Well done.

236
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:33,256
Enrique, why don't you take off
and I'll keep an eye out here tonight?

237
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,675
Is this some kind of test?

238
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,679
Someone offers me a day off,
I say yes.

239
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,355
My wife's been hounding me.

240
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:54,235
I could use a night away
from all of her questions, Enrique.

241
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,405
I'm glad I'm not married yet.

242
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,991
Don't make that mistake.

243
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,204
Thank you, boss.

244
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,130
It's Miguel.

245
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:18,384
Don't worry, boss.
I'll hang out until you get back.

246
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,764
Good.

247
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,727
Miguel's just finishing his call.
Come on in.

248
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,274
We can discuss that later.

249
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,236
He's here now.

250
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,116
Yes, you've said.

251
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:25,868
Bye.

252
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:35,169
My son. You know how he is.
A little... complicated.

253
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,089
He is your son.

254
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,733
- Is this the guy with the warrant?
- Yeah, I think so.

255
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:58,943
Yeah.

256
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,404
Looks friendly.

257
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,365
I don't give a shit,
as long as he does what he's told.

258
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,456
Good things
are coming, Jorge. You'll be part of it.

259
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,251
I'm glad, sir.
Is there anything else?

260
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,463
Take a seat.

261
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,969
You know that my brother...

262
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,514
he doesn't like this war thing.

263
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,684
He thinks it's a mistake,
being at war with the North Valley.

264
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,188
He said this brings too much tension,

265
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,982
with the violence and everything.

266
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:42,111
He's getting counsel
from men I don't trust at all.

267
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,199
Those phones that you...

268
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,494
How do you call it? Wiretaps?

269
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,247
Wiretap.

270
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,750
Do you think...

271
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,421
...you could put one
on my brother's phone in prison?

272
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,306
You want me to tap
Gilberto's phone in prison?

273
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,768
Mm-hmm.

274
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,688
For his own good.

275
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,776
Only if it became necessary.

276
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,237
So... for him.

277
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,367
Of course, sir. Anything you need.

278
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,743
Good.

279
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,997
- This stays here.
- Of course, sir.

280
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,631
Well, I should get back downstairs.
I'm posted outside tonight.

281
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,968
You? Nonsense.
You're too old for that!

282
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,637
I don't mind at all. It's part of my job.

283
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,974
No. No way.
Have one of the young guys do it.

284
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,019
You know, I'm eating late.
Fercho was about to make something.

285
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:01,190
You'll join us.
You'll join us, Jorge.

286
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,277
Fercho, we'll be two! Come.

287
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:44,233
- Do you like filets, Jorge?
- Yes, very much.

288
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,196
Hey, I've been meaning to tell you,

289
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,118
the building guys, they've been idling
in front of the house.

290
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,746
Blocking our exit.

291
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:00,124
You see that? Feels good
when one's been taken care of.

292
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,711
Yes. Keep your walkie charged.

293
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,757
And the exits clear.
Like you said.

294
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,803
- You want one?
- Yes, thanks.

295
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:22,063
Look, I have a bottle
of white wine that is...

296
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,733
Excuse me, boss, if it's not
too much trouble, I prefer red wine.

297
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,237
Okay. It's a shame, but... okay.

298
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:33,908
But I have a really nice bottle
of red wine. I'll bring it. I'll be back.

299
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,173
'You're in for a treat tonight.'

300
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:53,928
Miguel has me cooking
with these Japanese bread crumbs.

301
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,390
Sounds crazy,
but it's actually more tasty.

302
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,767
That's very interesting.

303
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,979
Hey, Fercho, looks like the oil's ready.

304
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,189
Yes.

305
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,205
Boss! Boss! Boss!

306
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,251
We have cars heading towards the building.
I repeat, boss, three trucks with cops...

307
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,030
Gentlemen, by law, I can't let you in.
This is a residence...

308
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,616
We have a warrant. Hey!

309
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,161
- A residence?
- What?

310
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:12,340
Did you hear that?

311
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,346
Enrique! What the fuck is going on?

312
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,181
How come you didn't inform us
there's a helicopter?

313
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,808
- How the fuck did they find us?
- Sir, calm down.

314
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,686
We need to get you out of here now.
There's no time to discuss this.

315
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,980
- Miguel, what's happening?
- You need to hide.

316
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,775
Is there somewhere we can take you?
A <i>caleta</i> in the apartment?

317
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,445
Stop. Get to the lobby.
Get to the lobby and stop them.

318
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,073
It's better if he goes.
Every second counts.

319
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,866
Get to the lobby! Stop them!

320
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,326
María!

321
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,650
No, no, no, no, no.

322
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:16,362
- Colombian law.
- No, but if he's got a <i>caleta...</i>

323
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,990
If you want anything we do in there
to count, follow the fucking rules.

324
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,495
Van Ness. Where are you?

325
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,081
I need the <i>fiscale</i> upstairs.
Where the fuck are you?

326
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,041
This isn't a financial building.

327
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,210
Miguel Rodríguez is upstairs.
We have the warrant.

328
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,839
- Yes. Without an address filed in Cali.
- So fill it in!

329
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:38,884
As I've told you, my office authorised
the search of a financial corporation.

330
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,512
- What the fuck is this?
- Hands in the air!

331
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:51,647
Look, sir, as I told your agent,
I can't do...

332
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,317
Write the address in right now.
That's why you're here.

333
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,570
You decide how you want this to go.

334
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,074
Okay.

335
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,917
- Are you Fernando Castillo?
- What's all this?

336
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,921
We're here to arrest Miguel Rodríguez.

337
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,548
Miguel isn't here.

338
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,107
- There's nothing.
- Look above.

339
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,610
Take that off!

340
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,571
Cabinets. There's nothing here.

341
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,032
Try the ones below.

342
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,255
Who's in charge here?

343
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,133
I asked you a question.

344
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,386
I'm sorry, sir. We're not authorised
to let anyone inside.

345
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,932
You see this fucking badge?

346
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,188
Your superiors failed to report
this operation with the local bureau.

347
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,232
I'd like to know
who'll be answering for that.

348
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:18,275
These are direct orders
from my superiors, sir.

349
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,110
Step out of my way.

350
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,867
Peinados, stay here.
Let's go!

351
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,702
Move!

352
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:31,997
Sergeant, you copy?
The local police are heading up.

353
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,630
Go to the back, please.
You can sit on the couch.

354
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,176
- How long is this going to take?
- Chris.

355
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,767
What are you doing?

356
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,480
Hey, kid. Where is he?
Was Miguel Rodríguez here?

357
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,650
- Don't speak to my son.
- Okay.

358
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,820
Can he please go to his room?
He's just a child.

359
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,822
- Is the room clear?
- Clear.

360
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,616
Okay, leave. Go ahead.

361
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,871
Flores...

362
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,208
- Who's in charge here?
- DEA.

363
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,254
I assume with Colombian support.

364
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,800
I don't see a ranking officer.

365
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,344
Guess that puts me in charge.

366
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,847
There's an exit over there
that leads to the street.

367
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,933
Do you have anyone posted there?
Of course.

368
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,020
If you'd properly notified my unit,
we could've blocked that exit

369
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,731
- and prevented this escape.
- There's no evidence he got out.

370
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,525
That's why you're looking
through the kitchen cabinets?

371
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,203
David!

372
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,622
David!

373
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,751
Wake up, man! We have to go.

374
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,464
Let go of her already.
Come on, man!

375
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:32,076
I think it's time you call your friend
Natalia. Find out what she's heard.

376
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,621
Erm...
Boss, that's Natalia on the couch.

377
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:43,879
- Find out what the fuck is going on.
- Don't say a word, brother.

378
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,715
We need to put them each
in separate rooms.

379
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,717
Fercho. Let's go.

380
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,974
To the right.

381
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,569
This is messed up, man.

382
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:12,241
- If your dad's still inside...
- Just drive the fucking car.

383
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,334
I'm just trying to do my fucking job.

384
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,753
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Gotta be hiding somewhere.

385
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,588
- Gotta be a <i>caleta.</i>
- Where?

386
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:28,799
- I don't know.
- Help us. We're running out of time.

387
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,593
I've never been here before.
I don't know the floor plan.

388
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,054
I don't know anything. This is new.

389
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,389
Wait.

390
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,730
Get back out there.

391
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,357
Fuck... Okay. Come on.

392
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,943
Wait. I need you to hit me first.

393

'We know that agents of the DEA
burst into the building this morning,

00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,000
'just before dawn...'

395
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,128
Hey, what did Salcedo say?

396
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,089
Salcedo! What did he say?

397
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,342
Sir, the thing is...
no one's heard from him.

398
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,261
Motherfucker!

399
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,973
Do me a favour.

400
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,934
Go to his house and
check what the fuck he's doing

401
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,479
that's more important than this.
Please.

402
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,899
Bye. Bye.

Good morning, ma'am.
We need to get into your apartment.

Having fun over there, Van Ness?

00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,624
Pretty sure the door upstairs
didn't close properly.

418
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,802
- What happened here?
- It fell over.

419

- It fell over?
- I mean, in a way, it did.

Check this out.

421

Come on,
there's something we gotta do.

422
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,454
That's it. Try to control the wrist.

423
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,956
The motherfucker's practising
his backhand.

424

That's it. Try to control it.

425
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,836
- Hey! You bastard!
- Hey, fellas. Where are you going?

426

- We're in the middle of a lesson here.
- Who are you talking to?

Why the fuck's my dad's house raided
while you're here having tennis lessons?

David, I don't know what
you're talking about. I don't understand.

430
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,478
You're going to go and help
my fucking dad. Now! Understood?

431
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:10,520
- Yes.
- Let's go.

432
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:13,357
Go on. Quickly.
What were you saying?

433
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,609
It's fine.

434
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,986
Pussy.

What exactly am I looking for?

436

This area downstairs
measures in at 108 inches.

Guys, I'm reading 84.

438

Can you set me up?

439
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,545
- Got the perfect shot.
- Pan towards the top.

440

You guys can't tear down that wall.
You don't have authorisation.

There's an air space back there.

444
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,468
Stop what you're doing.

445
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,387
Oh, Jesus Christ!
We've been over this already.

446

As Head
of the Attorney General's office in Cali,

447
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,434
I have to insist
you put down that hammer right now.

448
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,686
You're currently in violation
of Article 22 of the...

449
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,647
What's that? Arresting a fugitive?

00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,065
- Chris.
- No, fuck that!

451

Miguel Rodríguez is right here.
Inside this wall.

452

And you've broken the law.

453
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,075
As the legal authority in this room,

454
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,120
I demand that you cease and desist
your search of the premises immediately.

455
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,213
Put it down.
We're done here.

456
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:27,884
Yes, and I'll need
your documentation from the embassy.

457
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,845
Your passports.

458
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,473
Your passports.

459
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,853

- Give him your passport, Chris.

'We can now confirm
that the target of this investigation

466
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,960
'was in fact cartel godfather
Miguel Rodríguez.

467
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,172
'With the search now over
and no arrest made,

468
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:08,508
'questions regarding the actions of the
DEA and the credibility of their sources

469
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,719
'will surely arise.'

470
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:13,388
'It's been a frenetic morning here

471
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:17,142
'as a great number of police officers
exited the building.

472
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:20,145
'Official word from the National Police is
that the search has now been abandoned.

473
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:26,151
'Now the question is, what evidence
did the DEA have to run this operation?

474
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:30,155
'The U.S. Embassy hasn't
released a statement yet.'

475
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,577
Thanks for having our backs
up there, boss.

476
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,872
I say we keep our eyes on the building.
No way Miguel leaves here tonight.

477
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,999
And wherever he goes,
we follow his ass.

478
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,876
We're on a plane to Bogotá.

479
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:47,172
Meet Crosby tonight,
Defence Minister in the morning.

480
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,299
He makes the call on our visas.

481
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,302
It's over.

482
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:53,845
We fucked up.

483
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:06,733
It's all good.
He's in front of me. I'm about to tell him.

484
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,779
Hey, I just talked to Manny.
They've left the apartment.

485
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:18,537
Okay, good. But my dad isn't safe
until he's here with us. Call Fercho.

486
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,081
- Right.
- Just make sure. You hear me?

487
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,707
Sounds good.

488
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,006
Okay.

489
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,942
What about my family?
What happens to them?

490
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,902
- You need to get them out.
- 'I know.'

491
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,615
- I put their lives in your hands.
- 'I'm sorry, Jorge.

492
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:41,328
- 'Yeah, we're being recalled to Bogotá.'
- Bogotá?

493
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:43,705
They're gonna know
someone gave up the location.

494
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,667
'Someone on the inside.
If you leave, I'm a dead man.'

495
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,671
- You gave me your fucking word.
- We'll figure this out.

496
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,889
Fuck.

497
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,272
'Hello?'

498
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,651
They almost had you today, brother.

499
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:17,364
- They didn't, Gilberto.
- 'Thank God.'

500
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,491
'It's a miracle you got away.

501
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:22,410
'You need to revise
your security network.'

502
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,666
Bring this to an end, brother.

503
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,504
'You have to embrace
that this is the reality we've built.

504
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:36,966
'It's what's best for all.
Accept it, before it's too late.'

505
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,677
You, Gilberto.

506
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,389
The reality you built.

507
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,266
'And where the fuck has it got you?'

508
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,478
You're upset, brother. I get it.

509
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:52,273
'Yeah, I'm pretty fucking pissed.'

510
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:56,486
Then listen to me. Embrace it.

511
00:44:57,112 --> 00:45:00,240
Look, everything we have,
everything we've ever built,

512
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,034
is because of the decisions I've made.

513
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,787
'Our best strategy is non-violence.'

514
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,040
The best option we have is surrender.

515
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,211
I'm not going to surrender, Gilberto.

516
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:20,760
That was just a dream
you fell in love with.

517
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,763
It isn't mine.

518
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,852
Miguel?

519
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,809
'It takes balls, I'll give him that.'

520
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,896
Balls I wasn't sure he had.

521
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:18,568
You can appreciate
needing to show them off.

522
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,990
You again with those trucks?
I have orders to follow.

523
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,867
And I have new orders.

524
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,585
I don't like it,
this disagreement between them.

525
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,337
Doesn't feel right.

526
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:40,882
It isn't us.

527
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,179
Maybe.

528
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,724
But times are changing.

529
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,019
Let's go!

530
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,021
Follow me!

531
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,413
Everything's going to be okay, brother.

532
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,209
- Don't you worry.
- I'm not worried.

533
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,924
Makes you wish you were out there.

534
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:05,300
Yes, I know she doesn't want
to talk to me.

535
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:07,135
That's why she's not fucking home.

536
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,470
But it's important I talk to her.
Understood?

537
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:15,143
'Look, I don't know what's going on
between you guys, but she's upset.'

538
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,562
Pass her the fucking phone now!

539
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:22,567
'No, Jorge. Give her some space.
She'll call you when she's ready.'
