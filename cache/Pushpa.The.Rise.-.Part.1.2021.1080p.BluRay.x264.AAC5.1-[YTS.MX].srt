3
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,525
This story begins in Japan

4
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,986
where the sun rises first on the earth

5
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:18,908
This is a rich Japanese wedding...

6
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,371
It’s a custom here for groom to gift something to bride

7
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:28,126
This is not about Japanese wedding or their customs

8
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:31,254
Do you see that violin? It is about this.

9
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,315
It's costs is eight lakhs...

10
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:53,859
The reason is, it is made of seldom available wood

11
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:57,447
You will not find this wood anywhere around here.

12
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,628
But, it must be smuggled from China by sea.

13
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:15,256
Shanghai port, China.

14
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:19,051
That wood was transported by this ship.

15
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:28,060
It came from Chennai travelling thousands of miles.

16
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:42,617
They were loaded onto ships by these lorries

17
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:52,460
The place in the world where we can find red sandalwood...

18
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,921
Seshachalam forest, Rayalaseema.

19
00:02:57,423 --> 00:03:01,386
Surprisingly this plant doesn't grow
anywhere else than here on the earth.

20
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:03,304
That is the reason why it costs so much.

21
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,644
This is the gold growing on earth,
it's name is red sandalwood

22
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:33,668
This red sandalwood is being smuggled abroad from here.

23
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:46,556
Truthfully this story is not about Redsandal wood

24
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:51,060
It's about a labourer who became
a part of smuggling syndicate

25
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:52,937
Are you wondering what is a labourer?
Don't take him lite

26
00:03:54,855 --> 00:04:01,612
A guy like you and me would be everywhere,
but a guy like him is rare like the red sandalwood.

27
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:05,575
You are escaping right in front of police...
Who are you?

28
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:08,286
Get down.. get down...
get down.

29
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:33,143
We have met after long time.
How you doing?

30
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,146
Hope you are doing good.

31
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:39,024
That’s ok.

32
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:41,527
Why trouble between us.

33
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:44,989
I will give you Ten thousand.
Will you leave me?

34
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:46,657
Ten Thousand.

35
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:51,954
Bribe? Are you trying to bribe
Tamilnadu Police Is It?

36
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:56,459
Sir, he's trying to bribe us ten thousand, sir.

37
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,802
Twenty Thousand!

38
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:20,691
Thirty thousand!

39
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:34,163
Forty thousand!

40
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:40,085
Fifty thousand!

41
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,306
Fifty thousand!

42
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:13,327
One Lakh!

43
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:23,921
I meant is one lakh per head

44
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,967
What I’m saying is one lakh per head.

45
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:01,751
Brother... Are you Tamil?

46
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,293
What is your name?

47
00:07:04,587 --> 00:07:05,755
Pushpa!

48
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,924
Hardcore Telugu

49
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:26,776
Everyone’s story starts with his birth.

50
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:29,695
But my story has begin after I met him.

51
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:34,909
Don’t stay there gossiping
while you go and have tea.

52
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:37,745
Come fast. We have lots of work. OK?

53
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:01,226
Who is he? Is he your Son in law...
sitting as if he owns the place.

54
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:06,065
My Name is Kesava... this is the first time I've met Pushpa

55
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:10,194
Who is that guy? Sitting cross legged?

56
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:13,072
Hey... what is this?

57
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,157
How can you sit cross legged,
when owner is asking..?

58
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:16,450
Don’t you have manners?

59
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:19,203
What?

60
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:25,125
This leg is mine and this leg is mine...
and i kept my leg on my leg.

61
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,961
Did I put my leg on the owner or what?

62
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:30,590
Does he want me to work or give him respect?

63
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,342
You must change your behaviour
if you want to work here.

64
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,260
You cant behave as you want

65
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:36,554
Is it so?

66
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:40,307
It’s not possible to change my behavior
so how about changing the owner

67
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:42,309
Give me my wages

68
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:44,103
I will leave.

69
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,234
This is enough for what I have done.

70
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:56,198
Give this to your owner and ask him to go
and buy manners in the market if available.

71
00:08:58,408 --> 00:08:59,534
Hold this!

72
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:06,208
This fellow will either rule the world or go to dogs.

73
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:09,920
Hey... Where are you going?

74
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:12,798
I’m also changing the owner.

75
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:15,926
- I want to see what he becomes.
- Where are you going?

76
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:28,981
Hey Parvatamma.
How many days will you escape like this?

77
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:30,733
I gave you money during last Ganga fair.

78
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,610
Forget the principle,
till now you haven’t even paid the interest.

79
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,695
Didn’t I tell you Reddappa that I will pay back next month?

80
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:38,658
You are postponing every month saying next month.
How many times should I come to your house?

81
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:43,537
Shameless people... Shameless people.

82
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:46,373
Reddappa. Don’t shout.
The whole Village is listening.

83
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:49,084
I am shouting so that everyone can listen.
At least then they will feel ashamed and repay.

84
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:51,671
She is a widow. Is that the way to talk to her.

85
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:52,630
widow? So what?

86
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:54,048
She has a son as grown as a buffalo at home.. right.

87
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:56,133
Isn’t he a man? Doesn’t he have hands and legs?

88
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,636
No Reddappa, My boy has joined for work in the mill.

89
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:00,304
He will pay whatever he earns month after month to you.

90
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:01,346
What will he repay?

91
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:03,933
Everyone in the village know that
your son has left the work long time back.

92
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:08,312
What is this son?
Is Reddappa telling the truth?

93
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:11,606
Have you really left work at the mill?
How will we survive without work.

94
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,442
I am asking you.

95
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:17,029
Listen Parvatamma. Forget this.
I will come tomorrow morning.

96
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:18,656
I want you to repay every penny,

97
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:20,282
If not, this time I will not shout
standing in front of your house...

98
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:22,534
will do it from your roof top I will shout in front of everyone.

99
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,370
Drink... Neither son is listening nor the buffalo.

100
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:34,797
Principle Three thousand and
Interest Three thousand six hundred.

101
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:36,506
Total Six thousand six hundred.

102
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:37,717
The account is settled. bye.

103
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:40,803
Glad that your account is settled.
How about mine?

104
00:10:40,803 --> 00:10:42,137
Your Account? What account?

105
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:45,474
Entire village got to know that we have took a loan from you.

106
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:47,810
Now, Shouldn’t all of them know that we have repaid?

107
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,061
Isn’t it simple?

108
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,856
Hello Gurappa, Venkatadri Pushpa has repaid his loan.

109
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:53,691
Ok I take leave now

110
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,777
Yesterday there were so many people at the Ration Shop.

111
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:58,237
Who will tell all of them?

112
00:10:58,612 --> 00:10:59,739
What do you say now?

113
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,782
Gurappa get me the list of Who all were there yesterday?

114
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:04,118
A total of 106 people were there.

115
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:05,369
Pakala Ravi

116
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,620
Chalapathi

117
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:07,788
Munemma!

118
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:08,622
hey.. Stop.

119
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,415
Do you expecting me to inform all of them now?

120
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:11,792
I won’t.

121
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:17,297
Kondal Rayudu!

122
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:20,425
Listen Kondalrayudu... Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

123
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:22,261
- Has he repaid?
- Yes. He has repaid the entire loan

124
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,679
Bainapalli Subbalakshmi, Batyala Alivelu...

125
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,432
Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

126
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:30,310
Pushpa... Inform Venkata Subbamma also.
She is leaving for Dubai in the evening.

127
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:33,438
- Hundred rupees work...
- Thousand rupees work.

128
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:36,483
I have to go... I will pay money evening.

129
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:38,652
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

130
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:42,447
What is this hundred-rupees work?
And what is thousand rupees work?

131
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:44,283
This is legal, so Hundred rupees only.

132
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,994
That is illegal. More money and more risk...

133
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:48,370
Thousand rupees work... Thousand rupees work.

134
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,872
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

135
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,374
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

136
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,587
Hundred rupees work... Hundred rupees work.

137
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,633
Hey... why are you going that side? If we go that side,
there is no surety that we will come back home by evening.

138
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:04,719
I don’t have much work in the evening anyway.
So I’m going.

139
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:07,097
Stop... Stop... vehicle stop.

140
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:09,767
Get on to the vehicle... come on...

141
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,561
Hey... please let our parents know
if I am not coming back.

142
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:38,087
Hey, get down quickly.

143
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:42,382
Move on... move on...

144
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:43,508
Move!

145
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:45,928
Move... move...

146
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:52,893
To hell with this rain!
Get going.

147
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,981
Hey, come fast.

148
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,942
Quickly... we need to cross over the hill till the evening.

149
00:12:59,942 --> 00:13:02,402
- Bro, Is this your first time?
- Yeah bro.

150
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,278
What's your name?

151
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,989
Will they pay us after the work is done?

152
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:10,888
Where are you all going?

153
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,601
We put in so much effort to flick this,
and you want to hand over it to the police just like that?

154
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:19,604
I have an idea.
Come here, I will tell you.

155
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:27,072
Taskforce DSP Govindappa!

156
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:30,033
He's nightmare for Red sandal smugglers

157
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:33,703
After he took charge,
coolies realised that life more important than money

158
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:38,917
If anyone has to cut the trees or smuggle the goods out of
the forest it can be only after he takes a nap.

159
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,677
Ey.. What are you people doing here?

160
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:52,680
We came to graze the sheep... sheep

161
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:53,932
Where are the sheep then?

162
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:57,060
Sheep have gone into the forest to graze...

163
00:14:58,478 --> 00:14:59,938
How many sheep are you grazing?

164
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:02,774
How many sheep do we have?

165
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,734
around two hundred I guess.

166
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:06,319
We will have two hundred sir.

167
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,907
What work does Shepherds have with the axe?

168
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:17,372
They came to graze the sheep
and I came to kill the tiger if it comes...

169
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:22,127
Hey... Is this the way to speak to DSP sir?

170
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:23,378
Don’t you have manners??

171
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:27,257
of course, we have respect, that’s why we hid the logs.

172
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:30,468
Otherwise, we would have moved them out
of the forest in front of you.

173
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,389
Then you would have really lost respect?

174
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:38,268
Hey what are you staring at?

175
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,853
Tiger is caught. Wrap it!

176
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,982
Don’t act smart? Where are goods?

177
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:45,025
Where are goods?

178
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:49,737
I thought you are man who came to catch the goods

179
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:53,491
Didn't know you came to catch whatever come in your way.

180
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:05,253
Hello Sir.

181
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,006
You have just 6 bullets.

182
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:11,843
I have sixty axes around me.

183
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:14,971
We will OUTNUMBER you.

184
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:18,558
Sir, Look at their faces.
They are all looking like rouges.

185
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:20,102
Not now.
We will come back again.

186
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,812
He is giving good advice.

187
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,981
If you listen to him, it will do good for all of us.

188
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:26,566
I plead you sir... please come back sir.

189
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,694
They are strong only when they are in the forest...
Where can they go, sir.

190
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:31,321
Let's go sir...
we will nab them when they come out.

191
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:40,330
Look like they will take out the hidden stock in front of us.

192
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,623
We will lose our respect it that happens, Lets go sir.

193
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,516
Leaf lives on Sunlight to grow

194
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:45,895
The Goat eats away leaves to be alive

195
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:50,317
And a tiger hunts goat to survive

196
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:52,444
Isn’t it the power of Hunger?

197
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:54,654
Isn’t it the power of Hunger?

198
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:03,663
The tiger perishes in death
the death dissolves in time

199
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:08,210
And the time surrenders before Kali
This is a great hunger

200
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,718
The hunted knows it should run faster
And the hunter knows he should outrun his prey

201
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:21,806
If the hunted wins, it will live another day
And the hunter knows, it should win to survive

202
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:28,521
Life for one
May mean death for another

203
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:33,526
Goat has to find a place to hide
if it doesn’t want to be the next lunch of the tiger

204
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:03,973
A Worm is a bait to catch fish
Grains are used to trap the bird

205
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:08,728
A piece of Meat can lure the dog into danger Survival is the hook for human beings

206
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:17,320
In the festival to please a god
Chicken and sheep gets killed

207
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,824
The knife gets smeared with blood
And even a goddess can’t escape from a bait

208
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:24,035
This is the fate of the world

209
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:36,631
If you are not alert, the bait will catch you
You can only survive if you have a hunger to gobble the bait

210
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:45,557
A hungry man can’t see right or wrong
Only the fittest will survive here

211
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:51,229
Goat has to find a place to hide
if it doesn’t want to be the next lunch of the tiger

212
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:16,963
Somireddy-21 kilogram

213
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,298
Okay bro.

214
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,802
It is the same wage that I paid last time also

215
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:24,136
Go...

216
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:28,140
Jayachandrudu-28 KG
Take what I paid for and leave.

217
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:38,234
Brother. I will be with you.

218
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:40,069
What?

219
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,446
I will be with you brother.

220
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:44,741
What do I have with me, except this beedi.

221
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:46,868
Who are you?

222
00:20:47,034 --> 00:20:48,077
Missing finger.

223
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,579
My real name is Kesava.

224
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:52,499
Since I don’t have one finger,
everyone calls me missing finger.

225
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,083
What is the matter?

226
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,794
Brother, do you remember Muni Madhav
from that timber depot?

227
00:20:56,794 --> 00:21:00,757
He said that you will become a great man.

228
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:01,799
Is that so?

229
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:05,303
I somehow want to earn lot of money
and go back to my village.

230
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:07,597
I think I can earn fast if I’m with you.

231
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:14,061
what? so you want me to become
a great man for your sake.. uh?

232
00:21:14,061 --> 00:21:16,939
I thought of myself.
But you will become big.

233
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,484
How much do you want to earn?

234
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:22,904
Ten Lakhs

235
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:27,450
That's it?

236
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:31,454
Ok, go fetch my wages of Thousand rupees

237
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:32,872
Okay Brother.

238
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:36,042
Hey missing finger, Didn’t you collect your money already?
Why did you come again?

239
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:38,795
Not for me. I came for Pushpa’s wages.

240
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:40,212
I have loaded his log just now.

241
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:42,048
Pushpa? Who is he?

242
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:49,681
There.. that guy sitting cross legged under
the tree, and smoking a beedi.

243
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:54,143
He is a coolie him self.
And you are his coolie is it?

244
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:59,315
He could be sitting under a tree today,
The day he gets an opportunity he will rule the country.

245
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:01,067
Remember that.

246
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,027
- Get lost you coolie fellow.
- Hey police.

247
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:09,784
Hey useless fellows...

248
00:22:09,826 --> 00:22:14,163
You have twenty guns and forty bullets around you.
We will OUTNUMBER you.

249
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:17,542
No one will survive even if one person moves.

250
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:20,670
Stay where you are.

251
00:22:29,095 --> 00:22:30,346
Hey, throw

252
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:32,515
Come on... throw.

253
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:34,934
Hey, they coming closer... throw it.

254
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:51,075
Run.. run... run...

255
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,995
If you are caught by police
no one will come to save you.

256
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:55,622
I've pinned all my hopes on you.

257
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:01,794
Police are attacking from all sides
Run away from here.

258
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:00,853
Stop it... Stop

259
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:06,859
Where is the Lorry?

260
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:08,360
What sir?

261
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:11,823
Why do you always catch my collar and not the goods?

262
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:17,704
Lets go to the station and talk...
It's hot here.

263
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:22,667
I won’t move my leg.
You go.

264
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:32,594
Where is the lorry? speak!

265
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:36,639
Speak, speak out!

266
00:24:37,098 --> 00:24:37,932
Water...

267
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:40,434
Water...

268
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:47,358
He made the Lorry disappear right in front of our eyes.

269
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:49,861
Searched everywhere.
But couldn't find the lorry

270
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,243
Not for me Sir.

271
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,036
Give it to him.

272
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:01,581
He is so tired of beating me.
Poor guy.

273
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,917
Drink Sir.

274
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,506
Where did you hide the goods tell now...?

275
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:14,218
My boss won’t spare me if I tell you.

276
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:15,427
Boss?

277
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:16,846
Who is that?

278
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:20,016
Who else? It’s me only.

279
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:24,186
No one is born in Chittoor district,
who can tell me...

280
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:28,816
not yet.

281
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:31,861
you call yourself Boss.

282
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:33,988
And you are laughing?

283
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,197
Laughing...

284
00:25:35,406 --> 00:25:37,992
You have no respect for Police...

285
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,243
laugh...

286
00:25:39,326 --> 00:25:41,621
- Are you the boss?
- Sir!

287
00:25:43,164 --> 00:25:44,957
I know how to stop his laugh Sir.

288
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,426
What is your name boy?

289
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,972
We need to file the case, right?

290
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:03,100
Pushpa!

291
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,477
What’s your full name?

292
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,316
Pushpa...

293
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,109
Pushparaju...

294
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,570
Then what’s your Surname?

295
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,907
Surname? Don’t know?

296
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:28,500
One that is written in front of the name.
I’m asking what is it?

297
00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:30,502
Don’t know?

298
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:33,047
What are you thinking?

299
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:35,758
We all have it.

300
00:26:37,468 --> 00:26:38,552

Will you just write whatever anyone says?

Won’t you verify the details?

316
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:34,108
Just because my father visited their house
few times, will our surname become theirs?

317
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:44,243
Can’t you differentiate kids born out of wedlock
and the ones born to a mistress?

318

Molleti Pushparaju!

323
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:09,852
Just because my father slept with your mother,

324
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:12,772
you can’t inherit our surname.

325
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,945
You don’t have a surname.

326
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:22,448
Your name is just Pushparaju.

327
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,408

Pushparaju!

333
00:28:57,483 --> 00:29:00,569
What is this brother?
They have beaten you so badly

334
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:03,823
Won’t they beat if you hide the Lorry?

335
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:06,200
Am feeling hungry.
Let’s talk while eating

336
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,244
What is this? Look at all those injuries.

337
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:09,703
Hey, be quiet.

338
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,247
Go man...

339
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:13,707

Subbanna...

342
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,843
Konda Reddy brothers are three.

343
00:29:24,635 --> 00:29:26,012
Third one is Jaali Reddy

344
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,807
Unless he feels the feminine air,
he will not be able to breath.

345
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:33,227
If his eyes falls on any girl,
he make sure that se will loss her virginity.

346
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:39,191
It doesn't matter whom the girl marries,
she has to spent her first night with Jaali reddy.

347
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:39,901
Brother...

348
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:45,489
Obulu is very lucky that

350
00:29:50,244 --> 00:29:52,371
Amongst the three he's the one with brains.

351
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:56,834
He takes care of the whole business.

352
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,170
He is big support to Kondareddy.

353
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:10,973
He is Kondareddy, the eldest brother.
he is a factionist

354
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:13,767
In the riots at Siddhavatam,
he chased six of them and slayed them.

355
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:18,064
Believes in only Revenge over life
so threw a bomb at them.

356
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:21,400
After that he takes care of the
whole business with his single hand.

357
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:24,778
If the police caught us, I thought no body will come to save us.

358
00:30:25,071 --> 00:30:27,364
but now I see the owners themselves have turned up.

359
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:30,076
Now I understood what Pushpa has planned.

360
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:31,410
Hope all is well...

361
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:33,120
I am fine but...

362
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:35,581
Heard that you didn’t tell them whose goods
they are, even after police torturing you badly.

363
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:37,499
Looks like you have a lot of spunk.

364
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:39,001
Bro...

365
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:42,004
Their salary is less than 5 thousand per month.

366
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:43,965
What will I get if I tell them?

367
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:47,759
A broken beedi .. but you are different...

368
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:51,638
Are you asking money to tell where it is...
Coolie fellow...

369
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:52,556
Jaali?

370
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,392
How much do you want?

371
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,811
You can’t give me what I want.

372
00:30:59,146 --> 00:31:00,606
just, give me five lakhs

373
00:31:00,814 --> 00:31:02,066
Five lakhs!

374
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:05,319
Who will give him 5 lakhs?

375
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:08,155
If we give him some nice thrashing,
he will reveal everything...

376
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,199
What is that laugh?

377
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,368
This guy was laughing like this the whole night

378
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:16,247
40 Laathis broke, but the laugh didn’t go away...

379
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,208
finally we got fed up and stopped.

380
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:20,834
My thrashing will be different.

381
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:23,420
Jaali, first let him tell the stock whereabouts

382
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:24,713
You stay silent.

383
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:26,840
Okay!

384
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:30,511
I will pay the money you want.
Tell me where the goods are

385
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:34,848
You won’t understand if I say, let me show you...

386
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:41,438
See.. my hands are cuffed...
How can I show like this..?

387
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:44,525
He is asking us get him a bail...
Did you get it?

388
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:47,361
Looks like your brother is smarter than you...

389
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:50,697
anyways pay for what I ate and call a lawyer.

390
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:52,158
Hey Jaali

391
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:54,326
Are you telling us, just because we are not doing anything.

392
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:56,162
Do you know who are you speaking to?

393
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:57,204
Konda Reddy Brothers.

394
00:31:57,496 --> 00:31:59,206
I will kill you and burry you.

395
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:04,170
Then who will tell you where the goods are?
Konda Reddy?

396
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:16,640
What is this? Why did he bring us here?

397
00:32:16,723 --> 00:32:17,891
can see only fields around.

398
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:20,936
Rey, looks like these coolie fellows sat in a car
for the first time.. go open the door

399
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:22,896
Brother, door is struck.
It’s not opening...

400
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:24,231
What’s the hurry?

401
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:28,944
- That's how you door opens?
- This way!

402
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:43,459
Where is the lorry, Bro?
I see nothing but a well here.

403
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:10,611
What is this? Why did you destroy the Lorry
so badly, it is of no use now.

404
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,241
Bro, give us the money, our money

405
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:17,284
Hey, give them the money.

406
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:19,661
Here is 5 lakhs...

407
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,581
go and enjoy with your brother.
have fun...

408
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,210
Never seen so much money bro...

409
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:29,130
Can repay all debts and
bring the buffalo back home.

410
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,382
Whoever had said it, said it right.

411
00:33:31,382 --> 00:33:33,592
‘if I am with you, I can make 10 lakhs just like that brother.

412
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,885
Hey Where are you coming?

413
00:33:35,552 --> 00:33:39,640
I don’t have the habit of sticking to the women once I use her.

414
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:45,604
Take this hundred and come in an Auto Rickshaw

415
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,361
Come bro. We have an auto here.

416
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:55,197
Hey Driver... will you drop us at Rangampet..?

417
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:56,990
What will be the price of that vehicle?

418
00:33:57,908 --> 00:33:58,909
You mean, that Car... bro?

419
00:33:58,909 --> 00:33:59,576
Ya...

420
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:00,702
It should be around 5 lakhs bro

421
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:02,663
Does that car cost 5 lakhs!

422
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:04,706
Isn’t it too expensive.

423
00:34:04,706 --> 00:34:05,416
Yes Brother.

424
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:08,835
Go and buy that car.

425
00:34:10,003 --> 00:34:10,587
Bro...

426
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:13,048
Go and buy that car.

427
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:16,009
What are you talking bro?

428
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:20,181
We came here in a car when we didn’t have a penny on us.

429
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:22,933
Would it look good to go in an Auto
when we have so much money?

430
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:24,518
Go and get that car

431
00:34:25,186 --> 00:34:28,439
Brother, please understand. If we buy the car,
all the money will be spending on the car.

432
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:29,898
We won’t have anything left with us.

433
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:31,483
Then we will have to go and work for daily wages again.

434
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:33,026
And will we go for daily wage work in a car or what?

435
00:34:34,778 --> 00:34:38,782
Hey, I came here in car,
and I will leave only in a car from here.

436
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,160
Till then I won’t move from here.

437
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,286
Listen to me Bro...

438
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:46,540
Hey... I will not budge an inch in this matter.

439
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:54,965
Hey, who is that honking?

440
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:56,633
Do you think your mother owns this road?

441
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:58,719
Roll down the window.

442
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,262
I want to see who the hell you are...

443
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,598
It’s me. Your son from the hell...

444
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:05,892
Oh, is that you... Pushpa

445
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,312
What are those injuries on your body?

446
00:35:08,937 --> 00:35:13,484
You are seeing the small, small injuries on my body,
but can’t see the big car in front of you.

447
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:18,113
What kind of work are you doing..?
Whose car is this?

448
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:20,532
It is Parvathamma’s...

449
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:22,368
Which Parvathamma?

450
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:24,286
Pushpa’s mother.

451
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:26,079
That’s me.

452
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:28,123
Then, It’s your car.

453
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:32,127
But, I can’t understand how you bought this car.

454
00:35:32,461 --> 00:35:34,713
Seeing your difficulty in fetching water,
Brother bought this car for you.

455
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,341
- Who the hell are you?
- Keshava Aunty.

456
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:41,803
Pushpa, why did you bring me here?

457
00:35:45,474 --> 00:35:47,601
Whose car is this Maa?

458
00:35:47,768 --> 00:35:49,186
Hey wait!

459
00:35:49,186 --> 00:35:50,271
Hey wait!

460
00:35:58,445 --> 00:35:59,405
Uncle?

461
00:36:01,573 --> 00:36:04,117
Daddy.. Uncle has bought the car

462
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:10,207
The one who buys a car becomes car owner... not your uncle.

463
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:11,124
Come in

464
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:16,171
Did you see that car, Mohan?
Where did he get so much money to buy?

465
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:20,551
What else can you expect from a ragpicker?
Obviously through stealth.

466
00:36:23,136 --> 00:36:25,556
Hey looks like Mangalam Seenu Brother
has come. Go and see.

467
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:27,808
Brother, Namasthe...

468
00:36:27,891 --> 00:36:28,975
Namasthe, Namasthe

469
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:32,896
Bro, just by spending five lakhs,
I am not only got a car, am also getting respect with it.

470
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:38,109
why are you staring like that, man?
Jakkareddy bro called us. So we came in our car.

471
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:44,741
Sit Bro... Now we are qualified to sit here.

472
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:48,745
don’t want, again have to stand up
when Konda Reddy comes.

473
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,747
I can’t give so much respect to him.

474
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:55,336
True, bro.

475
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:56,337
How many loads?

476
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:57,796
Around 12 loads, Brother

477
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:04,428
How could you guys go and surrender
3 crores worth of stock to DSP Govindappa?

478
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:08,265
Don’t we have anyone who can transport
the load by hoodwinking Govindappa?

479
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:10,559
He is catching us in whichever way we go.

480
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:14,605
It is not possible to send a load when he is around.

481
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:17,983
It’s crazy why you are over-praising Govindappa here.

482
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:20,486
Like a restless lady who throws in the towel with her neighbor.

483
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:21,820
Leave it - its all beyond your ability.

484
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,238
Who the hell is he?

485
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:24,656
He is a coolie fellow.

486
00:37:25,073 --> 00:37:29,953
What the hell, Just because you came in a car
you think you earned a right to speak in this meeting.

487
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:30,746
Get out...

488
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:35,334
Brother, he is the same guy whom we got out on bail, Pushpa.

489
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:36,502
I only asked him to come along.

490
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:40,088
Are you the one who hid our load
and collected five lakhs from us?

491
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:45,176
Five lakhs are not for hiding the load Sir.
It’s for protecting you and your brothers from going to jail.

492
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,178
As if you don’t know...

493
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:50,599
it is not a big deal to get beaten by Police.

494
00:37:50,974 --> 00:37:53,977
Speak if you have guts to transport the load without getting caught.

495
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:57,398
You need an idea for transporting the load.
Not guts...

496
00:37:58,148 --> 00:38:00,526
Yes brother.
what our people are doing is...

497
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:05,447
Covering the load with Tomatoes and Watermelons.
They move the fruits, they see the load...

498
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:09,993
Forget Govindappa, Our load can be found
even by a useless Gurkha also.

499
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:14,623
We have to send the load but no one should know.
I have an idea. Should I tell?

500
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:17,709
You want to tell us how to transport the load.

501
00:38:18,043 --> 00:38:20,629
Everyone See, who has come to give us ideas.

502
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:21,588
Coolie fellow.

503
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:24,508
say what you think. Say.. say...

504
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,428
Is this a pickle to share with the entire world?

505
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:29,930
Ideas brother...
how can I say it Infront of everyone...?

506
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:34,225
How dare you?
you are asking, us only to go out.

507
00:38:34,476 --> 00:38:35,727
wait Jaali.

508
00:38:37,563 --> 00:38:43,360
Hey!..I better like what you say...
if not this kondareddy will deal with you differently.

509
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:46,029
All of you go out.

510
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:51,428
Hey stop...

511
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:54,347
check him...

512
00:39:54,347 --> 00:39:56,808
what sir.. Looks like you are suspecting me.

513
00:39:57,058 --> 00:40:00,937
After your thrashing, I have stopped all old businesses
and started milk business now.

514
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:04,650
Yes Sir, We have taken contract with Kalahasthi Khova Shop

515
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:07,068
Yes Sir, there is milk only here sir.

516
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,697
we mixed water in the milk,
now don’t tell me you are going to arrest us for that also.

517
00:40:11,197 --> 00:40:11,740
Let him go.

518
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:15,786
Give some Kalahasthi Khova to Sir.
We will go and come sir...

519
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:18,997
Where was he hiding all these days?

520
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:23,209
Give him... Give him all the load and
you be around to supervise.

521
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,048
I can do the complete the work all alone.
Just tell me what you will pay me.

522
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:29,174
your rate only Pushpa.

523
00:40:29,382 --> 00:40:31,176
We will pay you what we paid last time...
5 lakhs per load. Is it Ok?

524
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:37,390
Five lakhs is not okay.
Give me 4 percent.

525
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:39,768
4 percent would mean 4 lakhs.

526
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:41,603
You will lose one lakh.

527
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:44,981
You can keep that one lakh to yourself,
just pay my 4 percent.

528
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:50,028
What is this bro?

529
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:52,531
He was willing to pay 5 lakhs...
One lakh is our loss.

530
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:57,703
If we had taken five lakhs, we would have been their servants.

531
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:02,708
By taking 4 percent, won’t we become his partners.?

532
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:09,715
Now, Kondareddy and we are Partners...
Partner Pushpa here.

533
00:41:09,715 --> 00:41:12,133
You are very smart brother.

534
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:19,600
Hey, why is everyone looking at the sky like that?

535
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:20,726
Looking for the sparrows.

536
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:22,227
What?

537
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:23,228
For Sparrows

538
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:24,395
But... Why?

539
00:41:24,688 --> 00:41:27,608
Bro... see that girl sitting there,
wearing a red saree?

540
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:28,483
That girl...

541
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:31,194
She says she won’t sell milk unless she hears a Sparrow.

542
00:41:31,653 --> 00:41:34,114
With such a big work in hand,
what is this sparrow nonsense man?

543
00:41:34,322 --> 00:41:35,616
Who is that mad girl?

544
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:37,367
It’s my daughter.

545
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:40,370
She doesn’t listen to anyone. Even mine.

546
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:44,457
I named her after my mother,
and she is just like her in everything

547
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:49,045
Hey, Srivalli... let's fill the milk into the tank.

548
00:42:11,484 --> 00:42:15,572
You turn away both your eyes when I look at you

549
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:20,076
And cover your glances with your eyelids

550
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:25,123
You stare at even an invisible god without blinking an eye

551
00:42:25,123 --> 00:42:29,044
But you are ignoring me when i’m in front of your eyes

552
00:42:29,586 --> 00:42:36,885
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your word has become as rare as a ruby

553
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:45,811
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems

554
00:42:53,526 --> 00:42:56,655
What Sir? Why are you pawing with Lathis?
Its only milk, Sir!

555
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:58,824
What Sir? Can't we do business?

556
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:00,533
We are a reformed lot now.

557
00:43:14,715 --> 00:43:22,806
Me, who used to lead in everything
Is following you wherever you go now

558
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:31,732
Me, who never bent my head before anyone
Has bent my head to look at your anklet

559
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:36,695
After having lived such a great life,
Am now making rounds of your house

560
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:41,157
And thought it's enough
even if you look at me for an instant

561
00:43:43,576 --> 00:43:45,578
- Did She see?
- No bro...

562
00:43:46,788 --> 00:43:48,790
Did you see properly?

563
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:51,960
I have seen brother.
She didn’t even see once.

564
00:43:54,337 --> 00:43:56,089
I think you are very happy, right?

565
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:57,758
for what, bro?

566
00:43:57,799 --> 00:43:59,175
because she didn’t see.

567
00:43:59,384 --> 00:44:00,551
Why will I be happy bro?

568
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:07,517
No.. you are feeling happy, eating that peanut candy happily
and saying, she hasn’t looked even once.. I noticed it.

569
00:44:07,517 --> 00:44:09,644
No bro, I’m feeling bad inside.

570
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:14,565
ok. She didn’t see.
What would you have lost if you had said, she saw once...

571
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:16,985
at lest I would have felt happy Isn’t it..?

572
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:19,738
I didn’t get that idea bro. Sorry bro...

573
00:44:19,738 --> 00:44:22,448
You won’t get that idea.
Why will you get any idea that makes me happy?

574
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:29,790
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your word has become as rare as a ruby

575
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:38,715
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems

576
00:45:07,702 --> 00:45:15,877
All Your friends are average looking
May be... That's why you look beautiful

577
00:45:16,377 --> 00:45:24,845
And when one becomes 18
It's not just you, any girl would look cute

578
00:45:25,345 --> 00:45:29,891
When red sandal wears a saree
Even a stone would look like a princess

579
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:33,686
And, when a seven stone earring is worn
Any girl would look beautiful

580
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:34,980
Bro...

581
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,564
Now loading is done. Shall we go?

582
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,233
Shall we go?

583
00:45:38,399 --> 00:45:39,400
Yes, Bro.

584
00:45:39,692 --> 00:45:43,071
Is that all? Should we go?

585
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:46,825
What else? Loading is done.
So, Let’s go. That’s it

586
00:45:48,201 --> 00:45:50,203
Do you find all this funny?

587
00:45:50,495 --> 00:45:51,662
Why bro?

588
00:45:52,247 --> 00:45:53,664
You know it and you are still asking

589
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:55,208
I seriously don’t know brother.
I don’t know

590
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:58,962
You know I didn’t come for the load,
but came here for that girl.

591
00:45:59,129 --> 00:46:01,047
You know it and you are still saying
that we should leave.

592
00:46:01,047 --> 00:46:03,549
- Ok.. lets leave then.. come...
- brother.. brother...

593
00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:06,845
you can stay here as long as you want...
I will also stay with you.

594
00:46:06,845 --> 00:46:11,474
I will stay... I will stay and you too stay with me,
and tell me if she is looking at me.

595
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:15,270
Did she see?

596
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,021
Yes, Brother

597
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:18,439
She is looking at you only while washing the vessels.

598
00:46:18,439 --> 00:46:20,400
Is it true..?

599
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:25,864
You are lying to make me happy, isn’t it?

600
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:27,991
Yes Brother

601
00:46:29,075 --> 00:46:31,912
How can you agree so fast man?

602
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:34,664
You could have let me feel happy for
some more time...

603
00:46:34,664 --> 00:46:38,209
I think it is better I go and
beg her to look at me instead of dealing with you

604
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:41,796
Bro, don’t do that brother
I will go and beg her, to look at me

605
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:44,090
Please don’t do that brother.

606
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,134
I know, there is no use talking to you...

607
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:49,888
but for the last time,
tell me if she is looking at me or not

608
00:46:51,514 --> 00:46:52,891
I don’t know what to say brother.

609
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:54,225
I told you to tell me that she is looking at me...

610
00:46:54,267 --> 00:47:02,233
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your word has become as rare as a ruby

611
00:47:03,818 --> 00:47:11,117
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems

612
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,195

What happened sir? It’s the usual milk.
Why are you checking today sir?

614
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:07,423
What is this? I can hear milk sound on the top
and the sound of the wood below.

615
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:10,135
Are you hiding any load underneath?

616
00:48:10,969 --> 00:48:11,844

00:48:23,481 --> 00:48:24,440

622

There is one condition if I want to leave you.

623
00:48:31,197 --> 00:48:33,283
All these days you did as Pushpa said.

624
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:35,035
Now you must do as I say.

625
00:48:36,077 --> 00:48:36,827

626
00:48:39,705 --> 00:48:41,832

00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:56,264

The guy who keeps sitting at your milk center.

649
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:29,672
He sits cross legged with a dark guy next to him

650
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,092
Hey girl, his name is Keshava and it’s me

651

You said you will look at him just now.

00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:04,374
What is this smile business? I wont smile

- No... No. She will smile It’s only a smile.. right.?

665
00:50:07,377 --> 00:50:08,503
You buy tickets.

00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:09,962
Where do we met?

667
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:14,592
Ask him to come the Temple tomorrow
Smile... ask her not to forget the smile

668
00:50:16,302 --> 00:50:20,556
Bro, the priest said that the girl will look
at you if perform Abhishekam.

669
00:50:20,556 --> 00:50:21,766
That’s why I brought you

670
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:25,561
I don’t believe in all these

671
00:50:25,603 --> 00:50:29,232
Bro, look here.
Srivalli is coming. Our prayers worked

672
00:50:30,608 --> 00:50:33,861
So, what if she comes?
She doesn’t look at me. Come... Let’s go

673
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:35,530
Where do you want to go? Stay back brother.

674
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,240
Hey, getting late ask him to see her.

675
00:50:38,158 --> 00:50:40,243
He is there, look at him once.

676
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,787
She doesn’t look at me. It’s a waste
Let's go.

677
00:50:42,787 --> 00:50:44,789
(Girls whispering)
I am looking but he is not looking at me.

678
00:50:44,872 --> 00:50:46,332
Stop bro. I had paid thousand rupees

679
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:47,375
What?

680
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:50,002
To the priest. Our money will go waste...

681
00:50:50,002 --> 00:50:51,629
Look at him...

682
00:50:52,338 --> 00:50:56,842
This is the last time. If she doesn’t look at me,
I won’t look at her ever again in my life...

683
00:50:56,884 --> 00:50:59,429
Ok Bro. This is my last word. Fast & Final

684
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:06,519
Look at him... see him.

685
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:08,271
You wait!

686
00:51:12,024 --> 00:51:13,568
Srivalli is looking at me

687
00:51:14,194 --> 00:51:16,612
Smile at him

688
00:51:16,612 --> 00:51:17,613
Smile!

689
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,407
- Is she looking at you?
- yes

690
00:51:19,532 --> 00:51:21,617
Keep smiling...

691
00:51:21,742 --> 00:51:23,744
- Girl, are you smiling?
- I’m smiling.

692
00:51:24,078 --> 00:51:26,497
Hey.. She is smiling at me too

693
00:51:26,956 --> 00:51:29,209
Did she smile or not?

694
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:30,918
She is smiled at me

695
00:51:31,169 --> 00:51:32,795
That’s the power of Thousand rupees

696
00:51:33,338 --> 00:51:34,214
you also smile back...

697
00:51:35,548 --> 00:51:36,466
Yes, I too smiled

698
00:51:36,507 --> 00:51:39,969
It’s enough for these faces. Let’s go now
They paid thousand rupees only. Let’s go

699
00:51:40,636 --> 00:51:42,263
Now I understood.

700
00:51:42,888 --> 00:51:49,479
She didn’t see me when I was looking at her.
And I didn’t see her when she was looking at me.

701
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:54,108
When she caught me looking at her,
while she was looking at me.. she burst out laughing

702
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:54,817
Oh! Is it?

703
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:56,611
I know that she loves me

704
00:51:56,944 --> 00:51:58,571
That’s why I was behind her.

705
00:51:59,071 --> 00:52:00,198
Come. Let’s go and speak to her once

706
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,743
Where do you want to go? Don’t forget who you are...
You can’t bend before her

707
00:52:03,868 --> 00:52:05,703
We should take first step in these situations.

708
00:52:05,745 --> 00:52:07,538
Don’t go brother You don’t know.

709
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:08,998
You wait, man.

710
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:11,917
Hey Srivalli... Srivalli.

711
00:52:13,753 --> 00:52:15,380
Why were you smiling at me?

712
00:52:16,714 --> 00:52:18,341
do you like me?

713
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:21,469
When did I like you?

714
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:23,346
Then why were you smiling at me?

715
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:25,181
Wont I smile when I am paid...

716
00:52:25,723 --> 00:52:26,891
- Money?
- Yes

717
00:52:26,932 --> 00:52:27,808
What money?

718
00:52:28,017 --> 00:52:30,936
It seems you were feeling sad, because I was not looking at you

719
00:52:31,604 --> 00:52:32,897
was I feeling Sad?

720
00:52:32,938 --> 00:52:36,442
Yes, that’s why your friend Keshava gave me
the money to smile.. so I did...

721
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,487
Did you smile for that?

722
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:43,408
Whatever it is, We got to see Chiranjeevi movie.

723
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:45,785
It was very nice.

724
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:49,789
After having soft drinks and Samosa
we are still left with two hundred rupees.

725
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:54,294
Let me know where you would tomorrow.
I will come and smile at you for that...

726
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:57,380
Is this what thousand rupees prayer means?

727
00:52:57,505 --> 00:53:00,174
Tell me where I can find you tomorrow...

728
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:02,593
All my pride and ego has gone to dust...

729
00:53:03,135 --> 00:53:06,180
Hey Keshava. You have destroyed me.

730
00:53:06,347 --> 00:53:07,973
Hey Keshava. Where are you?

731
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:12,812
Oh no! he's coming...
I did all this for your happiness

732
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:15,189
Isn’t it disgusting to ask that girl to smile at me
by paying her for money?

733
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:20,069
You ruined all the feeling of happiness,
that a girl loved me...

734
00:53:20,278 --> 00:53:23,323
How can we stoop so low, to pay a girl and ask her to smile at me...

735
00:53:23,531 --> 00:53:26,075
Am I like that? Am I like that Jaali Reddy?

736
00:53:26,075 --> 00:53:26,867
No.. no.

737
00:53:28,453 --> 00:53:33,416
You have totally damaged my dignity.
Anyways, How much did you pay?

738
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:38,170
Thousand
Thousand... for a smile.

739
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:46,178
Ok. Anyways since I have already become bad...
I will pay five thousand ask her to give me a kiss me

740
00:53:46,262 --> 00:53:49,599
- What are you saying bro?
- I will pay her five thousand. Ask her if she will kiss me

741
00:53:49,974 --> 00:53:51,225
I never thought you can behave like this bro

742
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:54,061
I’m not like this bro. I’m a very good person

743
00:53:54,103 --> 00:53:57,189
but you have started this
and now you should take this to the end...

744
00:53:57,273 --> 00:53:58,107
what do you mean by end?

745
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:00,860
I don't know what is the end?
Till end. That’s all

746
00:54:01,277 --> 00:54:02,027
Bro...

747
00:54:02,194 --> 00:54:04,697
Go and do 5000 rupees worship.

748
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:11,245
ONE thousand tonnes of Syndicate goods!

749
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:19,879
Approximately two hundred crores!
and halting here instead of enroute Chennai...

750
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:26,886
That Mangalam Seenu, rotating syndicate goods
That's why we are not able to track the locations.

751
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,308
It is possible that the goods will be coming to Kondareddy godowns.

752
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:46,531
If you tip us off the moment he lands new stuff,
do you know the reward?

753
00:54:47,072 --> 00:54:48,324
Fifty Lakh Rupees.

754
00:54:54,664 --> 00:54:57,667
- How are you Draccha?
- I’m good Uncle

755
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:01,837
Srinu? What brings you here?

756
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,133
Excellent location Konda Reddy.

757
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:10,262
Godown is also nice.
Even Draccha liked it.

758
00:55:12,432 --> 00:55:13,516
He is Mangalam Seenu.

759
00:55:14,141 --> 00:55:16,310
The boss of the smuggling syndicate!

760
00:55:16,894 --> 00:55:19,772
There may be the likes of Kondareddy snoring
at corners to sweat small stuff...

761
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:25,945
he is the only one man who can navigate
the goods all through the 15 checkpoints to the Chennai Port.

762
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:29,281
That’s why he is the one who calls the shots.

763
00:55:29,615 --> 00:55:32,993
Nobody can go against him and get away with it.

764
00:55:33,578 --> 00:55:36,246
I see that you are shifting all the load into my godown.
What is the issue?

765
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:39,584
- You know Gowrreddy right...
- Who? Our Gowrreddy??

766
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:46,173
I dismissed him from job as
he was messing up the with goods.

767
00:55:46,256 --> 00:55:49,176
How could you do that man?
What if he informs the police?

768
00:55:49,385 --> 00:55:51,846
He knows addresses of all your godowns very well.

769
00:55:52,096 --> 00:55:57,309
That’s why I brought all the stock to your godown kondareddy.

770
00:55:57,477 --> 00:56:01,355
We still have some time to take it to Chennai.
Please safeguard the stocks. I hope it’s safe

771
00:56:01,856 --> 00:56:08,613
What are you talking dear? Did we bring the
stock directly here without trusting Kondareddy uncle?

772
00:56:08,613 --> 00:56:10,448
But the problem is that stock is safeguarded by that Jaali Reddy.

773
00:56:10,823 --> 00:56:13,868
And you know that womanizer Jaali reddy is
surrounded always by girls.

774
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:17,497
If we trust and leave our stock with here,
it is like digging our own graves.

775
00:56:17,747 --> 00:56:24,378
You said it right. If Govindappa comes behind a girl,
the entire stock will go for a toss.

776
00:56:24,545 --> 00:56:27,757
Syndicate has trusted me and kept the stock with me

777
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:28,883
You said it right dear...

778
00:56:28,924 --> 00:56:34,138
No need to worry. Now we have a sharp guy called Pushpa.
He is taking care of everything.

779
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:38,809
After he came, Police are not able to catch even
a stem, forget a log.. there he comes.. see

780
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:42,688
You are saying he is new. Can we trust him?

781
00:57:22,645 --> 00:57:25,898
I will tell in detail about him some other time Seenu

782
00:57:28,317 --> 00:57:30,235
He doesn’t look like the one to be discussed another time.

783
00:57:32,196 --> 00:57:34,114
Anyways, I have to go for a wedding.
I take your leave

784
00:57:34,156 --> 00:57:37,660
Pushpa, Srinanna’s stock will be with us
for two days. Take care of it...

785
00:57:37,868 --> 00:57:40,120
Sure, Brother
Brother, we are getting late. Come fast...

786
00:57:40,162 --> 00:57:44,709
What did you do with Gowrreddy?
Are you ignoring him or what?

787
00:57:46,043 --> 00:57:50,047
Don’t look at sky always uncle, look at the earth also sometimes.

788
00:57:50,214 --> 00:57:53,593
We get trees from the there only...
wont you put manure to it...

789
00:58:00,558 --> 00:58:02,768
Brother, Look there once.

790
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,540
No...

791
00:58:25,499 --> 00:58:30,838
He is like my younger brother.
I can’t see him die.

792
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:46,478
Why does this Mogalesh do incomplete work always?
Get me the gun...

793
00:58:48,272 --> 00:58:49,398
Give me.

794
00:58:57,823 --> 00:59:01,035
Why do we need this garbage in our backyard?
Throw it in the forest

795
00:59:01,035 --> 00:59:02,703
Okay Brother
Go and do that work.

796
00:59:13,422 --> 00:59:14,006
Bro...

797
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:16,759
- What is this?
- Cardamom bro.. for a good smell

798
00:59:17,217 --> 00:59:19,178
I have.

799
00:59:19,386 --> 00:59:22,682
Why delay? Where are the girls?

800
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:24,224
They are coming brother.

801
00:59:30,189 --> 00:59:32,608
They are waiting... Go

802
00:59:32,608 --> 00:59:35,152
Go... go.
Go and kiss him.

803
00:59:35,152 --> 00:59:37,655
I’m scared dear. What if he bites me?

804
00:59:37,655 --> 00:59:40,658
Why are you scared? He looks so handsome.

805
00:59:40,658 --> 00:59:42,827
What is that meeting they are having there?

806
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:44,536
I don’t know brother

807
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,749
Why delay girl? He is waiting since morning.
Send her fast

808
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:52,461
What is your problem to give a small kiss?

809
00:59:52,461 --> 00:59:54,839
If you can’t.. I will go and give him. Tell me

810
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:57,591
You wait, As If we can’t do that.

811
00:59:57,591 --> 01:00:00,385
Bro Should I come and give you the kiss?

812
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:05,015
Who is that? Calling me brother and offering me a kiss.

813
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:06,976
Where did you find them?

814
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:09,519
Stop those discussions and send her fast

815
01:00:09,937 --> 01:00:12,022
I am feeling scared
Shut up and come.

816
01:00:12,732 --> 01:00:15,192
She is coming bro.. she is Coming

817
01:00:15,901 --> 01:00:19,029
He is asking for a small kiss.
Go and give him a kiss, go...

818
01:00:23,951 --> 01:00:25,577
Keshava, close the door

819
01:00:25,745 --> 01:00:27,371
No, keep it open

820
01:00:28,205 --> 01:00:30,666
What are you doing here dirty fellow?

821
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:34,754
I’m noticing you since long.
Why are you shouting? Stop those antics...

822
01:00:34,754 --> 01:00:36,005
I will slap you hard idiot

823
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:39,717
Do it fast Pushpa and let’s go. Girls, turn away.

824
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,220
- Okay dear, as you wish!
- No touching!

825
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:45,514
What is this?

826
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,226
What you are chewing?

827
01:00:51,103 --> 01:00:52,897
Cardamom...
do you want?

828
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,357
Not there. I will kiss you here

829
01:00:55,775 --> 01:00:56,942
- Here?
- Yes

830
01:00:57,026 --> 01:00:59,945
Why should we pay so much for a kiss here?
Hey Keshava

831
01:01:00,029 --> 01:01:02,114
Ok ok. Don’t make it an issue...

832
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:04,784
Okay.

833
01:01:06,702 --> 01:01:07,452
Ok give me...

834
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:09,079
Talk something.

835
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:14,126
What is there to talk? You took money to kiss me.
Right.. so kiss me...

836
01:01:26,388 --> 01:01:28,265
Why are you crying girl? why?

837
01:01:28,265 --> 01:01:34,855
I thought it is easy when my friends told me.
But my heart isn’t agreeing.

838
01:01:35,272 --> 01:01:38,567
First kiss...

839
01:01:38,776 --> 01:01:43,739
How will I understand if you murmur? Say it clearly

840
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:47,409
I always wanted to give first kiss to my husband...

841
01:01:47,492 --> 01:01:48,493
To your husband?

842
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,456
If you wanted it to give to someone else,
why did you take money from me?

843
01:01:53,082 --> 01:01:55,334
And why are you crying now?

844
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,169
Stop crying... Stop it

845
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,546
why are you crying now?

846
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:01,173
What happened dear? My god

847
01:02:01,256 --> 01:02:02,091
What did you do brother?

848
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:06,053
I didn’t do anything brother. I didn’t even touch her
What did you do? Why is the poor girl crying so much?

849
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:09,765
Ask Srivalli.
Hey Srivalli. Did I do anything to you?

850
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:12,017
We trusted and sent our friend and is that what you do to her?

851
01:02:12,101 --> 01:02:13,227
Stop your nuisance for a minute

852
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:14,728
I didn’t do anything brother.

853
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,939
You all go away... In hurry he would have bite her.

854
01:02:16,981 --> 01:02:19,149
(Indistinct Voices)

855
01:02:20,776 --> 01:02:21,944
What happened, bro?

856
01:02:21,986 --> 01:02:23,779
She is making ruckus here.

857
01:02:24,446 --> 01:02:27,032
Leave it bro. She said she will kiss her husband only right

858
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:30,035
It’s my kiss man. I paid for it.

859
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,289
If I have to marry her and become her husband, I will.
I should only get that kiss...

860
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:36,708
I won’t compromise on this

861
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:48,345
Hey what is this? The entire stock is still here.

862
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:51,223
Didn’t I tell you that we must cross
the check post with this by the night?

863
01:02:51,265 --> 01:02:53,517
Jalanna was partying the whole night.

864
01:02:53,642 --> 01:02:57,897
He has stopped the lorries as they might disturb the party.

865
01:02:58,022 --> 01:03:01,733
Have your brains gone dead?
Who is Jaali to stop the stock?

866
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:03,152
Don't know, Brother.

867
01:03:03,527 --> 01:03:06,906
Police are observing us like Jackals for this
address since night,

868
01:03:06,906 --> 01:03:08,240
and you know how risky it is...

869
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:11,660
Where are the keys?

870
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:14,163
That is Jalanna’s room.
He will kill if we give you the keys

871
01:03:14,246 --> 01:03:15,664
What will he do?

872
01:03:17,624 --> 01:03:19,084
Pushpa, What are you doing?

873
01:03:36,643 --> 01:03:38,103
Don't scare, come sister...

874
01:03:38,187 --> 01:03:39,271
Hey Keshav,

875
01:03:40,397 --> 01:03:43,525
please ask our guys to drop her in the village safely.

876
01:03:43,525 --> 01:03:44,276
Okay.

877
01:03:44,276 --> 01:03:45,110
Go...

878
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:49,031
Selva, take her and leave her in the village.

879
01:03:49,073 --> 01:03:50,157
I will be here.

880
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:50,866
Okay.

881
01:03:50,866 --> 01:03:51,658
- You go.
- Come...

882
01:03:51,783 --> 01:03:53,160
Hey, do it fast.

883
01:03:53,202 --> 01:03:55,162
Pushpa has sent the girl home

884
01:03:55,329 --> 01:03:57,873
We are loading all the stock in the lorries.

885
01:03:57,915 --> 01:03:59,666
Why did you send the girl?

886
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:02,377
First tell me why you didn’t you send the stock.

887
01:04:02,377 --> 01:04:05,005
Have you converted the godown into your guest house?

888
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:09,218
Who are you to ask me? This is my godown
you are just a coolie fellow.

889
01:04:09,218 --> 01:04:12,012
How dare you call me coolie?

890
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:16,558
This is Pushpa.
Partner Pushpa. 4 Percent share.

891
01:04:16,934 --> 01:04:17,935
Give it now

892
01:04:18,143 --> 01:04:19,228
Speak to him brother

893
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:21,897
Pushpa, Kondareddy brother wants to speak to you

894
01:04:24,233 --> 01:04:26,986
Don’t you use what you have above neck
instead of what you have below the waist?

895
01:04:28,153 --> 01:04:29,779
Bro, please tell

896
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,783
Police have come to know our godown address

897
01:04:35,577 --> 01:04:37,204
What are you saying brother?

898
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:43,668
Hope all the stock is cleared from the godown

899
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,589
No brother. Your brother Jaali has
stopped all lorries from entering the godown

900
01:04:48,548 --> 01:04:53,595
My god! Thousand tons stock. It is worth 200 crores.
We will be done forever if we are caught.

901
01:04:56,181 --> 01:04:58,225
Mangalam Srinu has trusted us and handed over the stock.

902
01:05:01,395 --> 01:05:02,604
Do something...

903
01:05:02,646 --> 01:05:04,648
You have trusted me and handed over to me...

904
01:05:04,648 --> 01:05:07,026
consider Pushpa is dead, if even one log is caught.

905
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:11,113
How scared he is, the slave!

906
01:05:11,113 --> 01:05:14,950
Jalareddy, you’ll get it now!
Pushpa doesn’t budge an inch, always gives it back!

907
01:05:18,703 --> 01:05:21,081
How do we tackle this?

908
01:05:40,392 --> 01:05:41,435
Okay bro.

909
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:43,478
Rey... Pick the stock and throw it in the stream.

910
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:49,234
What are you looking at? Police are coming.
Get up and move

911
01:07:06,395 --> 01:07:08,980
Brother, listen to me once.

912
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:10,482
Entire stock is being thrown into water here.

913
01:07:10,482 --> 01:07:12,234
That's all Mangalam Srinu's Stock.

914
01:07:12,859 --> 01:07:16,696
We can put it on Pushpa if Govindappa catches it.

915
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,241
Not good for you to be there now.
Leave from there immediately

916
01:09:17,442 --> 01:09:20,111
Pushpa is caught now.
Srinu will not leave him.

917
01:09:20,153 --> 01:09:21,280
I am sure his time is over now...

918
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,251
Police are here.

919
01:09:34,626 --> 01:09:37,254
Brother... Log

920
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,419
Come fast.

921
01:10:29,222 --> 01:10:30,307
Quickly.

922
01:10:47,282 --> 01:10:48,533
Come on, quick rotate...

923
01:11:00,754 --> 01:11:05,675
Sir, They have put towers in the forest too.
They would have known the information by now

924
01:11:08,428 --> 01:11:12,516
- Rey... Is stock there?
- Sir, nothing is there here. Total license wood

925
01:11:12,599 --> 01:11:15,852
If Pushpa is there stock will not be there.
If stock is there Pushpa won’t be there.

926
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:19,648
If you want to see both together,
none of you will be there.

927
01:11:20,815 --> 01:11:24,277
- We should all be thankful to Govindappa Sir!
- Yes Bro.

928
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:27,113
Our range has grown because of this sir only...

929
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:30,992
If he had caught the stock that day,
I wouldn’t have become a partner today...

930
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,995
Don’t say like that brother? Sir may get angry

931
01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:36,956
What sir? Are you getting angry??

932
01:11:37,999 --> 01:11:41,503
Alas... I don’t even have shirt for you to hold my collar.

933
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:46,257
I have given it to a girl just now.
Not just you sir, we also do good deeds

934
01:11:46,299 --> 01:11:49,428
Rey... You are not understanding what you are doing...

935
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:52,639
You are more cruel than animals... Yak

936
01:11:53,097 --> 01:11:55,350
What is crueler than this world sir?

937
01:11:56,309 --> 01:12:00,021
This world has given a gun to your hand
and an axe to my hand.

938
01:12:00,564 --> 01:12:02,190
Everyone has his own war to fight.

939
01:12:04,568 --> 01:12:08,237
I have won this war also sir

940
01:12:09,155 --> 01:12:11,115
I will take care of whatever comes.

941
01:12:17,622 --> 01:12:20,417
Yes, You have won.

942
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:24,128
But do you know what kind of war you are fighting?

943
01:12:25,547 --> 01:12:30,510
You will lose as much as you are winning today.
You will know as you age...

944
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:41,438
Losers will always talk about principles.

945
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:43,690
When does the party start?

946
01:12:46,735 --> 01:12:50,363
Heard about Mangalam Srinu party,
but first time I am seeing it.

947
01:12:50,697 --> 01:12:54,659
Not only smugglers but police,
politicians all have come to party.

948
01:12:54,784 --> 01:12:58,497
When one saw so much money
Pushpa has become hero instantly.

949
01:12:58,538 --> 01:13:02,041
Mangalam Srinu himself personally introduced him to MP

950
01:13:06,004 --> 01:13:09,508
They kill me with their looks if I wear a saree

951
01:13:09,758 --> 01:13:13,386
They scan me with their eyes if I wear a skirt

952
01:13:13,512 --> 01:13:17,181
Forget saree and gown, let me divulge a secret

953
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:21,019
What is there in the dress when It’s your hold that matters

954
01:13:21,019 --> 01:13:24,606
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

955
01:13:28,568 --> 01:13:32,155
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

956
01:13:36,034 --> 01:13:39,579
One becomes upside down if I’m fair

957
01:13:39,788 --> 01:13:43,374
One creates uproar if I’m dark

958
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:47,170
Forget fair and dark, let me reveal the true color

959
01:13:47,295 --> 01:13:50,965
Color and figure won’t matter once you enter the field

960
01:13:51,007 --> 01:13:54,594
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

961
01:13:58,515 --> 01:14:02,101
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

962
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:24,457
One jumps with joy If I’m tall

963
01:14:24,916 --> 01:14:28,294
One shouts and wails if I’m short

964
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:32,131
Forget tall and short, let me tell you a truth

965
01:14:32,173 --> 01:14:36,094
You will be satiated with what you get

966
01:14:36,219 --> 01:14:39,806
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

967
01:14:43,518 --> 01:14:47,105
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

968
01:14:51,067 --> 01:14:54,529
One feels happy If I'm stout

969
01:14:54,696 --> 01:14:58,282
One feel bliss If I'm slender

970
01:14:58,449 --> 01:15:02,203
Forget stout and slender

971
01:15:02,203 --> 01:15:05,999
It is the man's wicked nature who caught me alone.

972
01:15:06,124 --> 01:15:09,711
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

973
01:15:13,632 --> 01:15:17,218
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

974
01:15:43,662 --> 01:15:47,248
One person poses like a respected man...

975
01:15:47,248 --> 01:15:51,085
I have a very good heart says one person

976
01:15:51,335 --> 01:15:55,048
There is no good or bad, everyone belongs to the same race

977
01:15:55,048 --> 01:15:57,466
when the lights are off...

978
01:16:02,388 --> 01:16:06,142
when the lights are off...

979
01:16:06,184 --> 01:16:09,771
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say Yes

980
01:16:13,608 --> 01:16:17,195
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

981
01:16:28,581 --> 01:16:32,711
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

982
01:16:35,088 --> 01:16:38,591
Mangalam Sreenu has arranged a super party

983
01:16:39,383 --> 01:16:43,137
He will get 2 crores from us and give only 25 lakhs to them

984
01:16:43,429 --> 01:16:46,057
Then, not only party, he can do anything.

985
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,309
Figure, liquor...

986
01:16:55,316 --> 01:16:59,779
- Brother, I want to speak to you urgently.
- What is that?

987
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:09,789
That Mangalam srinu is cheating us bro.
Mangalam srinu is fooling us.

988
01:17:10,123 --> 01:17:13,752
How much does he give us per ton?
Twenty-five lakhs right.

989
01:17:14,085 --> 01:17:16,545
He is selling for Two crores outside...

990
01:17:18,256 --> 01:17:19,883
How do you know?

991
01:17:20,842 --> 01:17:26,139
I have heard from the Murugan's people
when they were talking to each other

992
01:17:28,057 --> 01:17:31,185
Of late I was also getting doubt on him...

993
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:36,107
He is buying lands in lot of places.
What do you say now?

994
01:17:36,357 --> 01:17:38,777
Nothing to say. Let’s go and ask

995
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:40,904
We are loosing so much bro.

996
01:17:40,904 --> 01:17:44,448
We are all working hard and he is sitting and
enjoying all the fruits. Ask him Brother

997
01:17:44,448 --> 01:17:47,118
What? you want to go and ask Mangalam Srinu, is it?

998
01:17:47,118 --> 01:17:49,537
Yes Do you know what he is?

999
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:51,247
Hey Stop... You stop.

1000
01:17:51,956 --> 01:17:58,171
You can go and ask but there are lot of other things
between me and Srinu.

1001
01:17:58,587 --> 01:18:01,299
We will get into trouble if anything goes wrong.

1002
01:18:02,175 --> 01:18:03,885
- What is this?
- Dry mutton curry.

1003
01:18:03,885 --> 01:18:04,844
Go and get snacks.

1004
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:07,764
Do one thing man.

1005
01:18:08,514 --> 01:18:12,643
You go and ask him that people are talking like this outside.

1006
01:18:12,769 --> 01:18:14,312
You are also partner right.

1007
01:18:15,146 --> 01:18:18,482
If he agrees 50% share...

1008
01:18:19,275 --> 01:18:23,029
else, you didn’t ask me anything.
There is no relationship between us.

1009
01:18:24,155 --> 01:18:25,156
What do you say?

1010
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:27,867
No Brother.

1011
01:18:28,659 --> 01:18:32,163
If anyone has to ask him, it is you brother.
It won’t look good if I ask

1012
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:33,581
That’s why...

1013
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:37,794
Hey Muniratnam did you see Pushpa’s range.

1014
01:18:38,127 --> 01:18:40,379
He is having lunch with Kondareddy...
and he also doing business with him

1015
01:18:40,421 --> 01:18:41,380
You said it right.

1016
01:18:41,505 --> 01:18:43,674
He used to come to work for
a wage of hundred, hundred and fifty.

1017
01:18:43,674 --> 01:18:45,301
Now he has become very big

1018
01:18:45,593 --> 01:18:49,555
Where will you get a better match
for your daughter than him.

1019
01:18:49,555 --> 01:18:50,765
Why don’t you get her married to our guy?

1020
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:54,602
How did you say such a big thing
so easily in a serious discussion?

1021
01:18:55,228 --> 01:18:57,605
How can I give my daughter
without knowing his caste and gotra?

1022
01:18:57,856 --> 01:18:59,398
Hello... Do you know who he is?

1023
01:18:59,398 --> 01:19:01,275
He is younger son of Molleti Venkata Ramana

1024
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,736
Is that so? Then he is our own.

1025
01:19:04,237 --> 01:19:05,279
Good match

1026
01:19:08,532 --> 01:19:10,076
Munirathnam, The groom family is here.

1027
01:19:10,326 --> 01:19:11,077
Please come in.

1028
01:19:11,202 --> 01:19:12,829
Namaste!

1029
01:19:12,829 --> 01:19:14,789
See, How Muniratnam face is glowing

1030
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:18,584
Our lives are such that we feel happy
if Molleti Venkataramana says hi to us.

1031
01:19:18,793 --> 01:19:22,130
A match with such family means...
Its all god grace

1032
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:22,755
Here!

1033
01:19:24,841 --> 01:19:26,384
What are you looking at?
Move...

1034
01:19:26,384 --> 01:19:26,968
come in please.

1035
01:19:26,968 --> 01:19:28,636
Sit... please sit down.

1036
01:19:28,761 --> 01:19:30,221
Hey, you go.

1037
01:19:30,221 --> 01:19:32,098
What did you guys tell him?
He is talking strangely

1038
01:19:32,098 --> 01:19:33,474
What did you say?

1039
01:19:33,682 --> 01:19:36,602
That’s what Bro. I told him that you are
third son of Molleti Venkataramana.

1040
01:19:36,602 --> 01:19:37,979
Did you say like that?

1041
01:19:38,312 --> 01:19:40,689
I’m somehow getting scared

1042
01:19:40,689 --> 01:19:43,234
What’s wrong? Did he not tell what the truth is..?

1043
01:19:43,234 --> 01:19:44,777
Not like that my son
Be silent Mom.

1044
01:19:49,657 --> 01:19:51,367
Bro. Srivalli is coming.

1045
01:19:52,451 --> 01:19:53,786
Bring the girl.

1046
01:19:54,412 --> 01:19:55,496
(Chants)

1047
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:20,729
The girl is looking beautiful.

1048
01:20:20,813 --> 01:20:21,940
Girl, I had told you earlier only.
It was just a small kiss.

1049
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,441
You should have given it to him.
See it has come up to marriage.

1050
01:20:24,025 --> 01:20:27,361
Now you have to keep kissing him for life.
That too for free.

1051
01:20:32,616 --> 01:20:34,618
This is all because of that Keshava

1052
01:20:35,744 --> 01:20:37,080
I'll hit you...!

1053
01:20:38,706 --> 01:20:43,752
Pushparaj, the youngest son of
Rangampet resident Molleti Venkata Ramana

1054
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:45,546
and the resident of Yarravaripalem village...

1055
01:20:45,546 --> 01:20:47,882
We have seen the people
who sell fruits in the name of the tree.

1056
01:20:48,799 --> 01:20:53,554
We came here knowing that someone is selling fruits
without even know which tree has given those fruits

1057
01:20:56,182 --> 01:20:57,766
They are Venkataramana’s sons.

1058
01:20:58,767 --> 01:20:59,810
Greetings Sir.

1059
01:21:00,228 --> 01:21:03,272
It is said that relationship means it has
to have 7 generations both sides

1060
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:05,441
Why is it that you are not looking
at even to one generation?

1061
01:21:06,067 --> 01:21:08,569
Do you know to whom you are giving
your daughter for marriage?

1062
01:21:09,028 --> 01:21:10,154
What are saying sir?

1063
01:21:10,404 --> 01:21:12,490
He said he is third son of Molleti Venkata Ramana.

1064
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:14,117
Isn’t he your younger brother?

1065
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,327
Will someone become king just because
he has Raju in his name?

1066
01:21:16,327 --> 01:21:18,287
and my brother if he takes my father’s name?

1067
01:21:18,412 --> 01:21:20,331
He is anyways shameless to say it.

1068
01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:23,292
She is a lady shouldn’t she have any shame?

1069
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:27,671
Son, you sit quietly.
Swear on me that you won’t get up

1070
01:21:33,427 --> 01:21:39,100
Have you seen what is in that?
Did you see any surname?

1071
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:42,770
No Sir, its only written as Pushpa raju

1072
01:21:42,811 --> 01:21:44,022
That’s the story.

1073
01:21:44,355 --> 01:21:48,734
He is surviving by using our surname

1074
01:21:50,403 --> 01:21:52,821
So what if he doesn’t have surname,
what is it that Pushpa doesn’t have..?

1075
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:56,492
He has a house and earns handful.
Isn’t it enough to take care of your girl?

1076
01:21:56,742 --> 01:21:57,618
What do you say Muniratnam?

1077
01:21:57,618 --> 01:21:58,661
You said it rightly

1078
01:21:58,661 --> 01:21:59,495
what will he take care?

1079
01:21:59,495 --> 01:22:01,664
Do you think wedding is just exchanging vows?

1080
01:22:01,956 --> 01:22:04,292
We get a girl married to change her surname.

1081
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,170
I won’t send her to such house.

1082
01:22:07,378 --> 01:22:08,171
Get up dear.

1083
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:10,464
You wait... listen to me.

1084
01:22:10,464 --> 01:22:11,966
You sit my dear. Sit.

1085
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:17,346
Hey Son, you both are brothers and you share the same blood...

1086
01:22:17,596 --> 01:22:21,934
when such good occasions are happening,
one should overlook and move on.

1087
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:23,894
I agree with you

1088
01:22:24,187 --> 01:22:26,814
I agree that my father had an affair with his mother.

1089
01:22:26,814 --> 01:22:30,068
But what is the guarantee that he is born to my father?

1090
01:22:35,864 --> 01:22:37,575
My father didn’t tell me.

1091
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:40,411
What man?

1092
01:22:40,494 --> 01:22:42,830
Did your mother at least tell you to
whom you are born? What?

1093
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:44,290
How dare you?

1094
01:22:48,669 --> 01:22:51,589
(Commotion)

1095
01:22:53,966 --> 01:22:56,885
(Commotion)

1096
01:22:59,097 --> 01:22:59,847
- Pushpa!
- Bro, Mother...

1097
01:23:00,306 --> 01:23:01,474
Bro, Mother...

1098
01:23:09,898 --> 01:23:10,816
Mom!

1099
01:23:13,152 --> 01:23:14,070
Mom!

1100
01:23:17,031 --> 01:23:17,948
Mom!

1101
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:20,493
Keshava, get the vehicle.

1102
01:23:44,683 --> 01:23:45,726
Throw her out!

1103
01:23:46,352 --> 01:23:48,979
Please leave me... Please

1104
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:53,025
I plead you...

1105
01:23:53,151 --> 01:23:54,443
Leave me alone.

1106
01:23:55,819 --> 01:23:56,612
Mom!

1107
01:24:06,914 --> 01:24:09,917
Please... let me see his face once.

1108
01:24:21,637 --> 01:24:22,971
Father!

1109
01:25:25,784 --> 01:25:32,791
When your father asked me whether I want love
or respect, then I thought love was enough.

1110
01:25:34,084 --> 01:25:36,795
I thought his respect is mine too.

1111
01:25:38,589 --> 01:25:43,677
But I never thought you will face
so many insults because of this.

1112
01:25:47,265 --> 01:25:55,564
Had I known it, I would have taken
some poison when you were in my womb.

1113
01:25:58,276 --> 01:25:59,109
Mom!

1114
01:26:00,152 --> 01:26:01,945
Please forgive me, my son.

1115
01:26:02,154 --> 01:26:05,199
What is this maa? What are you talking?
What happened now?

1116
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:08,869
You have injuries on your head
that’s why you are talking like this.. Sleep now.

1117
01:26:09,161 --> 01:26:10,996
Grandma... Please maker her sleep.

1118
01:26:11,205 --> 01:26:14,708
Don’t cry my dear.
Drink some porridge.

1119
01:26:15,293 --> 01:26:16,377
Mom...

1120
01:26:24,593 --> 01:26:27,430
- Get some tea. Do you have money?
- I have bro.

1121
01:26:29,139 --> 01:26:30,391
Bro...

1122
01:26:35,271 --> 01:26:39,817
I was just five-year-old then.

1123
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:43,737
I didn’t even know how to fight.

1124
01:26:46,532 --> 01:26:50,703
These guys have created all kinds of troubles
and took away whatever we had.

1125
01:27:05,509 --> 01:27:10,180
My father had given me a gold chain for my birthday.

1126
01:27:11,307 --> 01:27:15,227
In that chain there used to be photo of me and my father.

1127
01:27:16,061 --> 01:27:20,107
That was the only thing I had as a memory in those things.

1128
01:27:22,067 --> 01:27:24,820
They took away that as well.

1129
01:27:36,499 --> 01:27:41,211
I won’t keep silent if they try to take away what I have to get.

1130
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,008
Whether it is 10 paise or 10 rupees.

1131
01:27:47,009 --> 01:27:48,302
I won’t spare anyone.

1132
01:27:49,052 --> 01:27:52,848
I won’t spare anyone, even if its Srinivasa on
the hill or Mangalam Srinu down the hill.

1133
01:27:53,223 --> 01:27:55,768
I will collect everything with interest.

1134
01:27:58,354 --> 01:27:59,563
This is Pushpa

1135
01:28:00,063 --> 01:28:01,231
Pushparaj here.

1136
01:28:01,857 --> 01:28:03,942
I won’t compromise.

1137
01:28:06,654 --> 01:28:08,155
Beat him here... not there

1138
01:28:08,155 --> 01:28:09,323
I have already beaten him there bro.

1139
01:28:09,323 --> 01:28:10,908
Beat him on his knee?

1140
01:28:10,908 --> 01:28:11,950
On his knee’s bro?

1141
01:28:13,076 --> 01:28:16,747
That hand... Mouth...
Beat him on the mouth.

1142
01:28:16,747 --> 01:28:17,915
Idiot shouldn’t open his mouth again.

1143
01:28:17,915 --> 01:28:19,917
Bro... He is scared

1144
01:28:19,917 --> 01:28:21,168
That’s why I asked you to beat.

1145
01:28:21,585 --> 01:28:27,425
How dare he comes directly to me
and ask me to increase the rate?

1146
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:39,019
It seems, Twenty-five is not enough for him...
he wants fifty lakhs per ton.

1147
01:28:39,353 --> 01:28:41,439
Fifty... Do you want Fifty lakhs?

1148
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:44,900
If I don’t give, you want to deal
with Chennai Murugan directly?

1149
01:28:45,734 --> 01:28:50,072
Why can’t you beat him yourself?
You are sitting happily and ordering him?

1150
01:28:50,448 --> 01:28:53,951
Bro... Stop now.
Drink this and take a breath.

1151
01:28:54,493 --> 01:28:56,286
Haven’t you got tired beating him since morning?

1152
01:28:56,704 --> 01:28:58,831
Unnecessary fuss all the time

1153
01:28:59,122 --> 01:29:01,083
She talks like that only.
You carry on...

1154
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,918
Hello MP Sir.

1155
01:29:03,335 --> 01:29:05,170
Come Pushpa. Sit.

1156
01:29:05,463 --> 01:29:06,464
Yes. Tell me MP Sir

1157
01:29:06,464 --> 01:29:09,216
Hey Srinu. Heard that you kidnapped Nagesh.

1158
01:29:09,425 --> 01:29:12,470
His brother came and is regretting
for the mistake that happened.

1159
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:13,971
Leave him for this time.

1160
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:15,639
I will speak to you

1161
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:18,100
So sad... I just killed him MP Sir.

1162
01:29:18,684 --> 01:29:19,477
Brother...

1163
01:29:20,478 --> 01:29:22,438
You should have called me five minutes ago.

1164
01:29:23,313 --> 01:29:27,317
I’m just washing the knife after cutting his neck
and your call came...

1165
01:29:27,317 --> 01:29:29,945
I had called your PA also in the morning Sir.
He also didn’t say anything.

1166
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:33,491
Hello MP Sir, please tell me in advance
if there is something like this next time.

1167
01:29:33,699 --> 01:29:35,033
It’s a matter of a person’s life. Isn’t it?

1168
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,369
I don’t want any differences
between you and me unnecessarily.

1169
01:29:37,369 --> 01:29:39,037
That's it sir... I take leave.

1170
01:29:40,288 --> 01:29:42,374
- How are you Pushpa?
- I’m fine, Sister.

1171
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:44,418
That is the matter.

1172
01:29:44,418 --> 01:29:45,711
Hey Nagesh.

1173
01:29:46,629 --> 01:29:52,009
I have given a word to the big man on the other side.
I will go wrong if I leave you.

1174
01:29:53,969 --> 01:29:56,346
Hey, Cut him into pieces.

1175
01:29:56,346 --> 01:29:57,222
Okay.

1176
01:30:01,977 --> 01:30:05,105
You guys have spoilt the entire floor...

1177
01:30:05,105 --> 01:30:07,650
Hey Venkatesu... make it clean.

1178
01:30:08,275 --> 01:30:10,444
What Pushpa? What made you come to me?

1179
01:30:10,444 --> 01:30:11,570
How is Kondareddy?

1180
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:12,320
He is fine Brother.

1181
01:30:12,738 --> 01:30:14,322
Brother, I have mixed the color.

1182
01:30:14,698 --> 01:30:15,908
What is this? Is this black?

1183
01:30:16,534 --> 01:30:17,576
Yes, black sir.

1184
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,370
Last time also you had said it was black
but had turned brown.

1185
01:30:20,829 --> 01:30:22,623
It was so awkward in front of everyone

1186
01:30:23,206 --> 01:30:26,418
It just happened like that last time brother.
This time it will be black for sure.

1187
01:30:26,544 --> 01:30:30,005
I don’t have confidence in you.
Put on him and show.

1188
01:30:31,381 --> 01:30:32,591
apply on him.

1189
01:30:34,176 --> 01:30:37,179
See Pushpa, how he died struggling.

1190
01:30:37,345 --> 01:30:39,890
Else, he wanted Fifty lakhs per ton.

1191
01:30:40,057 --> 01:30:44,269
All you have to do is to cross two check posts
and deliver stocks to me.

1192
01:30:44,436 --> 01:30:48,607
I must cross fifteen check posts
to transport the stock to Chennai.

1193
01:30:48,649 --> 01:30:49,775
Can you imagine how difficult it is?

1194
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:51,694
I agree brother, It is a very difficult job indeed.

1195
01:30:52,152 --> 01:30:55,405
Even I faced difficulty near fifteenth check post.

1196
01:30:55,573 --> 01:30:59,076
That SI Manikandan you know right.
He asked me for one lakh rupees.

1197
01:30:59,201 --> 01:31:00,410
That fellow.

1198
01:31:00,953 --> 01:31:05,916
Somehow, we made sure the
stock reached Chennai safely brother.

1199
01:31:09,419 --> 01:31:11,630
Have delivered the stock to Chennai?

1200
01:31:13,632 --> 01:31:15,509
Who told you to do that?

1201
01:31:15,509 --> 01:31:18,136
The twenty-five lakhs you give is not enough.

1202
01:31:18,178 --> 01:31:20,430
If you give one crore per ton,
I will sell to you only.

1203
01:31:20,973 --> 01:31:22,600
Crore?
What is it bro?

1204
01:31:23,308 --> 01:31:24,476
If I say no...

1205
01:31:26,394 --> 01:31:28,063
Whom did he say he will sell brother?

1206
01:31:28,313 --> 01:31:29,607
Chennai Murugan.

1207
01:31:29,732 --> 01:31:31,191
I will sell it to him only.

1208
01:31:31,191 --> 01:31:32,317
Why should I go to a new person?

1209
01:31:32,442 --> 01:31:33,652
Hey, do you understand what you are asking?

1210
01:31:34,027 --> 01:31:35,696
We just cut his neck for asking fifty lakhs only.

1211
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:38,406
And here you are asking for one crore.
Don’t you see what just happened..?

1212
01:31:38,657 --> 01:31:39,449
I understand man.

1213
01:31:39,617 --> 01:31:41,702
I came here to ask fifty lakhs only.

1214
01:31:42,077 --> 01:31:44,830
But after seeing him, I understood
how high the risk is...

1215
01:31:44,872 --> 01:31:47,290
that’s why I am asking for a crore...
Am I right brother?

1216
01:31:48,584 --> 01:31:51,128
Brother, tell me whether you can one crore per ton.

1217
01:31:51,461 --> 01:31:53,672
Otherwise, I will sell to Chennai Murugesan only.

1218
01:31:59,845 --> 01:32:02,389
All of you think about it and call me.

1219
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:04,767
Okay?
I take leave brother.

1220
01:32:06,184 --> 01:32:10,355
Oh! What is this bro?

1221
01:32:10,355 --> 01:32:15,110
This is black for sure.
Don’t worry and get it applied.

1222
01:32:32,085 --> 01:32:33,796
Brother, why did you leave him like that?

1223
01:32:35,005 --> 01:32:38,258
You are coming and asking me,
half an hour after he left?

1224
01:32:38,634 --> 01:32:41,762
I was in shock that he was speaking like that
even after seeing what death looks like.

1225
01:32:43,346 --> 01:32:45,599
Do you think I was in a dream sequence
with your sister?

1226
01:32:46,684 --> 01:32:48,476
I was also in a shock.

1227
01:32:49,687 --> 01:32:51,730
We have left him unnecessarily bro.
We should have killed him.

1228
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:52,981
What do you say Singireddy?

1229
01:32:52,981 --> 01:32:53,899
Yes, Brother

1230
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:20,676
Brother, Can I make a call?

1231
01:33:30,644 --> 01:33:31,561
Brother... Murugan.

1232
01:33:31,729 --> 01:33:32,520
Greetings Bro.

1233
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:35,899
This is syndicate member Pushpa speaking.

1234
01:33:37,985 --> 01:33:41,196
This time we don’t want to sell stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1235
01:33:43,115 --> 01:33:44,867
Thinking of selling it to you directly.

1236
01:33:45,868 --> 01:33:47,995
Ok... Ok Brother.

1237
01:33:48,203 --> 01:33:50,372
Stock has already reached Chennai Sir.

1238
01:33:52,165 --> 01:33:55,961
I will come to Chennai tomorrow and discuss rate with you.

1239
01:33:56,544 --> 01:33:59,089
Ok. Write down my pager number brother.

1240
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:03,135
Eight Three... Eight four...

1241
01:34:56,772 --> 01:34:58,690
You fool!

1242
01:34:59,566 --> 01:35:01,902
I didn't left because you spared me

1243
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:05,572
I left because I decided to leave.

1244
01:35:05,948 --> 01:35:06,865
What?

1245
01:35:07,657 --> 01:35:10,035
You thought Pushpa means flower...

1246
01:35:10,744 --> 01:35:11,829
It's Fire!

1247
01:35:13,205 --> 01:35:14,331
Fire!

1248
01:35:40,273 --> 01:35:42,317
Who are you?
What do you want?

1249
01:35:42,317 --> 01:35:43,777
We have come to meet Murugan.

1250
01:35:43,777 --> 01:35:44,361
Is it?

1251
01:35:44,361 --> 01:35:46,113
Hey... who are they?

1252
01:35:46,363 --> 01:35:48,573
Pushpa, Syndicate member.

1253
01:35:48,866 --> 01:35:51,493
Came from Tirupati to discuss business.

1254
01:35:51,743 --> 01:35:54,662
Hey, say Pager No. 8384.

1255
01:35:54,662 --> 01:35:55,831
He will recognize us with that

1256
01:35:55,831 --> 01:35:57,124
Why are you shouting in my ear?

1257
01:35:57,124 --> 01:36:01,086
Hey, Murugan Sir is busy and
he said he can’t meet anyone.

1258
01:36:01,211 --> 01:36:02,129
You heard it right!

1259
01:36:02,462 --> 01:36:05,007
Murugan Sir won’t meet anyone. Leave now

1260
01:36:05,007 --> 01:36:08,676
Let him say that after seeing this piece.

1261
01:36:09,136 --> 01:36:09,887
What is this?

1262
01:36:10,178 --> 01:36:13,723
This is Bro’s visiting card.
He will understand if he looks at it

1263
01:36:22,357 --> 01:36:23,984
Its 07:45 PM

1264
01:36:23,984 --> 01:36:25,568
It's tea time for Murugan sir.

1265
01:36:25,568 --> 01:36:27,029
Quickly go and give a tea to Murugan sir.

1266
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:30,490
Hey, Tea won’t go anywhere.

1267
01:36:31,074 --> 01:36:32,826
Murugan himself will come to tea

1268
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:42,044
What is this man?

1269
01:36:43,128 --> 01:36:43,962
A grade stock.

1270
01:36:44,796 --> 01:36:47,465
I had seen it long back when I started the business.

1271
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:49,968
I’m seeing it again now.

1272
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:51,887
This is gold.

1273
01:36:52,054 --> 01:36:54,764
How many hills we have to climb up
to see lord Venkateswara...

1274
01:36:55,098 --> 01:36:58,351
Likewise that many hills you need
to climb down to find this kind of stuff

1275
01:36:58,643 --> 01:37:01,521
This is A grade Stuff.

1276
01:37:02,272 --> 01:37:07,569
The smuggler who buys never knows where we can get it
The one who the cuts the tree knows the exact place

1277
01:37:30,508 --> 01:37:31,259
Open the door.

1278
01:37:45,773 --> 01:37:48,610
Two tons... five trucks
We have ten tons of stock

1279
01:37:48,818 --> 01:37:49,861
Super man!

1280
01:37:51,446 --> 01:37:54,992
Will speak to Mangalam Srinu
and fix the rate. You leave.

1281
01:37:55,075 --> 01:37:58,536
Brother, We have decided not to sell
the stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1282
01:37:59,246 --> 01:38:01,456
That is why we came directly to sell it to you.

1283
01:38:01,581 --> 01:38:03,458
That’s why we brought it this far.

1284
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:04,960
Do you want stock or not?

1285
01:38:12,384 --> 01:38:14,094
Hey, close the door.

1286
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:15,678
- Start the vehicles...
- Bro.. bro...

1287
01:38:16,054 --> 01:38:19,557
Mangalam Srinu is very dangerous.

1288
01:38:20,308 --> 01:38:23,311
Can you do business defying him?

1289
01:38:26,356 --> 01:38:29,109
Can you buy the stock defying him?

1290
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:31,945
Any who came here defying Mangalam Srinu
and they are all dead.

1291
01:38:32,946 --> 01:38:35,240
Brother, many would have come to you.

1292
01:38:35,698 --> 01:38:39,702
I called from Srinanna’s place only and
told you that I am coming to you

1293
01:38:40,328 --> 01:38:41,371
I’m different bro.

1294
01:38:41,496 --> 01:38:43,373
Who are you? Are you a crack?

1295
01:38:44,332 --> 01:38:47,210
Do you know to whom you are talking to?

1296
01:38:47,419 --> 01:38:48,920
I am Kondareddy’s partner.

1297
01:38:49,587 --> 01:38:52,132
Kondareddy himself sent me here to talk to you.

1298
01:38:52,132 --> 01:38:55,343
Are you Kondareddy’s man?

1299
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:57,679
You should have told me that earlier.

1300
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:58,721
Call him.

1301
01:39:00,557 --> 01:39:02,809
Let me speak once.

1302
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:06,813
That, only after negotiating the price...

1303
01:39:07,397 --> 01:39:08,648
Tell me what is the rate?

1304
01:39:10,442 --> 01:39:11,151
Hello!

1305
01:39:11,318 --> 01:39:12,402
Brother Kondareeddy

1306
01:39:12,694 --> 01:39:14,862
Hey Pushpa. Didn’t see you for the last 2 days.

1307
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,905
Where did you go?

1308
01:39:16,114 --> 01:39:17,282
I came to Chennai?

1309
01:39:17,574 --> 01:39:19,742
Chennai? Why??

1310
01:39:20,243 --> 01:39:22,079
I came here to meet Murugan.

1311
01:39:22,287 --> 01:39:23,413
To meet Murugan?

1312
01:39:23,830 --> 01:39:25,915
Hey Jakka.
He says he went to meet Murugan

1313
01:39:28,168 --> 01:39:29,377
Whose permission did you take to go to Murugan?

1314
01:39:29,502 --> 01:39:31,129
I asked you to go and meet Mangalam Srinu, right?

1315
01:39:31,296 --> 01:39:34,091
What bro? Doesn’t Kondareddy know
that we came here?

1316
01:39:37,135 --> 01:39:41,306
Just because we gave 4% share,
you want to act as you wish?

1317
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:43,850
One and half crore...

1318
01:39:50,732 --> 01:39:53,401
One and half crore per ton.

1319
01:39:53,735 --> 01:39:55,653
I just negotiated the deal with Murugan.

1320
01:39:56,071 --> 01:39:59,199
As usual, do you want me to sell to
Mangalam Srinu for twenty-five lakhs

1321
01:39:59,366 --> 01:40:01,576
or take risk and sell it to Murugan for one and half crore...

1322
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:08,041
Understood bro.

1323
01:40:08,916 --> 01:40:16,049
I will tell Muragan brother that
you can’t do business defying Mangalam Srinu.

1324
01:40:16,091 --> 01:40:17,634
I will tell him that we don’t have the guts.

1325
01:40:18,343 --> 01:40:20,887
I held back for all these days not because
I don’t have guts.

1326
01:40:21,179 --> 01:40:23,598
I stopped because I was bound by Syndicate’s decision.

1327
01:40:23,723 --> 01:40:28,145
When we know that Mangalam Srinu is
cheating us, who cares for the syndicate?

1328
01:40:28,353 --> 01:40:29,729
Finalize the deal.

1329
01:40:34,234 --> 01:40:34,901
Brother...

1330
01:40:35,318 --> 01:40:41,491
50% share to me and 50% to you from the profits.
You remember we agreed on this the other day.

1331
01:40:50,833 --> 01:40:53,002
How dare you information to police
about us.. you idiot?

1332
01:41:00,009 --> 01:41:03,138
What is the point of talking to him brother,
when he was informing everything about us to Police.

1333
01:41:09,186 --> 01:41:10,728
I don’t have anything to do with it.. brother.

1334
01:41:11,146 --> 01:41:12,564
He did everything.

1335
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:14,982
You knew, that he was doing all this.

1336
01:41:19,237 --> 01:41:20,280
I know, brother.

1337
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:21,364
Why didn’t you not inform us?

1338
01:41:23,866 --> 01:41:27,162
He lured me with money.

1339
01:41:28,413 --> 01:41:31,166
I got greedy in the hope to perform my daughter’s marriage.

1340
01:41:32,083 --> 01:41:33,042
Daughter?

1341
01:41:33,543 --> 01:41:34,627
Who is that?

1342
01:41:35,086 --> 01:41:36,713
Does he have a grown up daughter..?

1343
01:41:37,172 --> 01:41:40,425
same one brother, the one you saw when she came
to see ‘Choodalani undi’ Movie.. that one...

1344
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,010
Is she, his daughter?

1345
01:41:44,304 --> 01:41:46,764
Isn’t she beautiful? I saw her from far.

1346
01:41:46,764 --> 01:41:49,434
She looks just ok bro

1347
01:41:51,102 --> 01:41:53,730
Then ask her to come once.
We shall talk to her

1348
01:41:57,650 --> 01:41:58,651
Lay him down here.

1349
01:42:00,069 --> 01:42:02,322
Rey, You guys go and get his parents

1350
01:42:03,072 --> 01:42:03,573
My...

1351
01:42:03,906 --> 01:42:04,741
Where is my father?

1352
01:42:05,242 --> 01:42:06,534
What happened to him.

1353
01:42:07,869 --> 01:42:08,453
I’m asking you.

1354
01:42:08,578 --> 01:42:09,746
What happened to my father?

1355
01:42:09,954 --> 01:42:10,747
Tell me.

1356
01:42:11,248 --> 01:42:12,081
What happened to my father?

1357
01:42:14,417 --> 01:42:17,920
Rey Busappa, you said she is just ok.

1358
01:42:18,921 --> 01:42:21,674
But she is looking superb like a film heroine.

1359
01:42:22,675 --> 01:42:24,302
Your father is alive.

1360
01:42:24,344 --> 01:42:29,599
But go home and have a bath with lux soap.

1361
01:42:30,057 --> 01:42:35,313
wear this saree with jasmine flowers
and come here in the night.

1362
01:42:35,605 --> 01:42:37,274
Then, You can take your father home in the morning.

1363
01:42:37,982 --> 01:42:40,360
Get ready like a bride for Jalanna and come.

1364
01:42:41,236 --> 01:42:45,114
What? Can’t you adjust for one night
for the sake of your father’s life?

1365
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:50,537
Go... Go.

1366
01:44:09,574 --> 01:44:10,199
Hey!

1367
01:44:10,408 --> 01:44:10,908
Bro!

1368
01:44:11,326 --> 01:44:14,829
Go out and have some beer and biryani.
Come back in the morning.

1369
01:44:14,871 --> 01:44:15,580
Ok bro.

1370
01:44:15,705 --> 01:44:18,583
Rey, we can do this in the morning.
Let’s go. Rey. Let’s go

1371
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,254
(Song)

1372
01:44:44,233 --> 01:44:45,735
How come you came here dear?

1373
01:44:47,194 --> 01:44:48,613
Have you lost your way?

1374
01:44:48,613 --> 01:44:51,073
Jalreddy is saying that he will kill my father

1375
01:44:51,949 --> 01:44:54,952
Why Jalreddy?
Even I would kill him.

1376
01:44:56,037 --> 01:44:58,122
How could your father
show loyalty to the Police?

1377
01:44:58,373 --> 01:45:02,168
He said he will spare him,
if I sleep with him tonight.

1378
01:45:08,215 --> 01:45:09,676
You came all decked up right.

1379
01:45:10,217 --> 01:45:13,054
Go there.
Why did you come here?

1380
01:45:15,682 --> 01:45:20,144
If I go there tonight, my father might
return home in the morning...

1381
01:45:20,978 --> 01:45:22,439
but I will not be able to come to your house ever.

1382
01:45:22,855 --> 01:45:25,316
Why do you want to come to the house of
a guy who doesn’t have surname?

1383
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,819
You must have felt happy on the day the relation broke.

1384
01:45:27,819 --> 01:45:30,447
You must have felt very happy
that you have gotten rid of me,

1385
01:45:30,447 --> 01:45:31,906
and you don’t need to see my face ever again.

1386
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:34,451
Is this what you understood?

1387
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,370
You are like this, from the beginning.

1388
01:45:37,704 --> 01:45:40,915
When did you ever understood the heart
of a girl that you can understand today.

1389
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,046
When my friends told me that you are feeling sad,
because I was not looking at you,

1390
01:45:47,672 --> 01:45:51,843
I felt very happy that this boy likes me so much.

1391
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:54,471
I liked you as soon as I saw you.

1392
01:45:59,183 --> 01:46:01,060
When you gave me money and asked for a kiss...

1393
01:46:01,268 --> 01:46:06,023
I thought this is your way of expressing love.

1394
01:46:08,568 --> 01:46:11,488
When I said that I want to give first kiss to my husband,

1395
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:16,993
I gave an indication to you to marry me.

1396
01:46:17,952 --> 01:46:19,621
You didn't understand even that.

1397
01:46:20,872 --> 01:46:23,249
My father doesn’t even start the lorry without my nod.

1398
01:46:23,625 --> 01:46:27,336
Do you think you could come to my house
for marriage proposal without my wish?

1399
01:46:28,838 --> 01:46:35,428
Do you know how bad I felt seeing
you anxious when mother-in-law got hurt?

1400
01:46:35,637 --> 01:46:38,305
You could have understood that,
had you seen into my eyes once.

1401
01:46:39,682 --> 01:46:41,100
You left even without looking at me.

1402
01:46:41,225 --> 01:46:44,521
Do you mean to say, that I should
change my heart after hearing whatever you said...

1403
01:46:44,521 --> 01:46:46,981
and go fight with jaali and save your father?

1404
01:46:47,815 --> 01:46:49,316
It is not going to happen.
Leave now

1405
01:46:49,316 --> 01:46:51,944
I know that you won’t do anything like that.

1406
01:46:52,904 --> 01:46:54,822
Your money and business are important to you, Isn’t it?

1407
01:46:55,197 --> 01:46:58,743
Why will you fight for a stranger like me?

1408
01:47:00,787 --> 01:47:03,623
Anyways, I didn’t come for that.

1409
01:47:03,665 --> 01:47:04,666
Then why did you come?

1410
01:47:13,382 --> 01:47:21,933
I always wanted to share my first kiss and my first night
with someone whom I consider my husband.

1411
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:29,148
Please sleep with me once.

1412
01:47:29,941 --> 01:47:32,527
You will never see me again.

1413
01:47:34,612 --> 01:47:35,780
I will go.

1414
01:47:37,574 --> 01:47:39,701
And after that I don’t care what happens to my life.

1415
01:47:45,247 --> 01:47:46,207
What is this dear?

1416
01:47:47,834 --> 01:47:49,752
Do you love me so much?

1417
01:47:52,296 --> 01:47:55,883
You think I will allow anyone to lay his hand
on you after what you said.

1418
01:47:58,177 --> 01:47:59,762
Whoever it is...

1419
01:48:03,641 --> 01:48:06,227
will not allow

1420
01:48:14,902 --> 01:48:16,112
What Pushpa?

1421
01:48:17,321 --> 01:48:20,032
You only brought the girl to make her sleep with me.

1422
01:48:20,908 --> 01:48:23,244
Are you doing all this for just 4 percent?

1423
01:48:39,969 --> 01:48:41,137
I won't leave her.

1424
01:50:08,933 --> 01:50:12,729
Are you firing?

1425
01:50:13,896 --> 01:50:14,772
Dear, Come here.

1426
01:50:15,231 --> 01:50:16,482
Are you firing bullets on to the girl?

1427
01:50:16,774 --> 01:50:18,484
I am going to kill you, idiot.

1428
01:50:38,504 --> 01:50:41,298
How dare you lay a hand on girls?

1429
01:50:46,679 --> 01:50:47,429
Muniratnam!

1430
01:50:48,389 --> 01:50:49,640
Muniratnam, get up!

1431
01:51:02,611 --> 01:51:06,365
Look Srivalli, your father is fine.
I made him sit in the car.

1432
01:51:06,991 --> 01:51:11,453
What is this man?
You have hit Jalreddy so badly.

1433
01:51:11,746 --> 01:51:14,832
O Jalanna. I feel pity looking at you.

1434
01:51:15,582 --> 01:51:18,377
What maccha?
You made him incapable for anything.

1435
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:21,881
If Kondareddy gets to know if this, he will kill you bro.

1436
01:51:22,256 --> 01:51:25,301
Hey, who will tell?
This fellow only should say if at all...

1437
01:51:25,426 --> 01:51:28,930
What man? What will you tell your brother?

1438
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:34,018
Will you go cry before him and
tell him shamelessly that Pushpa beat you.

1439
01:51:34,101 --> 01:51:38,439
Ey Jaali, Go and complain.
I don’t care.

1440
01:51:38,522 --> 01:51:40,274
Dear, come let’s go.

1441
01:51:40,357 --> 01:51:42,902
We will get it resolved either this way or that way.
I’m ready for whatever happens.

1442
01:51:42,902 --> 01:51:48,199
Pushpa, I’m not an idiot to go
and complain to my brothers.

1443
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:52,578
This is between you and me...

1444
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:57,458
and I will deal about this with you directly.

1445
01:51:58,667 --> 01:52:00,169
I won’t leave you.

1446
01:52:00,169 --> 01:52:04,048
This.. This ..This...
This is what is called as being a man.

1447
01:52:04,048 --> 01:52:09,261
What you did with women
all these days is not like a man.

1448
01:52:09,804 --> 01:52:12,389
Now you have proven that you are a man.

1449
01:52:12,556 --> 01:52:14,183
Now stand on your word.

1450
01:52:14,433 --> 01:52:17,519
Kesava, he has masculinity in him.

1451
01:52:17,895 --> 01:52:19,688
I think he will stand on his word.

1452
01:52:20,189 --> 01:52:22,608
What dear? What do you think?

1453
01:52:22,608 --> 01:52:24,235
I too believe the same

1454
01:52:24,443 --> 01:52:25,820
He will stand on his word right

1455
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:27,947
How will he stand,
when you have already broken everything.

1456
01:52:37,081 --> 01:52:39,416
Muniratnam, Come... come.

1457
01:52:44,546 --> 01:52:46,382
Pushpa, I will park the car at home and come.

1458
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:00,938
Srivalli, I will take leave.

1459
01:53:00,938 --> 01:53:01,772
Pushpa!

1460
01:53:02,273 --> 01:53:04,108
Come and have dinner.

1461
01:53:04,525 --> 01:53:05,567
No need Aunty.

1462
01:53:06,277 --> 01:53:09,864
My mom is waiting for me... I have to go.

1463
01:53:09,906 --> 01:53:11,323
Pushpa, wait a minute.

1464
01:53:11,657 --> 01:53:12,533
You come.

1465
01:53:23,335 --> 01:53:24,545
My mom asked me to give this to you.

1466
01:53:27,006 --> 01:53:27,882
Okay.

1467
01:53:29,591 --> 01:53:30,342
You go.

1468
01:53:34,847 --> 01:53:36,307
Why are you staring at me?

1469
01:53:36,598 --> 01:53:37,141
Go.

1470
01:53:40,311 --> 01:53:41,228
What girl?

1471
01:53:45,566 --> 01:53:46,483
What girl?

1472
01:53:50,947 --> 01:53:54,491
When you call me Dear... Dear,
I feel like I have become your wife

1473
01:53:54,491 --> 01:53:57,411
Darling... My Darling

1474
01:53:57,912 --> 01:54:01,457
When I call you Darling... Darling,
you suit well as my Husband

1475
01:54:01,457 --> 01:54:04,376
Darling... My Darling

1476
01:54:04,668 --> 01:54:07,338
When I walk behind you

1477
01:54:08,089 --> 01:54:10,007
When I walk behind you

1478
01:54:10,049 --> 01:54:12,759
It feels like going uphill
to Venkanna Temple, Darling

1479
01:54:13,219 --> 01:54:15,221
When I sit next to you

1480
01:54:15,262 --> 01:54:18,182
It feels like I got Lord Parameshwara.

1481
01:54:18,432 --> 01:54:21,978
When I look at the path as you leave
It is as if the lake has dried up.

1482
01:54:21,978 --> 01:54:24,897
Darling... My Darling

1483
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:28,025
My Darling... Come here Darling

1484
01:54:28,442 --> 01:54:31,778
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1485
01:54:31,904 --> 01:54:34,698
My Darling... Come here Darling

1486
01:54:35,282 --> 01:54:38,619
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1487
01:54:53,259 --> 01:54:59,306
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1488
01:55:00,182 --> 01:55:03,477
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1489
01:55:03,477 --> 01:55:05,854
My breath gets stopped Darling

1490
01:55:06,772 --> 01:55:10,317
When you are chewing a Jarda Pan

1491
01:55:10,317 --> 01:55:13,237
My body gets painted Red... Darling

1492
01:55:13,279 --> 01:55:16,032
When I hear your yells and roars...

1493
01:55:23,622 --> 01:55:27,001
When I hear your yells and roars...
It thrills me like hell...

1494
01:55:27,126 --> 01:55:30,504
When you sit cross legged, it mesmerizes me.

1495
01:55:30,504 --> 01:55:34,175
When you take out two buttons and show your chest
Won’t it overflow like a milk Pot

1496
01:55:34,175 --> 01:55:37,303
My Darling... my Darling

1497
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:40,139
My Darling... Come here Darling

1498
01:55:40,556 --> 01:55:43,892
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1499
01:55:43,976 --> 01:55:46,770
My Darling... Come here Darling

1500
01:55:47,188 --> 01:55:50,524
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1501
01:56:05,331 --> 01:56:10,502
When I wear a new saree and you don’t complement

1502
01:56:12,004 --> 01:56:15,591
When I wear a new saree and you don’t complement

1503
01:56:15,632 --> 01:56:18,135
Wouldn’t that saree value become zero, Darling...

1504
01:56:18,885 --> 01:56:22,556
When I wear flowers in my hair
And if you don’t smell them

1505
01:56:22,556 --> 01:56:25,142
Wouldn’t the flower mound fall down.

1506
01:56:25,517 --> 01:56:28,729
When my saree frill slips down

1507
01:56:35,652 --> 01:56:39,115
When my saree frill slips down,
and you won’t look at me

1508
01:56:39,115 --> 01:56:42,576
The naughty wind would sympathize with me, Darling

1509
01:56:42,618 --> 01:56:46,413
If my beauty doesn’t become yours,
my life as girl would become poor

1510
01:56:46,413 --> 01:56:49,375
Darling... my Darling

1511
01:56:49,375 --> 01:56:52,169
My Darling... Come here Darling

1512
01:56:52,586 --> 01:56:55,922
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1513
01:56:56,006 --> 01:56:58,800
My Darling... Come here Darling

1514
01:56:59,218 --> 01:57:02,554
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1515
01:57:12,481 --> 01:57:14,525
Bro, Operation to the spine it seems.

1516
01:57:14,858 --> 01:57:17,819
Doctor is saying only after that
he can say if he can walk or not

1517
01:57:22,449 --> 01:57:24,285
He won’t say who hit him.

1518
01:57:24,868 --> 01:57:26,120
And you people don’t know.

1519
01:57:26,703 --> 01:57:27,621
Is that right?

1520
01:57:27,829 --> 01:57:28,664
Yes Brother.

1521
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:35,462
Bro... Bro... Bro

1522
01:57:35,462 --> 01:57:37,214
Whom did he sleep with last night?

1523
01:57:37,214 --> 01:57:39,758
Muniratnam daughter came... Bro

1524
01:57:39,758 --> 01:57:44,263
Muniratnam daughter came in the night and
went back in the morning with her father.

1525
01:57:44,263 --> 01:57:46,265
Then, who hit him?

1526
01:57:56,233 --> 01:57:59,653
Bro, looks like Kondareddy wants to kill the guy
who thrashed Jalreddy,

1527
01:57:59,653 --> 01:58:02,656
once he gets to know who did it.. ignoring that,
you are looking at Pager and money.

1528
01:58:03,282 --> 01:58:06,702
Only six months? For the trashing I gave him,
He should not get up for one year.

1529
01:58:06,952 --> 01:58:09,455
I think I haven’t given him enough...

1530
01:58:10,122 --> 01:58:13,584
Bro, Jalreddy still has some masculinity left in him.
That is why he didn’t name you.

1531
01:58:13,959 --> 01:58:15,711
What If Kondareddy gets to know this...

1532
01:58:15,794 --> 01:58:18,046
I lost my count...
How will Kondareddy get to know?

1533
01:58:19,881 --> 01:58:23,510
What Pushpa?
Has the stock reached Murugan?

1534
01:58:24,261 --> 01:58:26,388
Reached Bro. He sent the message too.
Just reached it seems

1535
01:58:26,638 --> 01:58:30,726
Ok. we should go to Tirupati tomorrow
and get the money.

1536
01:58:31,143 --> 01:58:34,104
- That Hawala slip is with you, only right?
- It is safe with me.

1537
01:58:34,104 --> 01:58:35,231
Be ready in the morning

1538
01:58:36,773 --> 01:58:38,066
what is that injury on your hand?

1539
01:58:38,275 --> 01:58:40,527
This... Our
That... Got scratched when coming in car.

1540
01:58:41,403 --> 01:58:42,863
Be careful man. Ok...

1541
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:44,406
- What Subbareddy?
- Bro...

1542
01:58:44,406 --> 01:58:46,742
- Did you get the jeep tyres changed?
- got it Changed bro

1543
01:58:49,203 --> 01:58:50,496
What should I do?

1544
01:58:50,954 --> 01:58:54,708
- Bro. Do you think he heard?
- No, He didn’t.

1545
01:58:54,958 --> 01:58:57,669
No Bro. I have a doubt that he must have heard...

1546
01:58:58,128 --> 01:59:01,715
I will do one thing.
I will go out and close the door and wait there...

1547
01:59:01,715 --> 01:59:04,092
You speak something.
I will see if can hear it or not

1548
01:59:06,303 --> 01:59:07,971
Bro... Speak.. Speak

1549
01:59:16,813 --> 01:59:18,148
bro, I could not hear anything

1550
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:20,317
I didn’t speak anything

1551
01:59:24,446 --> 01:59:27,199
- What man... What is this?
- Mosquitos Bro

1552
01:59:27,241 --> 01:59:28,409
- What?
- Mosquitos

1553
01:59:29,368 --> 01:59:31,745
Be careful man. Too many mosquitos here.
What if we get Dengue Fever?

1554
01:59:31,745 --> 01:59:36,292
I’m going to Tirupati on work...
Do you want anything?

1555
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:38,752
Don’t you know what I want?

1556
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:41,213
Your hands look good.

1557
01:59:42,088 --> 01:59:43,882
Should I bring you gold ring?

1558
01:59:47,428 --> 01:59:49,888
What? Don’t you like gold ring?

1559
01:59:51,307 --> 01:59:52,474
What do you want?

1560
01:59:53,767 --> 01:59:57,145
You are staring at me with eyes wide open.
What happened?

1561
01:59:57,521 --> 01:59:58,939
What are you doing?

1562
01:59:59,856 --> 02:00:01,567
Going to Tirupati on work

1563
02:00:02,025 --> 02:00:03,694
What are you doing now?

1564
02:00:04,152 --> 02:00:05,529
Looking at you

1565
02:00:06,238 --> 02:00:07,448
Where is your hand?

1566
02:00:07,614 --> 02:00:09,783
- what?
- Where is your hand?

1567
02:00:11,076 --> 02:00:13,787
Oh. Did my hand touch you? Sorry dear

1568
02:00:15,414 --> 02:00:17,958
You didn't remove
It is still there.

1569
02:00:18,375 --> 02:00:20,294
I was talking on the phone.. here, I removed it...

1570
02:00:20,586 --> 02:00:23,672
I didn’t realise it because I was busy talking on phone

1571
02:00:23,797 --> 02:00:25,757
You didn’t know, is it?
You didn’t know?

1572
02:00:25,882 --> 02:00:28,260
- You didn’t know, is it?
- Hey... Why are you hitting me, dear?

1573
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:30,095
Don’t talk... I'll not come again

1574
02:00:30,095 --> 02:00:32,013
- What happened?
- Don't talk.

1575
02:00:32,013 --> 02:00:33,724
I’m leaving now.

1576
02:00:34,182 --> 02:00:37,519
I came here to see your face before
going for money collection.

1577
02:00:37,519 --> 02:00:39,271
- Do you know how excitedly I came?
- What?

1578
02:00:39,813 --> 02:00:42,899
Did I come to get hit by you? I will go.

1579
02:00:43,066 --> 02:00:46,528
- Stop Darling...
- I'll go...

1580
02:00:46,528 --> 02:00:47,571
This is all waste business.

1581
02:00:47,571 --> 02:00:49,239
Stop Darling I will leave

1582
02:00:49,323 --> 02:00:52,158
What Darling?
You only did it and now you are only getting angry.

1583
02:00:53,076 --> 02:00:56,747
Why did you hit me? See... Again,
you are getting angry

1584
02:00:56,747 --> 02:00:58,415
Hold it darling

1585
02:00:59,541 --> 02:01:02,252

I will stay, you go dear... go dear...

1589
02:01:19,144 --> 02:01:21,146
Srivalli... Srivalli

Ok Darling... I leave now

1591
02:01:24,107 --> 02:01:28,362
Hey. What are you doing dear?
They will find it.

1592
02:01:29,488 --> 02:01:32,991
See, if your friend asks, tell her that we were just talking.
Don’t tell her all these things.

1593
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:34,660
It will spoil my reputation.

1594
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:36,202
Ok, Darling. I know

1595
02:01:38,622 --> 02:01:40,332
It’s time for work.

1596
02:01:43,209 --> 02:01:45,379
what dear? Looks like a lot happened inside

1597
02:01:45,504 --> 02:01:46,254
Nothing.

1598
02:01:46,254 --> 02:01:48,840
Hey Srivalli.
Ask Pushpa to have tiffin and go.

1599
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:51,343
He had tiffin aunty. He had it just now.

1600
02:01:51,593 --> 02:01:53,178
Can’t you see it?

1601
02:01:53,178 --> 02:01:54,054
Srivalli!

1602
02:01:54,388 --> 02:01:55,639
Careful darling

1603
02:01:56,432 --> 02:01:57,849
Darling!

1604
02:02:05,482 --> 02:02:06,942
Someone is coming.

1605
02:02:07,401 --> 02:02:09,069
Pushpa come... please come.

1606
02:02:09,235 --> 02:02:11,154
Shetji, are you fine?

1607
02:02:12,322 --> 02:02:14,115
- How are you?
- Fine sir.

1608
02:02:15,158 --> 02:02:16,159
How are you?

1609
02:02:16,284 --> 02:02:17,828
I am fine.

1610
02:02:55,657 --> 02:02:56,700
You go... I'll come.

1611
02:02:56,700 --> 02:02:58,159
Pushpa... look, new models have arrived.

1612
02:03:19,222 --> 02:03:21,433
Pushpa, go to new godown.

1613
02:03:32,819 --> 02:03:39,325
If you wear a striking dress and
if we give frightening looks... it scares (Song Humming)

1614
02:03:39,367 --> 02:03:47,459
aa... you get scared. If we come walking with grace
and you stop us for fun... scare... scares..scares

1615
02:03:47,709 --> 02:03:52,130
How did you hear what I was singing to myself?

1616
02:03:52,130 --> 02:03:55,425
Why can’t I hear?
You think we can’t hear whatever you guys speak inside?

1617
02:03:55,717 --> 02:04:02,683
Leave that. When you and Pushpa were talking of beating
Jalreddy, me and Kondareddy sir heard from outside.

1618
02:04:02,849 --> 02:04:04,976
What did you say? Move aside.

1619
02:04:14,778 --> 02:04:16,237
Max Pager Services

1620
02:04:16,738 --> 02:04:19,491
Sister, have to send a message urgently.

1621
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:20,659
Please tell me the number?

1622
02:05:08,498 --> 02:05:09,499
Get him up.

1623
02:05:12,002 --> 02:05:15,421
What man? Did you forget who we are?

1624
02:05:16,715 --> 02:05:19,885
Just because we gave you four percent share
and a seat next to us,

1625
02:05:19,885 --> 02:05:22,888
do you think we will remain silent
if you lay your hands on our brother?

1626
02:05:23,054 --> 02:05:25,641
I will kill you, idiot.

1627
02:05:26,224 --> 02:05:29,310
Hey. He has a 5 crore hawala slip in his pocket.
Search for it.

1628
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,814
- Why are you laughing?
- Hit the idiot. Hit him

1629
02:05:33,273 --> 02:05:35,275
My brother is talking and you are laughing at him.

1630
02:05:35,275 --> 02:05:36,860
Else what bro?

1631
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:40,196
I thought you are killing me because of your brother...

1632
02:05:40,614 --> 02:05:42,616
right now I got that you are killing me because of money.

1633
02:05:42,616 --> 02:05:47,621
Now business is good, after killing me
you can takeover all the my share also.

1634
02:05:47,621 --> 02:05:49,873
Hey... to me nothing is bigger than my brother.

1635
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:53,418
It’s a nice joke bro.
Maybe this is the last joke I will hear.

1636
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:58,339
What are you searching man?
I keep it in the fold of my hand sleeve right.

1637
02:05:58,339 --> 02:05:59,758
We got the note.

1638
02:05:59,758 --> 02:06:01,885
Kondareddy bro, you have become very commercial.

1639
02:06:01,885 --> 02:06:03,303
Hey Subbareddy. Is it the same note?

1640
02:06:03,344 --> 02:06:04,095
Yes Brother. It is the same note.

1641
02:06:04,137 --> 02:06:05,096
On which date do we get our money?

1642
02:06:05,138 --> 02:06:08,058
New title for you. Commercial Kondareddy.
Tag line-No Masculinity

1643
02:06:09,643 --> 02:06:11,144
Hey, take him and throw him in the pit

1644
02:06:11,561 --> 02:06:16,316
I know brother, that these kind of businesses
will definitely see death some day.

1645
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:21,571
If by mistake, Lord Venkateswara supports me and saves me,

1646
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:23,949
I will become a very big man for sure.

1647
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:27,160
I will sit on the top.

1648
02:06:28,704 --> 02:06:31,164
Yes. I can visualize my future.

1649
02:06:35,293 --> 02:06:38,296
Why delay?
Shoot him up.

1650
02:07:23,549 --> 02:07:25,510
Hey, I will kill this Jakkareddy.

1651
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:27,345
You guys go and kill that Pushpa.

1652
02:10:04,252 --> 02:10:05,378
Cut the rope.

1653
02:10:16,973 --> 02:10:18,016
Quickly.

1654
02:10:22,187 --> 02:10:23,188
Come on cut the rope.

1655
02:10:36,993 --> 02:10:40,080
Pushpa, come fast.

1656
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:45,835
Pushpa!

1657
02:10:59,849 --> 02:11:00,934
Catch him.

1658
02:11:02,894 --> 02:11:04,062
Kill him.

1659
02:11:12,653 --> 02:11:13,529
Hold on guys...

1660
02:11:20,078 --> 02:11:22,288
He is getting scared.. he is scared...

1661
02:11:30,005 --> 02:11:33,383
Bro, we found jakkareddy.

1662
02:11:33,466 --> 02:11:36,094
what are you waiting for? Kill him

1663
02:11:36,177 --> 02:11:37,095
I will cut his neck bro...

1664
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:38,554
then what about that coolie?

1665
02:11:38,554 --> 02:11:41,682
You mean, that Pushpa?
Our men would have killed him by now bro...

1666
02:12:50,876 --> 02:12:53,129
What Jakkareddy?
What are you looking at me like that.

1667
02:12:53,588 --> 02:12:55,506
Is it because I came back?

1668
02:12:56,007 --> 02:12:58,176
You and I may have million things between us...

1669
02:12:58,343 --> 02:13:01,971
but when an outsider comes, you are my partner.
That’s it.

1670
02:13:02,097 --> 02:13:03,514
You think I will sit and watch?

1671
02:13:50,395 --> 02:13:51,771
What man... why are you coming on to me like that.

1672
02:13:52,897 --> 02:13:55,608
If my brother-in-law comes to know of it
he won’t leave you...

1673
02:13:55,775 --> 02:13:57,110
If you something harm to me,
my brother-in-law won’t leave you.

1674
02:14:07,370 --> 02:14:09,330
Why are you taking out the gun? Will you kill me?

1675
02:14:09,455 --> 02:14:12,333
My brother-in-law won’t keep quite if you do anything to me.
He will kill all of you.

1676
02:14:12,583 --> 02:14:16,129
True Pushpa, It will become a big mess if you touch him.

1677
02:14:16,421 --> 02:14:18,506
He is getting scared. He is getting scared.

1678
02:14:18,798 --> 02:14:20,425
Even I want to kill him Pushpa.

1679
02:14:23,511 --> 02:14:25,930
But no... Leave him.

1680
02:14:27,432 --> 02:14:28,766
Let this end with my brother

1681
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:31,811
He is getting scared... Scared.

1682
02:14:31,811 --> 02:14:34,314
That’s all. Everyone should fear my brother-in-law.

1683
02:14:34,439 --> 02:14:36,357
See... here my brother-in-law himself is calling.

1684
02:14:38,234 --> 02:14:39,860
I will go. I will go away.

1685
02:14:40,069 --> 02:14:42,155
Hey Kesava... Start the vehicle.

1686
02:14:42,447 --> 02:14:43,156
Talk...

1687
02:14:43,698 --> 02:14:46,075
Talk to him... you are finished now.

1688
02:14:46,826 --> 02:14:48,578
What man Mogileesu?

1689
02:14:48,786 --> 02:14:49,954
Yeah, Srinu bro...

1690
02:14:50,663 --> 02:14:51,414
Pushpa!

1691
02:14:54,542 --> 02:14:57,253
Bro, they caught Mogileesu.

1692
02:15:00,173 --> 02:15:03,008
Look Pushpa. Listen to what I am saying...

1693
02:15:03,176 --> 02:15:07,555
Let us do business together...
that too at the rate you asked for.

1694
02:15:09,224 --> 02:15:12,477
We will discuss about the rest later.

1695
02:15:12,602 --> 02:15:15,605
Don’t do anything to my brother-in-law.

1696
02:15:15,896 --> 02:15:16,606
Okay?

1697
02:15:17,064 --> 02:15:19,359
Areyrey... I just killed him bro.

1698
02:15:21,361 --> 02:15:23,279
You should have called me five minutes ego.

1699
02:15:25,781 --> 02:15:32,079
Life will not come back once it is gone. Right, bro.

1700
02:15:32,121 --> 02:15:32,872
Brother in law...

1701
02:15:46,761 --> 02:15:48,137
Why are you silent, bro?

1702
02:15:49,222 --> 02:15:50,931
wondering what that sound is?

1703
02:15:51,891 --> 02:15:55,019
You alone know that I am not scared of anyone.

1704
02:15:55,770 --> 02:16:00,441
Now the entire market will know with this sound.

1705
02:16:01,359 --> 02:16:05,696
Bro... Just keep it in your mind

1706
02:16:06,197 --> 02:16:09,200
I didn’t come here to mess with anyone

1707
02:16:10,034 --> 02:16:14,038
I came here to rule.
I won’t compromise.

1708
02:16:30,263 --> 02:16:31,138
Get in Pushpa!

1709
02:17:14,849 --> 02:17:17,142
Bro... That Mangalam Srinu is coming.

1710
02:17:18,353 --> 02:17:21,356
He is coming here to die today.
Hey... Give me the gun

1711
02:17:21,356 --> 02:17:23,065
Hey Jakka .. you hang on,

1712
02:17:23,983 --> 02:17:25,360
I asked Mangalam Srinu to come.

1713
02:17:25,401 --> 02:17:28,988
If you guys fight here, the entire department will be here,

1714
02:17:29,238 --> 02:17:30,865
and I will get everyone killed in an encounter.

1715
02:17:30,990 --> 02:17:32,783
So Let's settle the matter here...

1716
02:18:03,147 --> 02:18:05,775
I will leave if my brother-in-law’s body is given.

1717
02:18:05,816 --> 02:18:08,319
You can go... but, sit first.

1718
02:18:11,906 --> 02:18:14,700
We were like brothers right.
Then What is this?

1719
02:18:14,784 --> 02:18:17,412
You should ask them all that.
It is they who have started all this.

1720
02:18:17,412 --> 02:18:19,872
What is it about starting?
It will not end till you are killed.

1721
02:18:19,914 --> 02:18:21,832
Hey Jakka. You stop...

1722
02:18:22,207 --> 02:18:24,794
Bro, first ask them why they sold stock to Murugan...

1723
02:18:24,794 --> 02:18:27,922
Yes Bro. They sold the stock to Murugan
without Srinanna’s knowledge

1724
02:18:28,923 --> 02:18:32,635
Jakka, shouldn’t everyone stick to the syndicate?

1725
02:18:32,677 --> 02:18:34,345
Why are you guys doing this?

1726
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:47,066
- How much is this?
- Three crores

1727
02:18:48,401 --> 02:18:50,027
How much? How much did you sell a ton for?

1728
02:18:53,489 --> 02:18:54,615
One and half crore.

1729
02:18:57,452 --> 02:19:00,538
What is this?
Is this true?

1730
02:19:00,538 --> 02:19:02,498
I will give all these calculations later

1731
02:19:03,165 --> 02:19:08,629
but what is this man? You not only killed by brother-in-law,
you are also complaining against me

1732
02:19:08,629 --> 02:19:13,509
Hey, I didn’t kill your brother-in-law.
I killed the person who killed Kondareddy Bro.

1733
02:19:14,301 --> 02:19:17,763
Do you think I will sit silently and watch
when someone attacks Jakkareddy bro with a knife?

1734
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:20,182
I shot him.

1735
02:19:20,265 --> 02:19:22,101
You hold on man
Even I won’t leave.. I will also kill.

1736
02:19:22,101 --> 02:19:24,228
What bro? Looks like both brothers-in-law’s are alike...
Do you think we are scared?

1737
02:19:24,311 --> 02:19:26,481
What, you will kill? that too in front me.

1738
02:19:27,314 --> 02:19:30,109
Why are you giving the gun?
What is this? Why are you silent?

1739
02:19:30,735 --> 02:19:35,656
Bro .. I called him when he was about to kill
my brother-in-law. Still he killed him.

1740
02:19:35,823 --> 02:19:38,493
Maybe you also called five minutes late like me.

1741
02:19:40,035 --> 02:19:41,537
But anyways, both sides have lost right?

1742
02:19:42,455 --> 02:19:46,083
Hey, put that gun away and first explain the calculations.

1743
02:19:48,043 --> 02:19:50,838
Till now you said, 25 lakhs per ton.. right?

1744
02:19:51,255 --> 02:19:52,882
Then how did he get a crore and half now?

1745
02:19:53,257 --> 02:19:54,509
We also asked him the same Sir?

1746
02:19:54,509 --> 02:19:57,470
Had he answered this, we wouldn’t have gone to Murugan
and things wouldn’t have come to this

1747
02:19:57,595 --> 02:20:00,347
This big man has screwed all of us so badly

1748
02:20:01,181 --> 02:20:04,644
What bro Srinu? Why are you silent?
Why don’t you answer when MLA sir is asking you?

1749
02:20:04,769 --> 02:20:07,229
What is this? Should I explain accounts now?

1750
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:09,440
Have you guys forgotten what all I did so far?

1751
02:20:09,607 --> 02:20:12,652
True Bro. Why are you asking
Srinanna accounts now?

1752
02:20:12,943 --> 02:20:14,904
How many people did he manage...?

1753
02:20:14,904 --> 02:20:16,864
How many check-posts he managed?

1754
02:20:16,864 --> 02:20:18,824
Won’t you take all that into account?

1755
02:20:18,824 --> 02:20:21,911
Hello Sir. We are coming there only.

1756
02:20:22,327 --> 02:20:25,289
You are paying off the police.
We are also paying off the police.

1757
02:20:25,372 --> 02:20:28,292
All of you are giving commissions.
Above that, we are also giving commissions

1758
02:20:28,417 --> 02:20:35,049
we are also giving commissions to people
in Forest, revenue, ID... how will it work out?

1759
02:20:35,382 --> 02:20:37,593
We, together should pay them once only.

1760
02:20:37,885 --> 02:20:40,137
Then see how much will we save?

1761
02:20:40,387 --> 02:20:42,222
Twenty-five percent.

1762
02:20:42,515 --> 02:20:43,933
Which we were wasting.

1763
02:20:45,059 --> 02:20:48,813
Just by bypassing Seenanna and going directly
to Murugan, he paid us one and half crore.

1764
02:20:49,104 --> 02:20:53,442
If we all unite and fix a rate,
he will pay two crores at least.

1765
02:20:53,526 --> 02:20:55,152
What? two crores??

1766
02:20:55,194 --> 02:20:57,488
Bro, the story doesn’t stop here...

1767
02:20:57,572 --> 02:21:00,658
There is Chatterjee in Calcutta,
and who is that in Mumbai? Ya.. Singh,

1768
02:21:00,658 --> 02:21:03,744
then Agarwal in Delhi.
I kept more people like them, in line.

1769
02:21:04,537 --> 02:21:08,332
Bro, we have the kind of stock
that is not available anywhere in the world.

1770
02:21:08,332 --> 02:21:10,209
We have it here in Tirupati in our Andhra Pradesh.

1771
02:21:10,459 --> 02:21:12,461
The kind that no one on this earth has.

1772
02:21:12,587 --> 02:21:15,380
With that kind of stock we have,
why should we go and ask them.

1773
02:21:15,380 --> 02:21:18,551
We should demand and create competition
amongst the buyers in the market,

1774
02:21:18,551 --> 02:21:20,595
Then they will buy our stock standing in Queue.

1775
02:21:20,678 --> 02:21:23,388
We may get three crores per ton also.

1776
02:21:24,181 --> 02:21:28,393
If we go by that, our MP sir may get
at least 20 crores as commission.

1777
02:21:32,356 --> 02:21:35,442
Yes, Pushpa said it correctly,

1778
02:21:36,401 --> 02:21:39,655
If we hand over the syndicate to a person like this,
our business will be good

1779
02:21:39,655 --> 02:21:43,283
It’s easy to speak sitting on the shore.

1780
02:21:43,283 --> 02:21:45,661
You will know the depth when you get into the water.

1781
02:21:47,663 --> 02:21:49,915
Pushpa Come man.
Sit down and tell the whole thing to MP sir...

1782
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:57,464
Give me one chance, Sir.

1783
02:21:58,048 --> 02:22:00,885
I will make sure that we see the
kind of profits that we have never seen.

1784
02:22:02,845 --> 02:22:04,221
What are you thinking Sir?

1785
02:22:04,764 --> 02:22:06,140
Are you thinking, where is my confidence is coming from?

1786
02:22:06,849 --> 02:22:09,309
None of the stock I have transported so far was ever caught.

1787
02:22:09,894 --> 02:22:12,813
That is my capital.
Trust me, Sir.

1788
02:22:14,064 --> 02:22:16,776
All of you are going with him just because he sold two tons for more.

1789
02:22:17,234 --> 02:22:20,571
Two people are also dead in the last two months
since he has entered the business,

1790
02:22:21,697 --> 02:22:25,868
just think, how many more dead bodies
will we see In the coming days.

1791
02:22:26,702 --> 02:22:30,539
What bro? do you want to believe everything this
youngster said and put the business in his hands?

1792
02:22:30,539 --> 02:22:34,126
- Bro, I am not totally convinced.
- If we trust him, we all will go bankrupt.

1793
02:22:34,209 --> 02:22:36,671
Yes bro, Even I’m getting doubts

1794
02:22:38,714 --> 02:22:41,175
Everything he did is right in front of our eyes,
can’t you all see it?

1795
02:22:43,052 --> 02:22:45,638
Pushpa will manage the syndicate from now onwards.

1796
02:22:45,888 --> 02:22:48,891
Everyone should sell their stock to Pushpa only.

1797
02:22:54,563 --> 02:22:56,356
We will have an oath taking ceremony in Kanipakam tomorrow.

1798
02:23:02,446 --> 02:23:03,948
Take this cash and go.

1799
02:23:11,831 --> 02:23:15,250
MP Sir, If they give me my brother-in-law’s body,

1800
02:23:15,835 --> 02:23:17,252
I will go home

1801
02:23:17,586 --> 02:23:21,506
Bro, From the time you came in,
you are sitting on his body only.

1802
02:23:21,506 --> 02:23:23,884
We will send his body safely home if you get up.

1803
02:23:24,551 --> 02:23:26,929
Hey Selva, help Seenanna in the preparations.

1804
02:23:26,929 --> 02:23:28,681
Okay Keshava.
Guys come...

1805
02:23:53,914 --> 02:23:56,500
That side is mine... This side is mine...

1806
02:23:56,834 --> 02:23:59,378
The piece of sky above my head is also mine

1807
02:24:04,884 --> 02:24:07,552
That wrong is mine... This right is mine.

1808
02:24:07,762 --> 02:24:10,430
The fire that burns the right and wrong is also me

1809
02:24:15,895 --> 02:24:20,775
The one who can defeat me is not yet born on the earth
Even If he is born, it would be me again

1810
02:24:21,483 --> 02:24:26,280
There is only one who can grow beyond me
And that’s me, myself in the future

1811
02:24:26,864 --> 02:24:29,742
If I twirl, it’s my mustache
And I hold Axe in my hand...

1812
02:24:29,742 --> 02:24:32,619
Whatever I do is the war
And I never negotiate

1813
02:24:35,330 --> 02:24:37,750
Hey Son... This is my bastion

1814
02:24:40,669 --> 02:24:43,338
Hey Son... This is my bastion

1815
02:24:57,019 --> 02:24:58,687
Will throw you in the lake

1816
02:24:59,814 --> 02:25:01,523
And I return with a fish

1817
02:25:02,566 --> 02:25:04,276
Will stick you to a pole

1818
02:25:05,194 --> 02:25:07,112
And I hoist like a flag

1819
02:25:08,113 --> 02:25:10,741
Will bury you in the soil and make you disappear

1820
02:25:10,783 --> 02:25:15,162
I will be found again as an expensive ore

1821
02:25:16,580 --> 02:25:19,041
Hey Son... This is my bastion

1822
02:25:22,127 --> 02:25:24,588
Hey Son... This is my bastion

1823
02:25:27,424 --> 02:25:29,885
Hey Son... This is my bastion

1824
02:25:40,229 --> 02:25:41,396
Open it.

1825
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:16,723
What is this Draccha?

1826
02:26:17,141 --> 02:26:19,518
It is six months since my brother died.

1827
02:26:19,894 --> 02:26:24,481
And you are sleeping like a log since then.
How can you?

1828
02:26:25,107 --> 02:26:26,817
What should I do?

1829
02:26:27,484 --> 02:26:30,404
That Pushpa has grown too big,

1830
02:26:30,654 --> 02:26:32,489
and that MP is also in his side.

1831
02:26:32,907 --> 02:26:36,493
We can’t do anything till the government changes...
We can’t do anything...

1832
02:26:37,036 --> 02:26:41,999
Then you should have waited till the
government changed to send my brother to him.

1833
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:47,337
Did I send him to get killed? I Sent him to kill...

1834
02:26:47,671 --> 02:26:50,799
What should I do if he died because of his incapability?

1835
02:26:52,092 --> 02:26:56,847
If so, you also couldn’t kill him...
Then, why are you still alive?

1836
02:26:56,889 --> 02:26:57,932
What is this Draksha?

1837
02:26:58,348 --> 02:27:00,600
Why are you still alive?

1838
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:15,282
Hey you idiotic Husband...

1839
02:27:15,282 --> 02:27:16,491
Come back if you are alive

1840
02:27:16,491 --> 02:27:18,618
We will together take revenge...

1841
02:27:18,618 --> 02:27:21,746
or else I will go alone and kill him

1842
02:27:21,914 --> 02:27:23,999
Who are you? Who are you?

1843
02:27:24,458 --> 02:27:26,335
I’m the iron I’m the iron

1844
02:27:26,668 --> 02:27:29,129
I will become a knife if I’m put under fire

1845
02:27:32,841 --> 02:27:34,927
Who are you? Who are you?

1846
02:27:35,219 --> 02:27:37,221
I’m the soil I’m the soil

1847
02:27:37,679 --> 02:27:40,307
I will become a brick if you crush me

1848
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:45,896
Who are you? Who are you?

1849
02:27:46,313 --> 02:27:48,315
I’m the rock... I’m the rock.

1850
02:27:50,359 --> 02:27:53,445
Under these circumstances,
Pushpa's marriage muhurat has been fixed.

1851
02:27:53,946 --> 02:27:56,115
Despite lot of happenings,
his mother's hope never gave up hope.

1852
02:27:56,781 --> 02:27:59,326
To give the marriage card she went to the big house.

1853
02:28:19,138 --> 02:28:20,722
It seems that Puspa is getting married on the 11th

1854
02:28:21,723 --> 02:28:23,183
This is not going to happen.

1855
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:29,189
I will become the god for sure If you hurt me.

1856
02:28:29,439 --> 02:28:31,984
Hey Son... This is my bastion

1857
02:28:35,070 --> 02:28:37,614
Hey Son... This is my bastion

1858
02:28:40,075 --> 02:28:42,619
Hey Son... This is my bastion

1859
02:28:45,914 --> 02:28:48,458
Hey Son... This is my bastion

1860
02:29:00,262 --> 02:29:07,019
With regret, Govindappa resigns and leaves,
claiming responsibility for Bhujanga's murder

1861
02:29:08,312 --> 02:29:13,150
Even though Jalreddy wants take revenge badly,
he was not in a state to get up.

1862
02:29:13,775 --> 02:29:17,988
Burning with vengeance, Dakshayani was left helpless...

1863
02:29:20,615 --> 02:29:24,286
when everyone thought that no one can touch Pushpa.

1864
02:29:25,829 --> 02:29:30,000
The new person arrived.
And the whole story changed

1865
02:29:57,111 --> 02:29:58,653
SP... Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat

1866
02:29:59,029 --> 02:30:01,906
There is nothing to say about him...
you are going to witness him.

1867
02:30:46,660 --> 02:30:47,786
It is strong

1868
02:30:48,453 --> 02:30:50,414
- Is it Sheelavathi or what?
- Yes sir...

1869
02:30:51,248 --> 02:30:51,915
Come!

1870
02:31:04,928 --> 02:31:08,265
Kupparaju, Sheelavathi is strong

1871
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:10,225
You get good quality here, Sir

1872
02:31:12,186 --> 02:31:14,062
That’s why I got asleep,

1873
02:31:17,982 --> 02:31:23,405
it came and It will come.

1874
02:31:24,448 --> 02:31:27,492
That’s why I’m falling asleep... I will sleep.

1875
02:31:42,966 --> 02:31:45,552
- Did you give this to me?
- yes sir

1876
02:31:46,928 --> 02:31:49,348
- What is your name?
- Mallesh sir.

1877
02:31:49,723 --> 02:31:51,516
- What?
- Mallesh sir.

1878
02:32:17,209 --> 02:32:18,585
What is your name?

1879
02:32:20,128 --> 02:32:23,757
De... De...

1880
02:32:26,009 --> 02:32:27,135
Devaraju Sir...

1881
02:32:31,556 --> 02:32:34,684
Sir... Sir... Sir... SP sir...

1882
02:32:35,101 --> 02:32:37,771
Heard, that you arrested 12 cannabis smugglers.
How? Sir...

1883
02:32:38,021 --> 02:32:40,399
10 people, not 12...

1884
02:32:40,565 --> 02:32:42,901
two fled...

1885
02:32:42,942 --> 02:32:44,569
They did not run away...
they were killed.

1886
02:32:44,569 --> 02:32:45,362
Shut up!

1887
02:32:45,362 --> 02:32:47,030
Sir... sir... did you kill them?

1888
02:32:47,071 --> 02:32:51,951
Sir... he says they were exactly 12 people...
we also have the same information. Where are the other two?

1889
02:32:51,951 --> 02:32:53,745
Sir... sir... they were killed sir... killed sir...

1890
02:32:53,787 --> 02:33:00,585
Didn’t I say that two of them have fled? He is a smuggler...
He doesn’t know the math. I will teach him now

1891
02:33:00,794 --> 02:33:02,212
Sir... what they are saying, is true?

1892
02:33:02,504 --> 02:33:03,755
Sir Media is asking

1893
02:33:03,963 --> 02:33:08,927
The new SP has come. I’m going to give him the card.
I will meet you once on the way.

1894
02:33:08,968 --> 02:33:10,887
Why do you want to meet?

1895
02:33:11,179 --> 02:33:12,681
I just want to talk

1896
02:33:12,722 --> 02:33:15,267
Just talk?
Will you sit silently once you come?

1897
02:33:15,267 --> 02:33:17,018
A lot will happen after that

1898
02:33:17,394 --> 02:33:20,104
I just want to talk to you and leave.
I will just talk and leave

1899
02:33:20,188 --> 02:33:24,984
What? You will see and go is it,
as if I don’t know what you will do.

1900
02:33:26,445 --> 02:33:30,949
You will tempt me and leave.
I will go sleepless after that.

1901
02:33:31,032 --> 02:33:32,701
Dear, why are you objecting when I say that
I will meet you and once and leave?

1902
02:33:32,701 --> 02:33:33,660
Hey... Where are you going?

1903
02:33:33,660 --> 02:33:34,661
I have a small work

1904
02:33:34,869 --> 02:33:37,664
Hey... You should not go out of home
once we make you a bridegroom.

1905
02:33:37,664 --> 02:33:40,500
Not good for the home.
You tell him, dear

1906
02:33:40,792 --> 02:33:43,044
What... what is this old woman’s torture?

1907
02:33:43,044 --> 02:33:46,423
Dear... Listen to what I’m telling you...
I don’t know why but my mind is suspecting harm.

1908
02:33:46,423 --> 02:33:47,131
You talk.

1909
02:33:47,131 --> 02:33:49,426
This is the first holy occasion
happening in my life, my dear son...

1910
02:33:49,759 --> 02:33:51,135
Pushpa, listen to me.

1911
02:33:52,804 --> 02:33:53,472
Pushpa.

1912
02:33:53,972 --> 02:33:54,681
Come...

1913
02:33:59,018 --> 02:34:01,521
This is the First-time meeting
with the newly appointed SP.

1914
02:34:01,938 --> 02:34:02,397
Sir...

1915
02:34:02,939 --> 02:34:03,982
I brought coffee

1916
02:34:03,982 --> 02:34:04,816
Keep it there

1917
02:34:05,191 --> 02:34:07,944
Had to bend to see him.

1918
02:34:15,159 --> 02:34:16,411
He is only Pushpa Sir.

1919
02:34:16,495 --> 02:34:17,579
I told you about.

1920
02:34:17,871 --> 02:34:20,164
He looks after the entire red sandal syndicate.

1921
02:34:20,707 --> 02:34:22,876
He came to see you, Sir.

1922
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:26,963
Hello SP... What is your name?

1923
02:34:27,297 --> 02:34:31,593
Ban... var sing Skiva... skyavathaa

1924
02:34:32,552 --> 02:34:33,678
whatever it is...

1925
02:34:34,888 --> 02:34:37,891
I am getting married on 11th.

1926
02:34:37,974 --> 02:34:39,309
Somehow you...

1927
02:34:41,436 --> 02:34:44,105
should manage and come.

1928
02:34:46,941 --> 02:34:48,192
This is this month’s commission...

1929
02:34:48,610 --> 02:34:49,403
One crore rupees.

1930
02:35:54,551 --> 02:35:57,095
One short!

1931
02:35:59,556 --> 02:36:01,015
One short

1932
02:36:01,975 --> 02:36:02,642
Sir?

1933
02:36:03,435 --> 02:36:04,894
One short

1934
02:36:05,061 --> 02:36:07,063
No Sir, it is all correct.

1935
02:36:13,487 --> 02:36:14,946
One short

1936
02:36:18,366 --> 02:36:19,325
Guys, come on...

1937
02:36:23,955 --> 02:36:27,542
Shall I tell what is the difference
between thief and Police.

1938
02:36:27,959 --> 02:36:30,962
He wore a white shirt... I too wore a white shirt,

1939
02:36:31,045 --> 02:36:35,091
and both look similar... but there is a difference.

1940
02:36:37,135 --> 02:36:40,013
This one has a half-inch sticker. Look...

1941
02:36:41,222 --> 02:36:42,098
It is there sir.

1942
02:36:42,724 --> 02:36:43,850
That is a brand.

1943
02:36:45,477 --> 02:36:46,686
you know what brand is right

1944
02:36:46,686 --> 02:36:47,562
Yes Sir.

1945
02:36:48,688 --> 02:36:52,484
In Telugu, you call it (Surname) Illi Peru

1946
02:36:53,443 --> 02:36:54,193
No sir.

1947
02:36:55,194 --> 02:36:56,195
Illu Peru

1948
02:36:56,195 --> 02:36:57,113
No Sir

1949
02:36:57,822 --> 02:36:58,782
Inti peru (surname)...

1950
02:36:59,073 --> 02:36:59,741
Yes sir.

1951
02:37:00,283 --> 02:37:02,035
It is like a surname...

1952
02:37:03,620 --> 02:37:06,414
It means a stamp that tells who manufactured this...

1953
02:37:07,582 --> 02:37:10,585
who gave birth.
That stamp

1954
02:37:14,047 --> 02:37:17,258
This one has the stamp,

1955
02:37:18,927 --> 02:37:20,136
That’s why it has value.

1956
02:37:21,387 --> 02:37:25,349
That one doesn’t have hence it doesn’t have value.

1957
02:37:27,435 --> 02:37:29,103
The count is right sir.

1958
02:37:30,354 --> 02:37:32,482
There is One short.

1959
02:37:35,610 --> 02:37:40,073
If we have a value, we will know the
value of the other person.

1960
02:37:42,450 --> 02:37:44,243
Tell us your value sir...

1961
02:37:44,452 --> 02:37:45,286
we will pay.

1962
02:37:45,704 --> 02:37:47,539
- Mr. Kuppu Raju...
- Sir!

1963
02:37:48,582 --> 02:37:49,541
Handcuff him.

1964
02:37:58,717 --> 02:38:02,136
If I arrest you now and charge you with PD act,

1965
02:38:02,846 --> 02:38:04,598
do you know how many years you will you be jailed?

1966
02:38:04,848 --> 02:38:05,682
Three years Sir.

1967
02:38:05,807 --> 02:38:06,725
Three years...

1968
02:38:07,058 --> 02:38:08,434
Your wedding on the 11th, right?

1969
02:38:08,560 --> 02:38:13,523
If you go to jail now, when will you get married?

1970
02:38:14,691 --> 02:38:16,359
After three years...

1971
02:38:16,735 --> 02:38:22,741
It means when you will get married...
I will decide.

1972
02:38:25,869 --> 02:38:28,287
If your marriage happen...

1973
02:38:29,998 --> 02:38:34,293
When will your wife become pregnant...

1974
02:38:34,961 --> 02:38:37,046
After one month...

1975
02:38:38,464 --> 02:38:39,758
a man

1976
02:38:40,424 --> 02:38:42,093
Pushpa is a man...

1977
02:38:44,220 --> 02:38:47,265
If you go to jail then if she becomes pregnant.

1978
02:38:51,770 --> 02:38:52,937
Are you laughing, right?

1979
02:38:56,149 --> 02:38:58,693
What? tightening fists?

1980
02:38:59,903 --> 02:39:00,987
Getting angry?

1981
02:39:02,530 --> 02:39:03,364
open it... open it

1982
02:39:05,033 --> 02:39:07,661
You don’t have that much luxury with police...

1983
02:39:07,827 --> 02:39:10,246
Open your hands... Open your fist...

1984
02:39:11,372 --> 02:39:12,248
Open your fist

1985
02:39:18,337 --> 02:39:19,213
Open your fist

1986
02:39:21,049 --> 02:39:21,966
Shh!

1987
02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:24,260
Did you get what was short?

1988
02:39:29,140 --> 02:39:30,767
Hey, you guys hold on.

1989
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:39,067
Pushpa’s count never wrong.

1990
02:39:42,403 --> 02:39:44,906
Tell me what is short for you sir...

1991
02:39:45,907 --> 02:39:46,658
What?

1992
02:39:48,159 --> 02:39:51,079
What is short for you please tell me sir?

1993
02:39:51,370 --> 02:39:52,205
What?

1994
02:39:59,713 --> 02:40:05,051
What is short for you please tell me sir?

1995
02:40:05,051 --> 02:40:05,927
Sir...

1996
02:40:08,137 --> 02:40:10,014
That was short.

1997
02:40:10,807 --> 02:40:20,316
I told you one short; one short right. ‘Sir’, was short.

1998
02:40:21,150 --> 02:40:23,653
shouldn’t say... “You should attend the wedding”.

1999
02:40:24,528 --> 02:40:28,992
You should say “attend the wedding Sir”.

2000
02:40:33,329 --> 02:40:35,039
- Mr. Kuppuraju...
- Sir...

2001
02:40:35,456 --> 02:40:36,540
Uncuff him.

2002
02:40:39,627 --> 02:40:40,754
Now the count is correct.

2003
02:40:41,838 --> 02:40:43,006
Bag... bag... bag...

2004
02:40:43,798 --> 02:40:48,219
from now on, along with the cash, sir also should come.

2005
02:40:50,179 --> 02:40:56,269
How much sir should take and
how much you will get will be decided by sir.

2006
02:40:56,770 --> 02:40:59,313
Shekhawat sir will decide.

2007
02:41:04,778 --> 02:41:05,403
Pushpa!

2008
02:41:10,491 --> 02:41:11,951
This is my gift for your wedding.

2009
02:41:13,369 --> 02:41:15,747
Buy clothes... branded ones.

2010
02:41:18,291 --> 02:41:19,500
I gave you a gift.

2011
02:41:21,210 --> 02:41:22,586
Won’t you give me a party, Pushpa?

2012
02:41:22,921 --> 02:41:24,130
Don’t know why?

2013
02:41:24,630 --> 02:41:27,591
Pushpa used to do whatever
Shekakavat said from then onwards.

2014
02:41:28,217 --> 02:41:29,928
He used to follow his orders religiously.

2015
02:41:29,928 --> 02:41:32,555
Never seen Pushpa bend before anyone till then.

2016
02:41:33,056 --> 02:41:35,224
This is the first time he was doing so.

2017
02:41:35,641 --> 02:41:37,936
We used to wonder why he is behaving like that.

2018
02:41:39,187 --> 02:41:43,066
That day, a little before Pushpa’s wedding muhurtham,

2019
02:41:43,066 --> 02:41:44,776
Priest called for the bridegroom.

2020
02:41:46,778 --> 02:41:47,904
When we went in to call him,

2021
02:41:49,238 --> 02:41:50,239
Pushpa was not there.

2022
02:41:50,949 --> 02:41:52,033
Even his motorcycle was also not there.

2023
02:42:01,793 --> 02:42:04,212
Wow!! What is this Sir?

2024
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:08,132
What is this Sir?

2025
02:42:08,382 --> 02:42:10,218
Never thought you have a funny side too, Sir.

2026
02:42:11,970 --> 02:42:16,224
Singing like a Romeo...

2027
02:42:16,599 --> 02:42:21,520
But that day you scared me with a mask of a tiger.

2028
02:42:21,980 --> 02:42:23,606
Had to scare Pushpa.

2029
02:42:24,190 --> 02:42:27,735
Only then you came know how to behave with me.

2030
02:42:28,194 --> 02:42:31,655
See now we are drinking together happily.

2031
02:42:32,907 --> 02:42:33,908
Where is Pushpa?

2032
02:42:33,908 --> 02:42:36,577
Where did he go?
Auspicious time is nearing...

2033
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:42,208
Not able to connect. Calling him
Call him again.

2034
02:42:43,542 --> 02:42:46,462
What Pushpa? Today is your wedding, right?

2035
02:42:47,130 --> 02:42:49,007
And you are here only. Is it ok?

2036
02:42:49,715 --> 02:42:50,716
Sir!

2037
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:56,555
The wedding can happen.
The bride will be there even if I go half an hour late.

2038
02:42:57,807 --> 02:43:02,603
But you Shekhawat Sir, gave me time to meet you.

2039
02:43:03,479 --> 02:43:05,564
What is more important than that?

2040
02:43:06,399 --> 02:43:09,152
When you referred to the wedding,
I remembered one thing.

2041
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:15,950
You said, you will decide when my wife should get pregnant,
and at what time she should get pregnant.

2042
02:43:17,243 --> 02:43:19,787
Why did you say that Sir?
I felt very bad.

2043
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:24,042
Tell me why did you say that Sir?

2044
02:43:24,625 --> 02:43:27,170
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

2045
02:43:27,586 --> 02:43:28,922
Why all that now.

2046
02:43:29,839 --> 02:43:30,506
It’s ok sir.

2047
02:43:31,049 --> 02:43:33,676
You must have said that to hurt me.

2048
02:43:34,343 --> 02:43:35,553
That’s it, right sir? Leave it.

2049
02:43:36,804 --> 02:43:37,680
But...

2050
02:43:39,515 --> 02:43:45,813
I didn’t like the way you insulted my mother Sir

2051
02:43:46,272 --> 02:43:48,441
What did I say about your mother Pushpa?

2052
02:43:49,608 --> 02:43:54,322
You know that I don’t have a surname right, Sir?

2053
02:43:56,532 --> 02:44:00,453
In spite of that, you insulted me
by saying who manufactured me...

2054
02:44:00,453 --> 02:44:05,749
who gave birth.
Stamp, Stamp... this... that. Right Sir?

2055
02:44:06,584 --> 02:44:08,836
What is this Pushpa?
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

2056
02:44:09,545 --> 02:44:10,838
Why all that now?

2057
02:44:12,090 --> 02:44:17,345
When someone speaks about my surname,
it is like insulting my birth.

2058
02:44:18,512 --> 02:44:20,723
And if someone insults my birth...

2059
02:44:22,266 --> 02:44:24,352
it is like insulting my mother.

2060
02:44:25,644 --> 02:44:30,733
Since birth every Idiot has insulted me with this, Sir.

2061
02:44:31,234 --> 02:44:32,026
Pushpa.

2062
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:34,487
You are drunk and speaking nonsense.

2063
02:44:34,487 --> 02:44:35,821
You are tipsy?

2064
02:44:38,491 --> 02:44:41,369
Yes Sir, I had more.

2065
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:44,080
In your gun one thing is more.

2066
02:44:44,163 --> 02:44:45,081
What is it?

2067
02:44:45,915 --> 02:44:51,921
Like you, I don’t know how to put
in suspense saying One is more...

2068
02:44:52,505 --> 02:44:54,298
There one extra bullet in that sir.

2069
02:44:57,510 --> 02:44:58,177
In this?

2070
02:44:58,594 --> 02:44:59,428
Yes!

2071
02:44:59,678 --> 02:45:00,304
Give me!

2072
02:45:02,473 --> 02:45:04,558
One, two, three, four.

2073
02:45:05,268 --> 02:45:07,686
There are six Sir...
Did you notice it? One is more

2074
02:45:07,937 --> 02:45:09,563
That is Service revolver Pushpa.

2075
02:45:10,189 --> 02:45:11,899
It will have Six bullets only.

2076
02:45:13,026 --> 02:45:18,197
That day when I tightened my fists hearing your words,
you aimed this gun at me right, Sir.

2077
02:45:18,906 --> 02:45:22,035
The bullet that had to go into this remained in this only.

2078
02:45:22,201 --> 02:45:23,202
That one is more

2079
02:45:50,980 --> 02:45:52,648
Do you know what this is Sir?

2080
02:45:54,525 --> 02:45:57,445
This is my father’s blood which is flowing in my body.

2081
02:45:59,113 --> 02:46:06,037
My father gave me this even before
my brothers could snatch the surname from me.

2082
02:46:08,122 --> 02:46:10,708
No one can separate this from me.

2083
02:46:11,584 --> 02:46:12,876
This...

2084
02:46:13,544 --> 02:46:16,714
This is my brand, Sir...

2085
02:46:32,230 --> 02:46:34,315
Hey, Shekhawat sir... Idiot

2086
02:46:34,773 --> 02:46:38,486
What? did you think I am of a brand
that will get scared of bullet?

2087
02:46:39,278 --> 02:46:42,906
This brand has grown with its own attitude.

2088
02:46:43,991 --> 02:46:49,580
Do you know why Pushpa was silent
that day when you said all that?

2089
02:46:50,539 --> 02:46:52,291
My mother didn’t have a wedding in her life.

2090
02:46:53,417 --> 02:46:57,630
This is the first wedding happening in our house.

2091
02:46:58,839 --> 02:47:03,136
I stopped myself till this hour,
thinking my mother will feel bad if anything happens.

2092
02:47:04,887 --> 02:47:07,473
Now I won’t hold myself back.

2093
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:08,682
Greetings!

2094
02:47:09,433 --> 02:47:10,684
Jakka, Sit down.

2095
02:47:15,856 --> 02:47:18,192
Keshava, Where is Pushpa?

2096
02:47:18,234 --> 02:47:22,196
you are not understanding what you are doing

2097
02:47:22,405 --> 02:47:25,783
What is there to understand?
I'll strip you.

2098
02:47:26,284 --> 02:47:28,035
Take it off.

2099
02:47:31,455 --> 02:47:33,874
Pushpa, do you know with whom you are confronting?

2100
02:47:35,418 --> 02:47:37,211
Bhanwar Singh.

2101
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:39,963
Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat

2102
02:47:40,298 --> 02:47:41,340
Is it?

2103
02:47:42,091 --> 02:47:43,551
Then remove your pants also

2104
02:47:43,842 --> 02:47:44,760
Why this?

2105
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:51,267
Pushpa stripped Shekhawat sir’s clothes
and made him stand stark naked...

2106
02:47:51,517 --> 02:47:53,686
imagine how great feels...

2107
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:56,605
Take it off.

2108
02:48:28,512 --> 02:48:32,266
Did you understand now? Everyone will feel
the same way when you strip them.

2109
02:48:32,891 --> 02:48:37,020
Either it is Shekhawat Sir or Pushpa.

2110
02:48:38,189 --> 02:48:41,317
You don’t have clothes on your body.
I don’t have clothes on my body.

2111
02:48:41,317 --> 02:48:43,486
But there is one difference, do you know it?

2112
02:48:44,237 --> 02:48:46,822
Pushpa started his life like this.

2113
02:48:47,573 --> 02:48:51,034
Do you know what was his range when he was a coolie?

2114
02:48:56,374 --> 02:48:57,958
This was his range

2115
02:48:58,709 --> 02:49:01,670
The range that was then is the same now.

2116
02:49:01,879 --> 02:49:05,299
See, If I go on the road like this also,
they will call me Pushpa.

2117
02:49:05,383 --> 02:49:09,470
If you go on the road like this without a police uniform...

2118
02:49:09,678 --> 02:49:12,640
even your dog won’t recognize you.

2119
02:49:14,558 --> 02:49:18,812
Brand is not in the clothes you wear.
It is in your living

2120
02:49:23,651 --> 02:49:25,110
Hey Shekhawat Sir...

2121
02:49:25,444 --> 02:49:27,196
please keep this in your mind

2122
02:49:28,281 --> 02:49:31,950
The load that has to go will go and the
money 'has to come will keep coming

2123
02:49:31,950 --> 02:49:33,577
You won’t get a rupee.

2124
02:49:34,370 --> 02:49:38,457
You will have just the uniform on your body
but you won’t have work to do.

2125
02:49:39,250 --> 02:49:45,088
You will only have ‘Sir’.
I will remove everything else

2126
02:49:45,673 --> 02:49:46,840
See you.

2127
02:50:06,235 --> 02:50:11,240
(Sanskrit Sloka)

2128
02:50:51,405 --> 02:50:53,532
Sorry, Sir... Your dog is not recognising you.

2129
02:50:53,824 --> 02:50:55,242
Hey, keep quiet.

2130
02:51:11,008 --> 02:51:12,009
What, dear?

2131
02:51:12,426 --> 02:51:14,470
What is this attire?
Why did you come like this?

2132
02:51:14,553 --> 02:51:15,679
What happened?

2133
02:51:36,992 --> 02:51:39,995
Someone thought Pushpa means flower.

2134
02:51:44,375 --> 02:51:46,835
I showed him that Pushpa means fire.

2135
02:51:47,753 --> 02:51:50,172
Ok. It’s all over, right?

2136
02:51:53,551 --> 02:51:55,344
Just started

2137
02:51:55,928 --> 02:51:56,804
What happened sir?

2138
02:51:58,806 --> 02:52:00,098
Pushpa!

2139
02:52:04,603 --> 02:52:06,647
Whoever comes...

2140
02:52:08,982 --> 02:52:10,734
Will not budge.
