1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,990
NYGMA: You have five
minutes, quiz kids.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,210
Wayne Enterprises
runs Indian Hill,

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,020
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,470
FRANK: A weapon is en route
to destroy the city.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,900
I can't take on
Nygma and Barbara

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,360
and the rest of them by myself.

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,910
Said you wanted
to build an army, right?

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,580
What about an army of freaks?

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,950
Who ordered the hit
on my father?

11
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,150
Frank Gordon.

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,580
Your uncle.

13
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,010
You have the right
to remain silent.

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,560
Dock 9C.

15
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,430
It's where the weapon
will be arriving.

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,760
Jim, do I hear
a favor coming on?

17
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,200
What is coming into.

18
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,100
Dock 9C?

19
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,000
Now I know who I am...

20
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,530
I'm the Riddler.

21
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,470
It's good to see you, too.

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,100
How'd things go with Selina?

23
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,570
This... is what I was made for.

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,940
The clone is in place.

25
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,510
Good evening, Alfred.

26
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,950
And to you, Master Bruce.

27
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,750
FRANK: You need to join
the Court of Owls, Jim.

28
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,650
A woman named Kathryn
is going to call.

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,080
He would have been
so proud of you.

30
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,110
No!

31
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,920
Kathryn, I presume.

32
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,190
I killed my uncle.

33
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,590
I make no apologies for it.

34
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,860
Maybe it's time we meet.

35
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,560
My thought exactly.

36
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,560
Hello?!

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,130
Anyone home?

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,630
When this guy gets home, we got
to ask him to kick on the heat.

39
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,530
It's colder in here
than it is out there.

40
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,970
Fascinating.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,570
I know you're hell-bent
on getting revenge

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,670
on Nygma and all,

43
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,710
and forming an army of freaks
is a great plan, I mean,

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,040
it was my idea, but...

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,250
Shh! Quiet.

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,580
I think I hear something.

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,010
Do you think it's him?

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,030
Mr. Fries.

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Welcome home.

50
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,270
I see you still hold me
responsible

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,110
for all of that
awful monster rhetoric

52
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,540
I spewed during my campaign.

53
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,680
You ran people like me
out of Gotham.

54
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,150
We both know
I only said those things

55
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,650
because that's
what the voters wanted to hear.

56
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,650
Your experiments, Mr. Fries.

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,990
You're trying to reverse
your condition, aren't you?

58
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,120
I can help you.

59
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,290
And why would you do that?

60
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,760
My enemies took
everything from me.

61
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,830
Tried to murder me.

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,170
You help me get my revenge,

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,030
and when I take back
my throne, I will give you

64
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,870
every resource you need to free
yourself from this icy prison.

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,640
Even if I wanted to say yes,

66
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,910
I can only survive
a few hours outside the cold

67
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,780
without my suit.

68
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,920
And you don't have it
because it's been locked away

69
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,050
in a Wayne Enterprises
black site

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,590
ever since you escaped
Indian Hill.

71
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,760
Ivy?

72
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,590
Oh.

73
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,330
Ta-da.

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,830
My suit.

75
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,000
So, Mr. Fries,
will you join us?

76
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,610
â™ª

77
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,020
Where are we?

78
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,260
Where we are
is not important, James.

79
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,330
What matters is why you're here.

80
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,230
You know why I killed my uncle.

81
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,200
Yes, I do.

82
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,070
Frank murdered your father.

83
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,010
What I need to know
is if you hold us accountable

84
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,640
for his action.

85
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,210
Frank acted alone.

86
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,680
He admitted as much to me.

87
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,910
Good.

88
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,820
Then we can proceed.

89
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,290
The city needs you now
more than ever, James.

90
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,860
There's turmoil ahead,

91
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,990
and good men like you
are going to be needed

92
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,230
to hold it together.

93
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,030
But make no mistake,

94
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,400
the Court, and the Court alone,
can save Gotham.

95
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,940
So what do you want me to do?

96
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,970
Prove your loyalty to the Court.

97
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,240
Killing my uncle wasn't enough?

98
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,840
That was between you and Frank.

99
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,010
It had nothing to do with us.

100
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,410
When the time is right,

101
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,050
we will call upon you.

102
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,350
And Frank's body?

103
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,850
It's still in the brownstone.

104
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,650
We've already taken care of it.

105
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,130
Who's the stiff?

106
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,100
Jim's uncle, Frank Gordon.

107
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,200
Never met him.

108
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,400
They were estranged.

109
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,870
Have you seen Jim?

110
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,470
He's working a case.

111
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,040
Or he's walking in the door

112
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,240
as we speak.

113
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,740
Hey, Jim. Come in,

114
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,470
we, uh, have
some bad news for you.

115
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,440
What's going on?

116
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,480
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,880
We found your uncle's body
this morning.

118
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,980
He was pulled out of the harbor.

119
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,950
I did my prelim.
The burns on his left temple

120
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,350
suggest he was shot
at close range.

121
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,920
Lab is running ballistics.

122
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,290
You saw him at the cemetery
yesterday.

123
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,330
He seemed on edge.

124
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,330
Did he say anything?

125
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,030
No. He, uh,

126
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,200
just stopped by to
pay his respects.

127
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,070
We didn't talk much.

128
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,070
Thanks, Lee.
I'll take it from here.

129
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,840
That's it?
That's your reaction?

130
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,840
What do you want me to say?

131
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,910
I know you.

132
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,950
You're hiding something.
You know something.

133
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,210
Lee, come on.
The man just lost his uncle.

134
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,050
Yeah, Harvey, you just
keep covering for him.

135
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,780
My condolences.

136
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,520
She's right. You do know
something, don't you?

137
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,090
Uncle Frank shot himself.

138
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,230
Said it was the only way
to get me inside the Court.

139
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,960
Did it work?

140
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,170
I met with a woman
named Kathryn.

141
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,970
She says I have to prove
my loyalty to the Court first.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,170
Look, I see the need
for playing it cool.

143
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,110
But right now,
the Court's readying a weapon

144
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,310
that could destroy the city.

145
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,210
We don't have time to sit
on our thumbs and do nothing.

146
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,280
I don't like it any more than
you do, but if I push too hard,

147
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,080
we might blow the only chance
we have at stopping this.

148
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,490
And Uncle Frank
will have died in vain.

149
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,390
Okay, so what do we do now?

150
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,230
Kathryn said
to get back to work.

151
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,360
Keep up appearances.

152
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,360
That shouldn't be too hard.

153
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,460
Look who resurfaced.

154
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,200
Hello?

155
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,940
Ed?

156
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,210
It's Barbara.

157
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,340
Your old friend
you've been blowing off.

158
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,980
I'll allow you to call me Ed

159
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,380
'cause we have history.

160
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,420
But my name...

161
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,420
is the Riddler.

162
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,860
So the headlines say.

163
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,290
Now, why are you here?

164
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,160
When Penguin was mayor,

165
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,430
did he mention
a mysterious group?

166
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,900
One that controlled
the levers of power in Gotham

167
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,330
from the shadows

168
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,170
with total impunity?

169
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,340
No.

170
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,040
See, I didn't claw my way
to the top

171
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,240
only to find out
there was someone above me.

172
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,840
I've been trying to find out
who they are,

173
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,280
but no one in this town seems
to know anything about them.

174
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,580
And how is it
that you know about them?

175
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,920
Jim Gordon put me onto them.

176
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,890
And what is his interest
in all this?

177
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,190
He didn't say.

178
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,930
But he did ask me
to investigate a shipment

179
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,430
coming into Dock 9C yesterday.

180
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,500
The harbormaster was protecting

181
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,930
a crate from Indian Hill.

182
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,000
What was inside?
I don't know.

183
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,470
Before I got a chance to
find out, some masked assassin

184
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,970
slaughtered half my men.

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,210
What do you know?

186
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,210
When I was at Indian Hill,

187
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,020
Professor Strange hinted at
some powerful, secret group,

188
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,890
but he didn't tell
me who they were.

189
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,190
This is the one riddle
that got away.

190
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,390
I will get you
the answer you seek.

191
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,000
But I will do it in my own way.

192
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,970
You're gonna make a big
production of this, aren't you?

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,110
Only someone with
power and connections

194
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,110
would have information
on this group.

195
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,310
I need to speak
with Gotham's elite.

196
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,050
And nothing brings out
the bourgeoisie quite like

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,050
opening night at the theater.

198
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,320
Where wilt thou lead me?

199
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,050
Speak,

200
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,250
for I will go no further.

201
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,130
I say, Ghost,

202
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,200
speak your business

203
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,070
or I shall

204
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,310
go no further!

205
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,280
My business

206
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,710
is not with you,
Prince of Denmark.

207
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,210
But with your audience.

208
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,560
I've come to address you,

209
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,290
the ruling class of Gotham.

210
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,400
You've kept a secret
for far too long.

211
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,400
But tonight

212
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,070
I will kidnap and torture
one of you

213
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,400
to expose the truth.

214
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,140
So, spread the word
to all your friends,

215
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,310
the Riddler is coming.

216
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,620
Also, I found your performance
to be wooden

217
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,950
and Unrealistic.

218
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,290
And scene.

219
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,650
And that, my old mucker,

220
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,610
is checkmate.

221
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,390
Good game, Alfred.

222
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,190
You let me win, didn't you,
Master Bruce?

223
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,390
No way, Alfred.

224
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,730
No way, my foot.

225
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,460
That's very unlike you,
isn't it?

226
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,160
And to be honest, I mean,

227
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,600
you haven't been yourself
these past few days, have you?

228
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,740
I don't know what
you're talking about.

229
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,730
I think you do know what
I'm talking about, so come on.

230
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,670
Out with it.

231
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,650
The other day when I came home,

232
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,380
you asked how things were
with Selina.

233
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,380
I made it sound like
things were hopeful.

234
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,460
I lied.

235
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,520
She said she never wanted
to see me again.

236
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,460
I was embarrassed.

237
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,130
I was afraid you'd ask me
about seeing Selina,

238
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,400
and I'd lie and...

239
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,800
I just didn't want
to talk about it.

240
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,640
Well, then...
I understand, Master B.

241
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,340
And thank you very much
for being so candid.

242
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,550
And I really wouldn't worry
about Ms. Kyle.

243
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,090
You know, time has a way
of sorting these things out,

244
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
doesn't it?

245
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,490
Talking of which,
I should check on the dinner.

246
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,100
Alfred.

247
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,660
Sir?

248
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,330
Thank you.

249
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,300
You're a good friend.

250
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,140
Glad to hear it, sir.

251
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,470
It's me.

252
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,630
It's happening again.

253
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,670
Hey.

254
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,440
So, the audience
has been accounted for.

255
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,710
Uh, is this Hamlet?

256
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,880
I guess he wasn't meant to be.

257
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,880
You crossed paths
with Nygma recently.

258
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,420
Any idea what this secret is
he's talking about?

259
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,720
No, I have no clue.

260
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,390
My guess is he just made it up.

261
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,720
Captain, we got the all clear.

262
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,190
All right.

263
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,670
This is all that's in there.

264
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,220
It's a riddle.

265
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,650
Shocker.

266
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,460
Written in iambic pentameter
like a Shakespearean sonnet.

267
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,430
"I am a man who holds
a high position,

268
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,700
"Who shows two faces
to all those he rules,

269
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,600
"A fraud, criminal,
and sometime politician.

270
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,270
Gotham, my constituency
of fools."

271
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,510
A two-faced politician

272
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,340
whose constituency is Gotham.
The mayor?

273
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,350
"Fraud, criminal" sounds
like he's describing Penguin,

274
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,910
but that doesn't make any sense.

275
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,550
Ed told Lucius
he killed Penguin.

276
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,220
Aubrey James.

277
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,650
He was recently reinstated
and he's been mayor before.

278
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,420
"Sometime politician,"
but why not just grab him?

279
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,830
Why tell us in advance?

280
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,490
Because Nygma wants
to make a show of it

281
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,260
and make us look bad
in the process.

282
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,300
Call the mayor's office.

283
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,860
Tell him we're on our way.

284
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,340
We don't need Nygma
for anything.

285
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,610
He should be dead by now.

286
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,510
He's obsessed with
finding the answer,

287
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,440
which is an easy
solution for us.

288
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,410
Once he does,
we'll get rid of him.

289
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,810
I promise.

290
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,980
And how's him causing a scene
at the theater help us?

291
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,250
It doesn't.

292
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,850
But it does help me more

293
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,660
fully announce myself
on the Gotham stage.

294
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,460
If you'll forgive the pun.

295
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,500
Do you want to become famous?

296
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,460
Try dying.

297
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,570
I can help you with that.

298
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,570
Okay, that's enough.

299
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,440
What actually is your plan?

300
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,670
Kidnap Mayor James.

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,010
The man ran this place
for ten years.

302
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,750
If anyone knows about this
mysterious group, he does.

303
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,010
You could've just said that.

304
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
I could've had him here,
being tortured.

305
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,450
Okay. See, but first
I had to tell the GCPD

306
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,050
what I was going to do.

307
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,660
How else am I
supposed to properly

308
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,660
embarrass them publicly?

309
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,630
My crimes must
live up to my name,

310
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,630
and this is no exception.

311
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,930
And what if the mayor

312
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,670
doesn't know anything
about this group?

313
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,000
Hmm? What then?

314
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,640
I have a plan B
to smoke them out,

315
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,740
but first...
I need something from you.

316
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,740
There's a biker bar on the
corner of Spaulding and Eighth.

317
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,510
It's full of brawlers, lowlifes.

318
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,350
I need a bomb

319
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,380
to detonate there.

320
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,390
Tonight.

321
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,750
I'll let you know when.

322
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,920
So tell us, genius,

323
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,890
how do you plan
to get Aubrey James

324
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,690
now that you've told the GCPD
you're going after him?

325
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,390
Oh, that's simple.

326
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,760
They're gonna bring him to me.

327
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,770
You know how many
crooked politicians

328
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
there are in this city?

329
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,840
This riddle could be for anyone.

330
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,540
Oh, my gosh,
these are delicious.

331
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,940
All the same, Mr. Mayor,

332
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,080
we'd like to move you
to a safe house immediately.

333
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,410
Did you not see
the muscle twins over there?

334
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,420
I'm perfectly safe here.

335
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,550
Besides, what's the Riddler
want with me, anyway?

336
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,950
We're not really sure.

337
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,360
He did say something
to the crowd at the theater

338
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,950
about a secret.

339
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,060
My life's an open book.

340
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,400
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mayor?
You look a little...

341
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,600
It's my blood sugar.

342
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,830
I've had too many
of these Danishes.

343
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,700
Where are my pills?

344
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,740
Wait a minute,
where'd you get these?

345
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,340
An appreciative citizen. Why?

346
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,940
Oh, boy.

347
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,580
Nygma.

348
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,010
This is bad.

349
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,630
Coming through.

350
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,070
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

351
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,740
You cannot be serious.

352
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,910
I've seen mass graves more
inviting than this place.

353
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,610
Strange messed me up
pretty good.

354
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,780
He convinced me

355
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,620
I was some sort of goddess,
and it took me a long time

356
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,720
to get over it.

357
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,420
Now, this place might be bad,
but Gotham is worse.

358
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,760
Hey, freak!
You're on company time.

359
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,060
Get back to work.

360
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,760
You don't have to take that.

361
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,900
You should totally kick his ass.

362
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,600
Yeah, but he's my boss.

363
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,400
Bridgit, there is nothing wrong
with being a freak.

364
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,140
I'm a freak.

365
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,870
So is Penguin.

366
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,410
You belong with us.

367
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,680
We've met before, haven't we?

368
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,980
Yeah. I'm Ivy Pepper.

369
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,820
Selina's friend.

370
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,790
Oh, I know. I ran into
one of Strange's puppies.

371
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,160
Kind of had a growth spurt.

372
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,720
Though, to be honest,
I'm not complaining.

373
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,730
Ivy.

374
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,060
And you're part of this?

375
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,200
Yeah. It's almost
like we're a family.

376
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,530
You don't have to
be alone anymore.

377
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,640
I could kill your boss
just to sweeten the deal.

378
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,840
Nah.

379
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,820
Hey, you.

380
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,080
I quit.

381
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,500
Thank you
for letting me come in.

382
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,230
The nosebleeds
are getting worse.

383
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,230
You did the right thing
coming here.

384
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,640
What did you tell Alfred?

385
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,540
Nothing.

386
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,700
I said I was tired,
then snuck out of my room.

387
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,550
I'm dying, aren't I?

388
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,880
Yes.

389
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,280
I'm sorry.

390
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,920
The process that brought you
into this world was flawed.

391
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,990
Will I die before Bruce returns?

392
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,490
No, Bruce Wayne will be back
in Gotham well before then.

393
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,800
I know we've asked a lot of you.

394
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,570
After Indian Hill I didn't know
what to do or where to go.

395
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,710
You gave me a purpose.

396
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,880
That's more than
most people could say.

397
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,540
I'm glad you see it that way.

398
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,620
When Bruce returns...

399
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,220
people are going to die,
aren't they?

400
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,790
A lot of people.

401
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,930
You haven't gotten attached
to anyone, have you?

402
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,330
Alfred, perhaps?

403
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,930
You've spoken fondly of him.

404
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,070
No. I just want to know.

405
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,340
The number is immaterial.

406
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,110
What matters is that

407
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,710
Gotham must fall.

408
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,710
And because of your sacrifice,
it will.

409
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,980
Can we count on you?

410
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,720
Yes.

411
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,090
His BP's dropping.

412
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,320
We need to stabilize him!

413
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,690
I want this ER secured.

414
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,230
Badge access only.
No one gets in

415
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,230
unless they're sick or dying.
CAMPOS: 10-4.

416
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,200
Nygma knows this is

417
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,830
the closest hospital to
the mayor's office.

418
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,200
We brought him right to him.

419
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,330
Great, let him show his face.

420
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,000
I got unis all over the place.

421
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,800
But what are we missing, Harvey?

422
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,210
What could Aubrey James know
that's so important to Nygma?

423
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,710
NYGMA: Paging Detective
James Gordon.

424
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,940
Paging Detective James Gordon.

425
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,380
Where's that coming from?

426
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,950
Communications room.
Second floor.

427
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,050
It's a trap.

428
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,020
Please don't kill me!

429
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,080
Please don't kill me!

430
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,080
Stay here.

431
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,850
So, Jimbo,

432
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,690
I know you must
be wondering what I want

433
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,960
from that ding-dong
Aubrey James.

434
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,230
Well...

435
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,100
turns out, he has answers
to a riddle,

436
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,360
one that you put into motion

437
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,400
when you sent Barbara
down to Dock 9C.

438
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,300
The question being,
who runs Gotham?

439
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,910
I got to get out of here.
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

440
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,080
Mr. Mayor, you're in no
condition to go anywhere.

441
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,980
Jim.

442
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,110
Tell me you got him.

443
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,380
He wasn't there.

444
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,750
But the secret he's after,
it's the Court.

445
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,250
Lidocaine and an IV push.

446
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
- You better get back here quick.
- What is it?

447
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,230
There was some kind
of explosion.

448
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,130
A lot of victims.

449
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,200
I got a bad feeling.
GORDON: It's him.

450
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,930
Don't leave the mayor's side.

451
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,770
Authorized personnel only.

452
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,070
Hell with that.
My friends got blown up!

453
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,410
Hello, Aubrey.

454
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,300
We got company.

455
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,910
Where is she?

456
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,110
Not here.

457
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,310
I know she and Nygma
kidnapped Mayor James.

458
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,780
Nygma mentioned Dock 9C and
she's the only one I told.

459
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,780
Nygma's got a big mouth.

460
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,250
Wait, wait, wait,
let me get this straight.

461
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,450
You mean this whole stupid
riddle thing with Nygma is real?

462
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,820
What? He clearly knows
everything already.

463
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,930
I heard a rumor

464
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,830
he hurt you pretty bad
a while back, both of you.

465
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,800
Surprised you're defending him.

466
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,800
Listen, you tell me
where they are,

467
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,070
I'll take Nygma down,

468
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
but I'll give Barbara
a free pass.

469
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,140
It's true. I hate him.

470
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,210
But I don't know where they are.

471
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,820
Harvey?

472
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,020
Okay. I'll
be right there.

473
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,160
Nygma sent another riddle.

474
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,020
Never should have brought
Barbara into this.

475
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,390
You better hope I
get to her first.

476
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,900
You should have
given that freak up.

477
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,000
No one wants Nygma
dead more than me.

478
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,470
But I can't betray Barbara.

479
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,140
Yeah.

480
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,400
'Cause she's always got
your best interests at heart.

481
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,980
Listen.

482
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,080
You're in way over your head
on this one.

483
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,080
You don't want to mess
with these people.

484
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,450
You see, everything that you say

485
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,050
just makes me more intrigued.

486
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,860
And determined.

487
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,990
I will be the one
who unmasks them.

488
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,220
You're insane.

489
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,260
Remember me, Aubrey?

490
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,400
I know that voice.

491
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,870
I'm so glad.

492
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,340
I thought maybe it got muffled.

493
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,110
We put that box on your head.

494
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,540
That was fun.
We should do that again

495
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,150
for old times' sake.

496
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,080
You don't get it, do you?

497
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,080
These people, they're...

498
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,580
They're like God.
They see and hear everything.

499
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,220
They'll know I talked.

500
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,860
Then it's the box.

501
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,450
No, no, no. Please,
a-anything but that.

502
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,200
They call themselves the Court.

503
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,960
And?

504
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,440
That's all I know.

505
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,840
I-I've never met
these people.

506
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,840
I just did
what they asked me to, I swear.

507
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,280
Very good!
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

508
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,080
You've been very helpful.

509
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,380
Helpful?

510
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,190
All he gave us
was "the Court."

511
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,860
He gave us tangible evidence
of their existence.

512
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,420
Now they'll know
I'm not bluffing.

513
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,260
What are you talking about?

514
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,090
I'm going to force the Court
to reveal themselves.

515
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,230
What is the one thing that every

516
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,870
secret organization
is afraid of?

517
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Being exposed.

518
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,600
Bingo.

519
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,510
Finally. Did you bring
what I asked for?

520
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,580
It's time to get the
Court's attention.

521
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Baby...

522
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,360
Gordon came to the club.

523
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,850
He knows everything.

524
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,990
You should have never gotten
Nygma involved.

525
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,540
I boosted the premium stuff,
Otto.

526
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,650
You're welcome.

527
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,150
Hello, Selina.

528
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,250
What the hell
are you doing here?

529
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,460
I wanted to see you.

530
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,990
I missed you.

531
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,990
Did you fall on your head?
I told you to stay away.

532
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,230
You did?

533
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,590
I forgot.

534
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,270
Why are you acting so weird?

535
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,240
I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't sleep well

536
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,270
last night.

537
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,570
Uh-huh.

538
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,280
Well, I just came
to feed my cat.

539
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,380
So, if you're not gonna leave,
I am.

540
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,180
I promised myself I'd stay away.

541
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,580
That it would be safer that way,
but...

542
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,990
things have changed.

543
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,650
What are you talking about?

544
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,690
You know what?
I don't care.

545
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,190
Just don't be here
when I get back.

546
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,620
Selina, wait.

547
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,060
I am not Bruce.

548
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,040
Jim?

549
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,510
Lee, now is not a good time.

550
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,240
Your uncle's autopsy.

551
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,480
Ballistics came back negative.
No match.

552
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,180
But there were microscopic
tears along the entry wound,

553
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,610
made postmortem.

554
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,180
What are you saying?

555
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,990
Someone removed the bullet
that killed your uncle

556
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,350
and replaced it
with another one.

557
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,390
It's an old mob trick
to cover up a murder.

558
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,420
You're reaching, Lee.

559
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,760
I don't think so.

560
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,290
And I think you know
what happened.

561
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,430
Listen to me.

562
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,530
You need to drop this.
You could get yourself hurt.

563
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,730
You think I care
what happens to me?

564
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,470
I am sick of watching you

565
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,000
destroy people's lives
and get away with it.

566
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,740
When I find out what you did,

567
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm gonna make sure
you pay for it.

568
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,570
And I'm gonna enjoy it.

569
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,670
Jim, hey.

570
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Where's the riddle?

571
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,020
Me and Lucius
took a crack at it,

572
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,290
but maybe
you'll have better luck.

573
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,030
"You can see me,
but you cannot touch me.

574
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,790
"The flick of a switch,
I enter your home.

575
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,500
"With another,
I leave you alone.

576
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,730
Where am I?"

577
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,630
He's taunting us.
If he kills James,

578
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,600
the press is gonna hand us
our asses on the 6:00 news.

579
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,070
Harvey, you're a genius.

580
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,210
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

581
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,480
I have a question.

582
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,810
What is this mysterious "Court"

583
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,780
that controls the levers
of power here in Gotham?

584
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,420
Alvarez, go to channel seven!

585
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,390
Find out where Nygma's
broadcasting from.
And will they

586
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,130
let our dear mayor's head
be blown to bits

587
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,630
in order
to keep their anonymity?

588
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,340
Are you watching the television?

589
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,270
I am.

590
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,140
The Court cannot be exposed.

591
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,810
We would clean this up
on our own,

592
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,110
but there are too many
eyes watching.

593
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,150
However, this does afford us
an opportunity, James.

594
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,050
To prove my loyalty.

595
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,720
You want me to find Nygma

596
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,290
and bring him to you?

597
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,860
I understand this puts you
in a difficult position.

598
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,560
He's a cop killer.
He belongs in prison.

599
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,560
If you decline, this
conversation will be our last.

600
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,860
The choice is yours.

601
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,770
That was the Court.

602
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,470
If I hand him over, I'm in.

603
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,870
They'll probably kill him.
And if I don't,

604
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,440
we'll never stop them
from destroying the city.

605
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,180
I know what you're thinking,
Aubrey.

606
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,610
That the police are gonna
somehow find you, rescue you.

607
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,720
But I gave the GCPD
every chance to save you.

608
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,090
But they're no match for me!

609
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,560
We're both dead men.

610
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,230
You don't get it, do you?

611
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,830
The Court isn't gonna
bargain with you.

612
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,470
You underestimate
me, Mr. James.

613
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,810
Hello.

614
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,870
Nygma.

615
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,850
Jim, I'm so sorry.

616
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,310
We can't be
clogging up the lines.

617
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,850
I'm actually expecting
an important call.

618
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,620
You want to know
who runs Gotham?

619
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,420
I have the answer.

620
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,760
Come by the GCPD.
I'll tell it to you.

621
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,820
Hmm. Yeah,
I think I'll pass on that.

622
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,330
Then you'll never know
the truth.

623
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,530
You think I told Barbara
everything I know?

624
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,430
You always were clever, Jim.
I respect that.

625
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,570
Empty out the GCPD.

626
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,240
I want it to just be you and me.

627
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,640
Alone.

628
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,610
Well, and this idiot
with the bomb around his neck.

629
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,880
You think he'll show?

630
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,920
GORDON: The thing that drives
Nygma is also his weakness.

631
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,950
He'll be here.

632
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,720
It's not like every man,
woman and child in Gotham

633
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,630
isn't depending on you
to succeed.

634
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,390
Yeah. No pressure.

635
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Good luck, pal.

636
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,300
Thanks.

637
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,770
Where's Ed?

638
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,810
That lunatic dropped me off.

639
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,910
Sent me in alone.

640
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,240
Get the bomb squad in here!

641
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,610
Sit down and shut up.

642
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,250
Ed?

643
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,950
It's just the two of us in here.

644
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,850
Just wanted to make sure
I wasn't walking into a trap.

645
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,450
Nah, ah, ah.

646
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,390
Sit down, Aubrey.

647
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,960
You said you have the answer
I was looking for, Jim.

648
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,630
It would be
incredibly disappointing

649
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,400
if this was all a ruse.
More so for Mayor James.

650
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,870
Just tell him what he wants.

651
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,400
He talks too much.

652
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,410
You should probably
just go ahead

653
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,210
and blow him up.

654
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,210
JAMES: I'll have
your badge, Gordon.

655
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,250
I'm not bluffing, Jim.

656
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,450
Neither am I.

657
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,820
What's the blast radius on
that thing? Am I good here?

658
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,790
Or should I...
duck behind a desk?

659
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,650
I want the answer, Jim!

660
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,930
I kill him, I still walk out
of here with you as my hostage.

661
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,340
No!

662
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,370
No!

663
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,440
No!

664
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,440
Oh, come on.

665
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,780
There's a radio frequency

666
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,380
jamming the signal between
the detonator and the bomb.

667
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,580
How?

668
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,520
Tabitha.

669
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,520
She holds quite the
grudge against you.

670
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,650
She called me.

671
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,760
Told me how to disarm the bomb.

672
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,630
I'll admit,
I didn't see this coming.

673
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,470
But that doesn't change
anything.

674
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,870
I want...

675
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,870
to know...

676
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,930
who the Court is.

677
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,540
Or Aubrey dies.

678
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,740
Don't!

679
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,780
You want to know
who runs Gotham?

680
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,020
Then let Mayor James go.

681
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,750
Take a ride with me.

682
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,460
But if you pull that trigger,

683
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,650
you'll never get the answer
you're looking for.

684
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,530
You fool me once, Jim,

685
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,290
shame on you.

686
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,600
You fool me twice...

687
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,100
well, that's just
not gonna happen.

688
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,530
Then the riddle
will go unsolved.

689
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,440
Fine!

690
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,520
Let's go.

691
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,760
Let me get this straight.

692
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:52,430
So, this limo pulls up
literally out of nowhere,

693
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,070
and this creepy lady tells you
to get in because

694
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,140
"you could be so much more"?

695
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,740
And you did?

696
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,770
I had nowhere else to go.

697
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,710
So where have you been
the last few months?

698
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,640
It's not important.

699
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,750
What matters is
you need to leave Gotham.

700
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,410
Right away.
Why?

701
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,150
Because the city
has been judged.

702
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,820
And something bad
is going to happen.

703
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,820
Judged by who?

704
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,460
The people who took you?

705
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,630
Wait a minute,
your clothes, your hair,

706
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,490
the way you talk.

707
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,930
Where is Bruce?

708
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,170
Selina...

709
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,540
What did you do to him?

710
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,000
He's fine.
He's not in Gotham.

711
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,010
But nothing bad is going
to happen to him.

712
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Then where is he?
It doesn't matter.

713
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,410
You just have to trust me.

714
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,740
You need to leave Gotham today.

715
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,380
Trust you?

716
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,120
I don't even know you.

717
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,750
Where you going?

718
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,920
To tell Alfred.

719
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,620
Selina...
Now let me go!

720
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,960
Selina, you can't tell anyone.

721
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,620
Then why the hell
did you tell me?

722
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,830
Because I care about you.

723
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,760
And if there's one
person I want to save,

724
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,670
I want it to be you.

725
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,870
That's the difference
between you and Bruce Wayne.

726
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,470
He would try and save everyone.

727
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,080
You can pretend

728
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,080
all you want,
but you will never be him.

729
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,050
You're nothing.

730
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,090
You're not even a real person.

731
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,590
You don't matter.

732
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,760
You're wrong about me.

733
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,900
I do matter.

734
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,200
And I won't let you tell Alfred.

735
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,740
Oh, yeah?

736
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,900
How you gonna stop...

737
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,840
You remember the night you
came over to Lee's for dinner?

738
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,810
It was like a lifetime ago.

739
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,780
Leslie made fondue.

740
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,620
The wine was a Bordeaux.

741
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,790
Well-aged.

742
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,120
Smooth tannins.

743
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,690
Ms. Kringle wore a black dress
with pink trim.

744
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,130
I tried like hell
to get out of it.

745
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,830
But Lee insisted.

746
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,970
The truth is, I had a good time.

747
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,970
I considered you a friend.

748
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,780
I can sneak up on you

749
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,550
or be right in front of you
without you even knowing.

750
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,020
But when I reveal myself,

751
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,550
you will never be the same.

752
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,720
What am I?

753
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,020
I don't care, I...

754
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,150
Betrayal.

755
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,930
That's how every
friendship ends.

756
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,930
So...

757
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,130
so what good are friends anyway?

758
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,310
Who are they?

759
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,810
The answer to your question.

760
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,000
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

761
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,940
I hear you've been
asking about us.

762
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,040
How do I know you're real?

763
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,980
Isn't that the point
of a good mystery?

764
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,210
You're never quite sure what
to believe until the end.

765
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,050
Gordon could've
put you up to this.

766
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,150
I assure you,

767
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,050
Detective Gordon had to be
convinced to bring you here.

768
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,060
But let me put it like this:

769
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,130
That question Professor
Strange had you ask

770
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,330
Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox
last year at Indian Hill,

771
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,730
the one that has tortured you,

772
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,870
the one you'll never
be able to answer.

773
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,370
That answer is with me.

774
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,040
What now?

775
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,210
Get in.

776
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,080
And all your questions
will be answered.

777
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,980
You won't be needing the gun.

778
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,940
You've made us proud,
Detective Gordon.

779
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,210
What are you going
to do with him?

780
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,180
A man with Nygma's intellect
could be quite useful to us.

781
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,880
I'm sure we'll find
something for him to do.

782
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,150
We'll be in touch.

783
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,900
â™ª Till the fearless come

784
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,970
â™ª And the act is done

785
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,710
â™ª A love like blood

786
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,200
â™ª A love
like blood â™ª

787
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,180
â™ª Till the fearless come...

788
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,410
Good evening, Ms. Kean.
May I offer you a drink?

789
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,920
Something went wrong.

790
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,820
Gordon took down Nygma
before he could find out

791
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,290
the truth about the Court.

792
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,860
Probably 'cause I told Gordon
how to disarm the bomb.

793
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,230
What?

794
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,430
Why?

795
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,030
You promised that when Nygma
handed over the underworld,

796
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,330
I would get to kill him.

797
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,240
Sealed it with a kiss, remember?

798
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,070
Don't you get it?

799
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,810
As long as the Court
is out there,

800
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,970
I'll never be in control!

801
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Don't you mean we'll
never be in control?

802
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,930
Seen it a thousand times.

803
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,060
Ambition, power.

804
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,500
People can't help themselves.

805
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,170
She's changed, baby.

806
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,970
When are you gonna see that?

807
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,200
Shut up, Butch!

808
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,340
Move!

809
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,970
This is trouble.

810
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,020
It's good to be home.

811
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,820
FYI, I've been to Wayne Manor.

812
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,120
It's way cleaner.

813
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,960
You never said anything about
Fries being a part of this.

814
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,130
You're a little hot.

815
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,290
Maybe you need to cool off.

816
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,100
Oh, come on, you guys.

817
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,390
We're on the same team
now, remember?

818
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,500
A family?

819
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,900
Keep him away from me.

820
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,520
There's a question mark
on your face.

821
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,150
You can sleep in the freezer.

822
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,350
The study speculates
that widespread chemical dumping

823
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,420
is to blame.

824
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,960
And this just in:
We now go to breaking news...

825
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,130
Hey, Pengy.

826
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,430
Check it out.

827
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,030
Do not call me "Pengy"!

828
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,930
The Riddler, aka Edward Nygma,

829
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,400
was apprehended by the GCPD

830
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,440
this afternoon after
kidnapping Interim Mayor

831
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,540
Aubrey James.

832
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,440
However, while en route
to Arkham Asylum, he managed

833
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,310
to escape police custody...
Riddler.

834
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,510
And is now at large.

835
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,050
How long did he have
to think about that one?

836
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,350
Once the right hand

837
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,010
to former mayor Oswald Kap...

838
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,120
Rest up, everyone.

839
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,320
Tomorrow is going to be

840
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,490
a busy day.

841
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,160

842
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,220
I'd like to introduce
our newest member,

843
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,660
James Gordon.

844
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,200
Welcome to the Court of Owls.
