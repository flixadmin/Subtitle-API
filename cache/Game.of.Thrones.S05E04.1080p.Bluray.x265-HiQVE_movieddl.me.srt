1
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,443
Is that Estermont?

2
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,963
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

3
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,964
The Sapphire Isle.

4
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,728
Why are we on a merchant ship?
Why no Lannister sails?

5
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,564
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

6
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,325
We'll get off earlier,
not far from Sunspear,

7
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,880
row ourselves to the Dornish shore
in the night.

8
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,044
You ever been to Dorne?

9
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,889
I have.

10
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,689
The Dornish are crazy.

11
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,286
All they want to do
is fight and fuck, fuck and fight.

12
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,442
You should be happy to go back then.

13
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,891
There's nothing like a good fight
to get you in the mood for fucking.

14
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,042
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

15
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,566
to clear your head for the next fight.

16
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,369
It's how the two work together.

17
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,489
Now we're gonna be doing a lot of fighting.
Well, I am.

18
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,250
But I don't imagine
we'll get to stick around for the rest.

19
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,004
Not after we've kidnapped their princess.

20
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,082
We're not kidnapping their princess.

21
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,369
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

22
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,441
Your niece?

23
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,241
I've been doing this a long time.

24
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,129
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

25
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,089
I know. Why are you here?

26
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,682
Why not send 40 of me? Or an army?

27
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,725
Unlike most folks, you've actually got one.

28
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,170
Because I don't want to start a war.

29
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,202
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

30
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,481
It has to be me.

31
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,646
If I'm putting something
like this together,

32
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,563
a one-handed man who happens to be

33
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,211
one of the most recognizable faces
in Westeros is not...

34
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,970
It has to be me.

35
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,164
You set your brother free, didn't you?

36
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,484
I'll bet your sister didn't like that.

37
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,482
Varys set him free.

38
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,931
Well,

39
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,087
if you ever see the wee fucker,
give him my regards.

40
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,242
He murdered my father.

41
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,924
If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.

42
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,129
And then I'll give him your regards.

43
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,527
The Iron Bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

44
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,171
Given the expense
of rebuilding the royal fleet...

45
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,685
How much can the crown afford?

46
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,125
With winter coming,

47
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,563
half what they ask? Less?

48
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,530
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

49
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,162
Well, House Tyrell could front the gold,
and the crown would pay us back in time,

50
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,289
or I'd have words with my daughter.

51
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,561
You've already given us too much.

52
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,843
No, we must arrange better terms
with the Iron Bank.

53
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,331
- Absolutely.
- In person.

54
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,961
Me?

55
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,963
We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

56
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,641
someone of importance
to show these bankers our respect.

57
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,690
As the king's Master of Coin,
I can think of no one more qualified.

58
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,489
I would be honored, Your Grace.

59
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,565
The king's expressed concern about
his father-in-law's safety on this voyage.

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,085
He's ordered Ser Meryn
to personally lead your escort.

61
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,640
My very own Kingsguard?
Please express my...

62
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,165
Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

63
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,171
Of course. Of course.

64
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,561
I'll give your regards
to the Titan of Braavos.

65
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,204
The Small Council grows
smaller and smaller.

66
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,009
Not small enough.

67
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,286
May I offer you some wine?

68
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,650
No.

69
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,887
The old High Septon
would have asked the vintage.

70
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,123
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven,

71
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,521
and should be kept pure.

72
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,729
But the truth is, I don't like the taste.

73
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,241
Hmm.

74
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,241
How may I serve?

75
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,161
All over Westeros
we hear of septs being burned,

76
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,083
Silent Sisters raped,

77
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,403
the bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

78
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,562
Wars teach people to obey the sword,
not the gods.

79
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,927
Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.

80
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,610
In the days before the Targaryens,

81
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,042
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

82
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,682
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

83
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,162
If I explain their holy purpose
to my son, the king,

84
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,450
I have no doubt he will sign a decree
arming the believers you felt worthy.

85
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,005
An army that defends
the bodies and souls of the common people?

86
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,526
An army in service to the gods themselves.

87
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,645
And to you, of course,

88
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,322
as the chosen representative of the Seven.

89
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,091
An honor I never expected.

90
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,969
Or ever wished for.

91
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,565
Which is why you were chosen.

92
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,444
You and I both know how the world works.

93
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,206
Too often, the wicked are the wealthiest,
beyond the reach of justice.

94
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,046
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

95
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,010
All sinners are equal before the gods.

96
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,883
What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

97
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,804
Shielded by gold and privilege.

98
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,486
May the Father judge him justly.

99
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,170
What are you doing?

100
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,884
Help me! Help me!

101
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,607
Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,211
Get off me!

103
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,521
Come on.

104
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,365
Shut up! Move!

105
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,848
This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.

106
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,327
Cocksuckers.

107
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,083
Boy fucker.

108
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,688
You buggering filth!

109
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,882
There's a special place
in the seventh hell for your kind.

110
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,566
Please. Please, I'll pay.

111
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,526
I'll pay all of you.

112
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,520
Yes, you will.

113
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,121
Seize him.

114
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,291
Sinner.

115
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,727
Get your hands off me.

116
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,168
Ser Loras of House Tyrell,
you have broken the laws of gods and men.

117
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,007
Who do you think you are?

118
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,481
Justice.

119
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,881
Why is my brother in a cell?

120
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,961
I don't know.

121
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,204
I didn't order it.

122
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,441
We both know who did.

123
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,083
You told me
she was returning to Casterly Rock.

124
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,923
Are you saying my mother's behind this?

125
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,048
She's jealous you're not hers anymore.

126
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,364
Arresting my brother is her revenge.

127
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,442
Aren't you and Mother getting along?

128
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,041
Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

129
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,844
Do you have any affection for me at all?

130
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,720
Of course I do.

131
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,205
You're my queen.

132
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,360
I can't bear to think of my brother
locked away in some grimy cell.

133
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,762
I'll set him free for you.

134
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,251
Do you promise?

135
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,727
I demand that Ser Loras be freed now.

136
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,446
Did I arrest him?

137
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,050
Well, no.

138
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,007
But you armed the Faith Militant.

139
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,084
You gave the High Sparrow an army.

140
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,366
I did.

141
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,002
And your wife has every right to criticize.

142
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,606
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother,

143
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,523
no matter his perversions.

144
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,801
Then,

145
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,327
can I tell Margaery
you'll have Ser Loras released?

146
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,880
I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras.

147
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,011
You're the king.

148
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,051
I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow,
he'll release the poor boy.

149
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,451
Halt!

150
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,810
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

151
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,160
Give the order, and we'll
clear out this rabble.

152
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,523
You mean kill them?

153
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,044
Here, at the sept?

154
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,083
You'd be sending them
to meet the gods that they love.

155
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,170
Bastard!

156
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,321
You're an abomination!

157
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,564
Born of sin!

158
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,885
Filthy bastard!

159
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,565
We'll find another way.

160
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,645
Abomination!

161
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,011
My queen?

162
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,847
There was no way
to free Ser Loras without violence.

163
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,966
You're the King of the Andals,

164
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,681
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
the Protector of the Realm,

165
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,889
and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother-by-law.

166
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,091
I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.

167
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,924
Are you? When?

168
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,211
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

169
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,567
He was praying just now.

170
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,405
I have to send word to Grandmother.

171
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,250
Will you come back later?

172
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,042
I need to be with my family, Your Grace.

173
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,125
Of course.

174
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,884
SELYSEI You think highly of this boy?

175
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,401
Good.

176
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,891
Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

177
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,170
And a bastard by some tavern slut.

178
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,050
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

179
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,884
I should have given you a son.

180
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,365
Not your fault.

181
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,885
Whose, then?

182
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,961
I gave you nothing but weakness

183
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,161
and deformity.

184
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,325
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

185
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,890
My lady.

186
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,086
Her father is the Lord's chosen king,

187
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,686
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

188
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,162
You march on Winterfell soon?

189
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,528
We must to beat the snows.

190
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,288
Once before, you put your faith
in Ser Davos and left me behind.

191
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,848
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

192
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,126
I won't.

193
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,760
I need you.

194
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,241
You only need faith, my king.

195
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,610
And you. What do you need?

196
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,370
To serve my Lord.

197
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,725
Lord Ashford.

198
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,609
Lady Caulfield.

199
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,925
Lord Smallwood.

200
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,051
I've never even heard of these people.

201
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,003
They haven't heard of you, either.

202
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,047
But we need men, and they have some.

203
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,410
How many men does this Lord Mayzen
have to send us?

204
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,887
More than Lord Wibberley.

205
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,521
- Not him.
- I know. I'm sorry.

206
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,250
But we need men and supplies,

207
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,450
and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North.

208
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,646
He murdered my brother.

209
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,530
We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.

210
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,009
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

211
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,606
And we can't get more men
without help from the Warden of the North.

212
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,724
Apologies, my lady-

213
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,410
Lord Commander.

214
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,203
How can I help you?

215
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,362
Come with us when we ride south.

216
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,410
None of us know the
castle as well as you do.

217
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,087
Its hidden tunnels, its
weaknesses, its people.

218
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,841
Winterfell was your home once.

219
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,800
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

220
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,046
Castle Black is my home now.

221
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,569
The Night's Watch take no part
in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

222
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,085
There's only one war.

223
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,684
Life against death.

224
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,003
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

225
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,082
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

226
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,448
Forgive me. I don't trust in visions.

227
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,121
No visions. No magic.

228
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,766
Just life.

229
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,447
Do you feel my heart beating?

230
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,009
There's power in you.

231
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,927
You resist it, and that's your mistake.
Embrace it.

232
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,890
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

233
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,081
Two parts of a greater whole.

234
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,731
In ourjoining, there's power.

235
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,640
Power to make life,

236
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,246
power to make light,

237
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,322
and power to cast shadows.

238
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,050
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

239
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,525
Then we shouldn't tell him.

240
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,761
- I can't.
- Why?

241
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,681
I swore a vow.

242
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,410
I loved another.

243
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,167
The dead don't need lovers.

244
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,361
Only the living.

245
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,280
I know.

246
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,411
But I still love her.

247
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,609
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

248
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,487
Are you lonely?

249
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,521
Just bored.

250
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,002
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

251
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,766
Were you bored a lot, too?

252
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,890
I know Castle Black
is no place for a child, but...

253
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,611
I like it. I thought I'd be left at home.

254
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,443
I know Mother didn't want to bring me.

255
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,720
Why do you say that?

256
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,729
She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

257
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,285
She shouldn't have said that.

258
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,289
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

259
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,166
When you were an infant,

260
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,171
a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.

261
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,323
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

262
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,122
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

263
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,849
No doubt he'd heard of your birth
and assumed new fathers were easy targets.

264
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,323
I still remember how you smiled
when I put that doll in your cradle.

265
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,803
How you pressed it to your cheek.

266
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,647
By the time we burned the
doll, it was too late.

267
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,649
I was told you would die.

268
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,811
Or worse,

269
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,809
the greyscale would go slow.

270
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,043
Let you grow just enough to know the world
before taking it away from you.

271
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,691
Everyone advised me to send you
to the ruins of Valyria

272
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,962
to live out your short
life with the stone men,

273
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,884
before the sickness
spread through the castle.

274
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,449
I told them all to go to hell.

275
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,450
I called in every maester
on this side of the world.

276
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,569
Every healer. Every apothecary.

277
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,767
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

278
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,364
Because you do not belong across the world
with the bloody stone men.

279
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,401
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

280
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,044
And you are my daughter.

281
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,801
I thought I might find you here.

282
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,290
Your Aunt Lyanna.

283
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,243
Father never talked about her,

284
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,604
but sometimes I'd find him down here
lighting the candles.

285
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,845
They say she was beautiful.

286
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,205
I saw her once.

287
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,443
I was a boy living with
your mother's family.

288
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,490
Lord Whent held a great
tourney at Harrenhal.

289
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,324
Everyone was there.

290
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,529
The Mad King, your father,

291
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,204
Robert Baratheon,

292
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,326
and Lyanna.

293
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,641
She was already promised to Robert.

294
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,531
You can imagine what it was like for me, a
boy from nowhere with nothing to his name,

295
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,207
watching these legendary men
tilting at the lists.

296
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,082
The last two riders were Barristan Selmy
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

297
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,841
When Rhaegar won,
everyone cheered for their prince.

298
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,843
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet,

299
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,127
and they saw that silver hair.

300
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,361
How handsome he was.

301
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,285
Until he rode right past his wife,

302
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,121
Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

303
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,727
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

304
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,924
He rode past his wife,

305
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,281
and he lay a crown of winter roses
in Lyanna's lap.

306
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,885
Blue as frost.

307
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,891
How many tens of thousands had to die
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

308
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,562
Yes, he chose her.

309
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,801
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

310
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,491
Come.

311
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,651
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

312
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,126
You're dressed for riding.

313
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,201
I am.

314
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,724
Where are you going?

315
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,848
King's Landing.

316
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,490
King's Landing?

317
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,642
Cersei sent for me.

318
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,087
We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.

319
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,970
You can't leave me here.

320
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,282
I know how hard it is
to live with people you despise.

321
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,407
Believe me.

322
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,406
But it won't be for long.

323
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,327
How do you know?

324
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,369
Stannis Baratheon garrisons
at Castle Black.

325
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,566
He'll march south to King's Landing
before the winter snows block his way.

326
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,042
But first, he has to take Winterfell.

327
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,441
- You don't know that.
- I do.

328
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,522
Once he liberates these lands
from the Boltons,

329
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,120
he'll rally your father's bannermen
to his cause.

330
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,728
With the North behind him,
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

331
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,723
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

332
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,170
He has a larger army.

333
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,891
He's the finest military commander
in Westeros.

334
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,726
A betting man would
put his money on Stannis.

335
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,246
I am a betting man.

336
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,209
And if you're right?

337
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,282
Stannis takes Winterfell,

338
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,489
he rescues you from
the most despised family in the North.

339
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,530
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

340
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,046
he names you Wardeness of the North.

341
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,445
But I...

342
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,204
I wouldn't...

343
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,691
Wardeness of the North?

344
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,967
You are the last surviving Stark.

345
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,441
He needs you.

346
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,370
And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?

347
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,131
Or he does, and the Boltons defeat him?

348
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,727
Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay,
and make him yours.

349
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,931
I don't know how to do that.

350
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,764
Of course you do.

351
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,604
He's already fallen for you.

352
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,770
His father frightens me.

353
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,410
He should. He's a dangerous man.

354
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,523
But even the most dangerous men
can be outmaneuvered.

355
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,487
And you've learned to maneuver
from the very best.

356
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,441
I'll return before too long.

357
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,329
You be strong without me.

358
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,202
The North will be yours.

359
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,925
Do you believe me?

360
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,088
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

361
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,001
Breakfast.

362
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,124
That would have been a shit way to die.

363
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,569
As far as I've seen, they're
all shit ways to die.

364
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,723
Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers a good ending.

365
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,644
I don't care
what's sung about me when I'm dead.

366
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,960
No?

367
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,043
Two knights off to rescue a princess.
Sounds like a good song to me.

368
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,525
Sounds like all the rest.

369
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,323
What about you?

370
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,641
What shit way would you choose?

371
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,045
In my own keep, drinking my own wine,
watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

372
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,761
How disappointing.

373
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,810
I thought you'd have
something more exciting planned.

374
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,166
I've had an exciting life.
I want my death to be boring.

375
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,764
How do you want to go?

376
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,241
In the arms of the woman I love.

377
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,001
She want the same thing?

378
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,685
Let's go.

379
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,242
The captain of that ship,
what was he, Braavosi?

380
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,049
Pentoshi.

381
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,690
And he's headed to Oldtown?

382
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,728
As I said. Why?

383
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,448
What's to stop him
from docking down the coast,

384
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,166
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

385
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,730
A bag of gold.

386
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,050
I'm not sure you understand

387
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,691
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

388
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,603
It was a heavy bag.

389
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,490
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

390
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,688
But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.

391
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,602
- How many you count?
- Four.

392
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,844
How many do you think you can take?

393
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,922
One, if he's slow.

394
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,170
Halt!

395
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,325
Over the hill.

396
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,528
Fucked in the ass.

397
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,961
Hvah!

398
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,361
Morning, lads.

399
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,647
Glad we found you.

400
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,121
Who are you?

401
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,969
Cooper. This is Darnell.

402
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,690
You're from King's Landing.

403
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,489
Accent gave me away?

404
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,361
Flea Bottom, whelped and whipped.

405
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,487
Why are you here?

406
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,128
Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.

407
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,122
It was a near thing, really.

408
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,402
Thought the sharks would get us.

409
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,362
There are no sharks in Dorne.

410
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,281
Could have sworn those were shark fins.

411
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,091
Dolphins, maybe.

412
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,165
Throw your swords in the sand.

413
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,961
Boys, there's no need for this.

414
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,125
Just point us in the right direction,
we'll find our way home.

415
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,368
Swords in the sand now.

416
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,887
Hyah! Hyah!

417
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,210
That one should be slow enough.

418
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,684
Nice move.

419
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,851
Luck.

420
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,562
You had a wonderful teacher.

421
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,163
Always wanted a Dornish stallion.

422
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,847
Beasts can run a day and
night without tiring.

423
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,003
We'll ride to the Water Gardens
with a nice breeze in our faces.

424
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,570
First we need to bury these bodies.

425
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,131
Birds have to eat, too.

426
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,527
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

427
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,489
We're not here to start a war.

428
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,931
Do you know how long it'll take us
to dig all those holes?

429
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,364
I can't dig very well with one hand.

430
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,408
Not at all, really.

431
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,966
Mama.

432
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,880
Nym, Obara.

433
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,968
Will it be war?

434
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,566
Prince Doran will weep for your father,
but nothing else.

435
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,120
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

436
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,329
Without Doran, we have no army
to march against the Lannisters.

437
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,163
We don't need an army to start a war.

438
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,845
Queen Cersei loves her children,

439
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,841
and we have one of them.

440
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,724
You may have a problem.

441
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,283
A ship's captain
who found me in Planky Town

442
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,044
claiming he had information to sell.

443
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,929
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

444
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,444
He's come for Myrcella.

445
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,128
If he gets to her before we do,
we lose our only chance for revenge.

446
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,050
You must choose.

447
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,449
Doran's way and peace,

448
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,330
or my way and war.

449
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,202
I'm with you always.

450
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,565
Nym?

451
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,291
Obara?

452
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,321
When I was a child,
Oberyn came to take me to court.

453
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,291
I had never seen this man,
and yet he called himself my father.

454
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,965
My mother wept, said I was too young
and a girl.

455
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,604
Oberyn tossed his spear
at my feet and said,

456
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,524
"Girl or boy, we fight our battles,

457
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,729
"but the gods let us choose our weapons."

458
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,404
My father pointed to the spear,
and then to my mother's tears.

459
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,447
I made my choice long ago.

460
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,724
Will you untie me?

461
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,924
Will you please untie me?

462
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,926
Will you please?

463
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,606
Thank you.

464
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,881
Who are you?

465
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,961
Your captor.

466
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,251
Do you have wine?

467
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,560
No.

468
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,045
Can't sleep without wine.

469
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,651
Then stay awake.

470
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,810
You're going the wrong way.

471
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,160
My sister is in Westeros. Westeros is west.

472
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,964
We're heading east.

473
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,247
I'm not taking you to your sister.

474
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,081
You said you were taking me to the queen.

475
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,927
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
She's the queen I serve.

476
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,525
What a waste of a good kidnapping.

477
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,009
It so happens I was heading there myself.

478
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,842
What business would you have
with the queen?

479
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,400
Gold and glory. Oh, and hate.

480
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,206
If you'd ever met my
sister, you'd understand.

481
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,568
So now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

482
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,364
A highborn knight from the north of
Westeros down on his luck in Essos.

483
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,723
Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate.

484
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,484
You're Jorah Mormont.

485
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,689
I have to ask.

486
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,288
How exactly were you serving your queen
in a whorehouse half a world away?

487
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,321
Is it possible that you were running?

488
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,121
Why would you be running?
And why would she have sent you away?

489
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,207
Oh, wait.

490
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,921
You were spying on her, weren't you?

491
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,690
It's all coming back to me.

492
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,728
I was drunk through
most of the Small Council meetings,

493
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,529
but it's all coming back.

494
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,769
You passed notes to Varys' little birds.

495
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,960
She found out, didn't she?

496
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,281
Found out and exiled you.

497
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,683
Now you hope to
win back her favor with a gift.

498
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,611
Risky scheme.

499
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,000
One might even say desperate.

500
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,849
You think Daenerys will execute me
and pardon you?

501
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,760
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

502
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,125
Everyone looks happy enough from up here.

503
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,650
What?

504
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,728
I was thinking about all
the times your brother

505
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,247
made me go with him down from the Red Keep
into the streets of King's Landing.

506
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,164
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

507
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,810
He liked to sing to them.

508
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,767
He sang to them?

509
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,524
Yes.

510
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,530
Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook,
or the Street of Seeds, and then he'd sing.

511
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,931
Just like all the other minstrels.

512
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,161
And what did you do?

513
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,005
I made sure no one killed him.

514
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,325
And I collected the money.

515
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,402
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

516
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,488
- He was good?
- He was very good.

517
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,800
Viserys never told you?

518
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,406
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

519
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,285
Rhaegar never liked killing.
He loved singing.

520
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,331
And what did you do with the money?

521
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,688
Well, one time, he gave it
to the next minstrel down the street.

522
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,240
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

523
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,047
One time, we got horribly drunk.

524
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,567
Your Grace.

525
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,688
Hizdahr is here,
waiting in the audience chamber.

526
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,607
How many others are there?

527
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,805
Fifty? 100?

528
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,564
Will you be joining us?

529
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,366
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

530
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,886
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

531
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,050
Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.

532
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,404
Your Grace.

533
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,802
All men must die, but not
all can die in glory.

534
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,928
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

535
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,722
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

536
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,326
So their names would live on.

537
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,244
Those who find victory in the fighting pits
will never become kings,

538
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,368
but their names will live on.

539
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,283
It's the best chance they'll ever have.

540
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,850
Is that what you used to tell men

541
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,810
before you set them
to butchering each other for sport?

542
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,690
Today is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

543
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,489
I do not recognize this tradition.

544
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,683
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

545
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,205
your city, together.

546
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,808
Without them, former slaves and
former masters have nothing in common.

547
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,082
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

548
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,802
I can't promise
this is the answer to all our problems,

549
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,930
but it's a start.

550
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,404
Sons of the Harpy.
