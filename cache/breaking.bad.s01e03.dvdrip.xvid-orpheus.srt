1
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,831
Let's break it down.

2
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:52,306
Hydrogen.
What does that give us?

3
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:55,086
By mole?
We're looking at 63%.

4
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:56,524
63?

5
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,029
That is a big bite.

6
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,720
My next step's
gotta be oxygen.

7
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,235
Oxygen: 26%.

8
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,833
26.
There you have your water.

9
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,073
Carbon: 9%.

10
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:07,969
Carbon: 9.

11
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:11,594
- For a total of 98%?
- Right.

12
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:15,685
- Nitrogen: 1.25%.
- 1.25.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,214
That brings it
to 99 and a quarter.

14
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:21,414
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements

15
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,900
down where the magic happens.

16
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:27,010
Oh, wait a minute.
What about calcium?

17
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:28,577
Calcium's not a trace.

18
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:30,525
Got a whole skeleton
to account for.

19
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,365
- You would think, right?
- Right.

20
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:36,269
Calcium. Calcium is only.25%.

21
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:38,834
What?
That low?

22
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:40,330
Seriously?

23
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:43,044
Damn, I never would
have thought that.

24
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:46,537
Okay, so where
does iron fit in?

25
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:49,013
Iron. Wow, okay.

26
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,014
.00004%.

27
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,305
What?

28
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:59,063
You can't have hemoglobin
without iron.

29
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:01,934
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No, it don't. Go figure.

30
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,984
- Sodium.
- Sodium:.04.

31
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,726
Phosphorus:.19.

32
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:14,397
.19.
There we go.

33
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:18,631
So, the whole thing...

34
00:02:19,526 --> 00:02:21,018
adds up to...

35
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:25,169
99.888042%.

36
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:32,381
We are.111958%...

37
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:36,103
shy.

38
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:38,396
Supposedly
that's everything.

39
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,483
I don't know.
I just... I just...

40
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:48,115
Just seems like
something's missing, doesn't it?

41
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,429
There got to be more
to a human being than that.

42
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:25,554
I hate these shoes.

43
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,639
These shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans,

44
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:31,318
like I should be squeaking
around bringing soup

45
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,425
to some disgusting old person,

46
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,608
then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

47
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,893
Then why are you
wearing them?

48
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,343
I like the support.

49
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,894
My arches happen to be
extremely archy.

50
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,090
Yo. What's up?

51
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,857
Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes?

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,578
Thanks. Bye.

53
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,985
Gotta go take this.

54
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:57,259
Female?

55
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:00,465
Louis.

56
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:04,219
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

57
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,946
Just be quick about it.

58
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:10,773
Oh, and, um,
please don't say yo.

59
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:14,228
You can't know
how much I hate that.

60
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:22,927
You missed a... spot right there.

61
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,423
Should you be
up on that ladder?

62
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:28,046
You're more than welcome
to take over for me up here.

63
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:30,326
I don't see why you don't
just get Walt to do it.

64
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,134
Yeah.
There's an idea.

65
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:39,060
So, I'm working
on this new short story,

66
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:42,900
and there's this stoner character in it,
and I'm trying to...

67
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:46,976
Well, know you,
actually, let me back up.

68
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,615
You've smoked your

69
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:52,407
fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

70
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:56,895
I mean, you at least tried it.

71
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:00,605
Come on.

72
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:07,331
I perhaps tried it. Why?

73
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,931
Do you remember it having
an effect on your mood,

74
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:12,637
like changing it
in any major way, or...

75
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:15,324
It made me more serious.

76
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:16,496
Really?

77
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:19,652
Because I mostly remember

78
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:22,786
it made me light-headed.
That's about it.

79
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:26,359
I was just wondering
if it maybe could...

80
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:33,399
You know, it's just
a character thing I'm stuck on.

81
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,838
Never mind.

82
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:37,281
- Walter Jr. 's on pot?
- What?

83
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:40,064
No! No.

84
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,729
- What would make you even...
- Where's he getting it from?

85
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:46,096
- Marie.
- Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

86
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:48,603
What are you going
to do about this?

87
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:51,111
You need
to look me in the eye.

88
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:55,090
I am strictly asking about a story
that I am writing, that's all.

89
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:58,976
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. is not on pot.

90
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:02,206
Certainly not
as far as I know.

91
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:05,323
Not as far as you know?

92
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:06,869
Marie.

93
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,067
Look at me.

94
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:00,488
Hey, turn around
and look at me.

95
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:07,880
This...
This here...

96
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:11,927
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

97
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,626
This is degrading.

98
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:21,969
I'm sorry.

99
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:27,103
You hope I'll make it easy on you
and just drop dead, don't you?

100
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,379
Well, I won't.

101
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,056
So either kill me
or let me go.

102
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,941
You don't have it
in you, Walter.

103
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:41,965
How do you know my name?

104
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,260
Jesse.

105
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,150
He told Emilio and me.

106
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,786
When he came by
to sell your meth?

107
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:54,886
So what?
You threaten him, huh?

108
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:57,770
- Did you beat it out of him?
- Not even close.

109
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,272
What else did he tell you?

110
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,447
Pretty much everything
you can think of.

111
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,120
How you were his
high school teacher.

112
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:14,283
How one time you taught about carbon
dioxide by making grape soda in class.

113
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:17,742
How you have a son
who's retarded,

114
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:20,304
or in a wheelchair
or something.

115
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:24,803
This shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

116
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,070
That partner of yours...

117
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,456
he's got a big mouth.

118
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,173
Walter, I don't know what you
think you're doing here,

119
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:38,986
but trust me, this line of work
doesn't suit you.

120
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,466
So I should just
let you go, then?

121
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:49,244
Just unlock you
and adios, huh?

122
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:52,972
I don't see what
real choice you have

123
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:56,110
if it's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

124
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,023
Besides...

125
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:02,000
your real problem
is sitting upstairs.

126
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:22,560
Occupied!

127
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,860
Hey, yo, I'm trying
to pinch one off in here!

128
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,185
Just give me
some privacy, would ya?

129
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,780
What the hell, man?

130
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:36,589
What are you doing, man?

131
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:39,297
- You asshole!
- You told him my name.

132
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,544
- Says who? Him?
- My name, where I work.

133
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:44,137
- You told him about my son!
- Don't touch me!

134
00:10:44,263 --> 00:10:46,066
- Damn junkie!
- No, give me that!

135
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:49,145
Too late! This is going down
the toilet. Watch it go!

136
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,449
No, that's worth 40 grand,
you stupid shit.

137
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,150
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

138
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,889
Get off the toilet.

139
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,867
Get off the toilet!

140
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:02,003
Get off the toilet!

141
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:04,717
Stop it!

142
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,460
No! No way!

143
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:51,035
What the hell do you
think you're going?

144
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,873
- Back off, man! Jesus!
- We've got work to do!

145
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:56,977
No, you got work to do.
I did my part.

146
00:11:56,985 --> 00:12:00,022
You mean that obscenity that I spent
the last two hours cleaning up?

147
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:02,843
- That is your contribution?
- Yo! Kiss my pink ass, man!

148
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,617
I didn't ask
for any of this!

149
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,776
How am I supposed
to live here now, huh?

150
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,587
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

151
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:12,311
Because you didn't
follow my instructions!

152
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,448
Oh, well,
heil Hitler, bitch.

153
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:16,685
And let me tell you
something else.

154
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,837
We flipped a coin,
okay?

155
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,324
You and me.

156
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:22,748
You and me!

157
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:25,199
Coin flip is sacred.

158
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,088
Damn it.

159
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:38,091
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement,

160
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:40,103
as per the coin.

161
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:42,085
Fucking do it already.

162
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:58,825
That's what she said.

163
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:05,730
Yeah, I think we have some of those.
Yeah, you'll have to try them on.

164
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:07,943
- Hello.
- 7½, maybe. I don't know.

165
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:10,614
Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?

166
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:16,135
Anyway, so like I was saying,
I went to the party the other night.

167
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:17,881
Yeah, Tony was there.

168
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:26,359
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

169
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:28,967
Sorry, baby. I'm kinda
busy here. What's up?

170
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:33,499
Kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject,

171
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:35,998
so I need you to focus and...

172
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:38,183
Hey, sit down!
Sit down!

173
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,033
Damn it, Hank.

174
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:42,600
Well, sorry, babe.
I'm just...

175
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,117
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

176
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:47,913
Sit down!
Sit your ass down!

177
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:49,659
Comprende?
You, too! Sit down!

178
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,008
Siéntete!

179
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:56,870
I'm back, baby.
What's up?

180
00:13:57,249 --> 00:13:58,560
Walter Jr.

181
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,562
Yeah,
what about him?

182
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:02,368
Marijuana.

183
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,444
- He's smoking it.
- Bullshit.

184
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:06,893
Excuse me.
His own mother seems to think so.

185
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,137
- Skyler told you that?
- She inferred it.

186
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:10,864
She inferred it, huh?

187
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,501
She strongly
inferred it, like...

188
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:19,081
"Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction."

189
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:22,254
Please, come on already.
I want you to talk to him.

190
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:25,626
Walt should. Skyler, better yet. She'll
kick his butt up and down the block.

191
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:27,815
I think
it ought to be you.

192
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:30,155
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

193
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:32,907
Maybe show him
some autopsy pictures.

194
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:35,376
What, autopsy for
a pot overdose? Come on.

195
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:37,547
I don't know, baby.
It's just that, you know...

196
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:40,813
I figure his dad should be the one
doing this thing, don't you think?

197
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:43,541
Hank, he respects you.

198
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:50,480
Yeah, all right. Well, listen,
I'll swing by their place after work.

199
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,436
Good. Scare him straight.

200
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:56,003
Where's my sugar?

201
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:03,069
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am.

202
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,608
You need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

203
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,383
I'm extremely clean.

204
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,935
Yeah, well,
I'd really appreciate it.

205
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:14,549
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

206
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,686
You know, I hid a pair
for you last week, gray ones,

207
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:21,776
but my manager found them, and
we had to put them back on the floor.

208
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:11,365
What do you think?

209
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:12,712
About what?

210
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:16,024
This look
like a nice place?

211
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:17,973
No, not really.

212
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:20,494
Think you'd like
to live here?

213
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:22,252
No.

214
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:25,881
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

215
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:29,365
I thought we were going
to Cold Stone Creamery.

216
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:31,688
Well, a little detour.

217
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:35,243
Figured we'd come over here
and check out how the other half lives.

218
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:38,045
This here's what we call
the Crystal Palace.

219
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,303
Now you know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

220
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:44,460
Nasty, skeevy,
meth-heads

221
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:47,825
who'd sell their grandma's
coochie for a hit.

222
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,758
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

223
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,327
Well, let me tell you something.
Every last one of these

224
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,600
miserable wastes of skin
got started how?

225
00:16:57,802 --> 00:17:00,144
- How do you think they got started?
- I don't know.

226
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,157
What do you think it was they were
all doing before they graduated

227
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,730
to shooting meth in their..?

228
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,039
A gateway drug.

229
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,249
That's what we call it.

230
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,013
Dollars to doughnuts,
and I shit you not,

231
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,447
that gateway drug
was marijuana.

232
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:18,020
Every time.

233
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,136
- You understand?
- Um, yeah.

234
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,275
So why are you
telling me this?

235
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:26,071
'Cause I love you,
you little bastard.

236
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,104
Hey, I was young once,
you know?

237
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,026
The world's a messed up place,
you know?

238
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:35,326
You know,
there was this...

239
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,123
this one time when...
Hey!

240
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:40,090
Hey! Hey, you!

241
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:42,099
Yeah, you, princess!

242
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:43,868
Get over here!

243
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:49,107
Don't make me
get out of the car!

244
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,287
Check this out.

245
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,905
See what I'm talking about.

246
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:01,128
- I ain't holdin', okay?
- Did I say you could open your mouth?

247
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:02,961
And hands of the car.

248
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:06,076
Other side.
Go around the other side.

249
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:07,926
Talk to my friend here.

250
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,027
What's your name,
sweetheart?

251
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:15,192
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?

252
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:17,800
How much you charge
for a windy, Wendy?

253
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:21,070
- I ain't doing him. He's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?

254
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:23,727
Don't think so hard.
It's gonna hurt your brain.

255
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:25,755
Are you on the pipe
or the needle?

256
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,989
Nothing. Neither.

257
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,183
Show us your teeth, huh?

258
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,303
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

259
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:35,830
Oh, God. See that?

260
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:38,033
Pipe. Definitely.

261
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:40,055
Big time. Big time
on the pipe.

262
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:44,017
- You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
- No, not really.

263
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:46,659
You ever smoke
anything else, Wendy?

264
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:48,565
Sausages don't count.

265
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:51,599
Seriously.

266
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,875
Tell my friend here
how you got started.

267
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:56,389
You probably used to be,
what, like, a Girl Scout

268
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:59,474
- Or probably sang in a church choir?
- What are you, like, handicapped?

269
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:01,686
He broke his leg
playing football.

270
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,374
He's a QB.

271
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:05,442
Got an arm
like a howitzer.

272
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:10,059
So tell me, Wendy,
do you smoke pot?

273
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,514
- Why, you got some?
- All right. Hoof it. Get lost.

274
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:17,136
Get out of here. Hey, fair warning!
Next time I'm gonna bust you!

275
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:26,894
So what do you think?

276
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:29,851
Cool.

277
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:40,362
Shut the door.

278
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:41,844
Lock it.
Lock it.

279
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,099
Who the hell was that?

280
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,862
A cop and some football player
messing with me.

281
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:50,312
They ask about me? Huh?

282
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:53,343
No. I think
they just wanted pot.

283
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:12,443
Oh, shit.
I left my root beer.

284
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,705
LET HIM LIVE

285
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:24,884
IT'S THE MORAL THING TO DO

286
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:29,678
WON'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF

287
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:35,966
MURDER IS WRONG!

288
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:47,648
KILL HIM, HE'LL KILL YOU ENTIRE
FAMILY IF YOU LET HIM GO

289
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,249
Hello.

290
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:04,357
Hey, sweetie,
it's me.

291
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,435
Listen, I'm so sorry.

292
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:10,397
The time, it just completely
got away from me there.

293
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:16,900
My fault. My fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late,

294
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:19,530
you know, doing
some inventory, and...

295
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:22,447
I've... I should have just...

296
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,493
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, no!

297
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:29,249
But, um...

298
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:32,852
Sky? You there?

299
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:36,845
You're at the car wash?

300
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:38,974
Yeah.

301
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:42,774
I seriously doubt that,

302
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,567
since you quit two weeks ago.

303
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,252
I called Bogdan,
looking for you.

304
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,723
Quite an earful
he gave me.

305
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,798
Listen...

306
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:06,336
Listen, I'll come home,
and we'll talk about it.

307
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,632
I don't think so, Walt.

308
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:09,601
Honey.

309
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:11,347
Wherever you are...

310
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:14,990
why don't you just
stay there tonight?

311
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:16,068
Skyler?

312
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,571
Skyler?

313
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:21,087
Skyler?

314
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:24,560
Walter!

315
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,782
Kind of hungry
down here!

316
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:34,444
Damn.

317
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:37,801
I didn't think
you were coming back.

318
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:53,868
How long was I out?

319
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,650
10, 15 minutes.

320
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:02,048
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

321
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:04,930
You breathe in the same
thing you used on me?

322
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:15,289
I've got lung cancer.

323
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,103
I'll go make you
another sandwich.

324
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:20,244
It's safe.

325
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:23,340
There's no poison.

326
00:26:24,197 --> 00:26:25,063
Yeah?

327
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,262
Because that'd be
the way to do it...

328
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:31,468
if you're gonna do it.

329
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:34,928
I suppose it would.

330
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:38,879
I mean, you being
a chemist and all.

331
00:26:57,018 --> 00:26:57,855
So...

332
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,020
that name...

333
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:02,653
Krazy-8...

334
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:05,824
Do I really have
to call you that?

335
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:08,024
I mean, no offense, but...

336
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,045
don't you have
a real name?

337
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:13,457
Domingo.

338
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:16,272
Domingo.

339
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:19,661
That's "Sunday, " right?

340
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:25,315
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

341
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:28,642
Yeah, whatever.

342
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:31,314
I can't say
I ever liked it much.

343
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:37,072
So, Domingo...

344
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:41,926
are you from around town
here or some place else?

345
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,549
Walter,
you getting to know me

346
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,530
is not gonna make it
easier for you to kill me.

347
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:50,346
Not that I mind,
you understand.

348
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:54,361
You know,
you keep telling me

349
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,319
that I don't have it in me.
Well, maybe.

350
00:27:58,116 --> 00:27:59,501
But maybe not.

351
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:06,267
I sure as hell am looking
for any reason not to.

352
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:08,739
I mean,
any good reason at all.

353
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:16,955
Sell me.

354
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,833
Tell me what it is.

355
00:28:23,777 --> 00:28:25,727
I guess I'd start off
by promising that,

356
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,071
if you let me go,
I won't come after you.

357
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,773
That you'd be safe.

358
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,873
I guess I'd say what happened
between us...

359
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:34,546
never happened.

360
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:37,995
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

361
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:42,707
But you know that anybody in my
situation would make promises like that.

362
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:45,185
And though in my case
they happen to be true,

363
00:28:45,341 --> 00:28:47,302
you'd never know
for sure.

364
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:52,904
So what else
can I tell you?

365
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:00,303
I don't know.

366
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,271
But you gotta convince me.

367
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,895
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

368
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:12,324
Hey, yeah. Yeah.

369
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:15,587
I'm from here
in town, man.

370
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:18,577
ABQ. Born and bred.

371
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:20,360
Never left.

372
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:24,500
Studied business
administration over at UNM,

373
00:29:25,124 --> 00:29:26,616
got my degree.

374
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:28,535
Really?

375
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:35,073
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

376
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,032
It doesn't hurt.

377
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,626
I was gonna study
music originally.

378
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:44,140
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin or Berklee.

379
00:29:44,412 --> 00:29:47,037
My pops talked me
out of it.

380
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:51,691
Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star,

381
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:54,917
and I didn't have
a snowball chance of that, man.

382
00:29:55,953 --> 00:29:57,722
What does your dad do?

383
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,874
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.

384
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:05,910
Wait a minute.
I know that place.

385
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,399
Wait a minute.
That's...

386
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:12,509
That's that...

387
00:30:13,374 --> 00:30:16,209
They used to have
those late-night...

388
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:19,404
Those stupid commercials.
Yeah, that's him.

389
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:22,972
- He's been doing 'em for over 30 years.
- Wait a minute.

390
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:25,035
How did it go?
It was, uh...

391
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,694
Wait, wait, wait.
It was...

392
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,476
Don't let shopping
Strain your brain-o

393
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:38,000
Just sing this short refrain-o

394
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:41,776
Our forniture is bueno

395
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:45,059
Tampico is the name-o.

396
00:30:55,892 --> 00:30:57,225
Pretty moronic.

397
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:58,798
But what can you do?

398
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:02,686
It did tend
to stick in your head.

399
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:06,914
Did you write that,
being the musician of the family?

400
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,655
Hell, no, man.

401
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,691
It was my crazy Uncle Alex.

402
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:14,195
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

403
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:16,637
In his mind,
it's like saying,

404
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:18,842
"I wrote Stairway to Heaven."

405
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:23,385
Wait a minute.
Tampico Furniture.

406
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,667
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

407
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:32,926
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.

408
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:35,079
We did use
to sell cribs.

409
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:38,726
Oh. Well, a crib, then,
okay? Crib.

410
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:41,296
Yeah. No, I remember that.

411
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:43,071
In fact,

412
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:47,088
I remember recognizing your dad
from those commercials.

413
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,643
Although he wasn't...

414
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,841
anywhere near as friendly
in real life.

415
00:31:51,842 --> 00:31:53,212
Yeah, no shit.

416
00:31:53,753 --> 00:31:56,595
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

417
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:58,513
Yeah, he probably did.

418
00:31:58,882 --> 00:32:01,356
And I was probably
dumb enough to buy it.

419
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:03,413
Yeah, that was
his big thing.

420
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:05,407
You ask him for
a glass of water,

421
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:08,571
he'll tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

422
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,097
- So did you work there, too?
- Only my whole life,

423
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,365
up until the day
I said "fuck you" and quit.

424
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:23,477
So, uh...

425
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:28,787
16 years ago, how old
would you have been?

426
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:32,736
It was after school.
Trust me, I was there.

427
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:35,204
Might have even
helped ring you up.

428
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:38,449
You and your extended
warranty on the crib.

429
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:49,022
Small world.

430
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:52,427
That it is.

431
00:32:54,414 --> 00:32:56,439
The paths we take, huh?

432
00:33:20,212 --> 00:33:21,249
You...

433
00:33:22,508 --> 00:33:24,405
Jesse know you got cancer?

434
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:29,316
No one but you.

435
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,991
Not your family?

436
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:34,164
No.

437
00:33:36,135 --> 00:33:37,201
Why not?

438
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:45,148
Not a conversation I'm even
remotely ready to have.

439
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,681
That's why
you're cooking meth?

440
00:33:51,504 --> 00:33:53,998
You want to leave money
for your family.

441
00:33:56,142 --> 00:33:59,791
Hell, I'll write you a check
right now if you let me go.

442
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:08,033
Like I said, Walter,

443
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,859
this line of work
doesn't suit you, man.

444
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:18,955
Get out
before it's too late.

445
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:27,330
I don't know what to do.

446
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:38,733
Yeah. You do.

447
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:00,133
I'll get the key.

448
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:04,370
No, don't do this.
Don't do this.

449
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:06,300
Why are you doing this?

450
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:09,556
Why are you doing this?

451
00:37:43,418 --> 00:37:45,800
You're doing
the right thing, Walter.

452
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:54,116
Do you want to...

453
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:12,396
So... you're not angry?

454
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,960
How do you mean?

455
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:16,923
Angry?

456
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,171
No.

457
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:21,885
Live and let live, man.

458
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:26,351
That's very understanding.

459
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:28,339
Whatever, man.

460
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,667
I just want to go home.

461
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:38,062
Me, too.

462
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,005
Unlock me, Walter.

463
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,725
The moment I do...

464
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,995
are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

465
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:41,011
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

466
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:55,862
I'm sorry.

467
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:58,388
I'm so sorry.

468
00:41:28,011 --> 00:41:29,280
Hello?

469
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:32,450
Anybody down here?

470
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:41,713
Everybody!

471
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,863
I need you all
to take your seats.

472
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,041
Settle down, please.
Thank you.

473
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:51,769
I understand
that Mr. White

474
00:42:51,787 --> 00:42:54,778
is feeling a little under
the weather this morning,

475
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:57,154
so you folks
are going to have

476
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,800
to be making do with me today.

477
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:02,601
And we are going
to be watching

478
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,721
a very interesting video on...

479
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:07,450
carbon.

480
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,161
Very important stuff.

481
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:16,661
- So what do you think?
- It's a cook site. Gotta be.

482
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:19,911
Nobody came way the hell
out here just to buy.

483
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:23,231
Fire there could have
started by accident.

484
00:43:23,387 --> 00:43:26,359
Don't look like it was
meant to destroy evidence.

485
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:30,012
Got a couple of Dually tracks
headed away towards the road.

486
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:33,349
So, what, they're
in some kind of camper/lab.

487
00:43:33,684 --> 00:43:36,887
They accidentally start a fire,
and everybody F.O.'s?

488
00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:38,526
Yeah, why not?

489
00:43:38,772 --> 00:43:42,357
Except why would that little
hair-gelled shit leave his car?

490
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,321
I-yi-yi, Gomie!

491
00:43:46,676 --> 00:43:48,289
It's a culture in decline.

492
00:43:48,308 --> 00:43:49,879
It's a rich and vibrant culture.

493
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:52,278
It's a car that
jumps up and down.

494
00:43:52,981 --> 00:43:54,273
What the hell?

495
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:57,440
You people used to be conquistadors,
for Christ's sake.

496
00:43:57,507 --> 00:44:01,075
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

497
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:04,007
I already searched it.

498
00:44:07,028 --> 00:44:08,858
You're wasting your time.

499
00:44:09,886 --> 00:44:10,908
Give it up.

500
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:12,595
If this here's a trap car,

501
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:15,872
it's gonna take more than
your dumb white ass to find it.

502
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:19,389
You are talking to the trap car
master, my friend.

503
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:22,805
I'm Rain Man
counting his toothpicks.

504
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,843
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.

505
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,270
Retarded.

506
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:34,995
Yeah, baby.

507
00:44:38,794 --> 00:44:41,013
- Hello, Zippy.
- Asshole!

508
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:44,415
I'd say that looks
like meth, but it's...

509
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:46,288
it's too damn white.

510
00:44:48,606 --> 00:44:50,931
You know what
I'm thinking, Gomie.

511
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:53,417
Somebody
croaked our snitch.

512
00:44:53,518 --> 00:44:54,945
Hey, agents!

513
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:56,679
You got something?

514
00:45:31,803 --> 00:45:33,565
I don't know. Just...

515
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:36,924
Doesn't it seem like...

516
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:38,987
something's missing?

517
00:45:40,439 --> 00:45:42,078
What about the soul?

518
00:45:53,846 --> 00:45:55,274
The soul.

519
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:06,025
There's nothing
but chemistry here.

520
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:12,528
Skyler.

521
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:25,846
There's something
I have to tell you.
