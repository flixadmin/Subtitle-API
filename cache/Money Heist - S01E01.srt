1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,760
Nobody move!

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,720
No!

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,400
My name is Tokyo.

4
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:31,800
But when this story began,
that wasn't my name.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,600
That was me.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,920
<font color="#B20000">SUSPECT'S WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN</font>

7
00:00:36,818 --> 00:00:38,263
And that was the love of my life.

8
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:39,972
<font color="#B20000">ROBBER GETS SHOT DEAD</font>

9
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:42,680
The last time I saw him
I left him in a puddle of blood

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,238
his eyes wide open.

11
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,046
We pulled off 15 perfect heists,

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,435
but mixing love and
business is never a good idea.

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,140
So, when the security guard fired,
I had to switch careers.

14
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:58,382
From thief to murderer.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,520
And that's when I had to run away.

16
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:03,920
In a way, I was dead too.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,440
Well, almost dead.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,600
I had been hiding for 11 days

19
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,199
and my picture was in
every police precint in Spain.

20
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:33,830
I'd get 30 years

21
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:36,345
And to be honest,
growing old in a prison cell

22
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,400
is not my thing

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,360
I'd rather run.

24
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,621
In body and soul.

25
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:45,185
And if I can't take my body with me,

26
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:47,420
"at least let my soul should run."

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,349
I was running out of time, and
there were important things to do.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,400
Only one, really.

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,856
Hello?

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,860
Mom?

31
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,900
Oh, my girl.

32
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:13,275
How are you, sweetheart?

33
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:16,230
What's happening?

34
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,247
You've heard what they said about me?

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,659
On all the news reports.

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,980
Of course I've seen them.

37
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:26,739
So, uh...

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,764
I'm thinking about going on a trip.

39
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:32,684
Maybe get a job on a Chinese boat.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
As a cook.

41
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,823
Didn't you say that
I couldn't even fry an egg?

42
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:37,481
Now I can learn. What do you think?

43
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know, dear.

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,190
What if they only eat Chinese food?

45
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,574
What does this trip mean,

46
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,474
that I won't see you again?

47
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:52,750
Of course not.
We'll see each other.

48
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,857
I'll buy you a ticket so
you can come and visit me.

49
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:00,284
And where is that?

50
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:02,784
The cemetery?

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,383
Are you alone?

52
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:12,255
Mom, are you alone?

53
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,221
Yes.

54
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:16,732
Then go down to the street,
go toward the grocery store.

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,880
I'll find you.

56
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,078
And that day, the day I was going to be slaughtered,

57
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,080
my guardian angel showed up.

58
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,730
You can never know be sure
what a guardian angel will look like,

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,801
but what you'd never expect

60
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,774
is for him to show up
in a '92 SEAT Ibiza.

61
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:37,626
I'm sorry, do you have a second?

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,522
No.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,036
There's an upside to
cooking on a Chinese boat.

64
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,976
You don't have to wash dishes.

65
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,280
For a minute I thought to myself

66
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,168
He's got a point.

67
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:07,833
- Who are you, a cop?
- Wait, wait.

68
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:10,760
You're heading into a slaughter,
a police task force is waiting for you

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,678
and the UIT has been
following you for six days...

70
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:13,961
Why should I believe you?

71
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:16,620
"And that's how I met the Professor,"

72
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:18,852
"by pointing a gun at his balls."

73
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:19,862
May I?

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,009
The good thing about relationships

75
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:24,063
is that we end up forgetting
how they started.

76
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,178
May I?

77
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:41,907
They're already at your mother's house.

78
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:49,674
That's what I wanted to tell you.

79
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,406
I have a business proposal,

80
00:04:56,236 --> 00:04:56,955
a heist,

81
00:04:57,618 --> 00:04:58,678
a heist that's...

82
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:01,936
unique.

83
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm looking for people that...

84
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,990
Well, with not much to lose.

85
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,432
How woud stealing...

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,440
about 2.4 billion euros sound?

87
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,429
No one has ever hit that hard,

88
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,781
Not even in New York,
London, or Monte Carlo.

89
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,600
So if my picture needs
to be in the news again,

90
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,320
at least it'll be for
to the greatest in history.

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,799
<font color="#B20000">WELCOME</font>

92
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:13,951
Welcome everyone

93
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,080
and... I wanted to
thank you all for...

94
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:23,951
agreeing to this offer.

95
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,920
We'll live here,
away from the maddening crowd.

96
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,072
For five months,
we'll spend studying

97
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,840
- how to pull off this heist.
- What do you mean, five months?

98
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:38,232
Are you nuts, or what?

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,080
There are those,
who spend years at school

100
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,960
to get a salary,
which, in even the best scenario,

101
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:51,545
is just a salary, a shitty one.

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,105
What's five months?

103
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,040
I've been thinking about this...

104
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:03,377
for much longer.

105
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
So I don't have to work ever again.

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,349
Nor will you

107
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,873
and nor your children.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,469
Alright.

109
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:26,880
Currently, you don't know each other
and I want to keep it like that.

110
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,920
I don't want to use names,
or personal questions,

111
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,649
And, obviously, no personal relationships.

112
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
I want each of you to pick a name,
something simple.

113
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,720
It can be numbers, planets, cities...

114
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:45,935
- Like "Lord 17, Lady 23."
- We already got a problem.

115
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:49,397
- I can't even remember my phone number.
- You can't even use your phone.

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,640
- Planets?
- I'll be Mars, he's Uranus.

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,880
I'm not Uranus, so just forget it.

118
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,560
- What's wrong with Uranus?
- It sounds like an asshole.

119
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,800
- We'll use cities. Cities.
- Cities, it's all agreed.

120
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:04,044
Good.

121
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,288
And, that's how I started
calling myself Tokyo.

122
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,040
The one looking at
my ass is Mr. Berlin.

123
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,674
There's a warrant for his arrest.

124
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,691
27 robberies.

125
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:17,538
Jewelry stores, auction houses
and armored vehicles.

126
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:20,290
His biggest score,
Champs Elysees, in Paris.

127
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,072
434 diamonds.

128
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:24,215
He's like a shark inside a pool.

129
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,999
You can swim with him,
but you're always nervous.

130
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:28,702
He was in charge of the heist.

131
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:31,399
The one coughing is Mr Moscow.

132
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,440
The first thing he dug was a mine,
in Asturias.

133
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,214
Later on, he figured out that
he'd go further by digging up.

134
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:42,120
Six fur shops, three watch shops
and the Royal Credit Union of Avilés.

135
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,842
He's an expert with the thermal lance
and any industrial tool.

136
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,642
The one behind Moscow is Denver, his son.

137
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,952
Drugs, busted teeth, broken ribs.

138
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,175
He's the king of bar fights.

139
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:56,637
Pure hot blooded.

140
00:08:57,261 --> 00:08:59,539
Perfect for a heist,
but, a time bomb.

141
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,440
Rio. He's my weakness.

142
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,729
He's the Mozart of computers.

143
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,520
He's been coding since he was six and knows
everything about alarms and electronics.

144
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,240
As for everthing else
it's like he was been born yesterday.

145
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:19,121
And there you have the twins,
Helsinki and Oslo.

146
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:22,739
Even with the most bulletproof plan
soldiers are neceesary.

147
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:24,801
And what's better than two Serbs.

148
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:27,796
It's possible they can think,
but, frankly, we'll never know.

149
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
Nairobi,

150
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,865
hopeless optimist.

151
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,800
She's been counterfeiting
banknotes since age 13.

152
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,800
And now she's our quality control manager.

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,834
It's possible that she's nuts,
but she's so damned funny.

154
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:45,640
To think that every day
the news will be talking about us.

155
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:49,000
And every family in this
country will be asking

156
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
what are they doing now.

157
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,920
And you know what they'll be thinking?

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,553
Those Motherfuckers!
I wish I thought of that first.

159
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:02,698
The Professor:
no criminal record.

160
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:05,473
Hasn't renewed his ID since he was 19.

161
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:10,517
For all intents and purposes, a ghost,
but a very smart ghost.

162
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:14,401
Because we're not stealing their money...
It's not theirs.

163
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:18,591
And for that very reason alone
they're gonna like us.

164
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,711
And that's imperative.

165
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,410
It's absolutely critical that we
have positive public opinion.

166
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,362
We'll be the fucking heroes
of the entire nation.

167
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,810
But be very careful,

168
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:37,900
because the second any blood
is shed, and this is very important,

169
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:40,320
if there's one single victim,

170
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,240
we'll no longer be Robin Hoods but
just a bunch of plain motherfucking punks

171
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,271
Professor.

172
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:50,486
Yes, Tokyo.

173
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,360
What are we robbing?

174
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:02,749
The Royal Mint of Spain.

175
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,920
<font color="#B20000">DAY OF THE ROBBERY
FRIDAY 8:35 A.M.</font>

176
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:28,962
Who chose these?

177
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:31,600
- What's wrong with the masks?
- They're not scary.

178
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,384
In every movie the
robbers wear scary masks.

179
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,092
Zombies, skeletons,
Angel of death, I mean...

180
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,903
I assure you that a nutjob with
a gun is scarier than a skeleton.

181
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:45,606
- That's enough.
- Who's the dude with the mustache?

182
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,840
Dalí, son, he was a Spanish painter.
A very good one.

183
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,920
- A painter.
- Yes.

184
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,720
- A painter that paints.
- Yes.

185
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,141
Do you know what's really scary?
Little kids dolls.

186
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:01,720
Those are scary.

187
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:03,680
What dolls?

188
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,880
Goofy, Pluto, Mickey Mouse, all of those.

189
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,560
So a mouse with big ears is scarier,
that's what you're saying?

190
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,354
Yes, bastard.
Do you want a kick in the nuts?

191
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,720
- Hey!
- I'm right. Listen.

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,767
If a some clown with a gun goes anywhere
wearing a Mickey Mouse mask

193
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,360
people will think he's a pyscho

194
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,214
and he want's a bloodbath.
And you know why?

195
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,760
Because weapons and children

196
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,950
are two things
you never put together, dad.

197
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,567
Right?

198
00:13:25,884 --> 00:13:28,070
Well, if you see it that
way it's, more dangerous,

199
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,539
more twisted.

200
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:32,914
Then a Jesus mask would be
terrifying, he's even more innocent.

201
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:36,280
That's like the old saying "Better
two guns than a crucifix", right?

202
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:38,363
- Like a saint with two guns.
- What's the difference?

203
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,920
It was obvious that this
gang needed more women.

204
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,191
A woman can spend two days
choosing shoes for a wedding,

205
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,069
but wouldn't spend a minute
arguing over masks for a robbery.

206
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,855
Everything we had planned was starting now

207
00:14:10,156 --> 00:14:11,513
and in those microseconds

208
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,044
I thought of all the
innocent people

209
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:16,228
whose lives will come to a
sudden stop because of us.

210
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,161
<font color="#B20000">E-80 LOCAL ROAD</font>

211
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:29,988
The Professor knew
there was only one way

212
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:32,403
to enter the Royal Mint
with a three ton arsenal

213
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:35,113
And it was through the truck
that came in each week

214
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,691
with the new rolls of
currency paper ready to print.

215
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,614
And that was exactly what we were doing,

216
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,306
get all the way in,
escorted by the National Police.

217
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:58,153
"In Spain, anything that has a double
escort means it's heavily protected."

218
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:05,766
"But if you prevent any radio or
phone communication from happening"

219
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:06,487
Center...

220
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,891
"and you point five assault rifles
into the heads of two 26-year-old kids,"

221
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:11,060
Get out of the car!

222
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:12,944
"regardless of how well armed they are,"

223
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,508
"they will do exactly the same
that any of us would do."

224
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,650
I told you get out, damn it!
Out of the fucking car!

225
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,913
"They'll shit ther pants."

226
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:20,820
You'll do what I tell
you, you understand!

227
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,887
"Courage and heroism come with a price,"

228
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,227
"and it's much higher than the
1,600 euros made each month"

229
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:28,395
- "by a guy in a uniform..."
- Open the door, do you hear me?

230
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,614
"...or by a truck driver."

231
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,360
For fucks sake, open it!

232
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:37,560
If those men had their daughters
inside the back of the truck,

233
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,399
they would never have opened it,

234
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:42,380
but who cares about some
rolls of watermarked paper?

235
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,060
Hurry!

236
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,710
Hurry! Move, dude! Come on!

237
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:50,588
Get your ass in there.

238
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:53,400
Close your eyes. Go.

239
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:54,704
Go. Go. Go.

240
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,874
Sit there. Now the three of you
keep quiet or I'll smash your heads.

241
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:03,087
You'll be driving with a
gun pointed to your kidneys.

242
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:06,080
So when they call you on the radio
to check how everything is going,

243
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:08,602
you'll answer calmly,
and say everything is going well.

244
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:10,840
Is that clear?

245
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:17,360
And in the middle of
the chaos with the guns

246
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:20,421
I remembered that the night before
I got a marriage proposal

247
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,023
and that I decided to
focus on other things.

248
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:27,363
Of course, if you think about it,
you'll never find a good day for a heist.

249
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,776
Alright, you know what you have to do.

250
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:32,336
Don't take your eyes off the girl.

251
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:34,955
There can be no mistakes, are we clear?

252
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:36,760
She's 17.

253
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:39,176
I think I can handle her.

254
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,643
Can I sit next to you?

255
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:27,622
Sure.

256
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:40,320
Hello.

257
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:43,573
Hi.

258
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:50,349
You want to hang out?

259
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,150
Yeah, right. I get it. I'll go.

260
00:17:58,307 --> 00:17:59,041
No, no.

261
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,979
I don't have to think it over.

262
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:05,800
Yeah.

263
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,067
Alright kids, we've arrived at the Mint.

264
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:42,121
We'll go directly to the museum lobby,

265
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:43,901
where we'll wait for the rest of the class.

266
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:47,025
Everyone be careful getting
off the bus and stay together.

267
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,080
And this is the front entrance
of the Royal Mint. Go on inside.

268
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:07,359
The little lamb just entered.

269
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:10,713
Perfect.

270
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:13,800
Berlin, it's your turn.

271
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,237
Now, be very careful with what you do next.

272
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:26,793
What's up, Javi? Where's Rafa?

273
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:28,377
He changed his shift.

274
00:19:36,764 --> 00:19:39,560
That's very good. Relax.

275
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,641
Alright, everyone come through.

276
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,490
Your credentials must
be visible at all times.

277
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:49,921
This let's security know that you
have permission to be on the premises.

278
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:54,846
So put them around your necks, and save
your questions until we're inside, please.

279
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:58,997
Everyone stay together and make
sure you're on your best behavior.

280
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,153
Don't turn around.

281
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:18,011
When you're this close,
I can barely stand to breathe.

282
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:19,734
Well, breathe,

283
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:23,280
because in nine months
you won't be able to breathe at all.

284
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,117
Go ahead.

285
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:40,610
These must be visible
at all times, alright kids.

286
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,463
Credentials around the neck.
Lower your voice.

287
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:52,551
Berlin, camera on your left.

288
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,675
You have nothing to say?

289
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:22,926
I tell you that I'm pregnant,
and you don't say anything?

290
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:23,860
What should I do Monica,

291
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:25,800
call my wife, tell her
to go pick up the kids

292
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,836
and we can all go celebrate together?
For God's sakes!

293
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,680
Go, go, go. Okay,
okay, that's it.

294
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:35,250
 Keep going. Okay. Go, go.

295
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,800
<font color="#B20000">ACCESS TO SECURITY SYSTEM</font>

296
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:42,087
Ready, Tokyo?

297
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,520
<font color="#B20000">ACCESS TO ALARM SYSTEM</font>

298
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,800
Yes!

299
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:53,995
- Alarms disconnected.
- Now.

300
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,195
Just yesterday you were saying
that you couldn't stand her any longer,

301
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,495
you were having problems.

302
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,308
Yes, like any other
couple, Mónica,

303
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,920
Same problems as any
marriage that has three kids,

304
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:11,257
not that I was leaving her.

305
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,578
Mónica, I have three kids,

306
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:25,178
all through artificial
insemination.

307
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,291
For more than 20 years I've been
having infertile sex with my wife

308
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,379
and now you're telling me this.

309
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:33,545
Who are you, Shiva,
the goddess of fertility.

310
00:22:52,193 --> 00:22:53,280
What are you implying?

311
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:55,349
I'm not here looking for child support.

312
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:58,394
Nor a divorce,

313
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,704
or any kind of paternity test, either.

314
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,925
I thought we were in love.

315
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,817
And...

316
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:16,133
And I was happy with that.

317
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:22,396
I realize that this won't be easy

318
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,840
but I'm sure it's what I want.

319
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:44,798
Hold on!

320
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:48,169
What? You want to know what
I'm going to do with your child?

321
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
That's it, isn't it?

322
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:51,992
Listen to me, don't
get carried away.

323
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,951
Don't move!

324
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:00,603
Don't do it.

325
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,840
Don't move or I'll blow you in half!

326
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:22,539
Stay calm! Stay calm!

327
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,291
Let's go, let's go.

328
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:25,445
Hurry!

329
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:27,026
Quiet!

330
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:34,793
Stay there!

331
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:42,287
Go. This way.

332
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,034
Let's go.

333
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:53,240
As you can see, this wonderful
stairway is made of marble and granite...

334
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,240
Don't move!

335
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:07,107
Stop! Go back!
Come on!

336
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:11,767
Professor, we have a problem.

337
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:13,764
I can't find the little lamb.

338
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,498
I don't see her! Fuck!

339
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,184
Alright, Miss Parker,

340
00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:20,305
where did you go?

341
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Come on! Hurry! Let's go!

342
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,158
Wait.

343
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:02,236
Okay.

344
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,110
Yeah, okay.

345
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm going too fast. I know.

346
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:14,280
We should capture this moment, right?

347
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:21,792
Come on. Let's take a picture of this.

348
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:28,021
In here? It's kind of gross?

349
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,035
This is our first date.

350
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:39,522
You're beautiful, you know that?

351
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:43,899
I can't find the girl.
I can't fucking find her.

352
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,930
Unbutton your shirt to make it sexier.

353
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,953
It's on your phone.
You can delete it, if you want.

354
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:55,999
Do it. This is just for us.

355
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:00,541
Come on, this is great.

356
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:02,175
Ready?

357
00:27:16,423 --> 00:27:18,958
With this photo you'll be
killing it on the Internet.

358
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,310
Give it back! Give me the phone!

359
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:24,122
Give me the phone!

360
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,480
Give me the fucking phone!
Give me the phone!

361
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,160
Give me the fucking phone!

362
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,379
First things first...

363
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:20,775
Greetings.

364
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,513
I am the man in charge.

365
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:34,088
And I want to start...

366
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,241
by offering my apologies.

367
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,640
This is not a good way
to end your week.

368
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,529
But you're here as our hostages.

369
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:50,851
Cellphone.

370
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:53,677
Follow our instructions and you'll be safe.

371
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:55,699
- Name.
- Alison Parker.

372
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,030
- PIN.
- 2018.

373
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:02,441
Cellphone.

374
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
It's okay, it's okay.

375
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:09,872
PIN.

376
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:12,132
But, why do you need the PIN?

377
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,720
Give the fucking PIN or I
beat it out of you. You decide.

378
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:18,838
How many months?

379
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,119
Eight.

380
00:29:21,316 --> 00:29:22,053
Eight months.

381
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:24,938
- PIN.
- 1234.

382
00:29:28,528 --> 00:29:31,083
You think that you're clever,
but that's your shitty PIN number.

383
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,252
What an idiot. Name.

384
00:29:32,573 --> 00:29:33,701
- Arturo.
- Arturo what?

385
00:29:33,726 --> 00:29:36,136
- Arturo Román.
- Arturo Román, got it. Arturito.

386
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:37,638
Arturito.

387
00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:40,231
You're our safe passage,
so I will protect you.

388
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,040
Hey...

389
00:29:48,962 --> 00:29:51,240
Give me your hands. Relax.

390
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:54,057
Relax. Relax.

391
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,134
What's your name?

392
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,840
Ariadna.

393
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:05,482
Ariadna.

394
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,123
Come with me, dear.

395
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,279
It's okay.

396
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,467
Feel my hands.

397
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:13,896
Are these the
hands of a monster?

398
00:30:14,488 --> 00:30:15,178
- No.
- No.

399
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:17,120
Because I'm not a monster.

400
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:20,627
I know exactly how you feel.

401
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:25,841
Dry mouth, out of breath...
You need to try to calm down. Breathe.

402
00:30:26,438 --> 00:30:27,190
Breathe.

403
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:29,720
Breathe.

404
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,340
That's it, please. Everybody breathe now.

405
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:34,540
Breathe.

406
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:35,700
Slowly.

407
00:30:36,693 --> 00:30:37,781
Everybody.

408
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:42,400
Take control of your breathing.
Trust me, you'll be alright.

409
00:30:43,894 --> 00:30:45,976
That's it.
That's it.

410
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,694
Miss Mónica Gaztambide, please?

411
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:55,517
Don't move. Please, don't move.

412
00:30:56,448 --> 00:30:58,863
They won't touch us.
Stay very still.

413
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:00,470
- Stay quiet.
- Okay.

414
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:05,720
Miss Mónica Gaztambide, would
you be so kind as to step forward?

415
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:09,767
Right here.

416
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,964
You're the man, Papa!

417
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:04,720
You're the bomb!

418
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,145
You could sleep great in here, papa.

419
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:45,710
Like a king.

420
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:48,240
Papa, papa papa.

421
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:51,560
To fuck a chick. Right here, boom!

422
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Boom, boom...

423
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,840
Stop fooling around like that
and let's get to work. Come on.

424
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:58,793
This smells fucking great.

425
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:01,010
Better than roasted lamb,
like you used to cook.

426
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:02,952
- Come lie down here.
- Quit it, will you!

427
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:04,855
When have you had
a bed like this before?

428
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,188
Not in your jail cell.

429
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:09,544
You see where we are, papa?
We're the on top now.

430
00:33:09,716 --> 00:33:12,396
- We're very big.
- Listen, kid. Don't be mistaken.

431
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,460
We're very small.

432
00:33:18,254 --> 00:33:19,154
What else can you do?

433
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:21,337
Have you ever had a proper job?

434
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:23,766
Have you ever put together
a resume and sent it out?

435
00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:25,857
Exactly. Come on.

436
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,040
You said a resume.

437
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:34,175
Why would I need that?

438
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,880
To get you out of jail, old man?

439
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:49,563
And do you think that I'm proud of that?

440
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,760
Of being in and out of prison for 12 years.

441
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:56,505
Want to know why?

442
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,440
Alright.

443
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,205
Because I'm not too smart, son.

444
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:05,902
And neither are you.

445
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,390
But on this job, someone
else is putting up the brains.

446
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:13,492
And if we're lucky
and you don't fool around,

447
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:15,684
you'll get out of here
with your life sorted out.

448
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:17,959
- I don't fool around.
- Come on, damn it. Let's go.

449
00:34:18,745 --> 00:34:19,285
Fill them up.

450
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,871
Answer the phone and
convince whoever is calling that

451
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:30,165
we are shut down due to
a technical problem. Got it?

452
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:31,126
Yes.

453
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:37,901
I have no choice but
to point a gun at you.

454
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:40,573
- Can you feel it?
- Yes.

455
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:42,200
Alright.

456
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:45,448
Now.

457
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:54,894
Royal Mint, can I help you?

458
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:59,224
I'm sorry, Arturo can't
be reached at the moment.

459
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:02,611
The system is down.

460
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:05,161
No, I can't leave right now.

461
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:08,158
No, he's not able
to answer the phone.

462
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:11,142
No, it's not possible.

463
00:35:11,806 --> 00:35:12,142
No...

464
00:35:15,258 --> 00:35:17,523
Look, I don't know
where he is right now,

465
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,256
I don't know if he's
somewhere in the Mint,

466
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,773
the museum, or the cafeteria,
anywhere! We're busy around here, lady!

467
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:34,786
That performance deserves
an Oscar, Miss Gaztambide.

468
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:50,273
20 minutes in,

469
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:52,808
we started wiring our
analogue communication

470
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:54,533
system to talk to the Professor.

471
00:35:56,606 --> 00:36:01,776
Cellphone free, no radio frequencies,
so no one can hear us.

472
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,574
We sealed all doors
and the alarms hadn't gone off yet.

473
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:07,492
We were in a time limbo,

474
00:36:08,046 --> 00:36:10,976
without anyone knowing
that we seized the Royal Mint.

475
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,316
And during that sweet
calm before the storm,

476
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:17,055
it simply seemed like

477
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:19,287
just another day.

478
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:34,640
You're a handsome guy.

479
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,000
Who is it?

480
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:58,361
It's me, let me in.

481
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,440
What are you doing, Rio? If the Professor
catches us, he'll kill us, you know?

482
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,240
I know, Come here.
I have to talk to you. Come here.

483
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,285
- What's going on?
- Sit down.

484
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:20,895
What is it?

485
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,109
The heist is tomorrow.

486
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,010
And we have no fucking
idea what will happen.

487
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:32,044
I want you to know
I'm serious about you

488
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:32,725
and...

489
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:37,651
I completely understand that,
that you're a little older, and...

490
00:37:39,263 --> 00:37:42,000
and it's possible you want
something more serious.

491
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,022
That's why I want to give you this.

492
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:53,242
I didn't get you a ring
because we're stuck in here,

493
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,975
but when we get out of here
I'll get you a big-ass ring.

494
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:58,752
You'll carry your hand
in a wheelbarrow. You'll see.

495
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:01,284
Is that right?

496
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:05,189
What's this?
An engagement dog tag?

497
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:07,388
Now at least you'll know my real name.

498
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,480
But we're not allowed
to know each other's names.

499
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,927
Well, don't look at it.

500
00:38:15,122 --> 00:38:15,724
But it's yours.

501
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:20,167
How do I tell you this?

502
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:27,680
What we've got has been
very good, okay? Awesome.

503
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:30,932
We've been together a few nights...

504
00:38:30,987 --> 00:38:35,200
A few nights? Every night...
Except for what, four or five...

505
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,787
Yeah, well.

506
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,154
I don't think we're
meant for each other.

507
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:44,630
- Isn't the sex good?
- Yes, the sex is very good.

508
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:45,843
Well, that's a start, right?

509
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:49,086
But it takes more than
good sex for it to work.

510
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,602
Is this because I'm 12
years younger than you?

511
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,160
I'm getting
300 million euros.

512
00:38:57,655 --> 00:38:59,061
I'm not a kid, my life is all set.

513
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,299
Really, Rio, I wish
there was love, but...

514
00:39:01,324 --> 00:39:06,000
Hey. Don't say that. There was
love, really. I was there, I saw.

515
00:39:14,943 --> 00:39:15,669
There's someone else?

516
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,201
He's gone.

517
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:23,280
Look, Rio,

518
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,784
when this is all over,
We'll go together to Tahiti

519
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:31,440
and we'll see how that works, tomorrow
I need to focus on only one thing:

520
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:32,960
staying alive.

521
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,520
Rio.

522
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,802
Rio, no. No, no.

523
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:27,157
One of the phones is on.

524
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:29,532
Turn it off.

525
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:44,992
Okay, the vault is open.

526
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:49,564
Put on your vest and be ready to go out.

527
00:40:50,295 --> 00:40:51,810
Then we'll activate the alarm.

528
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,509
Berlin, get ready to open up the doors.

529
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,720
Hostages, for your own safety,
move three steps to the back!

530
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,995
A little bit more. Here. That's it.

531
00:41:05,432 --> 00:41:08,150
There you go. Everything will be all right.

532
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:11,436
A little bit closer.
Everything's going to be okay.

533
00:41:22,428 --> 00:41:24,661
Shh. Relax

534
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,880
Relax. I'm looking at the bags.
They're filled with cash.

535
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,840
They're gonna clear out of here in no time.

536
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,295
We have a 10-33 at the Royal Mint.

537
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:00,725
Z24 on our way.
We'll be there in two minutes."

538
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:01,720
Two minutes.

539
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,203
Two minutes.

540
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:11,279
- Why is the alarm on?
- I don't know.

541
00:42:12,802 --> 00:42:14,720
They're just standing there,
not doing anything.

542
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:17,408
- Why don't they just leave?
- I can't tell!

543
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,679
One minute, 40 seconds.

544
00:42:23,655 --> 00:42:24,440
One minute and...

545
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:30,778
What's your name?

546
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:33,680
Arturo.

547
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:35,389
Arturo, is it?

548
00:42:35,535 --> 00:42:37,040
Yes. No, I haven't
seen anything!

549
00:42:37,065 --> 00:42:39,293
I haven't seen anything, I swear,
I haven't seen anything!

550
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:40,812
- Look at me.
- Please.

551
00:42:41,382 --> 00:42:43,080
Arturo, come on. Look at me.

552
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,695
- Look at me, look at me.
- I haven't seen anything!

553
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,200
Hey, hey, come on. Hey.

554
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:54,906
Do you like movies?

555
00:42:59,445 --> 00:42:59,851
Do you?

556
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,960
Yes, I'm fond of movies.

557
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:11,080
Okay. Have you noticed
how in horror movies

558
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,840
in the beginning, there
is always a nice guy,

559
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,160
and you say: "He's
going to get himself killed",

560
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,027
Yes.

561
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,360
- and then it happens.
- No...

562
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,558
 The man's killed.

563
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,440
Arturo, trust me, you're
gonna get yourself killed.

564
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,880
- Z24 to central, we're 30 seconds away.
- 30 seconds.

565
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:41,680
30 seconds.

566
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:46,089
Listen. It's absolutely imperative

567
00:43:46,114 --> 00:43:48,105
that the police don't have
any idea what we're doing.

568
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,178
We'll have them think it's just a robbery,

569
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,811
that we were caught fleeing with
the money and everything went south,

570
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:59,316
that we pulled our guns, and opened fire
at point-blank range, we had no choice...

571
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:01,588
but retreat.

572
00:44:03,898 --> 00:44:06,791
And then, without having hurt

573
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,974
anyone,

574
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:11,955
we go back inside.

575
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:16,816
Let them think that we're cornered.

576
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:19,751
Let them think we're improvising.

577
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:20,938
Now!

578
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,800
Tokyo! Tokyo, wait, damn it!

579
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,960
Tokyo!

580
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:31,456
Go out, toss the
money in the air,

581
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:34,402
fire toward the ground
and get back inside.

582
00:44:34,511 --> 00:44:36,489
I'd heard that more than 30 times.

583
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:42,014
But what the Professor never told us

584
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:43,920
is that they would also fire back

585
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,080
Rio, Rio!

586
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,160
Damn it to hell!

587
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,440
Holy shit!

588
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,400
You know it! It was
the first fucking rule!

589
00:45:45,624 --> 00:45:46,452
Fuck!

590
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,020
Rio.

591
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,520
Fuckers!

592
00:46:08,758 --> 00:46:11,006
requesting immediate
backup at the Royal Mint.

593
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:14,611
We've received hostile fire. Man down.
I repeat, man down.

594
00:46:16,168 --> 00:46:19,840
The bullet of an M16 bullet
shoots out at 2,100 MPH

595
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:22,996
Faster than the speed of sound.

596
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,760
So if they shot you in the heart,

597
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:29,403
you won't even hear
the bullet that killed you.

598
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,138
That's how I knew that I fucked it all up,

599
00:46:34,137 --> 00:46:35,600
in one microsecond

600
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:38,360
and the same way as always.
