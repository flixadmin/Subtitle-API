1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,969
My name is oliver queen.

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,404
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:08,240
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:09,975
To save my city.

5
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,077
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:15,447
To them, I am oliver queen.

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,150
To the rest
of starling city,

8
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,918
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,421
I am something else.

10
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,056
Previously, on "arrow"...

11
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:26,325
My sister. She was murdered,
and I can't tell anyone.

12
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:29,027
See, before, laurel, you were swinging
at your sister's killer.

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,897
Don't train for that. All right,
train for yourself.

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,333
Oliver: The serum that
you were exposed to,

15
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:37,169
It changes your body
but it also warps your mind.

16
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,870
You're not moving
very quickly this morning.

17
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,373
I just didn't sleep
much last night.

18
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,678
What are you doing here?

19
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,356
Oliver: Roy!

20
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,791
Where'd you go?

21
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:00,726
Sorry.

22
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,627
Get your head
in the game.

23
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,299
So is the culebra cartel and their
gajillion pounds of heroin.

24
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,000
They all showed up
about 30 minutes ago

25
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,303
And they haven't moved
from your location.

26
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,604
Oliver:
Copy that.

27
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:13,939
No sentries
outside.

28
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,241
If we're going to do this,
we need to do it now.

29
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,610
I've got north entrance,
dig's got south.

30
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,011
Roy...
East.

31
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,380
The roof.

32
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,781
You're on
over watch.

33
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,150
The culebras get their weapons
from the bratva.

34
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,185
All military grade.

35
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,687
I've got your backs.

36
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,423
Let's do this.

37
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,960
South is clear.

38
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:38,263
Nobody's home.

39
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,869
Roof's clear.

40
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,572
North is empty, too.

41
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,107
That doesn't make sense.
They all showed up

42
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,475
Half an hour ago
and never left.

43
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,645
They are in there somewhere.
[beep]

44
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,293
Looks like somebody
beat us here.

45
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,297
There's at least a few million
dollars worth of heroin.

46
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,673
[speaking spanish]

47
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,142
He took paco.

48
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,213
Whoever did this
ignored the drugs,

49
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,315
Took a gang member.

50
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,918
This was personal.

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,686
Yeah, more than that.

52
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:38,290
Whoever did this was
trying to send a message.

53
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,661
I think I know
what it is.

54
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,444
Guilty. Well, yeah.

55
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,113
The culebras are the bloodiest
gang in starling.

56
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,381
Who's the second bloodiest?

57
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,450
Culebras have a long standing rivalry
with the los halcones.

58
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,819
Thought you said this was
personal, not business.

59
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:11,223
There are only 86,000
pacos in starling,

60
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,757
Give or take 5,000
for a few nicknames.

61
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,292
Something tells me
that the culebra's

62
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,495
Long standing rivals will
narrow that down for us.

63
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:18,930
You know, when we find paco, he'll be
too dead to say anything.

64
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,267
I'm not looking for him. I'm looking
for whoever did this.

65
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,702
I will handle this.

66
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,104
Take the rest of the night.
I'll back you up.

67
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,506
Not dead on your feet,
you won't.

68
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,575
I'm sorry. I know I've been a
little out of it recently.

69
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,511
Don't be sorry.
Be rested.

70
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:39,618
If I let you get killed because
your reaction time is slow, ok?

71
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,923
There are a lot of halcones
members in starling city.

72
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:48,727
How about I take the ones north
of tenth street.

73
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,202
Oliver: You know, we've been
waiting here an hour.

74
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,572
After walking around
the block five times.

75
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,874
We need to work
on your patience.

76
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,377
Where is this guy?
And more importantly,

77
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,046
How is he going to help us
find out what this...

78
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,948
China white person is--

79
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,383
Chien na wei.
Whatever!

80
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,753
How is he going to help us find out what
she's doing in hong kong?

81
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,755
Waller hasn't been able
to locate chien na wei

82
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,725
Because she avoids using any
traceable forms of communication.

83
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,294
So he's the target now?

84
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,129
He's her delivery guy.

85
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,131
Her courier. But
he's not a target.

86
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,899
Waller doesn't want
you to kill him.

87
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,669
That's refreshing.

88
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,270
They'll use
a dead drop.

89
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,006
Leave behind information
for chien's network.

90
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,741
Information
waller intercepts.

91
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,643
I see him.

92
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,950
Stay on bluetooth.

93
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,553
I'll be right
behind you.

94
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,026
Ahh!
What was that?

95
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,528
Did he make you?

96
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,698
Yeah, I think he did.

97
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,881
He's gone.
Where is it?

98
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,750
Where's what?
The envelope.

99
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,051
The message.
We need it!

100
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,921
He must have stashed it somewhere
while you were chasing him.

101
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,389
I didn't see him
stash anything!

102
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:28,893
Yes, you did. You just don't
know it yet.

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,864
That's not bad.

104
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,500
Yeah. It's better
than I thought.

105
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:43,642
What the hell
was that?!

106
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,143
Today's lesson.
Fighting's about

107
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:49,381
Being surprised and not getting rattled.
You look rattled.

108
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,682
Try angry.

109
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,150
Another lesson, then.

110
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,819
It's not about you getting
knocked to the mat.

111
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,254
It's if you get up.

112
00:05:56,256 --> 00:06:00,625
Okay, fine.
Then let's go again.

113
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,827
Not tonight.
All right?

114
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,729
I got to
close up shop.

115
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,198
And you need to
get some rest.

116
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Let those
muscles recover.

117
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,603
Make sure you get some protein
within the hour, all right?

118
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,606
Yeah, egg whites.
They're my new bff.

119
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,608
Oh, that's disgusting.

120
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,344
No, no, no,
two blocks from here--

121
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,445
Korean tacos.

122
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,147
Korean tacos?
Trust me.

123
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:26,451
They're heaven.
Come on, I'm buying.

124
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,054
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

125
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,488
You just did.

126
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,723
Kidding. What?

127
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,491
You know how to do
a blood test, right?

128
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,061
I know just enough
to make me dangerous.

129
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,762
And, well, me holding a syringe,

130
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,365
Well, that makes me
more dangerous.

131
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,566
Why?

132
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,101
I need you
to test my blood.

133
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,570
For what?
And don't say stds,

134
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,106
Because that would
be crossing a line.

135
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,574
For mirakuru.

136
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,177
I don't need to check you for
traces of mirakuru.

137
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,878
You were cured.

138
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,779
I know, I--

139
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,681
If this is about
your sleep problems,

140
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,283
Mirakuru makes people
crazy strong

141
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,653
And crazy crazy. It doesn't make it
hard for them to get 8 hours.

142
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,154
Could you just...

143
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,457
Are you ok?

144
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,660
I mean, besides the whole
not sleeping thing.

145
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,096
Totally.
I'm fine.

146
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm just looking for reasons
to help me sleep, you know?

147
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,268
Ok.

148
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,748
I'm looking for a crew member
named paco.

149
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,015
Emilio?
Paco!

150
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,550
That's what
they call him, ese!

151
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,019
Paco's his street name!
Who?!

152
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,654
Emilio.

153
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,823
Emilio ortega.

154
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,426
Thank you.

155
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,928
Felicity, I have a name.

156
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,064
Emilio ortega.

157
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,000
Pinging his cell's gps.

158
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,302
He's in the glades.

159
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,438
Ninth and hasen.

160
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,637
Why'd you kill
all those men?

161
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,739
What the hell are
you talking about?

162
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,007
What are you doing?!

163
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,308
Get out of here.

164
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,977
Oh, my god.

165
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,245
Now, laurel!

166
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,113
No!

167
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,583
Ted didn't do this.
Ted's been with me

168
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,085
For the past two hours.
He trained with me,

169
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,221
And then we went for dinner.

170
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,722
And that...

171
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,059
He wasn't here when we left.

172
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:57,535
Ok, that is ten minutes of my life
I am never getting back.

173
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,770
I'm clean?

174
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,105
Your cholesterol is a little high
for someone of your age,

175
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,608
But absolutely zero
mirakuru serum.

176
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,109
Congratulations.

177
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,477
Ahh, thank god.

178
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,347
Ok, you're acting like
I just told you

179
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:12,016
That the biopsy
came back negative.

180
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,551
What is going on?

181
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,553
It's--it's stupid.

182
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,222
You just had me
test your blood

183
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,691
For a serum you were
cured of six months ago.

184
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,459
I already knew it was stupid.

185
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,995
The reason I haven't
been sleeping

186
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,098
Is 'cause I've been
having dreams,

187
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,733
And not normal ones.

188
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,070
It was like I was remembering
the time I was out,

189
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:32,971
You know?

190
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,406
When slade oded me
on the mirakuru.

191
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,608
What do you remember?

192
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,411
Nothing much.
Just a feeling.

193
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,115
A feeling
of being...

194
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,717
Not me.

195
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:49,621
And being strong
and out of control,

196
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:52,423
But here's the thing--

197
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,426
In those dreams...

198
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,596
I killed sara.

199
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,999
This really had you worried?

200
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:04,802
Because the dreams, they didn't feel
like dreams, felicity.

201
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,437
They felt like memories.

202
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:11,509
I actually remembered throwing
arrows into her.

203
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,278
Crazy, right?

204
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,446
[chuckles]

205
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,649
Yeah.

206
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,785
Crazy.

207
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,987
Quentin:
So that's it?

208
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,756
I was with him
the whole time.

209
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,292
You can put me on the box
if you'd like.

210
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,294
If I wanted to give my
daughter a polygraph,

211
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,663
I'd have done it back when
you discovered beer.

212
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,732
So listen,
what's the story

213
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,601
With you and this guy,
anyway?

214
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,936
He's just my trainer.

215
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,204
Who you went to dinner with?
As friends.

216
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,774
But I know him, and he would
never do something like this.

217
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,108
Well, we've got
to hold him here

218
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,677
Till the coroner's official
findings come back,

219
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,445
And then if they're consistent
with his story,

220
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,348
We'll cut him loose.

221
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,931
Well...
Well...

222
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,700
It's like I said.

223
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:09,767
He didn't do it.

224
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,469
Why would a mass murderer

225
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,870
String up a body in his gym?

226
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,939
Ted caters to a pretty
rough clientele.

227
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,308
A lot of career
criminals,

228
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,609
Gangbangers.

229
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,511
He runs afoul of one
every now and again.

230
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,648
He thinks someone was trying
to send him a message.

231
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,250
Who? He says he doesn't know.

232
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,919
I want to talk to him.

233
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:33,191
Two weeks ago, I said
I wouldn't train you to fight.

234
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,692
Now you have a trainer.

235
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,862
Who's training me to box,
to let off some steam.

236
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,798
I think I have a pretty good
reason to have some.

237
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,734
Keep your eyes open
with this guy.

238
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,235
He didn't do this.

239
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,938
Just the same.

240
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,651
Why are you sitting like that?

241
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,854
I'm concentrating.

242
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:07,525
Because I need to remember something.
Why?

243
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,331
Try this.

244
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,172
Pay attention.

245
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:37,055
Remember where
the matching one is?

246
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,495
See, your memory's fine.

247
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,231
Maseo: He needs your help.

248
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,733
You need my help.

249
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,935
You know I don't
like your friend.

250
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,404
This gaijin,
he is trouble.

251
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,407
Well, I need him
to remember what he saw.

252
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:01,279
When we capture chien na wei,
my debt is paid.

253
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,147
All I care about

254
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,383
Is us getting home.

255
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,452
Then help me.

256
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,322
I love you.

257
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,792
You know that, right?

258
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,997
Oh, come on,
you must be cheating.

259
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,700
I'm just better
at this than you.

260
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,535
Akio.

261
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,738
[speaking japanese]

262
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,942
We were just
playing a game.

263
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:37,381
I will house you, feed you,
and clothe you.

264
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:42,553
But my son
is off limits.

265
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,490
Fine.

266
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:48,426
Stay!

267
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,067
What are you doing?

268
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,536
I'm helping you.

269
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,304
Now...

270
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,306
Do exactly
as I say.

271
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,041
You ever heard
of this ted grant?

272
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,178
Yeah, I saw his title fight a
few years back on pay per view.

273
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,580
They call him wild cat.
He's the real deal.

274
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,749
Body in his gym
was strung up the same way

275
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,551
That the bodies
in the warehouse were.

276
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,153
Like punching bags.

277
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,621
What if laurel
vouches for him?

278
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,689
I don't think that laurel
is seeing clearly on this one.

279
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,726
If grant's our doer,
he's more than boxer.

280
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,061
I hacked csu's files on the
warehouse murders.

281
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,530
The culebras were
armed to the teeth,

282
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,432
But the killer, the psycho
mass murder guy,

283
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,501
Never fired a shot.

284
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,403
They were beaten to death by
brass knuckles.

285
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,272
It's a pretty specific m.O.

286
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,806
It matches one murder
from six years ago.

287
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,108
Same as tonight,
culebra drug dealer.

288
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,943
Blunt force trauma, consistent
with brass knuckles

289
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,144
Worn by a left-handed
assailant.

290
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,747
Let me guess-- ted "wild cat"
grant's a lefty.

291
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,582
They called him
the starling southpaw.

292
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,717
Well, SCPD never
put that together,

293
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,352
Because ted
was never arrested.

294
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,189
[beep]
he's moving.

295
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,523
You dinged him
with a tracer?

296
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:55,860
Just because laurel trusts
him doesn't mean I have to.

297
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,828
Talk me in.

298
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,610
[both grunting]

299
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,194
Second time I've found you
with a body!

300
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,930
I've never killed anybody.
I'm being set up.

301
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,099
Why should
I believe you?!

302
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,601
Because I used to be
a vigilante.

303
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,037
I used to be you.

304
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,746
This city's been hurting
long before you showed up.

305
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:25,449
I've never heard of another
vigilante in starling.

306
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,951
It was six years ago.

307
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,687
I wasn't news--
I stuck to the glades.

308
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,489
And these are supposed
to convince me?

309
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,892
Masks are also useful for
serial killers.

310
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,795
Says a guy currently
wearing one.

311
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,597
Who's that?

312
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,867
I don't know. I've never seen
him before in my life.

313
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:46,137
But this was hung
around the body

314
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,638
That was found in my gym.

315
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,273
The key is
to the storage locker.

316
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,976
He's leaving me
a trail to follow.

317
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,444
Who is?

318
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,746
Whoever's setting me up.

319
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,415
Look, I've never
killed anyone.

320
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:02,687
Except for that drug dealer that
you beat to death six years ago.

321
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,089
That was a mistake.

322
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,857
I may have avoided jail,
but I have lived

323
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,492
With the guilt
of that man's death

324
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,094
Every single day
of my life.

325
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,796
I gave it all up
after that.

326
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:16,033
I locked this place up and I swore
I'd never open it again.

327
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,103
Who else knows
about the locker?

328
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,271
No one.

329
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,806
This is where
I kept my supplies.

330
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,708
A safe place separate
from my day job.

331
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,910
I'm sure you've got
one just like it.

332
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,011
Mine's bigger.

333
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,913
Look, we're both
trying to find out

334
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,815
Who the hell's
doing this.

335
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,083
We could help
each other.

336
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,518
Laurel: His name
is albert mancini.

337
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,322
No criminal record, aside from
a few unpaid parking tickets.

338
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,024
Grant says he doesn't
know who this guy is.

339
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,326
Oh, and now you believe him?
I haven't decided yet!

340
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,795
Do you know that you're training
with a vigilante?

341
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,565
Former, apparently.
And no, I didn't.

342
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,700
I didn't!
So you also didn't know

343
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:53,170
That six years ago, he beat
someone to death?

344
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,539
How many more reasons

345
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,741
Am I going to have
to give you

346
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,709
Before you stay away
from this guy?

347
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,445
Ok, you know what, are you guys
just about finished

348
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,614
With your little
private chat?

349
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,983
The guy from your storage unit,

350
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,251
He has no criminal record.

351
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,954
He was a magician.
Magician's assistant,

352
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,189
More accurately.
He worked with a local act

353
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,858
Before getting cut loose.

354
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,393
Mancini hasn't worked since.

355
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,862
Culebra cartel,
magician's assistant.

356
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,130
What's the connection?

357
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,699
Their act was
at the sansa bar.

358
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:25,269
The sansa bar's where's the drug
dealer was murdered.

359
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,271
You mean the person
you beat to death?

360
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,342
Whoever's doing this is leaving me
a trail to follow.

361
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,443
Then we follow it.

362
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,511
We need another minute.

363
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,447
How do you two
know each other?

364
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:40,818
We used to date.

365
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,624
You cannot be serious.

366
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,691
I am not on
your team.

367
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,694
I don't work for you.
Exactly. You're untrained.

368
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,296
Oh, who's fault is that?

369
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,764
[exhales]

370
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,000
Does he know?

371
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,402
What's driving you?

372
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,005
I told him...

373
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,740
That sara's gone.

374
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:03,841
But does he know

375
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,610
That you want to follow
in her footsteps?

376
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,647
You're playing a very
dangerous game, laurel.

377
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,449
I can handle it.

378
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,817
No, you can't.

379
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,419
Because you haven't realized

380
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:19,924
That it's not actually a game.

381
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,359
Let's go.

382
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,360
What about laurel?

383
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,863
She's not coming.

384
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,237
Oliver has a 20
on our killer.

385
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,139
I thought oliver
was tracking grant.

386
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,273
Looks like things
have changed.

387
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,375
Suit up, he wants us
to provide back-up.

388
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,177
Roy can't go.
What?

389
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,745
I need to talk to you about
something important.

390
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,448
It can wait.
No, it can't. John?

391
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,418
I'll take care
of it.

392
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,053
What the hell is that about?

393
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:49,887
We need to talk.

394
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,622
Yeah, you made that
pretty clear.

395
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,557
Before we buried sara,
I scanned her body

396
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,693
Using portable magnetic
resonance imaging.

397
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,728
Felicity, you're really
starting to freak me out.

398
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,797
I basically created
a virtual autopsy.

399
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,699
It's not as good as
a regular autopsy,

400
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,269
But like when I can use it to
determine things an autopsy would,

401
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:08,205
Like angle of tack,
trajectory,

402
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,607
And the force
of the arrows.

403
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,076
Felicity, what are you saying?

404
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,611
There were certain things about
the forensics

405
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,346
That I couldn't
reconcile with,

406
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,614
Specifically,
the angle

407
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,983
And the velocity of the arrows
were not consistent

408
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,518
With a normal bow
or archer

409
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,489
But if the arrows were thrown
with mirakuru force...

410
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:29,727
What if there was some residual
mirakuru in your system?

411
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,861
It would explain
the forensics.

412
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,563
The angle and the force
of the arrows.

413
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,865
But you said that I tested
negative for mirakuru.

414
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,501
There isn't any in
your blood today,

415
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,303
But if one last
mirakuru episode

416
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:42,072
Burned down any remnants
in your system...

417
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,774
"episode?"

418
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,442
You mean...

419
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,213
Me killing sara.

420
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,726
I'm onsite.

421
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,062
Copy. Keep watching
the perimeter.

422
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,964
How many partners
do you have, anyway?

423
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,933
The culebras.
The body in your gym,

424
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,467
The body in your storage locker.

425
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,835
Someone's gone
to a lot of trouble

426
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,203
To frame you for murders
and bring you here.

427
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,973
Why? What does all this
have to do with one killing

428
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,841
Six years ago?

429
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,710
Hello, ted.

430
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,279
I see you got my messages.

431
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,817
Arrows.

432
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:31,722
I never knew why we couldn't just
use a gun the way they did.

433
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,857
Because we're better
than they are.

434
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,225
At least we're
supposed to be.

435
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,095
That's almost ironic,
coming from you.

436
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,064
I trusted you!

437
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,270
[siren]
scpd!

438
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,106
Ted grant,
you are under arrest

439
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,941
For multiple counts
of homicide.

440
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,444
Officer: Don't move!

441
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,179
What are you
talkin' about?

442
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,880
I didn't do this.
Yeah?

443
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,583
Tell that to the stiff we found
in your locker.

444
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,819
Let's go.

445
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:10,394
Sorry he got past me. He knew
an exit out of the building

446
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,829
That wasn't on any
of the blueprints

447
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,997
That felicity
hooked me up with.

448
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,732
You had ted grant
arrested?

449
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,467
Your father's men
found him at a crime scene.

450
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,169
Another body was found at a
storage locker that he owns,

451
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,039
Along with evidence
of past vigilantism.

452
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,574
No. He's innocent.
I know.

453
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,809
I saw the person
who's doing this.

454
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,011
Who is it?
[exhales]

455
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,614
He was wearing ted's old gear.
Full face mask.

456
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:31,782
Let's go.

457
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:35,753
Clearly grant knows
who's behind the mask.

458
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,554
Oliver.

459
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,356
Laurel.

460
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,425
What's up?

461
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,326
I have to--

462
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,595
Roy, don't. Let's just--

463
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:47,865
I need to tell you
something.

464
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,401
Ok?

465
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:52,569
I...

466
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:58,075
I killed sara.

467
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,046
That doesn't...

468
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,616
You're not making any sense.

469
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,452
Why would you kill sara?

470
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,386
It was the mirakuru.

471
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,155
Roy had no memory
of the attack.

472
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,290
No real memory, at least.
But he's been recalling

473
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:17,594
Fragments of his mirakuru
exposure last year.

474
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,697
That, and suppressed
memories

475
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:22,199
Often resurface in dreams.

476
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,635
This is insane.

477
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:28,138
Laurel, I am so
sorry. I'm really--

478
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,074
Don't!

479
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,013
Wait, roy, where do you think
you're going?

480
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,916
Let him go.

481
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,392
I thought he was cured.

482
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,061
What we know about mirakuru
is vastly outweighed

483
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,063
By the things
we don't know.

484
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,599
What does that even mean?

485
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:59,536
That roy killed my sister
and it's not his fault?

486
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:03,107
The arrows that killed sara,

487
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,508
We pulled dna off of them,
didn't we?

488
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,844
I tested it against the sample
of roy's blood.

489
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,445
It was the first
thing I did.

490
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,047
And?

491
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,349
The results
were inconclusive.

492
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,586
I can't process
this right now.

493
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:18,155
[sighs]

494
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,390
Hey.

495
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,592
Hey.

496
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:22,526
Look at me.

497
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,729
Focus on what you can process.

498
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,364
Ted knows
who we're coming after.

499
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,166
I need you
to find out who it is.

500
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:32,269
I can't. I can't. If roy
killed sara, then--

501
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:36,073
If roy killed sara, then...

502
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:40,277
We will deal with it.

503
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:44,014
For right now, I need you

504
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,816
To deal with ted.

505
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,485
Ok?

506
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:51,922
Ok.

507
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:04,868
How sure are you?

508
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,271
There's other
forensic evidence.

509
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:10,541
A virtual autopsy, in light of
what roy's described,

510
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,509
It sounds
incriminating.

511
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:18,649
That, and his trouble sleeping
started right when sara was killed.

512
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:27,257
My husband says you
are having problems

513
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,160
Remembering what you saw
earlier today.

514
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,196
That's the problem.

515
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,131
I didn't see anything.

516
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,767
You see and hear far
more than you think.

517
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,402
Hidden truths,

518
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,504
Very deep in
your sub-conscious.

519
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:43,807
You saw something, but your head
is too busy.

520
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,343
You need
to quiet it.

521
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,480
Close your eyes.

522
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,686
Take a deep breath.

523
00:25:55,688 --> 00:26:00,591
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

524
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:03,760
In...

525
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,229
And out.

526
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,263
And again.

527
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:10,300
You're floating,
in nothingness.

528
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,736
All that exists
is your breath.

529
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,973
Any thoughts you
have are clouds.

530
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:19,743
They just
drift away.

531
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:26,917
I remember.

532
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,222
16 murders.

533
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:36,593
17, counting the one
from six years ago.

534
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:40,197
That's more than the son of sam,
less than bundy.

535
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:44,334
Probably worth a mini-series,
huh? Maybe a book?

536
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,972
You became
a defense attorney?

537
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,942
Can I talk to him
for a minute?

538
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,745
[exhales]

539
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,852
You sure can
pick 'em.

540
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,094
You ok?

541
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,564
I'm not the one facing
a lifetime in prison.

542
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,066
Who framed you?

543
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,035
I don't know.

544
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:21,738
I can't help you if you're going
to keep lying to me.

545
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,310
The arrow saw you with him.
He knows you know who it is.

546
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:31,415
If the d.A.'s office refuses
to seek an indictment,

547
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:34,117
The police have
to release you.

548
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,720
But first...

549
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,922
I'm going to need you to be
straight with me.

550
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:42,759
Who was the man
behind the mask?

551
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,330
His name's isaac stanzler.

552
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:50,801
Six years ago, the culebras
ran the glades.

553
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,937
I thought it would be a good idea
for families to be able to live there

554
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,907
Without worrying about their kids
getting shot.

555
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,643
So I decided to do
something about it.

556
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,111
You became
a vigilante.

557
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,847
Just like your friend
in the green hood--

558
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,783
Without the green hood.

559
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:07,985
And what about
stanzler?

560
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,353
You know the guy
the arrow's been

561
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,122
Running around with lately?
The one in red?

562
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:15,759
Stanzler was my guy in red.

563
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,594
I guess you can call him
my apprentice.

564
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,396
And one night,
we decided to go after

565
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,133
This drug dealer that was
pushing crank near the school.

566
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:27,337
We tracked him all the way
to this nightclub.

567
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,673
And what happened?

568
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:32,576
That drug dealer...

569
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:36,413
Isaac got to him first.

570
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:39,583
That murder from
six years ago...

571
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:43,553
That wasn't you,
that was him.

572
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,591
[sighs] I hung it up after that.

573
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,693
What about stanzler?

574
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,529
What happened
to isaac stanzler?

575
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:55,432
I told him to get
the hell out of starling.

576
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:59,002
That I never wanted
to see his face ever again.

577
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:02,406
I cut him loose.

578
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:07,377
That's why I've been lying to you
this whole time, laurel.

579
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:12,682
Everything that's happening
is my fault.

580
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:16,286
No word from laurel?

581
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,854
Not yet.

582
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,956
But according to SCPD
email traffic,

583
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,391
Which I may or may not
have hacked into,

584
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,093
They are dropping the charges
against ted grant.

585
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,162
Oliver, let me go after roy.

586
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:26,930
If he's experiencing
mirakuru side effects,

587
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,932
We can't leave him
running around.

588
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,901
So you bring him in.

589
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,035
Then what?

590
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,537
Oliver,
this crusade of ours,

591
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,906
It's supposed to be about
justice, right?

592
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,041
So if that's supposed
to mean something,

593
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,676
We can have two sets of rules--

594
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,344
One for the bad guys
and one for us.

595
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,081
I'm the one who brought roy
into this crusade.

596
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,783
And maybe it's time
for you to cut him loose.

597
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,653
Are you telling me
to abandon him?

598
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,455
Yes, oliver.

599
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:55,625
If that's what it takes
to find justice for sara.

600
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,134
So what do you think
stanzler's next move is?

601
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,402
Well, framing me
didn't work.

602
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,971
I'm almost afraid to think of
what he might try to do next.

603
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,807
What I should have
done from the start.

604
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,612
After you abandoned me,
the culebra family,

605
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,248
They wanted payback
for the man they lost.

606
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,486
They tortured me for months
before I escaped.

607
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,054
Isaac, I'm so sorry.

608
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,489
I didn't know.

609
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,491
You have every
right to hate me.

610
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,659
But come on,
let's talk about this.

611
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,061
Oh, don't worry,
we will.

612
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:35,632
There's so much I have to say
before I kill you.

613
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,646
Where are we going?

614
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:50,814
Just drive!

615
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,249
Hey, your beef is with me.

616
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,818
Ok, you got me. Let her go.

617
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,987
Taking innocent people hostage?

618
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,388
Man, I taught you better
than that.

619
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,990
They're not people,
they're criminals.

620
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:02,926
Albert mancini wasn't.
You still strung him up

621
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,227
In that nightclub.
You taught me that

622
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,764
There are no innocents when you
abandoned me to the culebras.

623
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,400
You gave me
direction, purpose.

624
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:14,171
And then when things got tough,
when I really needed you,

625
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,272
You weren't there.

626
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:18,508
[cell phone vibrating]
it's laurel.

627
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,809
Put her on speaker.

628
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,711
Isaac: I hated you
so much for that.

629
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,979
That voice,
that's him.

630
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,715
I was just a kid. You were
supposed to know better.

631
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,450
Call's coming
from laurel's cell.

632
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:30,620
Moving fast, 45 miles an hour.
They're in her car.

633
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,589
They're headed north
on route 17.

634
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,324
Keep that line open.

635
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,959
Isaac, I'm sorry.

636
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,195
I had no idea!

637
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:41,831
Eyes on the road!

638
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,671
Don't stop!

[tires squealing]

640
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,176
Who was that, huh?

641
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,878
Who was that?!
I don't know.

642
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,714
The only friend
I ever had was you.
