00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:16,014
There's a couple outside,
Mr. Batson.

172
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:17,807
They run a group home.

173
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:20,774
I can take care of myself.

174
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:22,199
When you're 18.

175
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:23,809
Until then,

176
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,175
I won't have you
living on the streets

177
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,913
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

178
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:30,427
Give these people a chance.

179
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,585
'Cause that's what
they're giving you.

180
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,847
You're out of options.

181
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,260
All right, let's get the spiel.

182
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:49,270
Just stay with me and Rosa,
we get it.

183
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:50,833
We were foster kids
back in the day.

184
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,286
Ooh, back in the dark ages.

185
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:53,548
Girl!

186
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:54,849
I'm young at heart.

187
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,444
Got my finger on the pulse.

188
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:59,483
Yeah, that's a reference to his
blood pressure because he's old.

189
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:00,997
Billy, do you have
any food allergies?

190
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:02,844
Oh, wish you did.
Darla's cookin'.

191
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:04,311
- Oy, guerito!
- What?

192
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:08,795
We know how overwhelming
it can all be.

193
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,382
New house, new faces.

194
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:12,027
All up in your face.

195
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:14,555
Just...
take it at your own speed.

196
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:25,889
Hello?

197
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,437
We're home!

198
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,564
That's what happens
when you suck!

199
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,592
So much for the welcome party.

200
00:15:36,754 --> 00:15:39,754
Yeah, that thing growing out
of the couch would be Eugene.

201
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:41,558
Is that him?

202
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,250
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

203
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:44,743
Whoa, slow down, slow down!

204
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:46,079
Welcome home!

205
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:47,992
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

206
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,031
Big hugger.

207
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:50,069
I noticed.

208
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,290
Die! Die! Die!

209
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,682
He doesn't mean that.
It's the game.

210
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,130
Hey.

211
00:15:58,162 --> 00:16:00,029
No sodas after dark, remember?

212
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:02,603
Whoa. When did it get dark?

213
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,201
Oh, the poster. I made you one.
Come look!

214
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:07,847
Oh, no!

215
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:10,329
Sorry, Pedro must've been
working out.

216
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:12,635
He was supposed
to be at school.

217
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,146
Oh.

218
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:16,435
Here.

219
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:18,738
Yes.

220
00:16:18,763 --> 00:16:22,048
Exactly why your Math Department
is so uniquely suited for me.

221
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,041
I can't, I can't even...
with Eugene right now.

222
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,795
Sorry. Mary. Hi.

223
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:28,025
College interview.

224
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:30,394
- I'm Billy.
- What am I most excited about?

225
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,618
Oh.

226
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,571
What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

227
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:39,442
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

228
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:41,820
What I'm most excited about

229
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,298
is the campus experience.

230
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:45,219
As a foster child,
I'm a big believer

231
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:47,472
in finding family and
friends in the most

232
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,118
unlikely of places.

233
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:54,101
Oh, I'm gonna miss
that girl so much!

234
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:55,968
It's Caltech,
it's a very prestigious school.

235
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,977
And also all the way
in California.

236
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:00,219
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

237
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,934
It's a tough subject for me.

238
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,222
Do you like vegan food?

239
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,119
- Mm-mm.
- 'Cause, see, I love animals.

240
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:08,840
Oh, no! The tofurkey!

241
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:10,832
Oh, no, we may have
to eat a real turkey!

242
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,569
- Is that?
- It's okay. Come, I'll show you your room.

243
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:16,560
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but,

244
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:17,877
it's fun!

245
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,031
Watch the bumps there.

246
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,468
Pedro, mi amor, hola.

247
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:24,646
Say hi to Billy.

248
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:28,982
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

249
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:34,118
Freddy.

250
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:36,753
This is Billy Batson.

251
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:39,574
Make sure you make him
feel at home, okay?

252
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,529
Maybe don't say anything
too weird?

253
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:42,799
Oh, one weird thing is

254
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:45,418
you know the Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

255
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:49,029
Apparently, it-it works.

256
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,031
Yup, um...

257
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:02,142
Oh, it's, uh...
it's a long way down.

258
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,031
Trust me, I speak from experience.

259
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:10,079
Victor pushed me.

260
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:13,182
They seem nice,
but don't buy it.

261
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,427
It gets real Game of Thrones
around here.

262
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:19,019
What?

263
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:22,735
Dude, I'm... just messin' around.

264
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,378
It's um, it's terminal cancer, I...

265
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,303
I have three months.

266
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:29,923
Kidding, again!

267
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:31,470
You look at me and you're, like,
"Why so dark?"

268
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:33,947
"You're a disabled foster kid,
you've got it all." Right?

269
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,607
Oh, yeah, that's the, uh,
the old batarang.

270
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,420
I mean, it's a replica, but...

271
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:41,912
Feel how sharp.

272
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:44,033
Could kill you in your sleep
with that thing.

273
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,630
You ever a Supes guy?

274
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,332
Yeah, me too.

275
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,998
Behold, the holy grail.

276
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,638
One nine millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

277
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:54,829
It's legit.

278
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,595
Probably worth, I dunno,
$5-600, maybe more.

279
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,374
What's in the bag?

280
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:00,691
Hey.

281
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:03,010
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

282
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:06,366
You don't gotta
talk so much, you know.

283
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,421
I mean, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

284
00:19:34,785 --> 00:19:35,944
Dinner!

285
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:44,907
All hands on deck!

286
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:48,267
Sweet.

287
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:49,933
Thank you for this family.

288
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:51,555
Thank you for this day.

289
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:53,293
Thank you for this food.

290
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:55,155
Even if it's not steak fillet.

291
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:01,284
Big school. 2,000 students,
you might think,

292
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,904
"Wow, so many strangers."

293
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,541
But not if you think of them as

294
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,097
possible for each friend then,

295
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:07,635
"Oh, so many friends."

296
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,934
The principal, her name's
Shirley. She's the best.

297
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,293
Next.

298
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:14,971
This is our security scanner.

299
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:17,138
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

300
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,814
I know what it is.

301
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,650
Does she always do this?

302
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,662
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

303
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,071
She's almost never uncomfortable.

304
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,279
Have a good first day,
big brother.

305
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,287
Look, you don't have
to hug me all the time.

306
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,732
We're not actually
brother and sister, so.

307
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:37,838
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:43,357
- Hey.
- Hey.

309
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:45,262
I-I didn't mean to make her...

310
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:50,621
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.

311
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,230
<i>He said I must be pure of heart.

312
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:58,089
<i>He called himself a wizard.

313
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,824
<i>Just like a...

314
00:20:59,903 --> 00:21:02,618
<i>a wizard from Harry Potter, some...

315
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:06,743
<i>But y-you're saying that other
people have experienced this?

316
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:08,278
In a sense, yes.

317
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,024
Do you remember
what he said to you?

318
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:13,238
<i>He tested me.

319
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,536
<i>There were these statues.

320
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,698
<i>Their eyes, it's like
they were looking at me,

321
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:20,527
<i>making me think things.

322
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,187
<i>Like, horrible things.

323
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,959
And do these approximate
what you saw?

324
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:29,621
<i>Yes. That's exactly
how I remember it.

325
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:32,005
<i>I-I don't understand.
How do you know...?

326
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:34,008
Recurring imagery has
proven very common

327
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:36,005
 in cases of mass hysteria.

328
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,481
<i>"Mass hysteria"?

329
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,591
I know.

330
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:40,434
The term's a bit theatrical.

331
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:42,818
But take UFO sightings,
for example.

332
00:21:43,021 --> 00:21:45,291
Lights in the sky,
flying saucers.

333
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,704
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

334
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,018
Symbols.

335
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,532
Ask her about the symbols.

336
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,288
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.

337
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:01,082
But as an example of
recurring imagery,

338
00:22:01,247 --> 00:22:03,095
maybe you recall seeing

339
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,858
these symbols before
the alleged abduction?

340
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:09,078
<i>Don't remember any symbols, no.

341
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,104
<i>I think I caught it on video.
There was something, um...

342
00:22:13,194 --> 00:22:15,796
<i>I remember the numbers on
my alarm clock, they kept

343
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:16,972
<i>shifting.

344
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:18,078
Video?

345
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:21,522
Show me the video.

346
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:24,427
Uh, Ms. Kwan,
this is Dr. Sivana.

347
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:27,503
<i>Um, one moment,
I can send it.

348
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:29,767
<i>Hello?

349
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:32,629
<i>Oh, my God!
Who's there?

350
00:22:33,515 --> 00:22:34,546
<i>Hello?

351
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:36,603
<i>What's going on?
What's happening?

352
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:40,291
<i>I'm-I'm going
to call the police.

353
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:44,285
<i>Then this blinding light
all around me.

354
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:47,269
<i>And I felt like I was
getting pulled down...

355
00:22:47,353 --> 00:22:50,259
<i>Like a temple
carved inside a mountain...

356
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:53,235
<i>Exactly what you'd expect from
a guy who call himself a wizard.

357
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:55,569
<i>...brought there
to save the world.

358
00:22:58,122 --> 00:22:59,511
Dr. Sivana!

359
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,735
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

360
00:23:02,896 --> 00:23:05,221
But you're funding my project.

361
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:08,240
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

362
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,529
56 reported abductions.

363
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:12,412
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

364
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,904
Doctor, what is all this?

365
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:32,489
All these years...

366
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:35,996
I was convinced

367
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:38,671
I had the incorrect sequence.

368
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:40,314
Or perhaps...

369
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:43,989
the wrong symbols
to open the door.

370
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:47,622
But on that woman's alarm clock,

371
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,372
the seven symbols.

372
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:52,899
The sequence

373
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:55,002
repeating itself

374
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,280
seven times.

375
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:00,325
That's the difference.

376
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,176
Is this some sort of joke?

377
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:04,073
It may seem that way to you.

378
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:06,680
Because we're not, in actuality,

379
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:08,634
studying mass hysteria.

380
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:10,785
What all these people have seen,

381
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:13,457
every single one of them,

382
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:15,259
is absolutely real.

383
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:18,295
An alarm clock malfunctions,

384
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,368
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

385
00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:23,627
Come on, Dr. Sivana.

386
00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:26,126
You can't believe
any of this is real.

387
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,482
Why, yes.

388
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:47,621
Yes, I do.

389
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,998
I've been waiting
for this moment

390
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,403
for so long.

391
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:33,713
And now, here we are.

392
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,229
You don't remember me, do you?

393
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:44,984
I remember you.

394
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:47,947
You were a boy.

395
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:50,193
Now, you dare intrude
in my kingdom.

396
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:52,160
Do you know what it's like
for a child to be told,

397
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:54,058
"You'll never be good enough"?

398
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,463
No, you don't.

399
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,436
What you said to me
all those years ago

400
00:25:58,543 --> 00:26:00,972
made me realize
who I really was.

401
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,767
And you know something?

402
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,073
I am not pure of heart.

403
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:12,430
The wizard is too weak
to stop us.

404
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:15,980
No.

405
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:17,369
No!

406
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:29,609
You never found your champion.

407
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:33,766
But we found ours.

408
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:52,282
You are the true champion.

409
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,398
They're using you.

410
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:28,064
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

411
00:27:34,574 --> 00:27:38,091
Through you, they'll spread the
poison to everything they touch!

412
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:41,124
Make mankind turn into them.

413
00:27:42,147 --> 00:27:44,447
You seek a pure soul, old man.

414
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,427
But no one's worthy.

415
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:58,487
Flight or invisibility?

416
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,034
If you could have
one superpower,

417
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:02,788
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

418
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:06,123
Everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

419
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:07,935
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

420
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,272
No, 'cause heroes fly.

421
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:11,264
Who doesn't want people to
think they're a hero, right?

422
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:14,728
But-But invisibility, no way,
I mean, that's perfect.

423
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

424
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:17,946
Sneaking around everywhere.

425
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:19,648
It's a total villain power, right?

426
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,611
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

427
00:28:28,644 --> 00:28:29,773
They asked people
the same question,

428
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:31,375
You know, what power
do you want? But this time,

429
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,963
they made it so the
answers were anonymous.

430
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,064
And-And most people, since
they knew that it was secret,

431
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,255
said invisibility.

432
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:37,476
And I think that's
'cause most people

433
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:40,025
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

434
00:28:40,204 --> 00:28:41,521
You're gonna run away.

435
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:44,373
I mean, you stole my
Superman bullet.

436
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:46,782
Dude, I get it, I get it.

437
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,473
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

438
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,898
You don't trust anyone.

439
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:52,262
But that's the thing
about invisibility.

440
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,504
You handle it by yourself.

441
00:28:55,845 --> 00:28:57,932
I didn't steal your dumb bullet.

442
00:29:02,972 --> 00:29:05,281
Hey, how was it today?

443
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:07,558
That good, huh?

444
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:11,762
Whoa!

445
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,663
Oh, my God! Freddy!

446
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:16,115
You okay?

447
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:19,876
What the hell?

448
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:21,567
What is wrong with you two?

449
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:25,152
- No way that's gonna buff out.
- You gonna pay for that thing?

450
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,882
For the dent you made
almost hitting me?

451
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:30,001
Yeah, sure, um,
do you guys take these?

452
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:34,493
Brett, stop!

453
00:29:35,993 --> 00:29:37,406
Don't touch my brother!

454
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:39,779
What, you need your fake
family to stand up for you?

455
00:29:39,804 --> 00:29:41,466
- Stand up for yourself, man.
- Yeah, huh?

456
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:43,890
Here, stand up.
Stand up for yourself.

457
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,072
What are you gonna do?
Go home, cry to mommy?

458
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,280
Oh, yeah, you don't
have a mommy.

459
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:50,201
Stop hurting him!

460
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:51,299
Hey!

461
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:55,690
Man, sorry about that.

462
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:56,848
That wasn't fair, but,

463
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:58,613
then again,
you don't play fair, so.

464
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,624
Back off, assbags, I know
how to use these things!

465
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:09,632
Oh!

466
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,490
Hey!

467
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,345
Freddy, you okay?

468
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,166
Nowhere to run!

469
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,682
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him!

470
00:30:33,105 --> 00:30:34,303
Get out of the way!

471
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:36,637
Whoa!

472
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,030
No, no, no, no!

473
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,118
You're dead, kid!

474
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:42,811
Yeah, you think you're funny?

475
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,700
I know where you
go to school, right!

476
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:49,684
<i>Next stop, 30th Street Station.

477
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:52,312
<i>Change for the Regional Rail Line.

478
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:12,485
Hello?

479
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:14,326
What's going on?

480
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,947
Help!

481
00:32:01,418 --> 00:32:02,727
Holy moley.

482
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,243
Hello?

483
00:32:35,236 --> 00:32:36,554
What the hell?

484
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,779
Who-Who's doing this?!

485
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:12,059
Hi, um...

486
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:15,297
I was supposed
to get off at 30th.

487
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:16,750
Billy Batson.

488
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,945
How'd you know my name?

489
00:33:18,993 --> 00:33:22,588
I am the last of the
consul of wizards.

490
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:25,683
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

491
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:27,479
Oh.

492
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:29,608
You're

493
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,044
that guy.

494
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:32,828
Listen, I don't have any money.

495
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,316
Do not patronize me, boy!

496
00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:40,950
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

497
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:43,172
The Rock of Eternity.

498
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:46,165
Seven foes, seven wizards.

499
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:49,722
But long ago,
we chose a champion.

500
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:52,085
And we chose recklessly.

501
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,942
He used his power for revenge.

502
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:02,513
Releasing the Seven Deadly
Sins into the world.

503
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:08,682
Millions of lives were lost.

504
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:13,826
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

505
00:34:17,236 --> 00:34:20,836
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

506
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,613
until I find one
truly good person.

507
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:27,715
Strong in spirit.

508
00:34:28,223 --> 00:34:29,652
Pure in heart.

509
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:34,600
Look, man, maybe this is magic.

510
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:36,765
I-I don't know, but,

511
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:40,126
the people you're looking for,
good, pure people...

512
00:34:40,198 --> 00:34:41,925
I'm not one of them.

513
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,008
I-I don't know if anyone is, really.

514
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,268
You, Billy Batson, are all I have.

515
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,953
All the world has.

516
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:56,984
Lay your hands on this staff.

517
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:58,142
Gross.

518
00:34:58,238 --> 00:35:01,357
And say my name so my
powers may flow through you.

519
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:05,043
I open my heart to
you, Billy Batson.

520
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:09,284
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

521
00:35:09,494 --> 00:35:12,010
Thanks. Don't scream
at me, mister, but

522
00:35:12,035 --> 00:35:13,518
I really gotta get going.

523
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:17,244
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the sins.

524
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:20,433
Their thrones lie empty!

525
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:23,196
My magic must be passed on.

526
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,542
Now...

527
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,629
Speak my name!

528
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:28,571
I-I don't know your name, sir.

529
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:29,778
We just met.

530
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:32,761
My name is...

531
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:34,491
Shazam.

532
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:37,973
Wait, for real?

533
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:39,726
- Say it!
- Okay.

534
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:41,252
Jeez.

535
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:53,695
Should I say it?

536
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,163
Like,

537
00:35:55,465 --> 00:35:56,671
Shazam?

538
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,751
Yes!

539
00:35:58,776 --> 00:36:00,072
Carry my name

540
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:02,187
and with it, you
carry all of my powers.

541
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,616
The wisdom of Solomon!

542
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:05,016
The strength of Hercules!

543
00:36:05,058 --> 00:36:06,620
The stamina of Atlas!

544
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,351
The power of Zeus!

545
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:10,023
The courage of Achilles!

546
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:12,137
And speed of Mercury!

547
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:24,477
What happened to me?
Why am I...?

548
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:26,645
W-W-What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

549
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,753
You have been transformed to
your full potential, Billy Batson.

550
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,396
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

551
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:38,568
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await!

552
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,755
Huh! Oh!

553
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,131
Get me outta here!

554
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:56,509
Dope!

555
00:36:57,806 --> 00:37:00,750
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

556
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,167
Gold shoes, gold belt,
white cape!

557
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,716
It shouldn't work,
but, hot damn, it does!

558
00:37:27,772 --> 00:37:31,217
Yes, officer, I'm aware
he's run away in the past, I...

559
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,204
23 times?

560
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:35,497
Guy's got no social
media presence.

561
00:37:35,982 --> 00:37:37,220
At all.

562
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:39,442
The guy's a ghost.

563
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:03,877
You know guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

564
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,306
More than happy.

565
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:07,835
Then you gotta wash the dishes,
that's what's more important.

566
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:10,351
What are you gonna do, Freddy?
Run after him? Ha-ha-ha!

567
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:11,736
Very funny!

568
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:14,778
No, wait, don't scream.

569
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:16,639
Uh, Victor! Victor! Victor!

570
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:18,446
It's me! It's Billy!
It's Billy!

571
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:20,855
You asked me,
"Flight or invisibility?"

572
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,669
I thought that was stupid,
but now I look like this

573
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,145
and I need your help!

574
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:26,091
Meet me back here
after lights out?

575
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,346
What's up, bud? You all right?

576
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:31,205
Yeah. Yeah.

577
00:38:31,414 --> 00:38:32,708
I'm just...

578
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:34,946
I'm really... sad.

579
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:36,446
Because Billy's gone.

580
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:37,639
And you know,

581
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:39,789
maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

582
00:38:39,814 --> 00:38:41,521
Uh, you know, maybe I-I snore.

583
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:44,486
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

584
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,707
We'll find him, 'kay?

585
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:48,706
You don't snore that bad.

586
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:51,496
But you kinda smell.

587
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:03,034
Oh, oh, oh, my God!

588
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:05,257
Hey, stop right there.

589
00:39:05,394 --> 00:39:08,043
How do I know you're not a
supervillain using telepathic abilities

590
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:09,937
to make me believe
that you're Billy, huh?

591
00:39:10,022 --> 00:39:12,237
All I have to do is
press dial on this thing.

592
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:14,851
No, no, I have proof,
I have proof, here.

593
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,661
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

594
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:20,297
- Oop! No, no, no! No!
- No! No!

595
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:22,753
Stupid adult hands!

596
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:24,633
But you saw it.
You saw it, right?

597
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,271
Look, Freddy,
I swear it's me, okay?

598
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,179
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

599
00:39:29,204 --> 00:39:30,410
but you're the only
person that I know

600
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,481
that knows anything about
this Caped Crusader stuff.

601
00:39:32,547 --> 00:39:34,619
- That's Batman.
- What?

602
00:39:35,288 --> 00:39:36,549
Forget it.

603
00:39:37,977 --> 00:39:39,080
Can I...?

604
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:41,932
Oh, yeah, yeah.

605
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:51,163
Oh!

606
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:52,981
Oh, my God!

607
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,063
It's crazy, right?

608
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,230
What are your superpowers?

609
00:39:57,447 --> 00:40:00,201
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even
know how to pee in this thing!

610
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:02,059
Okay, c-can you fly?

611
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,289
Okay, let's do this.

612
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,162
How do we do this?

613
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:10,739
Just, um, just like Superman it.

614
00:40:10,928 --> 00:40:12,032
Pkkwwff.

615
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,552
Pkkwf.

616
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,356
Obviously, you have to jump.

617
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:17,635
Come on.

618
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:19,294
How is that even obvious?

619
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:20,661
Okay.

620
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:23,923
Try, uh, t-to believe
that you can fly.

621
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:26,896
Okay, I read this deep dive in the
pyramid studies of superpowers

622
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:29,421
and in 6 out of 10,
belief is the key.

623
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:31,783
Belief, belief, belief.
Okay, okay.

624
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:33,808
I believe I can fly.
I believe I...

625
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:35,854
I believe I can fly.

626
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,280
I...

627
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:46,876
Did you believe?

628
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,429
Yeah.

629
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,008
You wanna try invisibility?

630
00:40:54,616 --> 00:40:55,727
How do I do...?

631
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:58,616
You... Forget it. You know.
Okay, okay, okay.

632
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:04,296
Oh, my God! It worked!

633
00:41:04,693 --> 00:41:05,867
Where'd you go?

634
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,635
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

635
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:10,008
Where?

636
00:41:10,932 --> 00:41:12,035
I'm invisible!

637
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,749
I'm right here.
I'm over here.

638
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:16,702
I'm invisible!

639
00:41:16,845 --> 00:41:17,847
I'm invisible!

640
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:20,285
Hey! Nice outfit, dipshit!

641
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:23,162
I-I might have

642
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:26,299
been testing invisibility and super
intelligence at the same time.

643
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,746
Freeman, I'm gonna come
over there and beat you.

644
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,100
Oh, my God!

645
00:41:38,155 --> 00:41:41,195
The lightning, it was staring us
right in the face the whole time!

646
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,494
Literally!

647
00:41:51,724 --> 00:41:52,764
Okay, okay.

648
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,801
Billy, we gotta give you a
lightning-themed superhero name.

649
00:41:54,843 --> 00:41:55,891
Yeah.

650
00:42:07,211 --> 00:42:08,084
Oh, right.

651
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:09,592
Hey, you, back...

652
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:12,219
off.

653
00:42:12,382 --> 00:42:14,287
Hyperspeed, check!

654
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,785
I... I'm sorry-I'm so sorry.

655
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,372
I thought you were the
one who was screaming.

656
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:21,182
I doused him with pepper spray.

657
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,178
Smart move.

658
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:24,408
Yeah, hey, get up,
mister mugger guy!

659
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:26,162
Give the old lady
her purse back.

660
00:42:26,187 --> 00:42:27,703
Um, I'm your age.

661
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:30,491
And he didn't get a chance to take
it 'cause I didn't let him take it.

662
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:33,563
Good, yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

663
00:42:33,607 --> 00:42:35,401
And that should teach
you that old ladies,

664
00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:37,402
regular-aged ladies
like yourself

665
00:42:37,427 --> 00:42:39,100
don't need your protecting.

666
00:42:39,185 --> 00:42:40,550
Right? So get off, bro.

667
00:42:40,614 --> 00:42:42,312
I'm sorry, who are you?

668
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,020
His name is Thundercrack!

669
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,652
Hero to the people.

670
00:42:46,716 --> 00:42:48,914
With the power and speed
of lightning all in one.

671
00:42:48,956 --> 00:42:50,583
Dude, that sounds
like a butt thing.

672
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:55,023
- Mr. Philadelphia!
- That's a cream cheese thing, dude!

673
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:56,590
Powerboy,
'cause he's got all the powers.

674
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,400
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

675
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:02,110
Powerboy, do you know this child?

676
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,402
Like, like a teeny little bit.

677
00:43:05,427 --> 00:43:06,499
I don't really know...

678
00:43:06,533 --> 00:43:08,787
Yeah, he's, like, my manager.
He's like a miniature manager.

679
00:43:08,813 --> 00:43:10,559
- I'm his manager.
- And uh, you know.

680
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:13,100
Powerboy's not gonna work either,
okay? So work on something else...

681
00:43:13,163 --> 00:43:14,703
Hey, hey, hey...

682
00:43:19,649 --> 00:43:22,919
Electricity manipulation,
hyperspeed, super strength!

683
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,103
Dude, you're stacked!

684
00:43:24,177 --> 00:43:26,415
You're as cool as Superman!
Almost.

685
00:43:26,598 --> 00:43:28,550
I didn't see you
or what's happened here.

686
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:30,181
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

687
00:43:30,238 --> 00:43:32,024
- Oh, no, no, I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Thank you for your kind donation.

688
00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:33,438
No, no, no, but if you
need any more help,

689
00:43:33,502 --> 00:43:36,152
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

690
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,237
Forget flying, man,
we just made 73 bucks!

691
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:40,749
73 bucks?

692
00:43:41,273 --> 00:43:42,789
Come on!

693
00:43:43,762 --> 00:43:44,826
Hey, wait a minute.

694
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:47,040
I just got an idea.

695
00:43:47,913 --> 00:43:50,548
I'd like to purchase some
of your finest beer, please.

696
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,540
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID.

697
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:14,413
Freddy, would you relax?

698
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,106
Look at me, I am the fake ID.

699
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:18,975
Everything from the register!
Go! Go!

700
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,756
Now! Come on!

701
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:22,590
I don't have much time!
Let's go! Move!

702
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:24,222
I want it all! Hurry!

703
00:44:24,293 --> 00:44:25,436
This is your chance.

704
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,286
Oh! I... okay.

705
00:44:28,772 --> 00:44:30,558
Come on, come on,
let's do this!

706
00:44:34,596 --> 00:44:35,684
Gentlemen!

707
00:44:35,764 --> 00:44:38,597
Why use guns when we can
handle this like real men?

708
00:44:40,936 --> 00:44:42,031
Billy, look out!

709
00:44:54,928 --> 00:44:57,714
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

710
00:44:57,876 --> 00:44:59,035
I'm bulletproof.

711
00:45:00,863 --> 00:45:02,966
Today is December 8th,

712
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,636
and this is video proof
of authenticity.

713
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:07,398
Shoot him again.

714
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,065
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here.

715
00:45:09,113 --> 00:45:11,121
Go, both of you, come on.
Go to town.

716
00:45:18,003 --> 00:45:19,463
W-W-W-Wait!

717
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:22,679
We still don't know if the suit
is bulletproof or if you are.

718
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,417
Shoot him in the face.

719
00:45:25,442 --> 00:45:27,036
Shoot me in the...
in the face?

720
00:45:35,016 --> 00:45:36,294
It kinda tickles.

721
00:45:37,494 --> 00:45:38,755
You're dead.

722
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:46,430
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night.

723
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:48,105
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

724
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:49,401
Come on!

725
00:45:49,426 --> 00:45:50,695
Let's get outta here!

726
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:52,684
Hey.

727
00:45:52,994 --> 00:45:54,399
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yup.

728
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,636
That tastes like actual vomit.

729
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:04,521
You know,

730
00:46:04,546 --> 00:46:06,519
habanero jerky,
if you eat enough of it,

731
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:08,170
it could burn a hole
in your stomach.

732
00:46:08,463 --> 00:46:10,018
- Worth it.
- Yeah.

733
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:12,527
Probably not you though.
Probably got stomach superpowers.

734
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:13,377
Probably.

735
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:15,314
Oh, hey, what's up?
I'm a superhero.

736
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:16,928
Yeah, his name is, uh,

737
00:46:17,026 --> 00:46:18,534
Captain Sparkle Fingers.

738
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:20,771
No it's not. No it's not!
It's not my name!

739
00:46:20,796 --> 00:46:22,728
Hey, we should hang out.
We're like, the same age.

740
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,460
Ho! po-po. I'm out.

741
00:46:24,817 --> 00:46:26,182
Hey, wait up!

742
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:34,633
I mean, it's a pretty sick view.

743
00:46:35,214 --> 00:46:38,365
I totally get why Rocky was
training so hard to get up here.

744
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,280
I like you like this.
This is so cool.

745
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,999
I mean, no offense, but like,

746
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,015
Like, at first, you were kinda
like the opposite of how

747
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:50,528
of how Darla is.

748
00:46:52,324 --> 00:46:53,435
A dick?

749
00:46:53,523 --> 00:46:55,363
Your words, not mine.

750
00:46:55,601 --> 00:46:56,745
But yeah.

751
00:46:58,684 --> 00:47:00,255
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

752
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,185
was either on drugs
or asleep by now.

753
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:03,781
Wanna head home?

754
00:47:04,915 --> 00:47:06,092
Looking like this?

755
00:47:06,163 --> 00:47:08,113
Yeah. I mean,

756
00:47:08,138 --> 00:47:10,732
usually we'd have
a lair to go back to, but

757
00:47:10,898 --> 00:47:12,195
that's long term.

758
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:14,341
Right now you have a bunk bed.

759
00:47:18,911 --> 00:47:21,871
Just scares me thinking of
him out there all alone.

760
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:24,054
This is what he does, Rosa.

761
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:27,528
Difference is when
they find him,

762
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:29,547
we'll be the first
to take him back.

763
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:31,550
With open arms.

764
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:36,628
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

765
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:39,250
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back then.

766
00:47:39,345 --> 00:47:41,004
At least, I did.

767
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,852
Even Mary did it, twice.

768
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,030
That second time she ran off,

769
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:51,312
you said something
that I'll never forget.

770
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:53,174
You said,

771
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,199
"It's not a home till
you call it a home.

772
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,286
"It's something you choose."

773
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:03,066
All we can do is
give him a place full of love.

774
00:48:03,801 --> 00:48:05,794
Whether he chooses
to call it a home,

775
00:48:05,873 --> 00:48:07,277
that's up to him.

776
00:48:12,445 --> 00:48:14,033
Gonna help me with this tree?

777
00:48:15,216 --> 00:48:17,119
This tree's so sad.

778
00:48:19,111 --> 00:48:20,119
H-Hello?

779
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,206
Just got done in the bathroom.

780
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:24,484
Oh, okay, Freddy,
sweetie, goodnight!

781
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:26,182
- Night.
- Night.

782
00:48:28,016 --> 00:48:29,187
Freddy, who was that?

783
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:32,513
It's Billy, he's just really tired
and he has laryngitis.

784
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:34,489
- What? Laryngitis?
- I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding.

785
00:48:34,514 --> 00:48:36,290
He's really, really tired and he
wants to go beddy bye.

786
00:48:36,357 --> 00:48:38,354
- Beddy bye? What's beddy bye?
- Just hide, hide.

787
00:48:38,379 --> 00:48:39,919
Billy, you're back!
Let us see you!

788
00:48:40,716 --> 00:48:42,669
We're so worried about you.

789
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:45,118
I told you this was a bad idea!

790
00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:46,634
Freddy?

791
00:48:46,896 --> 00:48:48,626
Hey, what happened
to the stairs?

792
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,501
Hey, covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

793
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:54,517
is not gonna make her
less scared, okay?

794
00:48:56,927 --> 00:48:58,554
Darla, it's me, it's Billy.

795
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:00,576
I know I don't look like me.
A wizard made me look like this.

796
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:01,695
Maybe don't start with wizard,

797
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,987
it's just gonna make
her more confused.

798
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:04,700
Some old guy brought
me to a temple

799
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:06,183
and he made me say "Shazam"...

800
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:08,965
Rosa!

801
00:49:09,456 --> 00:49:11,797
Verbally-triggered body
manipulation properties!

802
00:49:11,822 --> 00:49:13,662
You can switch
by saying "Shazam!"

803
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:17,771
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

804
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,257
Um...

805
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:21,805
I-I was screwing in a bulb.

806
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:25,167
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot
tell anybody about this, all right?

807
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:27,171
But it's Billy, he's a hero.

808
00:49:27,196 --> 00:49:28,576
But if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

809
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:30,141
that endangers us, okay?

810
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,913
A hero's loved ones are, like,
a perfect bad guy target.

811
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:34,981
I-Is she good
at keeping secrets?

812
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:36,046
Moderate.

813
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:37,395
- No.
- Oh, God.

814
00:49:37,478 --> 00:49:38,858
Okay, listen to me.

815
00:49:38,882 --> 00:49:41,787
You cannot tell a single soul
about this all right? Please.

816
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:44,105
Why? What if it's
people we trust?

817
00:49:47,305 --> 00:49:49,416
'Cause good sisters
don't tell secrets.

818
00:49:49,593 --> 00:49:52,021
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

819
00:49:52,046 --> 00:49:53,650
You know what would make
you an even better sister?

820
00:49:53,675 --> 00:49:56,159
Is when you fix the-
the doorknob for us.

821
00:49:56,184 --> 00:49:57,191
Sweet dreams.

822
00:49:57,272 --> 00:49:58,302
Sweet dreams, goodnight.

823
00:49:58,358 --> 00:49:59,533
Good night.

824
00:50:05,056 --> 00:50:06,754
Hello, sir, how may I help you?

825
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,214
Hi, sir.

826
00:50:09,108 --> 00:50:10,394
Sir, you can't go in there.

827
00:50:10,584 --> 00:50:12,514
Excuse me!
You cannot go in there!

828
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,943
Sorry I'm late.

829
00:50:18,968 --> 00:50:21,453
Thad, this is for
board members only.

830
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,034
I'm aware of that, Father.

831
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:27,766
Now...

832
00:50:28,662 --> 00:50:31,385
That night, in the car...

833
00:50:31,872 --> 00:50:33,706
I swore to you
I saw something

834
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,563
but you never believed me.

835
00:50:35,845 --> 00:50:38,885
So much easier to blame
me, wasn't it?

836
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:42,357
And say that if I hadn't
screamed that night,

837
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,904
you'd still have your legs.

838
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:46,846
Well, now, I have proof.

839
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:51,436
That's enough, Thad.

840
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:52,819
Dear Sid.

841
00:50:53,263 --> 00:50:54,469
You think?

842
00:50:55,492 --> 00:50:58,381
You know,
even before the accident,

843
00:50:58,485 --> 00:50:59,713
you belittled me.

844
00:50:59,747 --> 00:51:02,232
Don't make me throw you
out of here, Thad.

845
00:51:02,737 --> 00:51:04,816
You don't need to make a scene.

846
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,431
Oh, brother...

847
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:07,989
The scene

848
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:09,536
has only just begun.

849
00:51:12,493 --> 00:51:14,557
Ask that if you can
throw me out.

850
00:51:14,694 --> 00:51:15,694
What?

851
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:18,273
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

852
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:23,900
Let me spoil it for you.

853
00:51:32,554 --> 00:51:33,792
Outlook...

854
00:51:34,363 --> 00:51:35,855
not so good.

855
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:40,808
I've come here during
the season of giving

856
00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:42,525
to give you...

857
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,734
what you deserve.

858
00:52:44,788 --> 00:52:45,915
Oh, my God!

859
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:48,170
No! No!

860
00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:49,503
No!

861
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:05,630
Help!

862
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:07,721
Somebody!

863
00:53:07,993 --> 00:53:10,501
Help me!

864
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:13,265
You can't go crying to
other people all the time.

865
00:53:14,835 --> 00:53:18,431
What sin best befits
you, Father? Hmm?

866
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,337
I'll give you anything.

867
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:21,784
Money...

868
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:24,165
The company?
You want the company?

869
00:53:24,613 --> 00:53:26,161
There it is.

870
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:28,798
Greed.

871
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:31,144
Do you honestly think

872
00:53:31,852 --> 00:53:33,726
all this

873
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:35,866
material you've accumulated

874
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:39,779
amounts to actual power?

875
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:45,206
This... is power.

876
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:48,546
More than you ever had.

877
00:53:49,085 --> 00:53:51,038
More than anyone has.

878
00:53:52,186 --> 00:53:55,194
There is one more powerful.

879
00:53:55,513 --> 00:53:59,887
The wizard found his champion.

880
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:01,990
Kill the champion

881
00:54:02,046 --> 00:54:05,728
before he learns
his true potential.

882
00:54:05,753 --> 00:54:08,590
Or he will defeat you.

883
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,690
Show me where to find him.

884
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:27,730
Oh, Greed...

885
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:30,492
you can have him.

886
00:54:31,844 --> 00:54:32,844
No.

887
00:54:34,995 --> 00:54:36,003
No!

888
00:54:37,219 --> 00:54:38,362
No!

889
00:54:39,337 --> 00:54:40,400
No!

890
00:54:58,051 --> 00:55:01,749
<i>Family is more
than just a word.

891
00:55:05,304 --> 00:55:06,495
<i>This is family.

892
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:32,357
Uh, Burke?

893
00:55:34,744 --> 00:55:36,109
Where's the truck?

894
00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:46,707
I can hear it.

895
00:55:56,529 --> 00:55:59,632
- Oh, my God!
- My truck!

896
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:02,227
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

897
00:56:02,758 --> 00:56:03,925
You know, guys...

898
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,226
I don't think that's
gonna buff out.

899
00:56:16,057 --> 00:56:18,700
Making the cripple kid
do the dirty work, wow.

900
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:21,011
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

901
00:56:21,036 --> 00:56:22,353
And I can't?

902
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:25,221
Your face gives off
a very strong vibe

903
00:56:25,246 --> 00:56:26,936
of someone who's
hatching schemes.

904
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,725
- M-My face? This face?
- Yeah!

905
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:30,988
Okay.

906
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,278
You boys got a hall pass?

907
00:56:38,825 --> 00:56:41,087
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

908
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:42,897
You.

909
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:47,306
You look like
you're up to somethin'.

910
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:49,791
Me? Up to something?
No. Never.

911
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:51,040
I'm not up to something.

912
00:56:51,096 --> 00:56:52,675
Our dad's picking us up.

913
00:56:52,754 --> 00:56:55,276
He, uh, he got held up at the...
the business

914
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:56,310
office.

915
00:56:56,335 --> 00:56:58,111
The business office, huh?

916
00:56:58,235 --> 00:56:59,322
Sure, kid.

917
00:56:59,347 --> 00:57:00,426
Look.

918
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:04,061
Parents or guardians
must appear physically

919
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:05,752
to check out students.

920
00:57:05,777 --> 00:57:07,078
Gotcha.

921
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:09,158
Okay, well, uh,
you hear that, Dad?

922
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:10,709
- Hey.
- Shazam!

923
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,722
Oh, hey, there, son!

924
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,024
Oh, hey, there, other son
that I also have that's related

925
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,793
to that son I just
passed in the hallway.

926
00:57:16,872 --> 00:57:19,493
I'm so sorry I'm late,
I got held up

927
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:21,681
at the business office.

928
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,142
Doing all the work stuff.

929
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:27,108
This is the-the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

930
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:28,157
Oh.

931
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:29,853
That's the other one.
This one sucks.

932
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:32,266
This is... that's not funny.

933
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:35,452
I gotta talk to him about that.
I apologize.

934
00:57:35,477 --> 00:57:37,033
Anyway, this is me
appearing physically

935
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:38,692
to check my sons out of school.

936
00:57:38,717 --> 00:57:40,636
So, thank you so much
for keeping them safe,

937

gonna be bringing us
dessert, right?

Tomorrow, at lunch.
You'll see.

01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:11,952
And when he doesn't show, then

1083
01:03:11,984 --> 01:03:13,365
we'll kick your ass.

1084
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:17,601
So wait, my identity's a secret

1085

mine as it is yours.

Billy, you're still gonna
do it, though, right?

1095
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:41,164

They found a costumed hero.

1101
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:02,945
He's doing good.

1102
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:04,808
Yeah, but is he, though?

1103
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:07,094
Oooh, controversy.

1104
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,128
Into it.

1105
01:04:08,153 --> 01:04:10,975
Share with us your
perspective, Eugene.

1106
01:04:11,368 --> 01:04:14,337
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

1107
01:04:14,411 --> 01:04:17,490
So what? I can charge a phone...
with a plug.

1108
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:18,770
Preach.

1109
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,242
Pedro, any thoughts?

1110
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:23,245
Costume's stupid?

1111
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:27,406
Big white cape like, he's
getting married or something.

1112
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,694
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

1113
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:31,599
Ever think about that?

1114
01:04:32,049 --> 01:04:33,970
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

1115
01:04:34,058 --> 01:04:35,645
Yeah, Freddy, let's

1116
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:37,479
manage to see the positive.

1117
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,777
Okay, well, I think
it looks like

1118
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:41,984
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

1119
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,651
Very specific. All right.

1120
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:45,878
Maybe to this superhero,

1121
01:04:45,903 --> 01:04:47,910
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1122
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:49,498
"Clingy", wow, interesting take.

1123
01:04:49,575 --> 01:04:51,876
You know, maybe sometimes
a superhero just

1124
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:53,449
wants a little me time.

1125
01:04:53,474 --> 01:04:55,572
You know, me time can
also be construed as

1126
01:04:55,597 --> 01:04:56,818
pushing away his family.

1127
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:58,956
Family. Is that
what they are now?

1128
01:04:59,037 --> 01:05:00,807
It's a classic symptom of
superhero syndrome

1129
01:05:00,837 --> 01:05:03,083
coined by German psychologist

1130
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:05,044
Heinrich de Von...
German something, where

1131
01:05:05,107 --> 01:05:07,690
superpowers become an
all-consuming narcotic.

1132
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:11,193
Son, we're still eating dinner.

1133
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:12,823
What he needs is a sidekick.

1134
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:14,926
Name one cool sidekick.

1135
01:05:15,616 --> 01:05:18,085
Darla, why are you so
quiet over there, baby?

1136
01:05:18,235 --> 01:05:20,020
You're never
at a loss for words.

1137
01:05:20,323 --> 01:05:21,831
I'm eating.

1138
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:34,416
Why am I still doing this?

1139
01:05:35,268 --> 01:05:36,982
Billy, you can't skip every day.

1140
01:05:37,078 --> 01:05:38,284
Not at your age.

1141
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:40,643
I'm not your age anymore.

1142
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,567
But I can go with you,
we just gotta

1143
01:05:43,632 --> 01:05:45,450
trick the guard out,
you know, and then...

1144
01:05:45,513 --> 01:05:47,339
Billy, where are you going?

1145
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,121
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1146
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,419
Billy?

1147
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:53,546
Sir-Zaps-A-Lot's still gonna
eat in the cafeteria, right?

1148
01:05:59,697 --> 01:06:01,080

All right!

1152
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:06,654
Did you check it?

1153
01:06:07,115 --> 01:06:10,702
People typically, like, give me
a little money, you know, to...

1154
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:13,120
You're a sweet couple,
you guys have a good day.

1155
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:26,132
Oh, my God.

1156
01:06:26,157 --> 01:06:27,934
Mary, Mary, are you okay?

1157
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:29,268
How do you know my name?

1158
01:06:29,293 --> 01:06:31,824
Uh, how do I know
your name, uh...

1159
01:06:31,975 --> 01:06:34,436
Uh, one of my superpowers
is name-guessing.

1160
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:36,686
Which is really weird, I bet.

1161
01:06:36,711 --> 01:06:39,013
Uh, it's not as cool as super
strength or super speed

1162
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:41,578
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1163
01:06:42,385 --> 01:06:43,718
Are you hurt?

1164
01:06:43,893 --> 01:06:46,290
No, I'm... I'm okay.

1165
01:06:46,321 --> 01:06:47,869
Thank you, um...

1166
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:51,371
I just need a second to think.

1167
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,511
This has been such
a weird day.

1168
01:06:53,617 --> 01:06:57,767
Um, using my powers
of super observation,

1169
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:00,702
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college

1170
01:07:00,765 --> 01:07:04,107
in your hand. Are you upset
because you didn't get in?

1171
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,068
I got in.

1172
01:07:11,143 --> 01:07:13,604
Uh... well, now my
superpowers are failing me

1173
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,425
and I'm very confused.

1174
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:18,156
Yeah, me too.

1175
01:07:19,105 --> 01:07:21,613
I don't know. I know I should be
excited 'cause this is my dream

1176
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:23,914
and I worked really,
really hard for this.

1177
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,062
But it's like...

1178
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:31,329
I don't know, leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1179
01:07:31,419 --> 01:07:34,085
Can I-Can I-Can I give you
a little piece of advice?

1180
01:07:34,391 --> 01:07:36,191
Don't be worried about
everybody else.

1181
01:07:36,224 --> 01:07:38,017
Always look out for number one.

1182
01:07:38,107 --> 01:07:40,274
- Gandhi said that.
- I don't think he said that.

1183
01:07:40,335 --> 01:07:42,143
- Yeah, he did.
- Gandhi did not say that.

1184
01:07:42,168 --> 01:07:43,906
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.
- Take care of number one?

1185
01:07:43,946 --> 01:07:46,113
It was a really wi...
It might have been Yoda.

1186
01:07:46,143 --> 01:07:47,389
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

1187
01:07:47,414 --> 01:07:49,302
Agree to disagree.
The point is...

1188
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,683
You do you, you know?
You gotta look out for you.

1189
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:54,304
And get as far away from
this place as you can.

1190
01:07:56,183 --> 01:07:57,660
I don't know if I want to.

1191
01:07:57,685 --> 01:07:59,272
Of course you do.
What are you gonna do?

1192
01:07:59,297 --> 01:08:01,398
You're gonna live in a group
home for the rest of your life?

1193
01:08:03,096 --> 01:08:05,326
Look, families are for people who
can't take care of themselves.

1194
01:08:05,351 --> 01:08:07,311
Okay? So.

1195
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,468
And you know, y-you can take
care of yourself, you know.

1196
01:08:10,493 --> 01:08:12,469
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

1197
01:08:17,419 --> 01:08:18,911
I'll just call him.

1198
01:08:22,868 --> 01:08:24,043
It's ringing.

1199
01:08:26,522 --> 01:08:28,514
Red Cyclone! Hey!
Hey, what's goin' on?

1200
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:31,152
Oh, that's crazy.
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

1201
01:08:31,177 --> 01:08:32,509
Yeah, it's crazy.
That is...

1202
01:08:32,534 --> 01:08:33,747
Great story.

1203
01:08:34,726 --> 01:08:35,988
He's not talking.

1204
01:08:37,689 --> 01:08:39,379
I was! I was!

1205
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:41,081
We're friends.
I know him. I do.

1206
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:42,430
I know... I know...

1207
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,112
Shit.

1208
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:53,583
Come on, now.

Hey, young man.

01:09:04,563 --> 01:09:05,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1215
01:09:05,745 --> 01:09:07,343
I'm in the middle
of a show right now.

1216
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,655
How can I help you?

1217
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,409
I just wanna say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1218
01:09:11,674 --> 01:09:14,935
Yeah, I got a little something
called a suitcase wedgie, right?

1219
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,634
I don't know if you've ever
heard of it, but it's when

1220
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:18,670
someone grabs your
underwear like that

1221
01:09:18,695 --> 01:09:19,901
and hold you like a suitcase,

1222
01:09:19,926 --> 01:09:21,516
walks you down the hallway.

1223
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:24,011
And this was my underwear.

1224
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,878
Gross.

1225
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:29,486
You said you'd come.

1226
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:31,547
You said I will come,
I never said I was...

1227
01:09:31,837 --> 01:09:33,377
I'm a superhero, dude.

1228
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,908
Well, you're acting real heroic.

1229
01:09:35,131 --> 01:09:36,702
How much are people
paying you today?

1230
01:09:36,802 --> 01:09:40,119
Listen, I have serious
responsibilities now, okay?

1231
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:42,453
But that's cool because I can
carry that burden with my...

♪ hands. Lightning with my hands. ♪

1233

Don't move!

1235
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,497
Nobody move!

1236
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,277
Oh, no.

1237
01:10:27,507 --> 01:10:29,103
No, no, no, no, no.
Stay, stay.

Stay. Stay. Stay.

Oh.

1240
01:10:40,854 --> 01:10:42,377
Oh, that looked like it hurts.

1241
01:10:42,524 --> 01:10:43,778
It's him!

1242
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:45,516
It's the superhero guy!

1243
01:10:46,362 --> 01:10:47,529
Save us!

1244
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,505
Come on.

1245
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:52,558
Come...

1246
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:56,409
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1247
01:11:05,548 --> 01:11:06,556
What?

1248
01:11:14,045 --> 01:11:16,291
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1249
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:18,319
That is the worst idea ever!

1250
01:11:28,098 --> 01:11:30,694
Oho! Oh, I did it!

1251
01:11:30,735 --> 01:11:31,894
I did it!

1252
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,085
I got the bus!
I got the bus.

1253
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:35,501
Nobody move in there!

1254
01:11:35,804 --> 01:11:37,733
I gotta put this thing down,
I gotta put this thing down.

1255
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:46,427
No, no, no, doggie, doggie,
you have to move. Move!

1256
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:47,602
Shoo! Shoo!

1257
01:11:47,627 --> 01:11:49,459
Please be a good dog.
Good dog!

1258
01:11:49,484 --> 01:11:51,041
Ooh, you're being a bad dog.

1259
01:11:51,066 --> 01:11:52,495
Go! Go!

1260
01:11:53,317 --> 01:11:54,888
Please go. Please move.

1261
01:11:55,829 --> 01:11:57,718
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1262
01:11:58,249 --> 01:11:59,368
Thank you.

1263
01:12:15,401 --> 01:12:16,425
Yeah.

1264
01:12:16,622 --> 01:12:18,567
Yeah, no, no, no, my f...

1265
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:20,728
I was in the neighborhood,
you know, so I thought...

1266
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:21,832
Thank you, thank you.

1267
01:12:21,857 --> 01:12:23,927
You know, it's kinda
my fault, anyway.

1268
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:30,283
So, it seems Philadelphia has
gotten an early Christmas present

1269
01:12:30,317 --> 01:12:34,161
in the form of
its very own superhero.

1270
01:12:34,228 --> 01:12:35,704
And we're out.

1271
01:12:36,069 --> 01:12:37,942
- Hey, thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1272
01:12:37,967 --> 01:12:40,309
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1273
01:12:40,542 --> 01:12:43,733
Yeah, you electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1274
01:12:43,911 --> 01:12:45,696
And then I caught it!

1275
01:12:45,947 --> 01:12:49,352
Freddy! I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1276
01:12:49,377 --> 01:12:51,705
I caught a bus like people
catch fly balls, like...

1277
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:52,998
Who does that? I do that.

1278
01:12:53,023 --> 01:12:54,683
Billy, you do nothing, you...

1279
01:12:54,755 --> 01:12:57,390
you take selfies and
make people pay you.

1280
01:12:57,554 --> 01:12:58,577
You know what, forget it.

1281
01:12:58,602 --> 01:13:00,888
I can't really talk to you
when you look like this.

1282
01:13:01,134 --> 01:13:02,491
You just wish it was you.

1283
01:13:03,392 --> 01:13:04,535
No shit.

1284
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:06,187
You think?

1285
01:13:06,212 --> 01:13:08,275
I would kill to have
what you have.

1286
01:13:08,883 --> 01:13:10,446
'Cause everything I do

1287
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:12,185
is like, some-some
desperate attempt

1288
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:13,986
to get people to notice me.

1289
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:15,602
To not feel sorry for me.

1290
01:13:15,922 --> 01:13:17,397
I mean, look at me.
Look at me.

1291
01:13:17,422 --> 01:13:18,853
Do you even see me?

1292
01:13:19,274 --> 01:13:20,925
'Cause most people don't.

1293
01:13:21,753 --> 01:13:23,118
'Cause they don't want to.

1294
01:13:23,915 --> 01:13:25,241
And you don't either.

1295
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,910
I mean, you think
this is who you are?

1296
01:13:28,475 --> 01:13:30,037
I mean, Billy, you're 14.

1297
01:13:30,062 --> 01:13:31,848
And now you're no
better than the Breyers.

1298
01:13:32,485 --> 01:13:34,162
All this power,

1299
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:37,177
and all you did was turn
into a showoff and a bully.

1300
01:13:39,729 --> 01:13:40,856
Whatever, kid.

1301
01:13:40,944 --> 01:13:42,364
I do what I want!

1302
01:13:44,136 --> 01:13:46,437
And I'm like mid-20s, probably.

1303
01:13:47,512 --> 01:13:49,059
Maybe even, like, 30.

1304
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:54,167
Chosen one.

1305
01:13:57,681 --> 01:13:59,768
The so-called perfect man.

1306
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:02,534
Pure of heart.

1307
01:14:03,756 --> 01:14:05,582
Flawless in every way.

1308
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,802
What made you so worthy?

1309
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,900
I'm sorry, can I help...
can I help...?

1310
01:14:12,019 --> 01:14:13,527
D'you want a autograph
or somethin'?

1311
01:14:13,552 --> 01:14:14,886
Give me your power.

1312
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:18,725
Or die.

1313
01:14:18,773 --> 01:14:20,281
Oh, snap.

1314
01:14:20,952 --> 01:14:22,349
You're like a bad guy, right?

1315
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:23,405
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1316
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,446
Look, before this gets
really stupid for you,

1317
01:14:25,526 --> 01:14:27,502
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1318
01:14:36,373 --> 01:14:39,169
The weapons of man draw
no blood from our kind.

1319
01:14:39,194 --> 01:14:40,214
This is the...

1320
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:44,504
The only thing that
extinguishes magic

1321
01:14:44,608 --> 01:14:45,973
is magic.

1322
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:49,485
Time to transfer
your power to me.

1323
01:14:52,327 --> 01:14:55,819
Oho, you did not see that one
coming, did you, grandpa?

1324
01:14:56,004 --> 01:14:57,472
Them's street rules!

1325
01:15:07,143 --> 01:15:08,460
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1326
01:15:08,485 --> 01:15:10,451
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1327
01:15:10,488 --> 01:15:12,188
I never should've punched
you in the nuts like that.

1328
01:15:12,213 --> 01:15:13,436
That was totally my bad.

1329
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,809
We can talk about this.

1330
01:15:14,937 --> 01:15:16,310
You grovel like a child.

1331
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,606
That's because I am one.
I-I'm a kid.

1332
01:15:18,631 --> 01:15:20,075
You don't want to
hurt a kid, do you?

1333
01:15:23,084 --> 01:15:24,203
I believe I can fly!

1334
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,849
I believe I can fly!
I can fly!

1335
01:15:25,874 --> 01:15:27,283
Freddy said if I believe,
I can fly!

1336
01:15:27,308 --> 01:15:28,863
Then I can fly, so I believe!

1337
01:15:28,952 --> 01:15:30,182
I believe, oh, please!

1338
01:15:30,232 --> 01:15:31,764
Okay! Superman!

1339
01:15:31,789 --> 01:15:34,192
Superman!
What arm is it?!

1340
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:35,754
Why am I not flying?!

1341
01:15:35,779 --> 01:15:37,642
Please, I don't wanna die!

1342
01:15:53,853 --> 01:15:54,877
Oh.

1343
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:57,877
Whoa.

1344
01:15:58,173 --> 01:15:59,252
Whoa.

1345
01:15:59,887 --> 01:16:01,506
I'm floating!

1346
01:16:14,824 --> 01:16:16,197
I can fly!

1347
01:16:22,246 --> 01:16:23,388
Billy?

1348
01:16:24,734 --> 01:16:26,519
Freddy! I need your help!

1349
01:16:26,694 --> 01:16:27,972
You can fly?

1350
01:16:36,165 --> 01:16:37,490
Who's the other guy?

1351
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:39,214
Santa!

1352
01:16:42,073 --> 01:16:45,861
So, like, what you and Mrs.
Claus do in the summertime?

1353
01:16:46,057 --> 01:16:48,518
Well, in some ways,

1354
01:16:48,661 --> 01:16:50,534
Santa's always here for you.

1355
01:16:55,379 --> 01:16:56,482
Oh, help!

1356
01:16:57,673 --> 01:16:59,046
Help Santa!

1357
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,272
Santa needs help!

1358
01:17:01,927 --> 01:17:03,292
Give us a shout if you need us.

1359
01:17:10,118 --> 01:17:13,150
I'm just gonna chill in here for
a little while, if that's okay.

1360
01:17:16,537 --> 01:17:17,664
This is crazy!

1361
01:17:17,983 --> 01:17:19,531
This is crazy. You don't
have to fight this guy.

1362
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:21,602
This isn't your job.
You can run, right?

1363
01:17:21,758 --> 01:17:24,162
Yes! You can run. Awesome.

1364
01:17:32,521 --> 01:17:33,743
Get back!

1365
01:17:33,807 --> 01:17:35,497
Just get... Get away!

1366
01:17:37,454 --> 01:17:39,533
<i>I'm Batman.</i>
Get him, Batman!

1367
01:18:09,589 --> 01:18:10,756
Come on!

1368
01:18:36,274 --> 01:18:38,226
Sh... Shazam!

1369
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:09,393
Billy!

1370
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:11,603
Billy!

1371
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:14,413
Billy, where are you?

1372
01:19:17,705 --> 01:19:18,760
Billy!

1373
01:19:19,998 --> 01:19:21,276
Where are you, Billy?

1374
01:19:25,744 --> 01:19:26,887
Billy, come on!

1375
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:31,013
Billy.

1376
01:19:31,904 --> 01:19:34,134
- Where is he?
- Um, supervillain.

1377
01:19:34,605 --> 01:19:36,851
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1378
01:19:37,984 --> 01:19:39,158
Worse.

1379
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:40,801
Much worse.

1380
01:19:41,051 --> 01:19:42,416
Radioactive anthromorph.

1381
01:19:42,456 --> 01:19:44,265
Psychic energy manipulator.

1382
01:19:44,561 --> 01:19:45,814
I won't let you read my mind.

1383
01:19:45,839 --> 01:19:47,966
My mind is blank.
You can't get in.

1384
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:49,620
I don't need to read your mind.

1385
01:19:50,193 --> 01:19:52,170
Because you are going to tell me.

1386
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:54,164
Where is he?

1387
01:20:06,504 --> 01:20:07,846
Oh, my God, are you okay?

1388
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:10,092
You okay?

1389
01:20:10,615 --> 01:20:11,940
What happened?
Are you hurt?

1390
01:20:12,038 --> 01:20:13,189
Come inside.

1391
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,474
We need to have a talk.

1392
01:20:15,923 --> 01:20:17,558
Just don't be too
hard on him, okay?

1393
01:20:24,014 --> 01:20:26,562
Running out on us.
Lying.

1394
01:20:26,718 --> 01:20:28,130
Then I get a call
from the school

1395
01:20:28,155 --> 01:20:30,075
telling me you've
been cutting class.

1396
01:20:30,332 --> 01:20:31,609
Getting in fights.

1397
01:20:37,893 --> 01:20:39,829
Whoa, is that...?

1398
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:44,419
What's Freddy doing
with a superhero?

1399
01:20:47,747 --> 01:20:50,970
What's this superhero
doing with Freddy?

1400
01:20:54,443 --> 01:20:55,848
You remember dinner?

1401
01:20:55,873 --> 01:20:57,904
When Billy and
Freddy were arguing

1402
01:20:57,971 --> 01:20:59,701
like an old married
couple like this?

1403
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:03,712
When he rescued me, he
knew I lived in a group home.

1404
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,800
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

1405
01:21:14,289 --> 01:21:15,368
Wait.

1406
01:21:15,393 --> 01:21:17,797
Are you saying Billy's
the Human Powerstorm?

1407
01:21:17,847 --> 01:21:19,672
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1408
01:21:19,746 --> 01:21:21,340
All on your own.
I didn't help.

1409
01:21:21,365 --> 01:21:22,643
I didn't break any promises.

1410
01:21:22,668 --> 01:21:23,838
You knew?

1411
01:21:23,918 --> 01:21:25,513
I'm a good sister!

1412
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:31,116
I mean, what were you thinking?

1413
01:21:32,338 --> 01:21:33,918
Then you bring Freddy into it.

1414
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:42,850
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset. Okay?

1415
01:21:52,963 --> 01:21:54,042
Billy?

1416
01:21:59,145 --> 01:22:00,463
You're him.

1417
01:22:01,526 --> 01:22:02,955
You're the hero.

1418
01:22:04,118 --> 01:22:06,499
Yeah, well, not anymore, so.

1419
01:22:10,614 --> 01:22:12,455
Why do you have my notebook?

1420
01:22:15,288 --> 01:22:17,153
Eugene finished you search.

1421
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:20,022
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1422
01:22:20,255 --> 01:22:22,699
But I have played
Watchdogs and Uplink.

1423
01:22:22,765 --> 01:22:24,899
And maybe I did
pick up a few skills

1424
01:22:24,932 --> 01:22:27,012
which maybe did get me
into federal databases

1425
01:22:27,037 --> 01:22:28,258
most people can't get into, but...

1426
01:22:28,325 --> 01:22:30,103
Good for you,
but I'm gonna go.

1427
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:33,661
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1428
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:40,268
What?

1429
01:22:40,436 --> 01:22:42,381
You were born in
Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1430
01:22:42,677 --> 01:22:44,352
They divorced when
you were three.

1431
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,037
Your mom moved here that year.

1432
01:22:46,284 --> 01:22:48,062
20 months later, you got lost.

1433
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:50,931
You never found them 'cause
your dad's been in prison

1434
01:22:50,956 --> 01:22:52,479
in Florida for 10 years.

1435
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,037
And your mom's...

1436
01:22:55,834 --> 01:22:56,865
What?

1437
01:22:58,421 --> 01:22:59,508
Is she dead?

1438
01:23:00,123 --> 01:23:02,251
She's two subway stops away.

1439
01:23:03,235 --> 01:23:04,259
What?

1440
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:06,277
You know, you didn't find her

1441
01:23:06,302 --> 01:23:08,573
because she reverted
to her maiden name.

1442
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:15,230
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1443
01:23:18,442 --> 01:23:19,878
Victor, get the keys.

1444
01:23:19,903 --> 01:23:22,077
Kids, stay here,
in case Billy comes back.

1445
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:32,005
Get inside. Let's go.

1446
01:23:40,424 --> 01:23:43,336
Wait. I thought we were
running after Billy?

1447
01:23:43,515 --> 01:23:46,118
No, we're gonna
wait here for now.

1448
01:23:49,584 --> 01:23:50,743
Billy?

1449
01:23:53,636 --> 01:23:54,700
Freddy?

1450
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:00,831
Oh, how quaint.

1451
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,170
Actually, I take that back.

1452
01:24:08,035 --> 01:24:09,662
What a shithole.

1453
01:24:53,143 --> 01:24:54,413
Just a second.

1454
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:00,536
Hey, look, I'm late for
work already, all right?

1455
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:02,719
We don't need any
magazines or whatever.

1456
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:04,322
Oh, I'm not.

1457
01:25:05,469 --> 01:25:07,184
You probably don't
recognize me, but

1458
01:25:09,211 --> 01:25:10,766
I found my way home.

1459
01:25:12,214 --> 01:25:13,230
Mom.

1460
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:16,296
It's me.

1461
01:25:17,671 --> 01:25:18,710
Oh, God.

1462
01:25:20,311 --> 01:25:21,335
Is it?

1463
01:25:23,946 --> 01:25:25,771
Um, hang on.

1464
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:28,818
Who's at the door?

1465
01:25:30,065 --> 01:25:31,240
It's um...

1466
01:25:31,906 --> 01:25:33,676
It's no one, Travis.

1467
01:25:38,561 --> 01:25:40,061
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1468
01:25:41,128 --> 01:25:42,342
No, I...

1469
01:25:43,156 --> 01:25:45,886
Listen, it's um...

1470
01:25:47,867 --> 01:25:49,041
It's really you, huh?

1471
01:25:51,505 --> 01:25:53,068
I didn't mean to run away.

1472
01:25:53,941 --> 01:25:55,235
You know that, right?

1473
01:25:55,939 --> 01:25:58,613
I let go but it was by
accident, I...

1474
01:25:58,725 --> 01:26:00,415
Yeah, I know, I know.

1475
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,822
I saw you.

1476
01:26:03,835 --> 01:26:04,843
What?

1477
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:09,895
I saw you after.

1478
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,170
So, it was never your fault.

1479
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:18,619
I was 17.

1480
01:26:19,177 --> 01:26:20,883
And my dad, he kicked me out.

1481
01:26:21,258 --> 01:26:23,234
And your dad just...

1482
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:25,742
decided not to be
a part of anything.

1483
01:26:26,287 --> 01:26:29,247
And I was hurting
and I was screwed up.

1484
01:26:31,507 --> 01:26:32,523
I wanted the tiger.

1485
01:26:32,548 --> 01:26:34,817
I know, I know, honey, but

1486
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:37,250
Mom's not exactly going pro
here, okay?

1487
01:26:40,311 --> 01:26:41,431
Billy?

1488
01:26:42,177 --> 01:26:43,296
Billy!

1489
01:26:44,251 --> 01:26:45,426
Billy!

1490
01:26:45,926 --> 01:26:48,204
Jesus Christ, Billy,
this isn't funny!

1491
01:26:48,928 --> 01:26:49,928
Here you go, buddy.

1492
01:26:55,904 --> 01:26:58,801
But it's just once
I saw you with the police,

1493
01:26:59,206 --> 01:27:00,821
I realized that

1494
01:27:00,932 --> 01:27:04,360
they could do a better job taking
care of you than I ever will.

1495
01:27:09,529 --> 01:27:11,021
But you're good, right?

1496
01:27:12,697 --> 01:27:14,604
I mean you landed on your feet.

1497
01:27:15,779 --> 01:27:17,255
'Cause, I mean, you look real good.

1498
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,412
It's just...

1499
01:27:23,264 --> 01:27:26,311
Now is not a really
good time for me, Billy.

1500
01:27:30,804 --> 01:27:32,931
All I wanted to do was

1501
01:27:34,293 --> 01:27:36,158
let you know
I'm doing good, but...

1502
01:27:37,588 --> 01:27:40,318
I have to get back
to my real family, so.

1503
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:43,652
Here.

1504
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,610
What's this?

1505
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,819
Marilyn! What's
going on out there?

1506
01:27:52,485 --> 01:27:54,088
You might need it
more than me.

1507
01:28:11,909 --> 01:28:14,488
Freddy, you were right.
Sorry I yelled at you.

1508
01:28:14,513 --> 01:28:15,996
<i>Come home, Billy.

1509
01:28:16,644 --> 01:28:18,089
<i>Come home.

1510
01:28:18,256 --> 01:28:21,406
<i>Billy! Supervillain!
Supervillain!

1511
01:28:37,959 --> 01:28:38,967
Shazam!

1512
01:28:52,902 --> 01:28:55,227
Who are you?
What do you want?

1513
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:56,816
What do I want?

1514
01:28:57,715 --> 01:28:58,961
I want...

1515
01:29:03,981 --> 01:29:05,251
That.

1516
01:29:06,143 --> 01:29:07,437
Whoa.

1517
01:29:11,044 --> 01:29:12,354
Kick his ass, Billy!

1518
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:16,197
Oh, God.

1519
01:29:16,222 --> 01:29:17,333
Yes, Billy.

1520
01:29:17,596 --> 01:29:19,073
Try it, by all means.

1521
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:21,312
Let them go and I'll come inside.

1522
01:29:21,651 --> 01:29:23,770
Oh, first you come inside,

1523
01:29:23,834 --> 01:29:25,762
then maybe I'll let them go.

1524
01:29:42,561 --> 01:29:44,037
Good boy.

1525
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:48,506
'Cause that's all you are, isn't it?

1526
01:29:49,315 --> 01:29:50,632
How old are you?

1527
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:53,339
- Basically, 15.
- Hmm.

1528
01:29:55,099 --> 01:29:56,718
When I was a child,

1529
01:29:56,814 --> 01:29:58,917
the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

1530
01:29:58,996 --> 01:30:00,409
And here you are,

1531
01:30:00,806 --> 01:30:02,282
a coward.

1532
01:30:03,043 --> 01:30:04,444
Run from me?

1533
01:30:04,891 --> 01:30:07,113
And that wizard chooses you.
You're not a hero.

1534
01:30:07,623 --> 01:30:10,457
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1535
01:30:11,093 --> 01:30:12,902
Give me the power
of a champion.

1536
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,603
No, don't do it, Billy!

1537
01:30:31,273 --> 01:30:32,599
Give me the power

1538
01:30:33,093 --> 01:30:34,140
and I'll let them go.

1539
01:30:34,165 --> 01:30:35,394
Darla, no.

1540
01:30:35,476 --> 01:30:37,166
Don't, don't go, Billy!

1541
01:30:37,327 --> 01:30:39,438
Don't go! Don't go, Billy!

1542
01:30:39,533 --> 01:30:41,588
No, no, I-I have to,
I have to, it's...

1543
01:30:41,919 --> 01:30:44,935
It's what a good brother
would do, right?

1544
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:50,760
Billy.

1545
01:31:17,106 --> 01:31:19,765
I dedicated my life
to getting here.

1546
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:22,446
I scoured the earth.

1547
01:31:22,993 --> 01:31:24,351
No one believed me.

1548
01:31:25,404 --> 01:31:26,507
No one helped.

1549
01:31:27,492 --> 01:31:28,492
Not the wizard.

1550
01:31:29,921 --> 01:31:31,159
Not my family.

1551
01:31:33,116 --> 01:31:34,696
I only had myself.

1552
01:31:35,453 --> 01:31:36,572
I get it.

1553
01:31:38,009 --> 01:31:39,358
I get what that's like.

1554
01:31:41,444 --> 01:31:43,127
Feeling like you're
all alone in the world.

1555
01:31:43,286 --> 01:31:44,365
Stand.

1556
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:47,763
Feeling like there's that one
thing, if you could just find it.

1557
01:31:47,894 --> 01:31:49,638
Then you'd finally
be good enough.

1558
01:31:49,735 --> 01:31:50,878
Stand.

1559
01:31:53,098 --> 01:31:54,868
The champion's name.

1560
01:31:56,352 --> 01:31:57,487
Say it.

1561
01:32:24,814 --> 01:32:25,972
Look, no offense, mister,

1562
01:32:25,997 --> 01:32:29,036
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1563
01:32:29,343 --> 01:32:32,462
Don't listen to this child.

1564
01:32:32,712 --> 01:32:34,783
Take the staff.

1565
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:40,270
Hold it and say
the champion's name.

1566
01:32:40,362 --> 01:32:41,823
They're using you.

1567
01:32:42,426 --> 01:32:44,989
You have to see that.
That they are using you.

1568
01:32:45,042 --> 01:32:46,376
Say your name.

1569
01:32:49,826 --> 01:32:51,151
His name...

1570
01:32:51,786 --> 01:32:53,890
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1571
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:55,559
And we're gonna
keep throwing things

1572
01:32:55,593 --> 01:32:57,712
at your big, fat, ugly ass head

1573
01:32:57,807 --> 01:32:59,735
until you let our brother go.

1574
01:33:24,826 --> 01:33:26,858
Boy, am I glad I didn't
sell that batarang.

1575
01:33:27,043 --> 01:33:28,297
Pedro, is that a lamp?

1576
01:33:28,378 --> 01:33:30,561
- It's an ugly one.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1577
01:33:30,685 --> 01:33:32,812
Guys, I appreciate the
thought, I really do.

1578
01:33:32,851 --> 01:33:34,470
But I don't think your
weapons are gonna help.

1579
01:33:34,495 --> 01:33:36,018
You can put 'em down now.

1580
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:38,841
The door was right here.

1581
01:33:38,916 --> 01:33:40,146
Billy, how do we
get out of here?

1582
01:33:40,416 --> 01:33:42,211
What, you think I know?
I don't know.

1583
01:33:42,975 --> 01:33:44,006
This way!

1584
01:33:44,126 --> 01:33:46,197
Go, go, go, go, go with Darla.
Good job, Darla!

1585
01:33:46,263 --> 01:33:47,478
Go, go, go, go!

1586
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:48,565
Kids?

1587
01:33:49,843 --> 01:33:51,065
Why is this open?

1588
01:33:51,244 --> 01:33:52,530
Freddy?

1589
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:53,895
Mary?

1590
01:33:58,865 --> 01:34:00,460
Freddy, Freddy, keep up.

1591
01:34:00,678 --> 01:34:01,900
Darla, stay in front.

1592
01:34:02,806 --> 01:34:03,909
We gotta hurry.

1593
01:34:27,684 --> 01:34:29,152
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1594
01:34:29,995 --> 01:34:31,710
So many doors.

1595
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:34,951
One of these has to be
a way out, right?

1596
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,548
Yeah, I would hope so.

1597
01:34:53,591 --> 01:34:54,781
Not this one.

1598
01:35:08,348 --> 01:35:09,475
Okay, no more doors.

1599
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,795
Nobody open any more doors.

1600
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:12,747
Come on, Billy,
what are we gonna do?

1601
01:35:12,813 --> 01:35:13,877
Darla, I don't know.

1602
01:35:13,924 --> 01:35:15,250
Billy, yes, you do,
 just-just think.

1603
01:35:15,275 --> 01:35:16,497
How'd you get out last time?

1604
01:35:16,522 --> 01:35:17,704
Well, uh, l-last time I
thought about the subway

1605
01:35:17,729 --> 01:35:18,729
and I was on the subway.

1606
01:35:18,754 --> 01:35:20,833
Then Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1607
01:35:20,858 --> 01:35:23,116
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

1608
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:46,625
Come on, come on, come on.

1609
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:48,102
Why are you covering my eyes?

1610
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:51,201
Really? This is the first place
you think of? Wow!

1611
01:35:51,226 --> 01:35:52,337
You're welcome.

1612
01:35:52,362 --> 01:35:53,962
Why can't I see what's inside?

1613
01:35:54,034 --> 01:35:55,494
You are not old enough.

1614
01:35:55,591 --> 01:35:57,893
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1615
01:35:58,172 --> 01:35:59,258
Not my thing.

1616
01:35:59,282 --> 01:36:00,450
Where's Freddy?

1617
01:36:00,475 --> 01:36:01,801
Yeah, you too, Sriracha, hey,

1618
01:36:01,826 --> 01:36:03,437
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

1619
01:36:03,582 --> 01:36:04,900
Freddy, what are you doing?

1620
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:06,545
Ah, it's nice people.

1621
01:36:06,601 --> 01:36:07,966
- Nice pe...? Come on.
- Is that glitter?

1622
01:36:07,991 --> 01:36:09,546
They have glitter.
Can I get glitter?

1623
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:11,396
- No, not from them.
- Please?

1624
01:36:20,814 --> 01:36:22,298
Go, go, go, go!
Everybody go!

1625
01:36:22,716 --> 01:36:23,994
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.

1626
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:25,757
One, two, three,
hold onto me.

1627
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:35,871
Carnival. Go, go, go.
Mary, go.

1628
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:37,045
Go. Come on, Pedro.

1629
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:38,087
Come on.

1630
01:36:50,059 --> 01:36:51,729
Walk, just be cool,
act naturally,

1631
01:36:51,754 --> 01:36:53,936
like kids naturally act
in a carnival.

1632
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:55,432
- He's not gonna look for you...
- Is that him?

1633
01:36:55,488 --> 01:36:56,813
Oh, my God, guys.

1634
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:58,141
Hey, Powerboy.

1635
01:36:58,166 --> 01:36:59,187
He's an impersonator, okay?

1636
01:36:59,212 --> 01:37:01,149
I'm an impersonator.
I'm a fake version of myself.

1637
01:37:01,174 --> 01:37:02,380
Don't take pictures...

1638
01:37:04,255 --> 01:37:05,446
Shazam!

1639
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:13,910
Hey, where'd he go?

1640
01:37:22,596 --> 01:37:25,310
Oh, man, oh, man,
I just spit on a baby!

1641
01:37:27,006 --> 01:37:28,474
Yo, what is that?

1642
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,726
Champion!

1643
01:37:38,668 --> 01:37:40,486
You don't deserve that name.

1644
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:48,414
Hiding behind innocent people
who will now die.

1645
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:54,523
Because deep down, you're
still just a scared, little boy.

1646
01:37:56,275 --> 01:37:57,942
Oh, no.

1647
01:37:58,910 --> 01:38:00,326
Run!

1648
01:38:00,723 --> 01:38:01,921
Run!

1649
01:38:15,316 --> 01:38:17,181
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Hold on!

1650
01:38:17,233 --> 01:38:18,955
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1651
01:38:27,909 --> 01:38:29,679
Well, you wanted me to be a hero.

1652
01:38:29,958 --> 01:38:31,040
Are you kidding?

1653
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:32,341
Okay, no. Old guy's up there

1654
01:38:32,366 --> 01:38:34,113
harboring multiple
spiritual entities,

1655
01:38:34,258 --> 01:38:35,703
plus, I mean, he has
the same powers as you,

1656
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,062
plus, you know, a-and
he knows what he's doing,

1657
01:38:38,117 --> 01:38:40,363
plus, you're my best friend,
I don't want you to die.

1658
01:38:41,837 --> 01:38:44,076
If a superhero
can't save his family,

1659
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,881
he's not much of a hero.

1660
01:38:51,276 --> 01:38:52,815
That was a decent catchphrase.

1661
01:38:53,722 --> 01:38:54,857
Shazam!

1662
01:39:03,844 --> 01:39:05,630
Now let's try this again.

1663
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,563
Or try that again.

1664
01:39:29,457 --> 01:39:30,957
Billy, look out!

1665
01:39:33,466 --> 01:39:34,578
Laser eyes?

1666
01:39:34,673 --> 01:39:36,006
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1667
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:38,199
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1668
01:39:50,035 --> 01:39:51,194
His power matrix.

1669
01:39:51,345 --> 01:39:52,527
His what what?

1670
01:39:52,649 --> 01:39:55,093
When the demon guys leave
his eye, he loses his powers.

1671
01:39:56,057 --> 01:39:57,668
That's why the
batarang hurt him.

1672
01:39:58,989 --> 01:40:01,465
Hey, over here!

1673
01:40:02,088 --> 01:40:03,089
W-What are you doing?

1674
01:40:03,114 --> 01:40:04,160
Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1675
01:40:04,185 --> 01:40:06,533
We separate the sins from the
eye, and he's just an old man.

1676
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:08,371
Gather the mutts.

1677
01:40:46,398 --> 01:40:49,200
Here, take it.
Take it, it's for you.

1678
01:40:50,078 --> 01:40:51,237
Hold it tight.

1679
01:40:51,792 --> 01:40:53,046
Close your eyes.

1680
01:40:53,837 --> 01:40:56,011
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay?

1681
01:40:57,190 --> 01:40:58,262
Okay.

1682
01:41:21,806 --> 01:41:22,846
Get up.

1683
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:39,757
Shazam!

1684
01:42:08,543 --> 01:42:10,139
Playtime's over, boy.

1685
01:42:11,364 --> 01:42:13,086
Your friends can't
help you anymore.

1686
01:42:18,839 --> 01:42:19,870
Hey!

1687
01:42:46,579 --> 01:42:47,785
Shazam!

1688
01:43:12,559 --> 01:43:13,638
Nice trick.

1689
01:43:14,122 --> 01:43:15,265
Catchy.

1690
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:17,384
One simple word.

1691
01:43:18,195 --> 01:43:19,584
I have a better trick.

1692
01:43:20,578 --> 01:43:21,721
Four words.

1693
01:43:23,133 --> 01:43:24,553
Kill the little girl.

1694
01:43:25,692 --> 01:43:27,129
- No, please!
- No!

1695
01:43:30,745 --> 01:43:32,110
Stop!

1696
01:43:47,511 --> 01:43:50,654
Billy, there's one more
demon guy in his eye!

1697
01:43:50,712 --> 01:43:52,378
You gotta just
rip it out of his face...

1698
01:43:52,699 --> 01:43:54,191
It's where he gets his power.

1699
01:43:58,395 --> 01:43:59,593
Reach for it.

1700
01:44:01,379 --> 01:44:02,672
I dare you.

1701
01:44:11,408 --> 01:44:12,655
Wise decision.

1702
01:44:15,075 --> 01:44:16,551
Hands on the staff.

1703
01:44:17,915 --> 01:44:19,407
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1704
01:44:19,544 --> 01:44:21,457
- Billy!
- Don't do it, Billy!

1705
01:44:41,277 --> 01:44:42,547
Say my name

1706
01:44:42,572 --> 01:44:45,111
so my power may
flow through you.

1707
01:44:45,298 --> 01:44:48,195
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

1708
01:44:48,347 --> 01:44:49,934
And in so doing,

1709
01:44:49,959 --> 01:44:52,601
choose you as champion.

1710
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:56,671
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

1711
01:44:56,778 --> 01:44:59,477
The thrones of our
brothers and sisters await!

1712
01:45:07,646 --> 01:45:09,114
All hands on deck.

1713
01:45:14,439 --> 01:45:15,511
Say my name.

1714
01:45:16,931 --> 01:45:18,106
Billy!

1715
01:45:18,355 --> 01:45:19,434
No, not my name. No.

1716
01:45:19,459 --> 01:45:21,696
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

1717
01:45:22,559 --> 01:45:23,860
Shazam!

1718
01:46:02,253 --> 01:46:03,571
Guys.

1719
01:46:04,988 --> 01:46:06,369
What's happening?

1720
01:46:10,784 --> 01:46:12,260
I can fly!

1721
01:46:16,936 --> 01:46:18,095
Guys.

1722
01:46:18,349 --> 01:46:19,889
Check out these guns.

1723
01:46:21,274 --> 01:46:22,504
No.

1724
01:46:23,481 --> 01:46:25,061
It's not possible!

1725
01:46:26,997 --> 01:46:29,434
Gee whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your game.

1726
01:46:29,507 --> 01:46:31,285
You want it back?

1727
01:46:33,164 --> 01:46:35,259
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

1728
01:46:35,348 --> 01:46:38,689
but I think we should kick this
guy's butt, like, really hard.

1729
01:46:50,162 --> 01:46:51,694
Guys, I think
I can move really

1730
01:46:52,829 --> 01:46:53,884
fast.

1731
01:46:54,333 --> 01:46:55,570
Hyperspeed!

1732
01:46:55,602 --> 01:46:56,722
Check!

1733
01:47:05,447 --> 01:47:06,638
Billy!

1734
01:47:06,828 --> 01:47:07,995
The eye.

1735
01:47:15,336 --> 01:47:16,471
Look out!

1736
01:47:18,627 --> 01:47:19,746
Whoa!

1737
01:47:21,297 --> 01:47:22,297
What?

1738
01:47:26,254 --> 01:47:27,659
You almost exploded me!

1739
01:48:13,915 --> 01:48:15,870
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

1740
01:48:15,895 --> 01:48:17,431
of every single superhero.

1741
01:48:18,822 --> 01:48:20,100
What do you got?

1742
01:48:23,806 --> 01:48:25,242
Well, that's terrifying.

1743
01:48:59,379 --> 01:49:01,585
Enough games, boy.

1744
01:49:02,415 --> 01:49:04,177
You think a pack of children can...

1745
01:49:07,244 --> 01:49:08,284
Wait, what?!

1746
01:49:08,403 --> 01:49:10,835
You will beg for mercy

1747
01:49:10,923 --> 01:49:12,860
as I feast on your heart.

1748
01:49:13,816 --> 01:49:14,888
Slow...

1749
01:49:16,342 --> 01:49:18,437
Are you making
some big, evil guy

1750
01:49:18,462 --> 01:49:20,024
speech right now or something?

1751
01:49:20,049 --> 01:49:22,346
You're like, a mile
away from me right now.

1752
01:49:22,371 --> 01:49:23,683
There's cars and trucks...

1753
01:49:23,708 --> 01:49:26,477
I will have the world eating
out of the palm of my hand...

1754
01:49:26,565 --> 01:49:29,168
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1755
01:49:29,201 --> 01:49:30,948
Only I

1756
01:49:31,019 --> 01:49:33,071
have the power to unleash...

1757
01:49:34,425 --> 01:49:35,600
Oh, whatever, screw it.

1758
01:50:06,751 --> 01:50:08,076
Oh, my gosh, those people!

1759
01:50:16,116 --> 01:50:17,204
Hi!

1760
01:50:17,942 --> 01:50:19,165
I caught you!

1761
01:50:30,276 --> 01:50:31,292
I got it!

1762
01:50:31,967 --> 01:50:32,983
I got it!

1763
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:40,474
Oh, my God, I do got it.

1764
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:58,376
You're not gonna believe this,

1765
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:00,194
but you're actually the
first villain I've ever fought.

1766
01:51:00,221 --> 01:51:02,293
It's, like, kind of
a huge deal for me.

1767
01:51:17,332 --> 01:51:18,760
Somebody help!

1768
01:51:27,712 --> 01:51:28,958
Hadouken!

1769
01:51:33,391 --> 01:51:34,391
Hi!

1770
01:51:34,416 --> 01:51:35,844
Wow, it's really you.

1771
01:51:36,811 --> 01:51:39,586
My name is Darla
and I've been really good!

1772
01:51:39,938 --> 01:51:40,966
What?

1773
01:51:44,673 --> 01:51:46,126
Oh, crap.

1774
01:51:47,643 --> 01:51:49,286
No, no, no, no.
No, no!

1775
01:52:17,317 --> 01:52:18,357
Oh, my God!

1776
01:52:18,382 --> 01:52:19,952
I'm giving you suitcase wedgies!

1777
01:52:57,114 --> 01:52:59,352
So this is about your
Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1778
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:02,506
I mean, I've never been
great at math, but uh...

1779
01:53:02,842 --> 01:53:05,229
The big, angry one,
that's Wrath, yeah?

1780
01:53:05,614 --> 01:53:07,892
And then Gluttony, obvi.

1781
01:53:08,665 --> 01:53:09,745
Pride.

1782
01:53:10,199 --> 01:53:12,690
Greed and Sloth, Lust, who

1783
01:53:12,741 --> 01:53:15,916
I thought was gonna be
way hotter, if I'm being honest.

1784
01:53:16,302 --> 01:53:19,215
But that's only six. Where's...
Where's lucky number seven?

1785
01:53:19,588 --> 01:53:21,508
Where's little man?
Where's Envy?

1786
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:24,559
Is he just scared of me and my
family 'cause we're so awesome?

1787
01:53:24,584 --> 01:53:25,916
'Cause I get that.

1788
01:53:26,103 --> 01:53:28,254
Like, the other sins, they
get to come out and fight

1789
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:30,111
'cause they're big
and strong and scary.

1790
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:31,671
But Envy,

1791
01:53:32,735 --> 01:53:34,171
he's just a runt.

1792
01:53:46,761 --> 01:53:48,087
And that's why
all the other sins

1793
01:53:48,112 --> 01:53:50,087
never invite him
out to play, man.

1794
01:53:50,181 --> 01:53:51,737
'Cause they all know who'd win.

1795
01:53:52,742 --> 01:53:53,952
And it's not weak,

1796
01:53:53,996 --> 01:53:56,524
worthless, ugly

1797
01:53:56,627 --> 01:53:57,941
Envy.

1798
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,829
No!

1799
01:54:24,033 --> 01:54:25,184
Gotcha.

1800
01:54:25,985 --> 01:54:27,183
Shazam!

1801
01:54:34,445 --> 01:54:35,493
Shazam!

1802
01:54:46,174 --> 01:54:47,920
Ready to go
round up your buddies?

1803
01:55:17,152 --> 01:55:18,382
No.

1804
01:55:19,202 --> 01:55:20,249
No!

1805
01:55:50,192 --> 01:55:52,041
Here's the thing about power.

1806
01:55:52,703 --> 01:55:54,282
What good's power

1807
01:55:54,353 --> 01:55:56,290
if you got nobody
to share it with?

1808
01:55:57,982 --> 01:55:59,704
- Nice.
- Ta-da.

1809
01:55:59,729 --> 01:56:00,878
That's disgusting.

1810
01:56:00,903 --> 01:56:02,117
Fatality.

1811
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:04,714
I got the voice.

1812
01:56:08,497 --> 01:56:09,775
What's that?

1813
01:56:15,299 --> 01:56:17,220
I can have anything
I've ever wanted?

1814
01:56:21,027 --> 01:56:22,224
Billy, no.

1815
01:56:22,281 --> 01:56:23,701
No, no, no, no!

1816
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:31,370
- You should hear yourself.
- That's not funny.

1817
01:56:31,427 --> 01:56:33,580
What, you think I'm gonna
put a demon ball in my head?

1818
01:56:33,633 --> 01:56:34,831
That's disgusting.

1819
01:56:34,898 --> 01:56:36,700
- It's not funny.
- Pretty funny. You got me going.

1820
01:56:36,725 --> 01:56:38,709
Uh, guys, guys.

1821
01:56:41,819 --> 01:56:42,938
What?

1822
01:56:45,488 --> 01:56:47,068
Oh, hey.

1823
01:56:47,298 --> 01:56:48,433
Oh, wow.

1824
01:56:50,968 --> 01:56:52,308
- Oh.
- Oh.

1825
01:56:57,637 --> 01:56:59,073
All right, we did it!

1826
01:56:59,416 --> 01:57:01,122
- Whoo!
- All right! Yeah!

1827
01:57:01,898 --> 01:57:02,985
Thank you!

1828
01:57:04,259 --> 01:57:05,624
We did it!

1829
01:57:06,945 --> 01:57:09,667
Yeah, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger.

1830
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:25,375
You sure this is gonna work?

1831
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:28,276
Told ya.

1832
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:49,320
You guys know
what this place is, right?

1833
01:57:49,411 --> 01:57:51,816
A dark, haunted cave
with demon statues.

1834
01:57:52,095 --> 01:57:54,976
Well, yes, but also...

1835
01:57:57,832 --> 01:57:58,943
Lair!

1836
01:57:59,133 --> 01:58:00,593
We got a lair!

1837
01:58:00,765 --> 01:58:01,956
Lair.

1838
01:58:02,622 --> 01:58:04,448
- Lair.
- We got a lair.

1839
01:58:06,755 --> 01:58:08,160
What's a lair?

1840
01:58:08,737 --> 01:58:10,642
And thanks to six superheroes,

1841
01:58:10,713 --> 01:58:12,546
citizens are back in their homes

1842
01:58:12,628 --> 01:58:14,462
safe again with their families.

1843
01:58:14,764 --> 01:58:17,264
And here with an eyewitness
account of the events...

1844
01:58:17,306 --> 01:58:19,568
It was f***ing crazy, man!

1845
01:58:19,729 --> 01:58:21,848
Creatures from f***ing hell!

1846
01:58:21,906 --> 01:58:24,541
Lightning coming out of
everyone's f***ing everything.

1847
01:58:24,672 --> 01:58:27,069
And that is not f***ing cool, man!

1848
01:58:27,906 --> 01:58:29,192
I'm tired of it.

1849
01:58:31,804 --> 01:58:32,982
<i>♪ This will be ♪

1850
01:58:33,813 --> 01:58:35,163
<i>♪ An everlasting love ♪

1851
01:58:36,705 --> 01:58:37,840
Guys,

1852
01:58:38,205 --> 01:58:39,578
all hands on deck.

1853
01:58:39,604 --> 01:58:40,604
Oh!

1854
01:58:42,704 --> 01:58:44,061
W-W-W-Wait!

1855
01:58:44,124 --> 01:58:45,156
Wait.

1856
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:47,103
Thank you for this food.

1857
01:58:47,357 --> 01:58:48,865
Thank you for this day.

1858
01:58:49,341 --> 01:58:50,770
Thank you for this family.

1859
01:58:51,556 --> 01:58:54,011
I thought maybe
this time I'd stay.

1860
01:58:55,024 --> 01:58:57,636
I mean, after all,

1861
01:58:57,691 --> 01:58:59,086
I'm home.

1862
01:59:36,139 --> 01:59:37,140
Nope.

1863
01:59:39,541 --> 01:59:40,613
Okay.

1864
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:45,209
What are you doin'?

1865
01:59:45,658 --> 01:59:47,963
Waiting for your
imaginary BFF to show up?

1866
01:59:57,577 --> 01:59:58,768
What are you guys doing here?

1867
01:59:58,974 --> 02:00:00,482
Well, we're having lunch with you.

1868
02:00:00,665 --> 02:00:02,347
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

1869
02:00:02,437 --> 02:00:04,706
Well, we made a very
special arrangement.

1870
02:00:05,790 --> 02:00:07,345
Darla, what's going on?

1871
02:00:07,416 --> 02:00:08,877
Why are you asking me?

1872
02:00:09,237 --> 02:00:10,674
Freddy Freeman!

1873
02:00:12,658 --> 02:00:14,419
This guy...

1874
02:00:14,451 --> 02:00:17,580
taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

1875
02:00:17,605 --> 02:00:19,909
True story, you should
get some pointers

1876
02:00:19,934 --> 02:00:22,053
from him. What's goin' on,

1877
02:00:22,082 --> 02:00:24,883
my best bud...
in the whole world?

1878
02:00:24,938 --> 02:00:28,160
And also new kids that I'm
meeting for the first time

1879
02:00:28,185 --> 02:00:29,742
but seem very cool?

1880
02:00:29,767 --> 02:00:30,801
Uh... huh,

1881
02:00:30,826 --> 02:00:33,598
I invited another friend,
I hope that's okay.

1882
02:00:40,428 --> 02:00:41,507
Huh!

1883
