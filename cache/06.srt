1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
After defeating Zoom
and saving the multiverse,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I ran back in time and created

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I restored the timeline to how it was,

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
only to find things weren't as I left them.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I brought new threats to our world,

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,646
&nbsp

27
00:00:00,656 --> 00:00:01,878
Previously on "The Flash"...

28
00:00:01,888 --> 00:00:01,880
&nbsp

29
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,913
What is that?

30
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:02,915
&nbsp

31
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:04,147
Another epidermal husk,

32
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:04,149
&nbsp

33
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:05,882
a fully-intact human pelt.

34
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:05,884
&nbsp

35
00:00:05,894 --> 00:00:07,918
Do we have any theories
as to what's causing them?

36
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:07,920
&nbsp

37
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,353
- I am Alchemy.
- Well, what do you want?

38
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:10,355
&nbsp

39
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:13,256
To help people achieve their true potential.

40
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:13,258
&nbsp

41
00:00:13,268 --> 00:00:15,725
I know you want this more than anything,

42
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:15,727
&nbsp

43
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:17,994
but you have to face the fact
that it might not happen.

44
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:17,996
&nbsp

45
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:19,963
There's a whole multiverse
of Harrison Wells out there.

46
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:19,965
&nbsp

47
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:21,665
- Call me HR.
- You're a fake.

48
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:21,667
&nbsp

49
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:23,533
Let me prove my worth.

50
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:23,535
&nbsp

51
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:26,069
If I fail, I will right back to my Earth.

52
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:26,071
&nbsp

53
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:28,305
If I succeed, I will have
done some good with my life.

54
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:28,307
&nbsp

55
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:29,906
Caitlin, these powers you have,

56
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:29,908
&nbsp

57
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:31,641
the more you use them,

58
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:31,643
&nbsp

59
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:34,311
the more difficult
they're going to be to reverse.

60
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,847
&nbsp

61
00:00:35,857 --> 00:00:37,147
I'm fast,

62
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:37,149
&nbsp

63
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,282
really fast.

64
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:39,284
&nbsp

65
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:40,917
I might even be the fastest man alive.

66
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:40,919
&nbsp

67
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,485
And when I'm running,

68
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:42,487
&nbsp

69
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:45,088
there's no greater feeling in the world.

70
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:45,090
&nbsp

71
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,058
I can move through the city
like a guardian angel,

72
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:48,060
&nbsp

73
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,492
protecting people who need me.

74
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:55,367
&nbsp

75
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:56,900
Whoa, you gotta slow down.

76
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:56,902
&nbsp

77
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:58,601
And watch where you're going, okay?

78
00:00:58,611 --> 00:00:58,603
&nbsp

79
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:01,137
- Okay.
- Okay.

80
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:01,139
&nbsp

81
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:02,138
Cool skateboard, though.

82
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:02,140
&nbsp

83
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,340
Thanks.

84
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,609
&nbsp

85
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,843
They even have a name for me.

86
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:06,845
&nbsp

87
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:08,745
They call me "Kid Flash."

88
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:08,747
&nbsp

89
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,180
Kid Flash?

90
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:10,182
&nbsp

91
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:11,581
Yeah, the name needs some work, but, Dad,

92
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:11,583
&nbsp

93
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:13,783
I'm telling you, it all just felt so real

94
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:13,785
&nbsp

95
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:16,286
like it was actually happening.

96
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:16,288
&nbsp

97
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:18,288
And how often are you getting these dreams?

98
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:18,290
&nbsp

99
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,622
Uh, last couple nights.

100
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:19,624
&nbsp

101
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:21,491
Last couple?

102
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:21,493
&nbsp

103
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:22,759
Wally, this is exactly

104
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:22,761
&nbsp

105
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:24,728
what Frankie Kane said happened to her.

106
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:24,730
&nbsp

107
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,130
She had dreams, a lot of painful ones,

108
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,132
&nbsp

109
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:29,265
and then she started hearing
Alchemy's voice in her head

110
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:29,267
&nbsp

111
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:31,034
- until she became Magenta.
- Yeah.

112
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:31,036
&nbsp

113
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:32,669
This is totally different, Dad.

114
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:32,671
&nbsp

115
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,804
No. No, it's not.

116
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:34,806
&nbsp

117
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:36,106
Yes, it is.

118
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:36,108
&nbsp

119
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:37,440
I'm a speedster in my dreams.

120
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:37,442
&nbsp

121
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:39,676
I'm not an evil split personality.

122
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:39,678
&nbsp

123
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:41,478
I'm helping people, not hurting them.

124
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:41,480
&nbsp

125
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,179
Dad, this could mean that

126
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:43,181
&nbsp

127
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:46,249
my powers are finally manifesting.

128
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:46,251
&nbsp

129
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:48,918
No, I think this means
that you have a lot in common

130
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:48,920
&nbsp

131
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,355
right now with people who either
ended up in prison or dead.

132
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:52,357
&nbsp

133
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:54,491
Except for the fact that
I got hit by the dark matter

134
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:54,493
&nbsp

135
00:01:54,503 --> 00:01:56,259
from the particle accelerator explosion,

136
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:56,261
&nbsp

137
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:57,827
just like Jesse.

138
00:01:57,837 --> 00:01:59,197
&nbsp

139
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:02,832
I'm going to class.

140
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:07,773
&nbsp

141
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:09,706
Hey, Julian, do you want me to get started

142
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:09,708
&nbsp

143
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:11,341
on the DNA analysis for you?

144
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:11,343
&nbsp

145
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:13,910
Why would I need you to do that?

146
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:13,912
&nbsp

147
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:15,578
I don't know, I just

148
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:15,580
&nbsp

149
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,614
figured we worked so well
together last time.

150
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:17,616
&nbsp

151
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,050
What, that I'd want to do it again?

152
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,052
&nbsp

153
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:21,818
One shared case and one shared drink

154
00:02:21,828 --> 00:02:21,820
&nbsp

155
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,087
does not make us mates, okay?

156
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:24,089
&nbsp

157
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,088
Miss Horton.

158
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:25,090
&nbsp

159
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,189
Mr. Allen.

160
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:26,191
&nbsp

161
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,724
- Mr. Albert.
- Morning.

162
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:27,726
&nbsp

163
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:28,792
New one?

164
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:28,794
&nbsp

165
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:30,827
Uh, yeah, number six.

166
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:30,829
&nbsp

167
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,362
Found it last night.

168
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:32,364
&nbsp

169
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:33,963
Well, this should
come as a welcome surprise.

170
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:33,965
&nbsp

171
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:35,398
You've been reassigned to meta-human

172
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:35,400
&nbsp

173
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,966
crime scene investigation full-time.

174
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:36,968
&nbsp

175
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:38,368
Full-time?

176
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:38,370
&nbsp

177
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,903
We're pouring all the resources we can

178
00:02:39,913 --> 00:02:39,905
&nbsp

179
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:41,771
into figuring out this
husk problem, especially

180
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:41,773
&nbsp

181
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:43,106
considering the last one turned out to be

182
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:43,108
&nbsp

183
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:44,707
that evil speedster, The Rival.

184
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:44,709
&nbsp

185
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,476
Any questions, concerns,
you guys direct them

186
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:46,478
&nbsp

187
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:47,577
to Judge Hankerson, yeah?

188
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:47,579
&nbsp

189
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:49,179
All right. Thank you.

190
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:51,149
&nbsp

191
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,248
Joe.

192
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:52,250
&nbsp

193
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,917
- Cecile.
- Hi.

194
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:53,919
&nbsp

195
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:55,418
I didn't know you were gonna be over here.

196
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:55,420
&nbsp

197
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,054
Any excuse I have
to run into you, I take it.

198
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:00,092
&nbsp

199
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:02,058
You know, I'm really looking
forward to tomorrow night.

200
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:02,060
&nbsp

201
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,059
So am I.

202
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:03,061
&nbsp

203
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,094
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

204
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:04,096
&nbsp

205
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:06,096
Okay, good, then I, uh,

206
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:06,098
&nbsp

207
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:07,630
- I'll see you then.
- All right.

208
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,734
&nbsp

209
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:12,502
Yo. Is that what I think it was?

210
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:12,504
&nbsp

211
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,070
You asked her to movie night with us?

212
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,072
&nbsp

213
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:15,305
That's awesome. When did you do that?

214
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:15,307
&nbsp

215
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:16,940
How'd you do it?

216
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:16,942
&nbsp

217
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:18,241
As much as I'd like to gossip with you

218
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:18,243
&nbsp

219
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:19,843
like a teenager right now,

220
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:19,845
&nbsp

221
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:21,845
there's something else
we need to talk about.

222
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:21,847
&nbsp

223
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:23,246
What?

224
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:23,248
&nbsp

225
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:24,514
Wally.

226
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:24,516
&nbsp

227
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:26,549
He's been having dreams.

228
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:26,551
&nbsp

229
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,684
Dreams?

230
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:27,686
&nbsp

231
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:29,319
Saving people,

232
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:29,321
&nbsp

233
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:30,687
becoming a speedster.

234
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:30,689
&nbsp

235
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,555
He called himself Kid Flash.

236
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:32,557
&nbsp

237
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:35,825
Kid Flash, he...
he said that name, specifically?

238
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:35,827
&nbsp

239
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:37,293
He's in trouble, isn't he?

240
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:37,295
&nbsp

241
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:39,262
If Wally's having dreams of being Kid Flash,

242
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:39,264
&nbsp

243
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:40,964
then he's in trouble,

244
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:40,966
&nbsp

245
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:43,666
yeah, but don't worry,
okay, we'll figure it out.

246
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:43,668
&nbsp

247
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:46,236
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

248
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:47,854

&nbsp

251
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,276
We have a problem.

252
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:53,278
&nbsp

253
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:54,944
Yeah, we do. He's still here.

254
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:54,946
&nbsp

255
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:58,181
Cisco, comedy of the obvious.

256
00:03:58,191 --> 00:03:58,183
&nbsp

257
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:01,384
I made a pact to justify
my presence on your Earth

258
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:01,386
&nbsp

259
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:04,854
and I think I got something.

260
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:04,856
&nbsp

261
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,356
- We're all ears.
- Okay.

262
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:06,358
&nbsp

263
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:09,459
I read every news report
I can get my hands on.

264
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:09,461
&nbsp

265
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:10,760
And I have come to the conclusion

266
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:10,762
&nbsp

267
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:12,262
that this very operation

268
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:12,264
&nbsp

269
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:13,897
is a ticking time-bomb.

270
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:13,899
&nbsp

271
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:15,398
What do you mean?

272
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:15,400
&nbsp

273
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,900
You can't spend all your time working on...

274
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:16,902
&nbsp

275
00:04:16,912 --> 00:04:18,935
working on whatever... whatever this is.

276
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:18,937
&nbsp

277
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:21,771
This... this is a very delicate

278
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:21,773
&nbsp

279
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,374
set of power-dampening cuffs.

280
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:24,376
&nbsp

281
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:26,109
We need them to stop the meta-humans.

282
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:26,111
&nbsp

283
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:28,044
My point exactly.

284
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:28,046
&nbsp

285
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:29,412
It's not gonna be long

286
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:29,414
&nbsp

287
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:31,281
before people start
putting the pieces together

288
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:31,283
&nbsp

289
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:33,016
and figure out what you're doing here.

290
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:33,018
&nbsp

291
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,151
You're working with The Flash.

292
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:35,153
&nbsp

293
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:36,619
Okay, so what's your idea?

294
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,621
&nbsp

295
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:38,621
The perfect disguise.

296
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:38,623
&nbsp

297
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:41,658
We reopen this laboratory

298
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:41,660
&nbsp

299
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,296
and I become the face of
the new S.T.A.R. Labs

300
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:46,298
&nbsp

301
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:48,464
Museum.

302
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:48,466
&nbsp

303
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:50,633
There's only one problem with that.

304
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:50,635
&nbsp

305
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:51,935
It's your face.

306
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:51,937
&nbsp

307
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:53,136
You're kind of a known murderer

308
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:53,138
&nbsp

309
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:54,837
around these parts.

310
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:54,839
&nbsp

311
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,706
You see, the evil Wells,

312
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:56,708
&nbsp

313
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:59,809
not to be confused with
the dick-ish but not evil Wells,

314
00:04:59,819 --> 00:04:59,811
&nbsp

315
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:02,345
he confessed to killing Barry's mother.

316
00:05:02,355 --> 00:05:02,347
&nbsp

317
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:04,214
So basically, if you step foot

318
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:04,216
&nbsp

319
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:06,883
outside this lab, you'll be arrested.

320
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:06,885
&nbsp

321
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:09,419
What... you're just telling me
this now, you two rascals?

322
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:09,421
&nbsp

323
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,221
What about the cryptogram?
What about the message?

324
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:11,223
&nbsp

325
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:12,522
Come to this Earth. Get a fresh start.

326
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:12,524
&nbsp

327
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:13,923
Well, what about your risumi

328
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:13,925
&nbsp

329
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:16,326
as a world-renowned genius scientist?

330
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,530
&nbsp

331
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,763
That's a good point. I guess we're even.

332
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:20,765
&nbsp

333
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:22,865
If a string is in a knot,
patience will untie it.

334
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:22,867
&nbsp

335
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:25,168
Patience can do lots of things.
Have you ever tried it?

336
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:25,170
&nbsp

337
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,403
My dear ma used to say that
to me all the time

338
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:27,405
&nbsp

339
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:28,905
any time I had a problem.

340
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:28,907
&nbsp

341
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,473
Now I have a problem.

342
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:30,475
&nbsp

343
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:33,309
I guess I'm gonna use that adage
to figure it out.

344
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:33,311
&nbsp

345
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:36,813
S.T.A.R. Labs Museum, think about it.

346
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:36,815
&nbsp

347
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:40,316
You think everyone on Earth-19
is missing crayons in the box,

348
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:40,318
&nbsp

349
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:42,485
or just him?

350
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:44,823
&nbsp

351
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,290
Paging Dr. Snow.

352
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,292
&nbsp

353
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:50,293
Wow, you are out of it. Sorry.

354
00:05:50,303 --> 00:05:50,295
&nbsp

355
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:52,996
This have anything to do
with your recent visit with mom?

356
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:52,998
&nbsp

357
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:54,998
I just... I haven't been sleeping well,

358
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:55,000
&nbsp

359
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,666
but I'm okay.

360
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:56,668
&nbsp

361
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:57,934
Coffee?

362
00:05:57,944 --> 00:05:57,936
&nbsp

363
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,168
Perfect.

364
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:07,479
&nbsp

365
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:10,079
So I did have powers?

366
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:10,081
&nbsp

367
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:11,180
I was Kid Flash?

368
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,182
&nbsp

369
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:14,284
In Flashpoint, yes.

370
00:06:14,294 --> 00:06:14,286
&nbsp

371
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:16,119
I knew that this was happening.

372
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:16,121
&nbsp

373
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,720
Why didn't you tell me before?

374
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:17,722
&nbsp

375
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:18,988
Because...

376
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:18,990
&nbsp

377
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,124
Because why?

378
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:21,126
&nbsp

379
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,059
All right, fine, Wally, it, look...

380
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:23,061
&nbsp

381
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:25,228
in that timeline,

382
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:25,230
&nbsp

383
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,863
you were fighting The Rival.

384
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:26,865
&nbsp

385
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,197
Edward Clariss?

386
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:28,199
&nbsp

387
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:29,799
Edward Clariss, yeah.

388
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:29,801
&nbsp

389
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,100
You couldn't stop him.

390
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,102
&nbsp

391
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:33,002
There was no S.T.A.R. Labs.

392
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:33,004
&nbsp

393
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:34,771
There was no team to help you.

394
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:34,773
&nbsp

395
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,372
It was just you and Iris.

396
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:36,374
&nbsp

397
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:39,042
The two of you were a brother-sister

398
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:39,044
&nbsp

399
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:41,944
superhero crime-fighting team.

400
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:41,946
&nbsp

401
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:44,647
Why didn't you tell us this before?

402
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:44,649
&nbsp

403
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,417
You didn't want to know
about your Flashpoint lives.

404
00:06:47,427 --> 00:06:47,419
&nbsp

405
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,118
But look, listen to me,

406
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:49,120
&nbsp

407
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,888
you got hurt, all right?

408
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:51,890
&nbsp

409
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,423
You got hurt bad.

410
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:53,425
&nbsp

411
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:54,891
So what?

412
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:54,893
&nbsp

413
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:56,959
That's that me, it's not this me.

414
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:56,961
&nbsp

415
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:58,961
And I want to be a speedster.

416
00:06:58,971 --> 00:06:58,963
&nbsp

417
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:00,463
I... I want to be a flash.

418
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:00,465
&nbsp

419
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:02,398
No, no, no, you don't.

420
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:02,400
&nbsp

421
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,833
Yes, I do.

422
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:03,835
&nbsp

423
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:05,234
You're not hearing what he's saying.

424
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:05,236
&nbsp

425
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,369
He's telling us it's not safe.

426
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:06,371
&nbsp

427
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,071
Who cares what Barry's saying?

428
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:08,073
&nbsp

429
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,605
How do we even know he's telling the truth?

430
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:09,607
&nbsp

431
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:11,474
Wally, come on, this isn't because of

432
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:11,476
&nbsp

433
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:13,843
the particle accelerator,
it's because of Dr. Alchemy.

434
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:13,845
&nbsp

435
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:15,912
It's the same thing
that happened to Frankie Kane.

436
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:15,914
&nbsp

437
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:17,280
- You don't know that.
- Yes, we do.

438
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,282
&nbsp

439
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,582
And we need to try
to keep it from happening.

440
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:19,584
&nbsp

441
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:21,784
Why don't we just say
what this is really about?

442
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:21,786
&nbsp

443
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:23,653
You're okay with Barry having powers;

444
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:23,655
&nbsp

445
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:25,121
you're okay with Barry running into danger,

446
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:25,123
&nbsp

447
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,422
fighting all these metas.

448
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:26,424
&nbsp

449
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:28,257
He can screw up over and over again

450
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:28,259
&nbsp

451
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:31,427
You're okay with all of it
because he's Barry.

452
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:31,429
&nbsp

453
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,463
But you won't give me
the same amount of leeway

454
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:33,465
&nbsp

455
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:34,731
because at the end of the day,

456
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:34,733
&nbsp

457
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,632
you just don't trust me.

458
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:36,634
&nbsp

459
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:38,501
You know that's not true, Wally.

460
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:38,503
&nbsp

461
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:40,470
I don't need you fighting
my dad's battles for him.

462
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,472
&nbsp

463
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,872
Say it, Joe.

464
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:42,874
&nbsp

465
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:45,875
You don't trust me, do you?

466
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:45,877
&nbsp

467
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:47,510
Wally...

468
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,512
&nbsp

469
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,711
That's what I thought.

470
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:51,616
&nbsp

471
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,515
Hey, hey...

472
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:57,989
&nbsp

473
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:01,090
No. No, you're not listening to me.

474
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,092
&nbsp

475
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:02,859
I said the shares are undervalued

476
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,861
&nbsp

477
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:07,029
so if the stock drops,
you should buy more, not less.

478
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:07,031
&nbsp

479
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,098
No, that... that's not how it works.

480
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:09,100
&nbsp

481
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,767
Look, just look at its balance sheet.

482
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:15,273
&nbsp

483
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:19,308
If you sell now, you're going
to lose a lot of money.

484
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:19,310
&nbsp

485
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,677
I understand that.

486
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:21,679
&nbsp

487
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,212
Of course it's your money.

488
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:23,214
&nbsp

489
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:25,782
Just hold onto it then.

490
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:25,784
&nbsp

491
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:28,785
You know what? If you're not gonna listen...

492
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:47,681
&nbsp

493
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:50,558
Petechiae around the eye,
the crushed larynx.

494
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:51,455
&nbsp

495
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,788
This poor chap has got

496
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:52,790
&nbsp

497
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,856
fingerprints all round his neck.

498
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:53,910
&nbsp

499
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,109
He's clearly been strangled.

500
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:55,111
&nbsp

501
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,511
I heard multiple witnesses

502
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:56,513
&nbsp

503
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:58,112
said the man was attacked by a shadow.

504
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:58,114
&nbsp

505
00:08:58,124 --> 00:08:59,680
Huh.

506
00:08:59,690 --> 00:08:59,682
&nbsp

507
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,149
So a meta from Neverland's made the trip

508
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,151
&nbsp

509
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:02,517
to Central City Fabulous.

510
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:02,519
&nbsp

511
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:03,951
So far there's no forensic evidence

512
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:03,953
&nbsp

513
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:05,186
that there was an assailant.

514
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:05,188
&nbsp

515
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:07,989
No laceration marks. No fingernail marks.

516
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:07,991
&nbsp

517
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:09,891
No DNA evidence underneath
the fingernails even?

518
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:09,893
&nbsp

519
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,259
Nothing yet, we'll have to wait and see.

520
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,261
&nbsp

521
00:09:11,271 --> 00:09:13,161
There's always something.

522
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:13,163
&nbsp

523
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:15,229
Bag the body up and
I'll meet you back at the lab.

524
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:15,231
&nbsp

525
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:16,430
- Yeah.
- See ya.

526
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,432
&nbsp

527
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,566
Oh, and Julian, um,

528
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:18,568
&nbsp

529
00:09:18,578 --> 00:09:20,868
I'm going to that movie in the park thing

530
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:20,870
&nbsp

531
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,439
with Joe and his... or my...
Iris and some other friends.

532
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:25,441
&nbsp

533
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:27,742
Uh, if you felt like going,
it starts at 8:00.

534
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:27,744
&nbsp

535
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:29,710
We're all a bunch of nerds, so

536
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:29,712
&nbsp

537
00:09:29,722 --> 00:09:31,445
you'll fit right in.

538
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:31,447
&nbsp

539
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:33,414
Well, that's a very enticing offer, Allen,

540
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:33,416
&nbsp

541
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:35,583
but I'm actually seeing
my girlfriend tonight, so.

542
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:35,585
&nbsp

543
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:38,352
Oh, you have a girlfriend?
I didn't know that.

544
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:38,354
&nbsp

545
00:09:38,364 --> 00:09:40,988
I'm sure there's lots
about me that you don't know.

546
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:40,990
&nbsp

547
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,757
- Cheerio.
- Yeah.

548
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:42,759
&nbsp

549
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:44,492
- Albert.
- Detective.

550
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:44,494
&nbsp

551
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:46,093
- Hey.
- Anything?

552
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:46,095
&nbsp

553
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:48,696
With the... uh, nothing yet, at least.

554
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:48,698
&nbsp

555
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,431
Have you seen Wally this morning?

556
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:50,433
&nbsp

557
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:51,666
No. Why?

558
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:51,668
&nbsp

559
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,634
He left the house in a huff.

560
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:53,636
&nbsp

561
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:55,036
He won't answer my calls.

562
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:55,038
&nbsp

563
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:56,671
Iris is out there looking for him right now.

564
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:56,673
&nbsp

565
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,239
Did you want me to run around the city?

566
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:58,241
&nbsp

567
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:01,008
Maybe if I can't get ahold of him.

568
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:01,010
&nbsp

569
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,110
What Wally said, it's partially true.

570
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,112
&nbsp

571
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:05,112
I didn't answer his question because

572
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:05,114
&nbsp

573
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:06,647
I... I don't trust him with these powers

574
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:06,649
&nbsp

575
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:08,482
the same way I trust you with them.

576
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:08,484
&nbsp

577
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:10,851
You got to talk to him about that.

578
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:10,853
&nbsp

579
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:13,254
You know, tell him why, especially now.

580
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:13,256
&nbsp

581
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,256
I will, I mean, just gotta find him first.

582
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:15,258
&nbsp

583
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,857
Look, I'll just keep calling him.

584
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:16,859
&nbsp

585
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:18,192
He's got to answer at some point, right?

586
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:18,194
&nbsp

587
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,427
Man, I feel bad, too.

588
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:19,429
&nbsp

589
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:20,561
It's your first date with Cecile

590
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:20,563
&nbsp

591
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:21,696
and you got to worry about this.

592
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:21,698
&nbsp

593
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,264
Don't worry about that.

594
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:23,266
&nbsp

595
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:25,666
That's one part of my life I can control.

596
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:30,340
&nbsp

597
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,006
Yes?

598
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:32,008
&nbsp

599
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:33,441
Have you seen HR?

600
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:33,443
&nbsp

601
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:35,476
Maybe he's meditating in his room.

602
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:35,478
&nbsp

603
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:37,044
No, he's not there.

604
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:37,046
&nbsp

605
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:38,946
HR, you're needed in the Speed Lab, now.

606
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:38,948
&nbsp

607
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,416
He could be doing inversion
stretches in the intake.

608
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:42,418
&nbsp

609
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:43,651
You saw that too, huh?

610
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:43,653
&nbsp

611
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:45,319
HR! He's not there.

612
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:45,321
&nbsp

613
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:46,821
Probably just brewing another pot of coffee.

614
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:46,823
&nbsp

615
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,623
- It's all he drinks.
- Not that either.

616
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:48,625
&nbsp

617
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,459
Okay. Why do you need him so badly?

618
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:51,461
&nbsp

619
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:53,761
He's going through my stuff, but now...

620
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:53,763
&nbsp

621
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:56,897
He's just being stupid about it.

622
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:56,899
&nbsp

623
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:59,066
Stupid about what?

624
00:10:59,076 --> 00:10:59,068
&nbsp

625
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:01,936
God, I swear I fixed the security system.

626
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:01,938
&nbsp

627
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,137
Who the hell are you?

628
00:11:03,147 --> 00:11:03,139
&nbsp

629
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:04,238
HR.

630
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,543
&nbsp

631
00:11:07,553 --> 00:11:08,709
Apologies.

632
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:12,849
&nbsp

633
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,548
HR.

634
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:14,550
&nbsp

635
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,751
See? Ah. What you've just been witness to

636
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:16,753
&nbsp

637
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:19,053
was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.

638
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:19,055
&nbsp

639
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:21,422
Okay, I see what's going on here.

640
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:21,424
&nbsp

641
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:24,525
You don't have facial transmogrification

642
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:24,527
&nbsp

643
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:25,693
on this planet, do you?

644
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:25,695
&nbsp

645
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:27,261
No, we certainly do not.

646
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:27,263
&nbsp

647
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:29,096
Well then,

648
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:29,098
&nbsp

649
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:30,665
it's a good thing for me
I found this little contraption

650
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:30,667
&nbsp

651
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:32,099
in my satchel... forgot I brought it.

652
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:32,101
&nbsp

653
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,934
It's so fun.

654
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:33,936
&nbsp

655
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:35,803
So fun? How does this work?

656
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:35,805
&nbsp

657
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:37,605
Light refraction technology.

658
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:37,607
&nbsp

659
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,106
Light refraction?

660
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:39,108
&nbsp

661
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:40,408
I think... I don't... Randolf,

662
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:40,410
&nbsp

663
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,109
my... business partner,

664
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:42,111
&nbsp

665
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:43,711
he's sort of more with the science.

666
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:43,713
&nbsp

667
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:45,880
But this little sucker
is gonna go a long way

668
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:45,882
&nbsp

669
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:48,349
to solving my Harrison Wells facial issues.

670
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:48,351
&nbsp

671
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:51,719
I'm gonna hang onto this
until I get my power cuffs back.

672
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:51,721
&nbsp

673
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:53,921
What, your power cuffs?

674
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:53,923
&nbsp

675
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,990
Your meta-human power-dampening cuffs?

676
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:55,992
&nbsp

677
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:57,591
Those very ones, the ones that are

678
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:57,593
&nbsp

679
00:11:57,603 --> 00:11:59,126
missing all of a sudden.

680
00:11:59,136 --> 00:11:59,128
&nbsp

681
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:00,795
What... you think... you think I took them?

682
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:00,797
&nbsp

683
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,630
I didn't take them.
What do I need cuffs for?

684
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:02,632
&nbsp

685
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:04,465
I just got to this Earth. I came alone.

686
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:04,467
&nbsp

687
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:06,767
I haven't met anyone yet;
it's gonna take a while,

688
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:06,769
&nbsp

689
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,236
even when I do meet them,
to get to the cuff stage.

690
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:09,238
&nbsp

691
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:12,106
Hey, guys?

692
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:12,108
&nbsp

693
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:15,242
Guys, I need you in the Cortex.

694
00:12:15,252 --> 00:12:15,244
&nbsp

695
00:12:15,254 --> 00:12:18,045
Killed by a shadow? That's a new one.

696
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:18,047
&nbsp

697
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:19,947
Maybe that's what killed Edward Clariss.

698
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:19,949
&nbsp

699
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,549
Clariss was a meta-human.

700
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:21,551
&nbsp

701
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:23,851
This victim doesn't appear to be.

702
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:23,853
&nbsp

703
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:25,920
Do we know if this shadow meta is from the

704
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:25,922
&nbsp

705
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:28,556
particle accelerator explosion
or from Dr. Alchemy?

706
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:28,558
&nbsp

707
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:29,757
Not yet, no.

708
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:29,759
&nbsp

709
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:30,958
We actually haven't found any

710
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:30,960
&nbsp

711
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,560
evidence to process.

712
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:32,562
&nbsp

713
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:34,962
If only we had a way, Francisco,

714
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:34,964
&nbsp

715
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:36,197
to see what happened.

716
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:36,199
&nbsp

717
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:37,732
Where was the crime scene located?

718
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:37,734
&nbsp

719
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:39,667
In Chubbuck, uh, Palmer and Racine,

720
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:39,669
&nbsp

721
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,036
around 11:00 last night.

722
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:43,473
&nbsp

723
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:44,939
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

724
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,941
&nbsp

725
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:45,973
That's gonna give me night terrors.

726
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:45,975
&nbsp

727
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:47,975
- Shade.
- What?

728
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:47,977
&nbsp

729
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,977
We had a meta-hominid on my planet

730
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:49,979
&nbsp

731
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,145
who could do virtually the same thing,

732
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:51,147
&nbsp

733
00:12:51,157 --> 00:12:52,646
called himself "Shade."

734
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:52,648
&nbsp

735
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:54,949
What did he do, throw
his side-eye at his enemies?

736
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:54,951
&nbsp

737
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:56,650
No, I know, it's a terrible nickname, right?

738
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:56,652
&nbsp

739
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:59,220
But what Shade could do was
vibrate at such a high frequency

740
00:12:59,230 --> 00:12:59,222
&nbsp

741
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:02,123
he created the illusion
that he was a shadow.

742
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:02,125
&nbsp

743
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:03,958
That's how I phase.

744
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:03,960
&nbsp

745
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,326
Do you think he's doing the same thing?

746
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:05,328
&nbsp

747
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:06,494
He has to be.

748
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:06,496
&nbsp

749
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:07,661
Heat signature's fluctuating.

750
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:07,663
&nbsp

751
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:09,397
Red shift is ridiculous.

752
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:09,399
&nbsp

753
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:11,031
Okay, so he is.

754
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:11,033
&nbsp

755
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:13,534
He must be slowing down his
molecules whenever he attacks.

756
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:13,536
&nbsp

757
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:16,670
So we just have to figure out
a way to keep them slowed down,

758
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:16,672
&nbsp

759
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:18,305
and that should be enough to grab him.

760
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:18,307
&nbsp

761
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:19,640
All right, can you get started?

762
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:19,642
&nbsp

763
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:20,941
Okay, but, like, right this minute?

764
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:20,943
&nbsp

765
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:22,510
Yeah, I'm sor... we just...

766
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:22,512
&nbsp

767
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:25,479
we gotta stop this guy fast
so we can focus on Alchemy.

768
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:25,481
&nbsp

769
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:27,882
Wally has been having

770
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:27,884
&nbsp

771
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:30,684
dreams about being a speedster,

772
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:30,686
&nbsp

773
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:33,654
Alchemy dreams.

774
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:33,656
&nbsp

775
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,423
He was a speedster in Flashpoint?

776
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,026
&nbsp

777
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:40,227
Anyone else gonna have powers
we should know about?

778
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:40,229
&nbsp

779
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,029
No.

780
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,031
&nbsp

781
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,864
All right. I'm gonna work on Shade.

782
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:43,866
&nbsp

783
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:45,566
- I'll supervise.
- You're gonna find my cuffs.

784
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:45,568
&nbsp

785
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:47,301
I'll have to find some cuffs.

786
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:47,303
&nbsp

787
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:48,502
All right, I got to get back to work

788
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:48,504
&nbsp

789
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:50,204
before Julian loses his mind.

790
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:55,378
&nbsp

791
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,344
Wally, it's your dad, again.

792
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:57,346
&nbsp

793
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:58,913
Just give me a call back, all right?

794
00:13:58,923 --> 00:13:58,915
&nbsp

795
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,981
Or a text, I just need to know you're okay.

796
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:00,983
&nbsp

797
00:14:00,993 --> 00:14:02,516
I'm okay.

798
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:02,518
&nbsp

799
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,552
Wally.

800
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:04,554
&nbsp

801
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:05,586
You can't do that.

802
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:05,588
&nbsp

803
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:08,155
You can't just disappear.

804
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:08,157
&nbsp

805
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,590
I just wanted to let you know

806
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:09,592
&nbsp

807
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:11,459
I'm fine, so.

808
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:11,461
&nbsp

809
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:13,527
Come here.

810
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:20,536
&nbsp

811
00:14:20,546 --> 00:14:22,870
Listen, you were right.

812
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:22,872
&nbsp

813
00:14:22,882 --> 00:14:26,140
I do treat Barry differently
than I treat you.

814
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,142
&nbsp

815
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:28,509
But not because I think
Barry's better than you.

816
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:28,511
&nbsp

817
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:29,944
Then why?

818
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:29,946
&nbsp

819
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,213
Wally, you're a lot like I was as a kid.

820
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:32,215
&nbsp

821
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:34,181
You're fearless and you take risks

822
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:34,183
&nbsp

823
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:36,450
and that makes you
a handful just like I was.

824
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:36,452
&nbsp

825
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:39,253
And now you're getting powers.

826
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:39,255
&nbsp

827
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:41,889
That alone would make me nervous

828
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:41,891
&nbsp

829
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:44,391
because I know what I
would have done if I got powers.

830
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:44,393
&nbsp

831
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:47,228
But you're not getting your speed

832
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:47,230
&nbsp

833
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,963
the same way Barry got his.

834
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:48,965
&nbsp

835
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,297
You're getting your speed the way

836
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:50,299
&nbsp

837
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:52,600
Magenta and The Rival got theirs.

838
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:52,602
&nbsp

839
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:55,069
So it's not that I don't
trust you, Wally, it's just

840
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:55,071
&nbsp

841
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:57,805
I don't trust what's
going on with you right now.

842
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:57,807
&nbsp

843
00:14:57,817 --> 00:14:59,974
And that scares the living hell out of me.

844
00:14:59,984 --> 00:14:59,976
&nbsp

845
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,742
I know, Dad.

846
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:01,744
&nbsp

847
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:03,511
I get it.

848
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:03,513
&nbsp

849
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:04,845
Okay, so

850
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:04,847
&nbsp

851
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:06,046
let's get you to S.T.A.R. Labs

852
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:06,048
&nbsp

853
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:09,216
- and see what we can do.
- All right.

854
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:10,219
&nbsp

855
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:13,020
Wallace.

856
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,022
&nbsp

857
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:14,588
Wallace West.

858
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:17,994
&nbsp

859
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,026
Ah!

860
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:21,330
&nbsp

861
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,296
Wally.

862
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:22,298
&nbsp

863
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:24,064
Wally!

864
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:28,004
&nbsp

865
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,503
Hey, Cisco.

866
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:29,505
&nbsp

867
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,005
Yes?

868
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:31,007
&nbsp

869
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:34,675
I took your cuffs.

870
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:34,677
&nbsp

871
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,010
Why?

872
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,012
&nbsp

873
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,177
Because I need them.

874
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:37,179
&nbsp

875
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:39,046
Is... is this some sort of, um,

876
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:39,048
&nbsp

877
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:41,815
bold fashion choice 'cause
you're not a meta-hu... hu...

878
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:41,817
&nbsp

879
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:43,851
human.

880
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:43,853
&nbsp

881
00:15:43,863 --> 00:15:45,119
Surprise.

882
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:50,560
&nbsp

883
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,660
It started a few months ago.

884
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:52,662
&nbsp

885
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:54,061
That's why you went to see your mom,

886
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:54,063
&nbsp

887
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,195
to see if she could help you.

888
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:55,197
&nbsp

889
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,697
But she can't.

890
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:56,699
&nbsp

891
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:58,265
I've run every test.

892
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:58,267
&nbsp

893
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:00,100
There's nothing that anyone can do.

894
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,102
&nbsp

895
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:03,103
I need a favor.

896
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:03,105
&nbsp

897
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:06,807
I need you to vibe me in the future

898
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:06,809
&nbsp

899
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:10,010
because I need to know if I become...

900
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,012
&nbsp

901
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:12,846
her.

902
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:12,848
&nbsp

903
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,782
You're not gonna become her.

904
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:14,784
&nbsp

905
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:17,451
Okay, just because you have these powers

906
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:17,453
&nbsp

907
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:20,154
doesn't mean you're gonna
turn into Killer Frost.

908
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:20,156
&nbsp

909
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,622
I think it might.

910
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:21,624
&nbsp

911
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:23,223
Please?

912
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:23,225
&nbsp

913
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:25,793
I just need to know for sure.

914
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:25,795
&nbsp

915
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:27,528
I need to know if I become evil

916
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:27,530
&nbsp

917
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,697
because if I do, I have to leave

918
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:29,699
&nbsp

919
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:30,798
and never come back.

920
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:57,360
&nbsp

921
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,861
And?

922
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:00,863
&nbsp

923
00:17:00,873 --> 00:17:02,496
I didn't see anything.

924
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:02,498
&nbsp

925
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:04,531
You're fine.

926
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:04,533
&nbsp

927
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:06,033
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

928
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:09,572
&nbsp

929
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:11,305
Please, um,

930
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:11,307
&nbsp

931
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:13,907
don't tell anyone about this yet, okay?

932
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:13,909
&nbsp

933
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,476
- Of course.
- Okay.

934
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:26,388
&nbsp

935
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,521
According to this,
all your vitals are fine, Wally.

936
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:28,756
&nbsp

937
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:30,322
Wally, what did you see?

938
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:30,324
&nbsp

939
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:32,291
I was Kid Flash again, but

940
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:32,293
&nbsp

941
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:33,959
this time it wasn't a good dream.

942
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:33,961
&nbsp

943
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:37,696
I was fighting The Rival
at some abandoned sawmill.

944
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:37,698
&nbsp

945
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,364
That's what happened in Flashpoint

946
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:39,366
&nbsp

947
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:40,666
before you got hurt.

948
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:40,668
&nbsp

949
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:41,834
They're not just dreams,

950
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:41,836
&nbsp

951
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:43,769
they must be memories of that life.

952
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:43,771
&nbsp

953
00:17:43,781 --> 00:17:45,871
More and more people are getting powers.

954
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:45,873
&nbsp

955
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:47,439
Okay, so how do we stop this?

956
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:47,441
&nbsp

957
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:49,408
I mean, is there any stopping it even?

958
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:49,410
&nbsp

959
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,077
If Alchemy could reach you at CCPD,

960
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:52,079
&nbsp

961
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:53,545
he could probably reach you
from anywhere, right?

962
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:53,547
&nbsp

963
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:55,113
I have a suggestion.

964
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:55,115
&nbsp

965
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,648
Why don't we throw Wallace in the pipeline

966
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:56,650
&nbsp

967
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,983
until we figure this situation out.

968
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:57,985
&nbsp

969
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,585
You want to lock him up?

970
00:17:59,595 --> 00:17:59,587
&nbsp

971
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:00,853
Yeah, I agree with Joe, we lock him up

972
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:00,855
&nbsp

973
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:02,788
because think about this.

974
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:02,790
&nbsp

975
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,290
We can't stop Alchemy from
getting into Wallace's head,

976
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,292
&nbsp

977
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:07,493
but we put him in the pipeline,
then we control the situation

978
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:07,495
&nbsp

979
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:09,561
from there on out.

980
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:09,563
&nbsp

981
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:10,996
As much as I don't like it, Dad,

982
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:10,998
&nbsp

983
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,465
maybe he's not wrong.

984
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:13,467
&nbsp

985
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:15,133
But only till we figure out

986
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:15,135
&nbsp

987
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:16,301
a better way to make you safe.

988
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:16,303
&nbsp

989
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:17,736
Yeah, I agree with Joe.

990
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:17,738
&nbsp

991
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,239
I'm gonna cancel this movie with Cecile.

992
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:20,241
&nbsp

993
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,640
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, wait, wait,

994
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,642
&nbsp

995
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,509
you've got a date with Cecile?

996
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:23,511
&nbsp

997
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:25,010
Yeah, I was gonna bring her

998
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,012
&nbsp

999
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,845
to movie in the park tonight.

1000
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:26,847
&nbsp

1001
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,447
Well, don't not go.

1002
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:28,449
&nbsp

1003
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:30,349
You've put your life on hold
for us long enough.

1004
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:30,351
&nbsp

1005
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:31,683
Yeah, Dad, he's right, I mean,

1006
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:31,685
&nbsp

1007
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,520
go be Joe West; you're always Dad.

1008
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:34,522
&nbsp

1009
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:36,455
Yeah, we'll stay with Wally,
and make sure nothing happens.

1010
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:36,457
&nbsp

1011
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,557
I told her all of you were coming with me.

1012
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:38,559
&nbsp

1013
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:39,992
Am I gonna be the only one that shows up?

1014
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:39,994
&nbsp

1015
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:43,028
Uh, I would love to see a movie.

1016
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,030
&nbsp

1017
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,997
- What movie is this?
- "The Shining."

1018
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:44,999
&nbsp

1019
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,833
"The Shining," oh, I love that movie.

1020
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:47,835
&nbsp

1021
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:49,468
That movie freaks you out.

1022
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:49,470
&nbsp

1023
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,537
You have never made it past
the part with the Grady twins.

1024
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:51,539
&nbsp

1025
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:53,238
That's... that's... that was...

1026
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:53,240
&nbsp

1027
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,339
I was younger.

1028
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:54,341
&nbsp

1029
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:56,008
Why don't I go with you?

1030
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:56,010
&nbsp

1031
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,042
You sure you don't want stay...

1032
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:57,044
&nbsp

1033
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,176
No, I want to be with you.

1034
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:58,178
&nbsp

1035
00:18:58,188 --> 00:18:59,745
Either way, the more the merrier.

1036
00:18:59,755 --> 00:18:59,747
&nbsp

1037
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:01,179
Let's do it.

1038
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:01,181
&nbsp

1039
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:02,781
Hell, this will be
great fodder for my novel.

1040
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:02,783
&nbsp

1041
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:04,650
Hold on, you guys didn't tell him about?

1042
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:04,652
&nbsp

1043
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:06,184
Joe, no.

1044
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:06,186
&nbsp

1045
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:07,319
They... they told me,

1046
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:07,321
&nbsp

1047
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:09,555
finally, the little scamps.

1048
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:09,557
&nbsp

1049
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,857
But I think that I've worked my way

1050
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:11,859
&nbsp

1051
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:13,992
around that little problem.

1052
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:13,994
&nbsp

1053
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:16,295
Watch this.

1054
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,631
&nbsp

1055
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,932
Whoa.

1056
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:19,934
&nbsp

1057
00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:22,167
Oh, um, let me just...

1058
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:23,604
&nbsp

1059
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:25,337
- What... ah...
- What did you do?

1060
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:25,339
&nbsp

1061
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:26,805
Did you just neuralyze us?

1062
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:26,807
&nbsp

1063
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:28,607
No, I gave you a simple retinal adjustment

1064
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:28,609
&nbsp

1065
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,610
so all of you can see me, HR,

1066
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:31,612
&nbsp

1067
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:34,313
while the rest of the world sees...

1068
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,083
&nbsp

1069
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,284
Randolf Morgan.

1070
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:39,286
&nbsp

1071
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,553
Joe, I promise,
I'll be so... I'll be so quiet.

1072
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:41,555
&nbsp

1073
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,755
You won't even know I'm there.
Silent observer.

1074
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:43,757
&nbsp

1075
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,223
All right.

1076
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:45,225
&nbsp

1077
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:47,459
Wally, keep me posted.

1078
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:47,461
&nbsp

1079
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:48,560
Yeah, I'll be fine.

1080
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:48,562
&nbsp

1081
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:49,628
Just go have fun.

1082
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:49,630
&nbsp

1083
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,562
That's great.

1084
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:52,600
&nbsp

1085
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,433
All right, we want to be 2/3 to the back,

1086
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:54,435
&nbsp

1087
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:56,435
- right in the middle.
- That's a very small screen.

1088
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:56,437
&nbsp

1089
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:58,236
Like, I don't know if we're
gonna be able to see from...

1090
00:19:58,246 --> 00:19:58,238
&nbsp

1091
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,105
No, HR, the screen is perfect, okay?

1092
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:00,107
&nbsp

1093
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,807
- We'll be able to see fine.
- But we're so far...

1094
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:01,809
&nbsp

1095
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,175
That's where the engineer sits when

1096
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:03,177
&nbsp

1097
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:04,977
- he mixes the sound, all right?
- All right.

1098
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:04,979
&nbsp

1099
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:06,511
When you want to get the
Kubrick experience, that's...

1100
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:06,513
&nbsp

1101
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,513
- All right, yeah.
- The sweet spot, right there.

1102
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:08,515
&nbsp

1103
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:10,015
I don't know, maybe we get a
little closer, like right by...

1104
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:10,017
&nbsp

1105
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:11,316
Why don't you let us worry about the seats?

1106
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:11,318
&nbsp

1107
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:12,484
You take care of the snacks and the drinks.

1108
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:12,486
&nbsp

1109
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,353
Great idea.

1110
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:14,355
&nbsp

1111
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:15,687
Any time.

1112
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:15,689
&nbsp

1113
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,222
Oh, I don't...

1114
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:17,224
&nbsp

1115
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:19,291
I'm pretty sure they're

1116
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:19,293
&nbsp

1117
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,627
not gonna take the money from my Earth.

1118
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:21,629
&nbsp

1119
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,061
- I don't think.
- What?

1120
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:23,063
&nbsp

1121
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:24,963
- What is this?
- That's a helbing.

1122
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:24,965
&nbsp

1123
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,131
Here's what you're gonna do.

1124
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:26,133
&nbsp

1125
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,866
You're gonna get us what we need,

1126
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:27,868
&nbsp

1127
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,301
you're gonna do that, go over
to that stand over there.

1128
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,303
&nbsp

1129
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,902
- Great idea.
- You're gonna get us some

1130
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:30,904
&nbsp

1131
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:34,606
- licorice sticks, some Jujubes.
- Licorice... Juju...

1132
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:34,608
&nbsp

1133
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:35,974
Yeah, and coffee.

1134
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:35,976
&nbsp

1135
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:36,975
Do you want anything?

1136
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:36,977
&nbsp

1137
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,177
- No thanks.
- Okay.

1138
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:39,179
&nbsp

1139
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:40,812
Okay.

1140
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:40,814
&nbsp

1141
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,114
You okay, Cisco?

1142
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:42,116
&nbsp

1143
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,482
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

1144
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:43,484
&nbsp

1145
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:44,983
just trying to deal with HR.

1146
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:44,985
&nbsp

1147
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,284
Yeah, 'cause you've been on edge

1148
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:46,286
&nbsp

1149
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:48,053
ever since you vibed me.

1150
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:48,055
&nbsp

1151
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:49,321
Are you gonna tell me what you saw?

1152
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:49,323
&nbsp

1153
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,622
Yeah, I told you what I saw.

1154
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:50,624
&nbsp

1155
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,224
No, but, for real.

1156
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:52,226
&nbsp

1157
00:20:52,236 --> 00:20:53,925
I can tell when you're
not being honest with me.

1158
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:53,927
&nbsp

1159
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:55,961
Am I her?

1160
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:57,398
&nbsp

1161
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:59,665
Yeah.

1162
00:20:59,675 --> 00:20:59,667
&nbsp

1163
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,166
Yeah, you're her.

1164
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:01,168
&nbsp

1165
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,802
I... I saw the both of us

1166
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:03,804
&nbsp

1167
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:05,370
fighting.

1168
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,372
&nbsp

1169
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:10,275
Like, full-on Vibe versus Killer Frost.

1170
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:10,277
&nbsp

1171
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:13,645
It's like we're meta-frenemies.

1172
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:13,647
&nbsp

1173
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:15,981
Well, have you ever vibed
anything from the future

1174
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:15,983
&nbsp

1175
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:18,884
that didn't come true?

1176
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:18,886
&nbsp

1177
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:21,153
Just Earth-2 being ripped to shreds.

1178
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:21,155
&nbsp

1179
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:23,321
But that doesn't mean
that can't happen again.

1180
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:23,323
&nbsp

1181
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,724
Caitlin,

1182
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:25,726
&nbsp

1183
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:26,992
you have to tell them.

1184
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:26,994
&nbsp

1185
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:28,694
You have to tell the team.

1186
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:28,696
&nbsp

1187
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:29,961
We have to figure out what's going on.

1188
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:29,963
&nbsp

1189
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:31,063
No. It's too late.

1190
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:31,065
&nbsp

1191
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:33,165
There's nothing you can do.

1192
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:33,167
&nbsp

1193
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:34,566
Nobody else needs to know.

1194
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:38,605
&nbsp

1195
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:40,672
I haven't been to a movie in forever.

1196
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:40,674
&nbsp

1197
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:42,207
I come whenever I can, I mean,

1198
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:42,209
&nbsp

1199
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,942
sort of a summer tradition with the kids.

1200
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:43,944
&nbsp

1201
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:45,577
Yeah?

1202
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:45,579
&nbsp

1203
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:46,845
You know, it's funny,
you don't really peg me

1204
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:46,847
&nbsp

1205
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:48,513
for a, uh, horror movie type.

1206
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:48,515
&nbsp

1207
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,649
I thought maybe you'd be
more of a chick-flicky.

1208
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:50,651
&nbsp

1209
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:52,617
- Oh, you got jokes.
- Yeah.

1210
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:52,619
&nbsp

1211
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:54,252
I might be mad if you weren't so gorgeous.

1212
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:54,254
&nbsp

1213
00:21:54,264 --> 00:21:57,956
Gorgeous, really?

1214
00:21:57,966 --> 00:21:57,958
&nbsp

1215
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,591
If I'm so gorgeous, then how come you're

1216
00:21:59,601 --> 00:21:59,593
&nbsp

1217
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:02,194
spending more time looking
at that than you are at me?

1218
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:02,196
&nbsp

1219
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:03,462
You know what?

1220
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:03,464
&nbsp

1221
00:22:03,474 --> 00:22:06,031
You're right, Cecile, I'm sorry.

1222
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:06,033
&nbsp

1223
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:07,666
My son, Wally,

1224
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:07,668
&nbsp

1225
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:09,701
he's...

1226
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:09,703
&nbsp

1227
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:12,137
going through some changes and I'm just...

1228
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:12,139
&nbsp

1229
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:13,472
- Hey.
- Just really concerned.

1230
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:13,474
&nbsp

1231
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:15,173
Joe, we can do this another time.

1232
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:15,175
&nbsp

1233
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:16,942
No-no-no-no, I really
want to be here with you, I do.

1234
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:16,944
&nbsp

1235
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:19,511
It's just that when
one of my kids is hurting I'm...

1236
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:19,513
&nbsp

1237
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:22,214
Can't think about anything else at all.

1238
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:22,216
&nbsp

1239
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:24,182
Completely understand.

1240
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:24,184
&nbsp

1241
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:25,951
- You have kids?
- Yeah.

1242
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:25,953
&nbsp

1243
00:22:25,963 --> 00:22:27,285
- Daughter.
- Oh.

1244
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:27,287
&nbsp

1245
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:29,020
Just turned 18.

1246
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,022
&nbsp

1247
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:31,123
I have less than a year before
she leaves me for college.

1248
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:31,125
&nbsp

1249
00:22:31,135 --> 00:22:33,291
Oh, man, you should have brought her.

1250
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:33,293
&nbsp

1251
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:36,194
I drag you away from her
so you can watch a horror movie.

1252
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:36,196
&nbsp

1253
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:38,697
Not many men could.

1254
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:38,699
&nbsp

1255
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:41,666
I'm just glad you finally
figured out what you want.

1256
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:41,668
&nbsp

1257
00:22:41,678 --> 00:22:43,101
Me too.

1258
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:47,274
&nbsp

1259
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,207
Wally, you okay?

1260
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:55,215
&nbsp

1261
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:57,415
- I hate that we have to do this.
- Mm.

1262
00:22:57,425 --> 00:22:57,417
&nbsp

1263
00:22:57,427 --> 00:23:00,152
He so badly wanted powers,
and, now, to keep him locked up

1264
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:00,154
&nbsp

1265
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:01,386
so he doesn't get them, it's...

1266
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:01,388
&nbsp

1267
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:02,821
It's hard, I know.

1268
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:02,823
&nbsp

1269
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,457
I don't know if you actually do.

1270
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:05,459
&nbsp

1271
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:07,159
What does that mean?

1272
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:07,161
&nbsp

1273
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,628
All Wally wants to do is to help people.

1274
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:09,630
&nbsp

1275
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,664
And to see you do that every day
while all he can do

1276
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:12,666
&nbsp

1277
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:14,199
is stand by and watch,

1278
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:14,201
&nbsp

1279
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:16,535
it's hard being a bystander sometimes.

1280
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,906
&nbsp

1281
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:21,907
You don't feel that way too, do you?

1282
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:21,909
&nbsp

1283
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,376
Barry...

1284
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:24,378
&nbsp

1285
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:26,011
Come on.

1286
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:26,013
&nbsp

1287
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:28,847
My contributions here are limited.

1288
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:28,849
&nbsp

1289
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,215
I don't know science.

1290
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:30,217
&nbsp

1291
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:31,650
I don't have powers.

1292
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:31,652
&nbsp

1293
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:35,053
I don't know how to help you.

1294
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:35,055
&nbsp

1295
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:38,290
I couldn't do this without you.

1296
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,292
&nbsp

1297
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:39,291
That's not true.

1298
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:39,293
&nbsp

1299
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:41,726
That is true.

1300
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:41,728
&nbsp

1301
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:44,462
Whether you realize it or not,
there is no Flash

1302
00:23:44,472 --> 00:23:44,464
&nbsp

1303
00:23:44,474 --> 00:23:46,998
without Iris West.

1304
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:51,238
&nbsp

1305
00:23:51,248 --> 00:23:52,838
I'm wolfing this.

1306
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:52,840
&nbsp

1307
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,573
- I'm telling you, it's so good.
- It is good.

1308
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:54,575
&nbsp

1309
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:56,474
What is it about popcorn and the movies?

1310
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:56,476
&nbsp

1311
00:23:56,486 --> 00:23:57,542
Hey, you okay?

1312
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:57,544
&nbsp

1313
00:23:57,554 --> 00:23:58,710
- Hey.
- Yeah, fine.

1314
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:58,712
&nbsp

1315
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:00,278
- Hi, I'm Caitlin.
- Hi.

1316
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:00,280
&nbsp

1317
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,947
Cecile. Nice to meet you.

1318
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:01,949
&nbsp

1319
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,548
And you must be Cisco. That's me.

1320
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:03,550
&nbsp

1321
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,916
Nice to meet you. Hi.

1322
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:04,918
&nbsp

1323
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:05,851
Don't forget about me.

1324
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:05,853
&nbsp

1325
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,953
Hello.

1326
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:07,955
&nbsp

1327
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:10,055
I'm HR.

1328
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:10,057
&nbsp

1329
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:12,123
HR Randolf.

1330
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:12,125
&nbsp

1331
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:13,592
It's amazing to meet you.

1332
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:13,594
&nbsp

1333
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:16,328
- All right, now.
- Amazing.

1334
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:16,330
&nbsp

1335
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,464
And so then... then she says to me,

1336
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:19,466
&nbsp

1337
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:22,100
"Oh, so you are hot chocolate
from another land."

1338
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,102
&nbsp

1339
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,268
I said, "Okay, easy, now."

1340
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:23,270
&nbsp

1341
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,836
Then she, "Wait a minute.

1342
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:24,838
&nbsp

1343
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:27,005
Do you speak a foreign language?"

1344
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:27,007
&nbsp

1345
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:28,006
What did you say?

1346
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:28,008
&nbsp

1347
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:30,342
Well, I said, "Sure."

1348
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:30,344
&nbsp

1349
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:33,178
"As long as I know the words."

1350
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:33,180
&nbsp

1351
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,514
"As long as I know the words."

1352
00:24:36,524 --> 00:24:37,618
&nbsp

1353
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:40,018
I'm gonna smack somebody.

1354
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:52,866
&nbsp

1355
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:54,065
Everybody, move, move!

1356
00:24:54,075 --> 00:25:02,943
&nbsp

1357
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:04,442
It's Shade.

1358
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:04,444
&nbsp

1359
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:05,744
He's at Hofherr Park.

1360
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,547
&nbsp

1361
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:09,180
Wallace.

1362
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,751
&nbsp

1363
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,217
Wallace West.

1364
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,021
&nbsp

1365
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:15,887
The time has come

1366
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:15,889
&nbsp

1367
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:20,058
to restore what was taken from you.

1368
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:20,060
&nbsp

1369
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,594
The time has come

1370
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:22,596
&nbsp

1371
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,663
to set you free.

1372
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:42,512
&nbsp

1373
00:25:42,522 --> 00:25:44,345
Hey, hey, the same thing
happened to Frankie.

1374
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:44,347
&nbsp

1375
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:45,813
You have to fight through the pain.

1376
00:25:45,823 --> 00:25:52,355
&nbsp

1377
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:54,689
Are you okay?

1378
00:25:54,699 --> 00:25:54,691
&nbsp

1379
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:55,957
I think so.

1380
00:25:55,967 --> 00:26:06,336
&nbsp

1381
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:07,769
Find me.

1382
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:07,771
&nbsp

1383
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:10,638
And I will release you from all of this.

1384
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:10,640
&nbsp

1385
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,706
Wally, what is it?

1386
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:11,708
&nbsp

1387
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:13,541
You have to open the door.

1388
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:13,543
&nbsp

1389
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:15,443
I... I can't do that, Wally. I can't.

1390
00:26:15,453 --> 00:26:15,445
&nbsp

1391
00:26:15,455 --> 00:26:18,780
I can make you whole again.

1392
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:18,782
&nbsp

1393
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,648
Open the door! I need to get out!

1394
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:20,650
&nbsp

1395
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,816
Now!

1396
00:26:21,826 --> 00:26:35,298
&nbsp

1397
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:37,832
Flash, just who I came to see.

1398
00:26:37,842 --> 00:26:37,834
&nbsp

1399
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:40,301
So you like shadows?

1400
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:40,303
&nbsp

1401
00:26:40,313 --> 00:26:42,036
Want to try and catch mine?

1402
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:59,889
&nbsp

1403
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:01,456
Barry, we're in the van. Can you hear us?

1404
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:01,458
&nbsp

1405
00:27:01,468 --> 00:27:04,725
And I just got tossed
on my ass like a rag doll.

1406
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:04,727
&nbsp

1407
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:05,693
That's not good.

1408
00:27:05,703 --> 00:27:05,695
&nbsp

1409
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:07,195
All right, guys,

1410
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:07,197
&nbsp

1411
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:09,063
I cannot do anything if I can't see him.

1412
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:09,065
&nbsp

1413
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:10,865
Can we light this place up?

1414
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:10,867
&nbsp

1415
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:12,700
Light's gonna slow down
his molecular vibration

1416
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:12,702
&nbsp

1417
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:14,502
so we can catch him.

1418
00:27:14,512 --> 00:27:14,504
&nbsp

1419
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:16,237
How are we gonna light this place up?

1420
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:16,239
&nbsp

1421
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:17,738
- See all these cars?
- Yeah.

1422
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:17,740
&nbsp

1423
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,340
- I hack into their computers.
- Yeah?

1424
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:19,342
&nbsp

1425
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:21,275
- The park's overhead lights.
- Yeah?

1426
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:21,277
&nbsp

1427
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:22,510
Blast this guy with more lumens

1428
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:22,512
&nbsp

1429
00:27:22,522 --> 00:27:24,445
- than a Pink Floyd concert.
- Yeah.

1430
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:25,448
&nbsp

1431
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,547
What are you doing?

1432
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:26,549
&nbsp

1433
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,648
He's gonna need these.

1434
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:30,186
&nbsp

1435
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:31,452
- She took...
- She took the cuffs.

1436
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:31,454
&nbsp

1437
00:27:31,464 --> 00:27:32,987
Okay, just drop it, all right?

1438
00:27:32,997 --> 00:27:32,989
&nbsp

1439
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,088
Barry, I'm in.

1440
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:34,090
&nbsp

1441
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,756
Okay.

1442
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:35,758
&nbsp

1443
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:37,959
All right, wait until my mark.

1444
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:37,961
&nbsp

1445
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:39,427
And by mark,

1446
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:39,429
&nbsp

1447
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,695
I do mean

1448
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:40,697
&nbsp

1449
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:42,296
next time that I get punched.

1450
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:43,266
&nbsp

1451
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:45,433
Mark.

1452
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:53,943
&nbsp

1453
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:56,010
Flash!

1454
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:08,324
&nbsp

1455
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:10,958
Don't like the light, do you?

1456
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:10,960
&nbsp

1457
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,593
Nowhere to hide now.

1458
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,764
&nbsp

1459
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,931
Get me out. Get me out... ah!

1460
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:23,673
&nbsp

1461
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:24,972
Help me!

1462
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:24,974
&nbsp

1463
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:26,774
Please, make it stop.

1464
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:26,776
&nbsp

1465
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:27,808
Ah, Iris!

1466
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:27,810
&nbsp

1467
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,710
Hey, Wally, Wally, Wally, look.

1468
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:29,712
&nbsp

1469
00:28:29,722 --> 00:28:31,112
It's over, okay? Come on, come on...

1470
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:31,114
&nbsp

1471
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:34,315
Find me.

1472
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:34,317
&nbsp

1473
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:36,617
Stay out of my way.

1474
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:38,855
&nbsp

1475
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:39,987
Wally, stop.

1476
00:28:39,997 --> 00:28:39,989
&nbsp

1477
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,322
Stay out of my way!

1478
00:28:41,332 --> 00:28:47,163
&nbsp

1479
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:48,996
Wally wasn't himself.

1480
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:48,998
&nbsp

1481
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:50,598
He was possessed.

1482
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:50,600
&nbsp

1483
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,999
Alchemy was calling for him.

1484
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:52,001
&nbsp

1485
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:53,301
I knew I shouldn't have left.

1486
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:53,303
&nbsp

1487
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:55,202
It's okay, Joe, nothing happened.

1488
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:55,204
&nbsp

1489
00:28:55,214 --> 00:28:56,904
He's not okay, Barry.

1490
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:56,906
&nbsp

1491
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,339
This thing's coming after him, and...

1492
00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:58,341
&nbsp

1493
00:28:58,351 --> 00:28:59,540
and there ain't a damn thing we can do?

1494
00:28:59,550 --> 00:28:59,542
&nbsp

1495
00:28:59,552 --> 00:29:00,841
Well, we stopped Shade.

1496
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:00,843
&nbsp

1497
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:02,610
And now we can focus on Alchemy, all right?

1498
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:02,612
&nbsp

1499
00:29:02,622 --> 00:29:04,645
Unless he sends another meta
to Central City to attack.

1500
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:04,647
&nbsp

1501
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:05,913
Then we're in trouble.

1502
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:05,915
&nbsp

1503
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:07,548
You think Shade was a distraction?

1504
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:07,550
&nbsp

1505
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,350
I agree with Iris;
I think the attack on Wally

1506
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,352
&nbsp

1507
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:11,485
and the attack by Shade happened
at essentially the same time.

1508
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:11,487
&nbsp

1509
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:13,421
So that's not a coincidence.

1510
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:13,423
&nbsp

1511
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:15,222
If that's true, that means
Alchemy's gonna sending

1512
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:15,224
&nbsp

1513
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:16,357
another one of his metas soon.

1514
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:16,359
&nbsp

1515
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:17,491
We don't know that.

1516
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:17,493
&nbsp

1517
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:19,727
Barry, we found six husks.

1518
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:19,729
&nbsp

1519
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:22,229
So besides Shade, Magenta, and Clariss,

1520
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:22,231
&nbsp

1521
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:23,998
there's still three unaccounted for.

1522
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:24,000
&nbsp

1523
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,133
Okay, well, if more come,
then we'll stop them.

1524
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:26,135
&nbsp

1525
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:29,303
But Alchemy can't get Wally
if he stays in the cell.

1526
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:29,305
&nbsp

1527
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:31,172
Barry, we can't just let
Wally suffer in there.

1528
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:31,174
&nbsp

1529
00:29:31,184 --> 00:29:32,840
And besides, burying our head in the sand

1530
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:32,842
&nbsp

1531
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:35,876
is not gonna make Alchemy go away.

1532
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:35,878
&nbsp

1533
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:39,480
Ignoring the problem does not get rid of it.

1534
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:39,482
&nbsp

1535
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:40,548
You're gonna have to face it.

1536
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:41,784
&nbsp

1537
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:43,651
Don't we?

1538
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:44,721
&nbsp

1539
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:46,387
- What?
- Nothing.

1540
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:46,389
&nbsp

1541
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,222
Come on, Caitlin.

1542
00:29:48,232 --> 00:29:48,224
&nbsp

1543
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:49,790
Not right now, Cisco.

1544
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:49,792
&nbsp

1545
00:29:49,802 --> 00:29:51,926
I... just... I can't just keep this in.

1546
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:51,928
&nbsp

1547
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:53,861
You have to tell them.

1548
00:29:53,871 --> 00:29:53,863
&nbsp

1549
00:29:53,873 --> 00:29:54,996
Tell them what?

1550
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:59,469
&nbsp

1551
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,002
I have powers.

1552
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:01,004
&nbsp

1553
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:02,403
What?

1554
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:02,405
&nbsp

1555
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:04,305
What kind of powers?

1556
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:06,209
&nbsp

1557
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:07,308
The cold kind.

1558
00:30:07,318 --> 00:30:11,781
&nbsp

1559
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,648
Happy now?

1560
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:13,650
&nbsp

1561
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,050
So, what, we're just gonna
keep secrets from each other?

1562
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,052
&nbsp

1563
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,785
Yeah, well, this wasn't your secret to tell,

1564
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:17,787
&nbsp

1565
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:19,053
was it, Cisco?

1566
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:19,055
&nbsp

1567
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:20,488
I did that because I care about you.

1568
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:20,490
&nbsp

1569
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,822
If you cared about me, then you would have

1570
00:30:21,832 --> 00:30:21,824
&nbsp

1571
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,124
let me tell them all when I was ready.

1572
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:23,126
&nbsp

1573
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:25,760
Because this is happening to me, not you.

1574
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:25,762
&nbsp

1575
00:30:25,772 --> 00:30:27,628
I'm the one turning evil.

1576
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:27,630
&nbsp

1577
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,564
I'm the one who's gonna have to leave soon.

1578
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:36,039
&nbsp

1579
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:40,441
I vibed the two of us fighting
each other in the future.

1580
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:40,443
&nbsp

1581
00:30:40,453 --> 00:30:43,377
She was Killer Frost.

1582
00:30:43,387 --> 00:30:43,379
&nbsp

1583
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:45,146
- I'll go talk to her.
- I got it.

1584
00:30:45,156 --> 00:31:06,703
&nbsp

1585
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:08,936
How long have you known?

1586
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:08,938
&nbsp

1587
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:10,905
A few months.

1588
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:12,709
&nbsp

1589
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:15,843
First I didn't want to accept
what was happening to me.

1590
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:15,845
&nbsp

1591
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:17,611
And then I had to.

1592
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:17,613
&nbsp

1593
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:21,148
So then I tried to suppress my powers.

1594
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:22,919
&nbsp

1595
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:25,920
There's no suppressing these powers.

1596
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,890
&nbsp

1597
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,091
I just can't believe that this is my life.

1598
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:30,093
&nbsp

1599
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:32,493
It shouldn't be.

1600
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:32,495
&nbsp

1601
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:35,196
None of what's happening
to any of you should be.

1602
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:35,198
&nbsp

1603
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,031
What do you mean, any of us?

1604
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:37,033
&nbsp

1605
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:39,633
I mean...

1606
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:39,635
&nbsp

1607
00:31:39,645 --> 00:31:41,302
Dr. Alchemy.

1608
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,304
&nbsp

1609
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:42,737
Wally.

1610
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:42,739
&nbsp

1611
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:45,005
You getting powers.

1612
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:45,007
&nbsp

1613
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,508
Even Dante being dead in this timeline.

1614
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:50,213
&nbsp

1615
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:52,713
It's all because I created Flashpoint.

1616
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:52,715
&nbsp

1617
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:55,583
Even Iris, who, I don't know, I think

1618
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:55,585
&nbsp

1619
00:31:55,595 --> 00:31:57,718
she's disappointed that
she doesn't have powers

1620
00:31:57,728 --> 00:31:57,720
&nbsp

1621
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,753
and everyone else does.

1622
00:31:58,763 --> 00:31:58,755
&nbsp

1623
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:00,221
And no matter what I do now,

1624
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:00,223
&nbsp

1625
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:02,757
everything's different.

1626
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:02,759
&nbsp

1627
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,692
So none of this happened before?

1628
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:08,798
&nbsp

1629
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:11,599
I'm sorry, Caitlin.

1630
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:11,601
&nbsp

1631
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:13,868
Wally's up.

1632
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:13,870
&nbsp

1633
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,002
Okay.

1634
00:32:15,012 --> 00:32:19,008
&nbsp

1635
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:20,341
How you feeling?

1636
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:20,343
&nbsp

1637
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:21,909
I've been better.

1638
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:21,911
&nbsp

1639
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:23,144
What do we do?

1640
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:23,146
&nbsp

1641
00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:25,312
We got to come up with something.

1642
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:25,314
&nbsp

1643
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:26,313
Use me.

1644
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:26,315
&nbsp

1645
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:28,182
No. No, no, hell no.

1646
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:28,184
&nbsp

1647
00:32:28,194 --> 00:32:30,985
Alchemy's calling for me to go to him.

1648
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:30,987
&nbsp

1649
00:32:30,997 --> 00:32:33,487
Follow me wherever he is,

1650
00:32:33,497 --> 00:32:33,489
&nbsp

1651
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:34,955
and we can stop him.

1652
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:34,957
&nbsp

1653
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:37,758
No. We're not asking you to do that.

1654
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:37,760
&nbsp

1655
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,193
This is our chance to stop him

1656
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:39,195
&nbsp

1657
00:32:39,205 --> 00:32:40,194
We have to do it.

1658
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:40,196
&nbsp

1659
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:41,695
Wally...

1660
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:41,697
&nbsp

1661
00:32:41,707 --> 00:32:44,598
Dad, he... he wants me.

1662
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:44,600
&nbsp

1663
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,966
He's hurting me.

1664
00:32:45,976 --> 00:32:45,968
&nbsp

1665
00:32:45,978 --> 00:32:47,234
So let me fight back.

1666
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:49,972
&nbsp

1667
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:51,705
Wally?

1668
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:58,862
&nbsp

1669
00:32:58,872 --> 00:33:01,129
Find me.

1670
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:02,332
&nbsp

1671
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:03,465
Turn him on his side.

1672
00:33:03,475 --> 00:33:03,467
&nbsp

1673
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:04,899
All right, get him over, come on.

1674
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:04,901
&nbsp

1675
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:06,501
This should help.

1676
00:33:06,511 --> 00:33:06,503
&nbsp

1677
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:07,535
It's a mild sedative.

1678
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:07,537
&nbsp

1679
00:33:07,547 --> 00:33:08,737
- What is that?
- Lorazepam.

1680
00:33:08,747 --> 00:33:08,739
&nbsp

1681
00:33:08,749 --> 00:33:10,271
It works on seizures.

1682
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:10,273
&nbsp

1683
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:11,840
Hopefully it'll work on whatever this is.

1684
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:11,842
&nbsp

1685
00:33:11,852 --> 00:33:13,842
These episodes keep happening
more frequently.

1686
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:13,844
&nbsp

1687
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:15,510
Yeah, and this is just a temporary fix.

1688
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:15,512
&nbsp

1689
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:16,845
If we don't stop it too, he could suffer

1690
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:16,847
&nbsp

1691
00:33:16,857 --> 00:33:18,880
from permanent brain damage.

1692
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:18,882
&nbsp

1693
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,448
We don't have a choice.

1694
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:20,450
&nbsp

1695
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,916
We have to do what Wally wanted; we have to

1696
00:33:21,926 --> 00:33:21,918
&nbsp

1697
00:33:21,928 --> 00:33:23,351
use him to find Alchemy.

1698
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:23,353
&nbsp

1699
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:24,886
No, we're no... it's too dangerous.

1700
00:33:24,896 --> 00:33:24,888
&nbsp

1701
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:27,255
So is doing nothing.

1702
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:27,257
&nbsp

1703
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:28,857
Need I remind everyone that Dr. Alchemy

1704
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:28,859
&nbsp

1705
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:30,759
has a rock that shoots lasers, so who knows

1706
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:30,761
&nbsp

1707
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,060
what he has up his sleeve?

1708
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,062
&nbsp

1709
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:33,261
Cisco's right.

1710
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:33,263
&nbsp

1711
00:33:33,273 --> 00:33:34,796
What if we're walking into a trap?

1712
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:34,798
&nbsp

1713
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:36,531
You guys aren't walking into anything.

1714
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:36,533
&nbsp

1715
00:33:36,543 --> 00:33:38,266
You guys are gonna stay here.

1716
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:38,268
&nbsp

1717
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:39,601
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right.

1718
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:39,603
&nbsp

1719
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:40,436
What does that mean?

1720
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:40,509
&nbsp

1721
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,142
It means that if I'm
gonna put Wally at risk,

1722
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:42,144
&nbsp

1723
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:45,078
I'm gonna use everything
in my power to protect him.

1724
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:45,960
&nbsp

1725
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,627
Double-check your packs.
Make sure we have everything.

1726
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:48,629
&nbsp

1727
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:49,862
- Good to go.
- Okay.

1728
00:33:49,872 --> 00:33:53,634
&nbsp

1729
00:33:53,644 --> 00:33:55,367
So what's the plan, Detective?

1730
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:55,369
&nbsp

1731
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:58,137
This lunatic, calls himself Alchemy,

1732
00:33:58,147 --> 00:33:58,139
&nbsp

1733
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,838
he's the one responsible for all these husks

1734
00:33:59,848 --> 00:33:59,840
&nbsp

1735
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,407
we've been finding all over town.

1736
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:01,409
&nbsp

1737
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,909
But we believe we found a way
to get his location.

1738
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:03,911
&nbsp

1739
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:06,078
How?

1740
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,248
&nbsp

1741
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:10,115
By using his next target.

1742
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:10,117
&nbsp

1743
00:34:10,127 --> 00:34:11,650
Your son?

1744
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:11,652
&nbsp

1745
00:34:11,662 --> 00:34:12,985
We'll stop him, Joe.

1746
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:17,358
&nbsp

1747
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:18,557
Where's Julian?

1748
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:18,559
&nbsp

1749
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:19,925
He didn't come in today.

1750
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:19,927
&nbsp

1751
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:21,360
What, he never misses a day. You call him?

1752
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:21,362
&nbsp

1753
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:23,629
Yeah, it went straight to voicemail.

1754
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:23,631
&nbsp

1755
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:25,397
Well.

1756
00:34:25,407 --> 00:34:25,399
&nbsp

1757
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,465
All right, gents, move out.

1758
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:26,467
&nbsp

1759
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:27,800
Let's roll.

1760
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:27,802
&nbsp

1761
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:28,934
All right, be safe.

1762
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:28,936
&nbsp

1763
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:32,071
We'll see you in a few.

1764
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:32,073
&nbsp

1765
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,505
You ready?

1766
00:34:33,515 --> 00:34:33,507
&nbsp

1767
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:34,974
Yeah.

1768
00:34:34,984 --> 00:34:34,976
&nbsp

1769
00:34:34,986 --> 00:34:37,176
Hey, you remember when
I said that you remind me

1770
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:37,178
&nbsp

1771
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:39,612
of myself as a kid?

1772
00:34:39,622 --> 00:34:39,614
&nbsp

1773
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:41,046
I was never this brave.

1774
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:44,919
&nbsp

1775
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,685
They've just left.

1776
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:46,687
&nbsp

1777
00:34:46,697 --> 00:34:49,788
I'm almost done. I'll be right there.

1778
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:49,790
&nbsp

1779
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,792
Cisco, I am so sorry about how I reacted.

1780
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:53,794
&nbsp

1781
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:56,595
I understand why you told everyone.

1782
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:56,597
&nbsp

1783
00:34:56,607 --> 00:34:58,664
Never helps when we
keep things from each other.

1784
00:34:58,674 --> 00:34:58,666
&nbsp

1785
00:34:58,676 --> 00:34:59,865
You're right.

1786
00:34:59,875 --> 00:34:59,867
&nbsp

1787
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:03,603
And I'm glad that you told everyone.

1788
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:03,634
&nbsp

1789
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:07,235
I'm just not very good at asking for help.

1790
00:35:07,245 --> 00:35:07,237
&nbsp

1791
00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:09,638
I get that from my mom.

1792
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:09,640
&nbsp

1793
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,940
You're better than your mother.

1794
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:11,942
&nbsp

1795
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:13,808
I don't know.

1796
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:13,810
&nbsp

1797
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,977
I'm just so terrified because she said

1798
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:15,979
&nbsp

1799
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,879
if I keep using my powers, then

1800
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:17,881
&nbsp

1801
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:20,782
it'll be impossible to stop them.

1802
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:23,754
&nbsp

1803
00:35:23,764 --> 00:35:26,855
Your mother might be
one of the most accomplished

1804
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:26,857
&nbsp

1805
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:29,691
scientists on this planet,

1806
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:29,693
&nbsp

1807
00:35:29,703 --> 00:35:33,695
but when it comes to the impossible,

1808
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:33,697
&nbsp

1809
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:34,896
we're the experts.

1810
00:35:34,906 --> 00:35:38,969
&nbsp

1811
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,268
We're gonna help you, Caitlin.

1812
00:35:40,278 --> 00:35:40,270
&nbsp

1813
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,504
- Okay?
- Okay.

1814
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:42,506
&nbsp

1815
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,839
Let's go help Wally.

1816
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:44,841
&nbsp

1817
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,141
You got it.

1818
00:35:46,151 --> 00:35:51,148
&nbsp

1819
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:52,480
We're moving in.

1820
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:52,482
&nbsp

1821
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:54,216
Just remember, once you get in there,

1822
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:54,218
&nbsp

1823
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:55,250
we're not gonna have eyes

1824
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,252
&nbsp

1825
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:56,418
Copy that.

1826
00:35:56,428 --> 00:36:02,993
&nbsp

1827
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:05,327
Of course, dude uses an
abandoned subway to set up shop.

1828
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:05,329
&nbsp

1829
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,561
Of course he does.

1830
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:06,563
&nbsp

1831
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:07,862
Where's Grodd when you need him?

1832
00:36:07,872 --> 00:36:07,864
&nbsp

1833
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,564
Gro... Gorilla Grodd?

1834
00:36:09,574 --> 00:36:09,566
&nbsp

1835
00:36:09,576 --> 00:36:11,633
You have sentient gorillas
on your Earth too?

1836
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:11,635
&nbsp

1837
00:36:11,645 --> 00:36:13,535
Oh,

1838
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:13,537
&nbsp

1839
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,670
oh, yeah, yeah, we do, many.

1840
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:15,672
&nbsp

1841
00:36:15,682 --> 00:36:17,872
Many. Yeah.

1842
00:36:17,882 --> 00:36:26,083
&nbsp

1843
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:27,549
Come to me.

1844
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:27,551
&nbsp

1845
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,950
Wallace.

1846
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,787
&nbsp

1847
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:31,987
Everybody set?

1848
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:31,989
&nbsp

1849
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,255
We're good.

1850
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:33,257
&nbsp

1851
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:35,423
Just lead the way.

1852
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:52,943
&nbsp

1853
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:54,743
You okay?

1854
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:54,745
&nbsp

1855
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,244
Yeah.

1856
00:36:56,254 --> 00:36:56,246
&nbsp

1857
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:59,581
It's okay to be scared, Wally.

1858
00:36:59,591 --> 00:36:59,583
&nbsp

1859
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,683
I am.

1860
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:01,685
&nbsp

1861
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:03,451
You are?

1862
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:03,453
&nbsp

1863
00:37:03,463 --> 00:37:05,620
Keeps me alert.

1864
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:05,622
&nbsp

1865
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:08,023
Then I'm on high alert.

1866
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:08,025
&nbsp

1867
00:37:08,035 --> 00:37:09,591
Let's do this.

1868
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:33,984
&nbsp

1869
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,950
Hello, Wally.

1870
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:46,043
&nbsp

1871
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:47,776
Are you him?

1872
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:50,114
&nbsp

1873
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:53,815
Are you the voice I've been
hearing inside my head?

1874
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:53,817
&nbsp

1875
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:57,152
I am Alchemy.

1876
00:37:57,162 --> 00:37:57,154
&nbsp

1877
00:37:57,164 --> 00:38:00,222
I've been having visions

1878
00:38:00,232 --> 00:38:00,224
&nbsp

1879
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:01,690
of another life.

1880
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,247
&nbsp

1881
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:09,148
Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...

1882
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:09,150
&nbsp

1883
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,350
The Flash.

1884
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,352
&nbsp

1885
00:38:11,362 --> 00:38:14,287
I can give you that back,

1886
00:38:14,297 --> 00:38:14,289
&nbsp

1887
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:16,222
should you desire it.

1888
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:16,224
&nbsp

1889
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:18,224
I just want the pain to stop.

1890
00:38:18,234 --> 00:38:18,226
&nbsp

1891
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:19,992
It will, child.

1892
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:19,994
&nbsp

1893
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:22,028
Whatever you desire,

1894
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:22,030
&nbsp

1895
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,263
I will see it so.

1896
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:24,265
&nbsp

1897
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:26,265
Now tell me,

1898
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:26,267
&nbsp

1899
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:29,635
do you wish for the life
that was taken from you

1900
00:38:29,645 --> 00:38:29,637
&nbsp

1901
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:33,306
to return?

1902
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:33,308
&nbsp

1903
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:36,275
What I wish for...

1904
00:38:36,285 --> 00:38:36,277
&nbsp

1905
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:38,477
is all of you gone.

1906
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:38,479
&nbsp

1907
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:39,745
It's a trap!

1908
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:50,158
&nbsp

1909
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:51,657
No!

1910
00:38:51,667 --> 00:39:02,870
&nbsp

1911
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,038
The boy has been chosen, Flash.

1912
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:09,277
&nbsp

1913
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:13,446
And you will not stand
before what must be...

1914
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:14,682
&nbsp

1915
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:16,449
Ever again!

1916
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:18,019
&nbsp

1917
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:19,018
No!

1918
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:21,956
&nbsp

1919
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:23,055
Get on your knees!

1920
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:23,057
&nbsp

1921
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,490
Now! Don't move!

1922
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:24,492
&nbsp

1923
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:25,791
Don't move! Get down!

1924
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:27,462
&nbsp

1925
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:29,996
On the ground.

1926
00:39:30,006 --> 00:39:29,998
&nbsp

1927
00:39:30,008 --> 00:39:31,297
I said get on the ground.

1928
00:39:31,307 --> 00:39:34,769
&nbsp

1929
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:37,436
That was a grave mistake.

1930
00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:37,438
&nbsp

1931
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:39,739
- You okay?
- I'll be fine.

1932
00:39:39,749 --> 00:39:39,741
&nbsp

1933
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:41,907
Wally?

1934
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:41,909
&nbsp

1935
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,476
Yeah.

1936
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,879
&nbsp

1937
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:46,345
It's over, Alchemy.

1938
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:46,347
&nbsp

1939
00:39:46,357 --> 00:39:48,147
Over?

1940
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:48,149
&nbsp

1941
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,082
You have no idea

1942
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:50,084
&nbsp

1943
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:51,851
what's about to begin.

1944
00:39:51,861 --> 00:40:02,764
&nbsp

1945
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:05,164
What the hell?

1946
00:40:05,174 --> 00:40:05,166
&nbsp

1947
00:40:05,176 --> 00:40:06,465
Did you guys see that?

1948
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:06,467
&nbsp

1949
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:08,668
See what?

1950
00:40:08,678 --> 00:40:17,245
&nbsp

1951
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:18,811
Go. Get the hell out of here!

1952
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:22,417
&nbsp

1953
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:23,983
Wally, move towards the door!

00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:23,985
&nbsp

1955
00:40:23,995 --> 00:40:24,984
Stick with me!

&nbsp

1957
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:29,155
The other way! The other way!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1958
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:29,157
&nbsp

1959

&nbsp

1967
00:40:48,252 --> 00:40:50,776
Take your power.

&nbsp

1969
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,413
