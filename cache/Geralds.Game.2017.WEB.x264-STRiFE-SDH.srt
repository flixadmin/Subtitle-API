806

Not in a week or a year or...
even ten years from now.

807
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,119
Please...

808
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,872
I won't tell.

809
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:16,959
I mean...

810
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,422
if we don't tell your mom today...

811
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,801
then we could never tell anyone.

812
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,928
I wouldn't. Never.

813
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,012
Not ever.

814
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,431
- Ever.
- And not just your mother.

Not anyone.

816

That's a big responsibility
for a little girl.

817
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:40,857
I'm sorry.

01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,155
But you might be tempted.

With friends...

821
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:54,080
One of them tells you a secret,
maybe you might wanna tell them.

822
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:58,000
- Never.
- Or your brother.

823
01:03:58,584 --> 01:03:59,585
Or your sister.

824
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,673
There might come a time
when you wanna tell...

825
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:04,757
No.

826
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,970
No. I promise. I swear.

827
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,139
I don't know, Jess.

828
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:19,063
I think it might be better for both of us
if this were all out in the open now.

829

Please...

832

Please, please, please.
Please just don't tell her.

833
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,791
I won't tell anybody... ever.

834
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,587
Ever. Please.

835
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:50,970
I've never been able to refuse you
anything that you really wanted, have I?

836
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,182
Okay, Jess.

837
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,060
We'll try things your way.

838
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,146
Thank you, Daddy.

839
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,901
So I guess we have a deal.

840
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,112
I say nothing.

841
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:13,701
You say nothing, not to anyone else,
not even to each other.

842
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,662
We walk out of this room...

843
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,916
and it never happened.

844
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,126
Okay.

845
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,342
I did a shameful thing.

846
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:34,013
You looked away... when you said that.

847
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:40,478
You were able to face me with the lies.

848
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,900
But it was the truth
that finally made you turn away.

[FATHER] I don't know what came over me.

850
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,322
Maybe it was the eclipse.

851
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,704
Well, thank God
we'll never see another one.

852
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,210
Nothing happened.

853
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,381
Nothing ever happened.

Sun's starting down.

01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,566
Or if they did, you were asleep.

Eventually, someone will find you, Jess,
but it might take a long time.

868
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:04,163
The first assumption will be we're off

Only you and I know, at the end,

01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,378
I could only get it up
if you were handcuffed to the bed.

To the rest of the world,
we're the picture of marital function.

Sooner or later,
people will start looking, my people.

874
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:25,851
There are a couple of women
in New Orleans you call friends, but...

875
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,106
You've never really let them
inside your life, have you?

876
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,529
None of them are gonna worry much
if you drop out of sight for a week or...

877
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,531
ten days.

878
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:43,619
But I have appointments.

879
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,415
And when I don't show up by Friday,
there'll be questions.

880
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:53,546
That's how it'll start.

881
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:02,429
I think the caretaker
will actually discover the bodies.

882
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,892
He'll call the cops when he spots you
through the window or...

883
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,728
when he smells us.

884
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:16,402
He'll turn his face away while he throws
the blanket from the closet over you

885
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,488
because he won't wanna see your fingers
sticking through the handcuffs.

886
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,326
Stiff as pencils, white as candles.

887
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,454
But, most of all...

888
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:31,500
he won't wanna look at the expression
of horror on your face.

889
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,460
Why are you doing this?

890
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,882
The forensics unit will show up
with the county coroner.

891
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,719
When they pull off the blanket,
they will...

892
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:48,517
wince and nod and tell each other
the woman on the bed died hard.

893
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,061
But they won't know the half of it.

894
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,523
They won't know...

895
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,486
the real reason your eyes are staring...

896
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,073
and your mouth is screaming...

897
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:08,537
is because of what you saw at the end...

898
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,040
coming out of the dark.

899
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:18,005
They'll take you to the medical examiner.
He'll cut you open, inventory your guts.

900
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:21,592
He'll have a peek
at what's left of your last meal,

901
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:24,595
take a little section of brain
to look at under his microscope.

902
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:25,888
But in the end...

903
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,521
in the end, he'll just call it
"death by misadventure."

904
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:40,361
- They were playing a harmless game.
- Harmless.

905
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:44,573
Only the gentleman had a heart attack
at a critical moment...

906
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,661
and the woman was left to...

907
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:52,873
Well, it's best not to get into it.

908
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,461
Just to say the lady died hard.

909
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,674
You only need to look at her to see that.

910
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,640
And maybe someone
will notice your wedding ring is gone...

911
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:16,188
but they won't hunt for it
for long, if at all.

912
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:22,861
They won't notice that one
of your bones...

01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:28,284
not an important one, the third phalange
in your right foot, let's say...

914
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:32,288
is also gone.

But we'll know, won't we, Jess?

916
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:42,381
We'll know he took them.

917
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,136
Because it was Death.

918
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,806
And you did see him...

919
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,644
as people who die in the lonely places do.

920
01:11:58,522 --> 01:11:59,606
It was Death.

Because seeing?

943
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:31,425
It would have meant my little sister
was also doomed

944
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:34,178
to let that son of a bitch
steal her childhood,

945
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,638
and Mom would have died
before facing that.

946
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,558
So it was up to me to protect Maddie.

947

Even though it meant that I never felt
like part of the family again.

01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:51,528
And that wasn't my job description.

The last thing I want...

01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,321
is to have to take you

- But the thing about blood...

975
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,555
is that, until it clots,
it's as slick as oil.

than the body's other checkpoints.

so... I made sure that I did.

to every kid it could possibly help.

When I was 12,
I went to the lake house with my family.

And while that helped my days,
I still sat up at night...

waiting for that pale face
in the moonlight...

hit the papers,

but I never read about them,
not in New Orleans.

1093
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,549
And they were tiny stories, buried.

1094
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,636
Someone was breaking
into crypts and mausoleums

1095
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:43,391
of small town cemeteries
with drills, bolt cutters and hacksaws...

1096
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,893
and stripping corpses of jewelry.

1097
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:48,604
As the months went by, it escalated.

Incidents started being reported
in Louisiana.

1099
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:55,278
He gouged out eyes, cut corpses' throats.

1100
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:58,948
Last February,
two were found without noses.

1101

Later hands. Then... ears.

1102
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:06,539
Something I'd always assumed was the dog.

1103
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:11,711
And when it came to removing genitalia
after having sex with the dead...

1104
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,505
he stuck strictly to the gentlemen.

1105
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:17,300
This was, clearly, extremely lucky for me.

1106
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:21,929
I only noticed
when he finally made the front page.

1107
01:33:22,596 --> 01:33:24,974
He'd graduated, it seemed, from the dead.

1108
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:29,186
And, one night, a man woke up
to find Raymond Joubert in his room,

1109
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,647
naked, trying to cut off his ear.

1110
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:35,109
Joubert suffers from acromegaly,

1111
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:38,446
a progressive enlargement
of the hands, feet and face

1112
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:41,324
that happens when the pituitary gland
goes into warp drive.

1113
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:43,826
It causes the forehead to bulge

1114
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:47,538
and abnormally long arms
that dangle almost to his knees.

1115
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:52,418
They went to his only known address,
a farmhouse on Kingston Road.

1116
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,337
They didn't find him there,

1117
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,714
but they did find his sister
and her husband,

1118
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,633
who he called his "mommy and daddy."

1119
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,096
He'd scalped them both
and eaten most of "Daddy."

1120
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:09,935
They found 50 bell jars
containing ears, lips, fingers.

1121
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:14,523
They think he may have killed as many
as a dozen people in the last five years.

1122
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:16,651
But, for some reason, he spared me.

1123
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:21,447
This monster was real, real as they come.

1124
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:25,117
As real as the cuffs, as the dog.

1125
01:34:26,535 --> 01:34:28,037
As real as the eclipse.

1126
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:32,333
And so I had to write this
to you, Mouse...

1127
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,753
because you're the only person
who'd understand...

01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,714
and you're the only one who truly matters.

[YOUNG JESSIE] "He's being arraigned
tomorrow, and I'm going to see him.

1130
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:49,392
Because the people who were supposed
to protect you from the monsters...

1131
01:34:50,142 --> 01:34:52,311
[BOTH] turned out to be
monsters themselves...

1132
01:34:53,312 --> 01:34:55,064
[BOTH] and it almost killed you."

1133
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:58,109
We need the sun to come back out.

1134
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:00,194
After so long...

1135
01:35:01,695 --> 01:35:03,280
I think we deserve the sun.

1138
01:35:12,748 --> 01:35:17,461
an unusual decision in a case
that's already full of surprises.

1139
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,630
But nothing more unusual than the way...

a single word since his arrest,
