Going to Westlake next year?

00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,708
My cousin said
there's a kid who smokes there.

42
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,875
- You see anything?
- No. A lot of yappin'. Come on.

43
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,666
- Ah, there we go.
- All right.

44
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,833
Another year, another batch
of 5th grade head cases.

45
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,875
Kabir, Anthony, welcome.

46
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:48,208
You from New York,
new guy? Patriots suck!

47
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,500
That's New England.

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,333
- I think your shirt's on backwards.
- Come on!

49
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,500
- Look at this. Bunch of motormouths.
- Yep. Same old, same old.

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,625
I saw Cara in a sweater from Gymboree.

51
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,750
- There's the snotty clique.
- Tween Queens.

52
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,500
- The Facade Squad.
- Peaking at 11.

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,000
- The "sick and should've stayed home" kid.
- Always one.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,666
There's the class clown
who secretly despises himself.

55
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,166
That's hysterical, Cole!

56
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,958
- Thanks, Cole!
- Jeez, how many Coles this year?

57
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,291
Reminds me
of the Justin avalanche of 1991.

58
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,458
God forbid we ever see a Richie again.

59
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,208
Bro, no way, are you taller than me now?

60
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,333
The inevitable Cheez Doodle kid.

61
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,458
No,
those look like Dorito fingers.

62
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,541
- We just moved from the Bronx.
- You're new? Wow.

63
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,416
That's hard. Never had to leave friends,
except when we went to Myrtle Beach.

64
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,750
On the flight home,
the old lady next to me had arthritis.

65
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,166
I opened her mustard packet.

66
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,166
- First child.
- No filter.

67
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,583
Never heard the word "enough."

68
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,875
Okay, guys. Are you excited?

69
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,083
Most of you have been going
to this school for five years.

70
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,708
Some of you, seven.
And now you're the big kids.

71
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:51,750
I hope everyone's met our class pets,
Leonardo and Squirtle.

72
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,041
I'm not touching those things.

73
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,541
Don't they eat, sleep and poo
in the same place?

74
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,791
Hey! I poo where he sleeps.

75
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,083
Now what if I told you

76
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,666
there's a big reward at the end
of this year if you do well in class?

77
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,583
The Academicathalon thing?

78
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,541
Look at her work these kids.
Salinas, what a pro.

79
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,125
Best since Ms. Bielecky in the '60s.

80
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,375
And what if I told you
this year's winning class

81
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,375
gets a field trip to somewhere special
for a whole day?

82
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,708
{\an8}Yeah!

83
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,625
{\an8}Wow!

84
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,833
- Salinas havin' a baby?
- The belly's poppin' a little.

85
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,416
Oh, Zane, I'm afraid
you can't bring snacks into the class.

86
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,916
I'll hold those, just for now.

87
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,958
Cheetos. Wow, didn't see that coming.

88
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,541
At the end of the year,
our three 5th grade classes

89
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:36,500
compete in art,
debating, science, and history.

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,375
{\an8}And if our class wins,
we get a trip to Magic Land Park!

91
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,625
Don't they have the Dragon Coaster?
I heard it caught fire once!

92
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,166
- Yeah, it was banned in Europe.
- Yes, but not in Florida.

93
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,458
Yep, havin' a baby.

94
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,583
Okay. Let's see
how much you guys already know.

95
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,166
Who knows what you
call it when a plant...

96
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,250
...converts light to food?

97
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,500
- The conversion's photosynthesis...
- Photosynthesis.

98
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,416
- ...turning H2O and CO2 into glucose.
- Into glucose.

99
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,333
- Ah.
- Excellent job, Mia.

100
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,041
Oh. So...

101
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,916
Oh, boy. Divorced parents.

102
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,791
Okay, honey. Thank you.

103
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,958
You're okay. So sweet.

104
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,083
Okay.

105
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,208
Let's look at some of the books
we're gonna read in class this year.

106
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,166
Who's heard of <i>Charlotte's Web?</i>

107
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,833
Oh no. The kids always cry at the end.

108
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,000
Like kids don't cry enough?
We gotta trigger the garden hoses?

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,833
- Crying's for weaklings.
- Right.

110
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,041
We'll meet Fern and her pig, Wilbur.

111
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,791
It's a stupid book anyway.

112
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,750
- Right. Animals never talk to people.
- Plus, no one gets to eat Charlotte.

113
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,958
You just have to hear
about this delicious spider for days

114
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,833
and get hungry thinkin' about it.

115
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,000
...like you'll learn this year.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,375
Sorry, Cole?
Is there something you wanna share?

117
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,458
That's so gross!

118
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't believe you did that!

119
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,833
Sorry, guys.

120
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,250
Man, that smells good.

121
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,875
Send some of that our way next time.
Gettin' sick of the lettuce.

122
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,708
Hi, Mrs. Salinas!

123
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,083
- Hi, I'm Cole Wiseki's mom.
- Oh, hi.

124
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,833
Can I.. Real quick? For Facebook?

125
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,625
Thanks.

126
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,750
- Cole is a very..
- That's gonna look great. Thank you.

127
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,916
Since when do people
wanna look like ducks?

128
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,208
Isn't that something,
how they've grown?

129
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,750
And in 5th grade, you'll find your kids
wanting to make their own choices.

130
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,416
Embrace it.
Let them make their own mistakes.

131
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,916
How long does this go?

132
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,750
Not terribly long, Dr. Wenger.

133
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,833
Now, some of you may have heard
about Mrs. Salinas', uh,

134
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,291
incident in class.

135
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:42,166
I want to confirm it has nothing to do
with anything she ate in the cafeteria.

136
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,750
She's just gonna be taking
some time off. A leave, let's say.

137
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,333
Wait. For how long?

138
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,833
Here comes the bomb.

139
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,083
For, uh... Till she has the baby,
let's say.

140
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,750
- What?!
- Having a baby?

141
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,333
Are you sure?
Did she get a second opinion?

142
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,833
Are you kidding me?
This is what happened in 3rd grade!

143
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,083
The substitute was awful!

144
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,333
I'm texting my daughter right now!
She'll be devastated!

145
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,375
You can't just say that!

146
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,333
Look at these lazy class pets.
Do they even move?

147
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,041
- I'd like that job.
- That lizard looks pretty old.

148
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,416
Do I look old?

149
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,208
Mm-mm.

150
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,125
Thank you.

151
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,583
It's a Tuatara. They live a long time.
Till about 75.

152
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,916
Hmm. Never knew that.
Suck on that, hamsters.

153
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,166
Wow. Looks like
he's gettin' close to that.

154
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,041
Bye. Nice seeing you.

155
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,416
Ah, he's nuts.

156
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:12,416
I mean, you're old, cranky, lazy,
but no way does that make you 75.

157
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,291
<i>Seventy-five.
Seventy-five. Seventy-five.</i>

158
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,666
<i>Underneath it says,</i>

159
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,916
<i>"Here men from the planet Earth
first set foot upon the Moon."</i>

160
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,041
<i>We came in peace..</i>

161
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,791
1949.

162
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,000
- What about it?
- I was born around then.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,666
How many years has it been since 1949?

164
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,250
No idea. That's addition.

165
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,583
They learn that in 2nd grade.
We're all about fractions.

166
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,333
Great. Why can't they move us
around a little, so we can know more?

167
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,291
Okay, four sixteenths equals
how many fourths?

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,958
- She's leaving. They don't hear a word.
- 1966, 1967...

169
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,041
- What're you doin'?
- Trying to count how many years old I am.

170
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,083
1968, 1969, 1970...

171
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,208
I'm out of toes and fingers.
What else can I count with?

172
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,541
I'd tell you, but there's kids around.

173
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,708
I was talkin' about his tail.

174
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:25,000
Addition... I...
I gotta talk to some 2nd grade pets.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Forget it.
We only see those pets at fire drills<i>.</i>

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They don't happen until November.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,708
What the..

178
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,000
- Huh? What?
- Is this a fire drill?

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,750
It's probably nothing, but let's go.
Anthony, why don't you grab the pets?

180
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,000
Everyone evacuate! Stop, drop and roll!

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,541
I think I'm on fire!

182
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,916
Jeez, we just redecorated!

183
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,458
Someday, cops are gonna
carry that kid off a plane. Huh?

184
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,958
I'll park ya right over here, fellas.

185
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,958
All right, here we go.

186
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,958
Hey, guys, how was your summer?
Do anything fun?

187
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,666
- Sleep.
- Sleep.

188
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,041
- Eat.
- Lot of poopin'.

189
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,125
Terrific. Say, who's 2nd grade again?

190
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,291
- That's me. How ya doin', Lizzy?
- Great.

191
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:16,750
I'm actually Leonardo. Lizzy's the iguana
in Mr. Marculia's homeroom. You're...

192
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,583
I'm Cinnabun. I know. So corny.
Just got renamed again.

193
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,333
Oh. Well, beats "Thumper."

194
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:27,416
I guess. What's bad are the Hare ones.
Hare Brain, Hare Piece, Hare-y Potter...

195
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,208
Right, right. Hey, the 2nd graders,
you guys do addition, right?

196
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,291
...Hare Lip, Hare Club For Men.

197
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,958
Yes, and subtraction. We do both.

198
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,916
Great, okay,
look. If I got here in 1949,

199
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,666
and it's 2023, what does that make me?

200
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,333
Oh. Uh, I know this one. A reptile.

201
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,750
Shmuck.

202
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,500
Okay, it was a false alarm.

203
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,750
The school is not on fire.

204
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,833
No, how old would I be?

205
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:01,375
No. Right, subtraction.
Okay, um, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, 74.

206
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,583
- Seventy-four. Isn't that right before..
- Upsy-daisies.

207
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,500
Wait, wait! Hold on!

208
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,583
That's the number before 75, isn't it?

209
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:13,708
What's the matter? You look upset.

210
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,541
Cinnabun!

211
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,708
Settle down.

212
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,416
I'm a lizard. Ooh.

213
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,583
That's good. Don't dignify it.

214
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,958
Doesn't matter. I'm doomed.

215
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,250
I'm 74 seventy-fifths dead.

216
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,458
What? That's not for class pets.

217
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,166
When you're in captivity,
75 is the new 70.

218
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,625
And, hey, you wanna live so bad,
a little exercise wouldn't kill ya.

219
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,083
- Like what?
- Blinking's good. That'd be a start.

220
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,166
- I blink.
- Barely.

221
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,083
Fine.

222
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,916
Okay. You didn't have to dive right in.

223
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,166
Who am I kiddin'?

224
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:59,458
I can't start this rigorous workin' out
at this point in my life.

225
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,958
It's too late. I blew it.

226
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,000
I wasted my life!

227
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,625

<i>This</i> is our substitute?

243
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,750
You have to leave? So soon?

244
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,958
Well, my doctor thinks I need
to rest through my pregnancy.

245
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,666
So until I'm back,
you'll have Ms. Malkin.

246
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,625
It's not brain surgery, gang.

247
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,708
Guys, you don't have to be afraid
of change.

248
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,208

- Oh, I don't sing.
- Oh, okay.

253
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:21,666
How about we continue with the class.
I'm gonna teach with Ms. Malkin today..

254
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,333
- Please don't leave us, Mrs. Salinas!
- Oh.

255
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,833
{\an8}Agh! Down! Now! Down!

256
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,333
No hug! Sit!

257
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:32,666
In class, we sit up straight,
pay attention, and we are what? You!

258
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,750
What? Oh, my God. Um, we're quiet?

259
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,875
That's very good listening, Logan.
That's a heart for you.

260
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,875
The hearts are for when the kids listen.
To motivate good..

261
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,208
Listening is not a favor.

262
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,625
When you listen, you get knowledge,
not a carnival prize.

263
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:02,541
We have a chance to go to Magic..

264
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,958
Ew. What was that?

265
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,625
Peanut butter and ham. My dad overslept.

266
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,500
Okay, well, we're out of time, so
let's wish Mrs. Salinas well. Bye-bye.

267
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,166
- But, I.. The class is..
- No, no. I know. Out we go.

268
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,750
- Better luck with your own kid.
- Okay, guys, see you in..

269
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:28,625
Moving on. It's Friday. That means one
student has to take home a class pet.

270
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,500
- What's this now?
- Uh, we don't do that here.

271
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,791
Not anymore. No way.

272
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:36,958
In <i>my</i> classroom,
you will learn responsibility.

273
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,916
You will feed it properly
and return it in healthy condition.

274
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,916
Alive.

275
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,583
Do we have a volunteer?

276
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,208
- Come on. Somebody raise your hand.
- What?

277
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:53,583
Remember what happens at the kids' houses?
They forget to feed you or abuse you.

278
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,000
It'll grow back.

279
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,916
- Yeesh.
- Hey, it looked cool in the '90s.

280
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,666
I'm waiting. Volunteer, please.

281
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,791
Don't you get it? This is my shot.

282
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,208
So I go with one of these kids,
case the house for open windows,

283
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,583
then when I'm alone, zip! I escape.

284
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:25,125
- Ha. You couldn't zip when you were 20.
- I'm zipping. And then I really live.

285
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,833
Maybe climb a tree. Swim in a sewer.
See the Everglades.

286
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,458
The Everglades? With those
untamed animals? Are you nuts?

287
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,166
You know they don't even have names,
right? It's anarchy.

288
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,875
You think a rock potato like you
can survive there?

289
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,750
- Your last days will be in a beer can.
- Let's go.

290
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,375
Who's gonna take on some responsibility?

291
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,041
- Or do I have to pick?
- Well, if no one else will...

292
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,666
I don't want them to feel not wanted.
Everybody wants to fit in

293
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,625
and shouldn't be judged
on looks, species, foreheads.

294
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,750
I have to go indoor skydiving tomorrow,

295
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,166
but my father'll be home,
so if it's okay to..

296
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,750
- Pick one!
- Okay, the lizard!

297
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:11,708
Listen, when you're out there in the
wild and those animals come after you,

298
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:15,250
remember to change your colors
and blend in!

299
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,291
- That's chameleons. I'm not a chameleon.
- Oh, well, then you're a dead man.

300
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,458
Tomorrow's indoor skydiving.
We have to get ready.

301
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,125
It's exactly like skydiving,
except you can't get hurt.

302
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,375
Okay, we have a busy weekend.

303
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,750
Do I have to wear a dress to Grandma's?
It'll be pants weather on Sunday.

304
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,583
Jayda said the word "puke".
She said it wasn’t a curse word. Is it?

305
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,708
I feel bad leaving him.
Nobody wants him near the dinner table.

306
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,416
He's good with his water. Back soon!

307
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,458
Kayla, don't look scared of him.
That's being mean.

308
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,541
It's on.

309
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,500
Yeah.

310
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,541
He's nice, the new kid Kabir,
but he doesn't talk a lot,

311
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,875
at least not with me.
Maybe he's shy since...

312
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,625
Then I burned my tongue.
It didn't, like, burn off completely,

313
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,875
or I couldn't tell you
how I ate my mozzarella sticks.

314
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:02,083
Hey, Leonardo. You missed a great movie.
Tomorrow I'll take you down for breakfast.

315
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:06,250
I hope they have everything bagels left.
I don't know why we get sesame bagels.

316
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,333
Mom asked me to try one, I was like,
"Why would you take off the poppy seeds

317
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,291
and the salt..."

318
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,041
Wait, where are you?

319
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,083
This is a nightmare!
I'll be the kid who killed the lizard,

320
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,000
no matter what I do in my life.

321
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,250
Whether I do drama, be a doctor..
I'll never be a doctor now.

322
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,375
I could work at the DMV.
Hopefully, the one next to Quiznos.

323
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,416
I don't wanna go far from my parents.

324
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,375
Mother of Godzilla!

325
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,375
What was that?

326
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,916
Well? Who said that?

327
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,416
The wall? Walls don't talk.
Why would a wall say anything?

328
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,375
Why point to it?
They say, "If these walls could talk,"

329
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,708
because they can't talk..

330
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,625
The trophy!

331
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,333
You said something! You just spoke! Mom!

332
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,708
- No!
- You talked!

333
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,875
You're talking!

334
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,125
I'm telling Mom,
or people will think I'm crazy.

335
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,125
I'll have to go to that school
in Tampa for kids with issues! I..

336
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,750
But please,
people can't know!

337
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,458
- Why are your hands wet?
- They're naturally moist.

338
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,791
Please, I'm begging you to keep quiet.

339
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,333
If people know I talk,

340
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,916
they'll send me
to a scientist or something.

341
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,541
- But I have to tell someone.
- Please.

342
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,500
You're the only one
who can hear me.

343
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,375
Oh. Then why are you whispering?

344
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,333
Because you were,
and it sounded fun.

345
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,375
Do all lizards talk?

346
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:29,416
I don't know. I never met them all,
but we never talk to humans.

347
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,875
- Why are you talking to me?
- Well, I didn't...

348
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:37,083
Because I want to. I think you're nice.

349
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,041
Really? Thanks.

350
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,458
I don't know if people think I'm nice.
It's so hard to read people at school.

351
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,416
People say you're nice to be nice,

352
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,083
and if they say you're nice,
you'll think they're cool..

353
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,166
I get it.

354
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,208
You say "I get it" a lot.

355
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:55,000
That's 'cause I understand things.
That's all. "I get it." I've been around.

356
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,166
- Okay. I thought it was something else.
- Like what?

357
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,708
- That you want me to stop talking.
- Oh. Wow.

358
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,833
Really? Like, "Wow, that's crazy"?

359
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:08,416
No, more like, "Wow, I didn't
think you were that self-aware."

360
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,916
I can tell. People are
too nice to say I talk too much,

361
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,208
but I can tell from their faces
that I'm talking too much.

362
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:17,500
Like, old people make this face.
And babies kind of look sleepy.

363
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,291
And the bus driver's face is like,
"Stop." But I can't stop and I...

364
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,958
Sorry, I'm listening. Please, go ahead.

00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,875
I know. It's great you're good
at talking about yourself.

394
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,208

Five-second rule.

398
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,750
Well, that was really nice. Thank you.

399
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,583
Oh, yeah. Glad to do it.

400
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:18,000
Hey, remember,
you can't tell anyone, ever.

401
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,083
Or we won't be able to talk again.

402
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:24,083
Okay. So I'm your special,
secret friend? That was a question.

403
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:27,208
Uh, yeah. Sure. And good question.

404
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:31,083
- Thanks, Leonardo.
- Call me Leo. Less Ninja Turtley.

405
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,541
Summer. You need to get to bed, sweetie.

406
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,458
Mom, what's the square root of 91?

407
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,083
What? Please just get to bed.

408
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,791
I don't mean just any question.

409
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,625
Okay. Right. Got it.

410
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,791
Find your new seats.

411
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,833
Oh, back already?
You saw the whole world in one weekend?

412
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:04,416
Wow. Hey, how were the Everglades?
How high was the Eiffel Tower?

413
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:08,958
- What was the Pope like?
- Could you not do that on my pillow?

414
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:14,541
Put those computers away. We will not
be studying our curriculum on toys.

415
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,833
{\an8}Russian judge.

416
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:40,291
Slow down. No running.

417
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,708
No eating the books!

418
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,750
Oh, Coach Kimura.

419
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,416
Oh, I apologize. Let me...
Let me clean that for you.

420
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,125
There we go.

421
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:58,791
This is so unfair. Ugh!
She'll work us till we have no energy.

422
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:01,125
Then we'll only get into schools
with drug problems.

423
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,666
Forget about winning the trip.
This is a nightmare.

424
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,500
It's worse than when I lost my phone.

425
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,583
Worse than when my dad wore bike shorts.

426
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,666
Worse than when I got lost on a plane,
which is hard to do, but really scary.

427
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:13,625
Like a horror movie, though my
parents won't let me watch them,

428
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:16,333
unless you count the furnace
in <i>Toy Story 3</i>, but that..

429
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,958
Oh. What should we do about it, Jayda?

430
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm totally telling my parents about it.
My dad has a lot of pull,

431
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,958
because he gives the teachers
free zit cream,

432
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,625
but you should tell yours too.

433
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,791
Why are you talking to Summer?

434
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:33,541
- I like her now.
- Uh, I know. I do too.

435
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:42,166
- What was that all about?
- She likes me. She thought I was fun.

436
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,625
You fun? What'd you do,
turn your head more than once?

437
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:46,708
Oh, what a showman.

438
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,708
Get all your mean jokes in now,

439
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:51,708
'cause the next kid
who takes me home is the last kid.

440
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,708
Sure they are, Mr. Chicken-to-leave.

441
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:56,166
Whatever you say,
Mr. Wants-to-get-bitten.

442
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:59,583
Oh, I'm shaking,
Mr. Almost-as-brave-as-Scooby Doo.

443
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:06,708
Duck, duck, duck, goose!

444
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:10,583
Ow! Okay. Okay.
All right! That's not the game. Kids!

445
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:15,250
...the Stamp Act. Eyes up here!
For those of you who did the reading...

446
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,708
- Salinas never taught this stuff.
- Yeah. What's a stamp?

447
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,625
...the first tax levied directly

448
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,583
on American colonists
by the British Parliament.

449
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,000
Skyler, what did I just say?

450
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,875
Answer! How did the colonists react?

451
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:37,541
Demerits!

452
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,208
You do not want demerits.

453
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:49,333
- What's a demerit?
- I think he played for the Clippers.

454
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:52,166
You're going to leave 5th grade
with discipline,

455
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,833
or you are never going
to leave 5th grade.

456
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:56,916
Eh.

457
00:26:56,916 --> 00:27:00,458
Who has the discipline
to take a class pet home this weekend?

458
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,875
I'll do it. I'll take Leo again.

459
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,083
"Leo"?

460
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,750
Again? Who would want it twice?

461
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:20,041
Not one of you is man enough
for middle school, are you?

462
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:23,250
Ugh. Not now. I'll take the lizard.

463
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:32,583
Oh, you'll have so much fun with Leo,
Eli. You think, maybe, I can visit?

464
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:35,750
Really? That'd be great.
Zane's coming, but we can all hang..

465
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:00,208
You kids having a fun play date?

466
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,333
Uh...

467
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,875
Sure.

468
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,916
Sorry about those chips, Zaney.
Can't be too careful.

469
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,541
Have a kale cupcake.

470
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,208
Do I have to wear the safety suit
all weekend?

471
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,000
Lizards carry disease, honey.

472
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,875
Kids and dogs are especially vulnerable.

473
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:53,333
Um, I think my mom wants to pick me up.

474
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:59,833
- Thank you, Julie!
- They had the best time.

475
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,791
Could you go cut his chicken
into non-chokeable pieces?

476
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,083
Hey.

477
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,083
Ow!

478
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:09,083
Ha-ha.

479
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,083
What? It'll grow back.

480
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:21,833
You're dressed like a 1950s astronaut
and I'm the weird one?

481
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:25,208
Oh, now you're threatening me,
Doodlepoo? Do that..

482
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:28,250
What?

483
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,083
- What..
- Dinnertime, Eli!

484
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:39,875
Eli, now! You need three hours
to digest your food before bed.

485
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,250
This is totally crazy. You talk?

486
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,416
Just to you.

487
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,708
- 'Cause, uh...
- I'm special?

488
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,458
Uh, yeah, that's right.

489
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,541
Oh. Okay.

490
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:55,375
But you can't tell anyone.
They'll try to kill me like E.T.

491
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:58,791
But my parents told me when
someone says, "Don't tell anyone,"

492
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:00,166
that's when I have to tell.

493
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:03,583
Well, your parents are right,
but that's with strange humans.

494
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,833
I'm just a strange lizard. Okay?

495
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:09,916
- Please don't tell. Especially him.
- The drone?

496
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:13,333
No way. You saw what it did
to the Cheetos out there.

497
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,583
I mean, it's nice that it's loyal.

498
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,291
Come on. When I was six,
kids thought it was cool.

499
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:22,666
- Maybe you should say something about it.
- I don't want to hurt its feelings.

500
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:27,125
I know a way.
I've seen kids break up over the years.

501
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,541
You write down why you're dumping them,

502
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:33,083
and it gives the other person time
to soak it in and not snap.

503
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:35,166
It's a "Dear Drone" letter.

504
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:36,583
Get a pen and paper.

505
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:53,125
<i>♪ When you hover over me all day ♪</i>

506

He's just doing it for show. See?

517
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,916
He knows he's recyclable.

518
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,958
Let's just give him some space.

519
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,375
Nobody's ever gonna
like me like he does.

520
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:34,583
Kid, they don't even know you.
Now you can finally show your stuff.

521
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,958
Uh, I don't have any stuff.

522
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,583
Ah, you just gotta find your gimmick.

523
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:43,250
There was a boy in 1998, Mike Djokovic.

524
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,666
He memorized all the words
to "Walkin' on the Sun."

525
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,541
Smash Mouth? No?
Look, it's got a lot of words.

526
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,333
The point is,
plenty of kids have a gimmick.

527
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,083
It's okay. I got a few.

528
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,833
- Uh, get me a caterpillar.
- For real?

529
00:33:58,833 --> 00:33:59,916
Trust me.

530
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:13,750
Oh, that's perfect.

531
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,583
Okay, here we go.

532
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,750
So gross!

533
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,833
Wait.

534
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,166
What the..

535
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:27,416
Here, let me show you something.

536
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,791
Eli, where's your safety suit?

537
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:32,750
Try doing this.

538
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:51,708
Very good.

539
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:52,958
Fore!

540
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,875
- You nailed that thing.
- What was it? A possum?

541
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,500
I don't know,
but you hit it in the jellybeans.

542
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,583
Wanna quit and go home?
Can't top that.

543
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,166
Not everyone's invited.

544
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:29,791
Yes, I'm back.

545
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:32,625
Where's your tail?
You escaping one limb at a time?

546
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:36,000
Just give me some space.
I got hit in the jellybeans.

547
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,791
I forgot that was there.

548
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,666
Salinas was teacher of the year!
That substitute lady's unacceptable.

549
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:47,833
Do the skin cream samples I give out
mean nothing to you people?

550
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,375
How do I get that
horrible woman replaced?

551
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,833
Dr. Wenger, please.
She's sitting right here.

552
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:55,458
- So?
- Jay, it's not polite.

553
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,375
Fine.

554
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:59,083
May I speak about you
as if you're not here?

555
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:06,833
Listen, my kid was on track
to get into Westlake next year,

556
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,500
Langley Prep in three years,
Dartmouth in seven years,

557
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,083
then a moderately happy marriage
in 14 years.

558
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,375
I paid for that smart board
and this light switch.

559
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,916
If I'm letting you keep this animal
as her teacher,

560
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:21,750
you're gonna do something
for me to fix this.

561
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:26,958
Four seconds. Three, two, one.

562
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,250
Pencils down.

563
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,250
Except Jayda,

564
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,958
who will now be getting two more minutes

565
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:36,625
due to her permanent jet lag.

566
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,916
Quiet. No discussion.

567
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:43,208
Now, one of you
has to take home a class pet.

568
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,333
Volunteer or be assigned.

569
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,583
I'll take Leo again.

570
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:51,208
- What is the deal? Leo? Again?
- You can't take a pet twice, right?

571
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,625
Because I would..
I mean, why do you want him again?

572
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:57,083
Um, 'cause he was awesome.

573
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:00,000
- Why do you want him?
- Uh, same reason. Awesome.

574
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,333
Wait. If it's awesome, I want it.

575
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,666
It's supposed to say, "Dr. Skin,"

576
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:06,041
not "Dr. Skid."

577
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,791
S-K-I-N. No D's.

578
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:11,291
Jayda, I dyed the cat green.

579
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,583
So unoriginal.

580
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,916
Isn't that great, what I got for you?

581
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:18,083
- Drake's coming to my party?
- Eh, I'm still on it.

582
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:21,000
I meant the pop quiz,
the two more minutes.

583
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,916
- Who takes care of you?
- What did Daddy do?

584
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:27,875
Well, Benji, Jayda's substitute teacher
is a horror show...

585
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:30,333
Making the kids read big books.

586
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,250
No!

587
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,208
So Daddy got Jayda something
no other kid gets.

588
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,250
What, Daddy?

589
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:40,041
<i>♪ Extra time
The other kids are sweatin' ♪</i>

590
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,791
<i>♪ All the answers they're forgettin'
All except for mine ♪</i>

591
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:46,166
<i>♪ 'Cause my kid's got extra time</i>... <i>♪</i>

592
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:49,166
Should we put the lizard in my room?
The birthday party's coming up..

593
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:53,208
- Not now. Daddy's bragging.
<i>- ♪ Lovin' that extra time ♪</i>

594
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,000
Ugh. It's like the worst day of my life.
Nobody's focusing on my party.

595
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,416
It's going to totally suck, and the
other kids will be happy about it.

596
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:03,208
What? Why would they be happy?

597
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:06,541
Because they're all jealous.
Wait. What? Who said that?

598
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:07,708
That was me.

599
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,708
- Oh my God! You talk?
- No, it's not safe.

600
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:13,958
- You're the only one who can hear me.
- So awesome! We have a talking lizard!

601
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,791

Uh, sure.

606
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,583
That makes sense.
But can you do tricks at the party?

607
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,041
Can you rap
and play the piano with your tongue?

608

Nah, this is just between us.
I'm talking to you to give advice.

609

- People were jealous.
- Not of the snottiness.

616
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,916
Look, people don't realize

My family is so amazing,

Mom, Dad,
do we have any more invitations?

657
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,541
More? I thought we excluded
everyone you wanted.

658
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:58,166
Yeah, but we made a bigger list.

659
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:13,750
- Hi, guys. I'm so glad you came.
- Thanks for inviting us.

660
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,583
Of course. How are you?

661
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:18,500
Uh, wait. I know this one. We're fine.

{\an8}Wow. Zane is funny now?

664
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,916
Zane was always funny.

665
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,166
Like in 2nd grade,

666
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:32,208
when he told Mrs. Lemos
that Superman came from planet Crouton?

667
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,666
- Hey. You kids try the bubble guy yet?
- Dad, we'll get to the bubbles.

668
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,500
This guy's next level.
He makes bubble animals.

669
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,750
Here you go. Next.
You're not holding it right!

What're you looking at, boss?

674
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,416
Got a problem with compact legs?

675
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:14,458
What?

676
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:17,291

What do you do in the box?

677
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:19,583
Uh, I molt.

678
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,250
Occasional blinking.

679
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,541
All right. I'm sorry, brother.
We're fighting the same fight.

680
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:27,875
I mean, the only fun I've ever had was
biting some of that guy's fingers off.

681
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:31,083
I've asked you five times
to jump through this hoop.

you know?

683
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:37,833
Ever feel like time's running out,
and this is all we're ever gonna know?

684
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:47,833
Were you just talking to that horse?
Is he having a good time?

685
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,000
I gotta tell you,

686
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,166
the truth is,
no animal wants to be locked inside..

687
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,833
Hey, Jayda. Hey, Leo.
I can't believe how much cool...

688
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:59,958
Uh, I mean, hey, just Jayda,
are you having a good time?

689
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:02,916
Thanks for asking me.
My parents never ask.

690
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,041
They just assume I'm having a good time,

691
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,625
'cause they still don't realize
they aren't that great.

692
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:11,875
- What would make you have a better time?
- Good question.

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,333
in 1974, all of a sudden, grew a nose
the size of a Buick just like his dad's.

754
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:38,875
And everybody still loved him,
'cause he was a cool kid, like you.

755
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:42,000
And the next week,
Cole's problem was even tougher.

756
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,750
You won't do sleepovers,
'cause you say things in your sleep?

757
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,291
Well, if I'm not gonna tell anyone
about you talking to me,

758
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:51,375
do you promise not to tell anyone?

759
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,708
Yeah. Of course.

760
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,500
This isn't my real voice.

761
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,791
I really talk like this. I
can't let them know. I sound ridiculous.

762
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:02,416
This is priceless.

763
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:04,333
Well, I fixed it. I told him...

764
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:06,750
- You sound like a young Bee Gee.
- A what?

765
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,458
How 'bout The Weeknd? Know him?

766
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,875
Yeah, like that.

767
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:17,041
<i>Last week,
he sang at the winter recital</i>,

768
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:19,375
<i>and I heard they went nuts.</i>

769
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:22,583
Nice job, Ms. Malkin.

770
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,875
I'm sorry, was that praise?

771
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:28,375
Keep it up<i>,</i>
and we may see more of you here.

772
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:31,000
<i>- The class did great.
- Did they win?</i>

773
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,958
<i>Nah, kindergarten always wins.
Way too cute.</i>

774
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:40,500
And you should've seen me
last week with Mia.

775
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,583
<i>You mean Huggy?
The human cling wrap?</i>

776
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:45,041
<i>Excuse me. She has a name.</i>

777
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,958
<i>As you know,
her parents were recently divorced.</i>

778
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,125
Only two hours late today.
Very considerate.

779
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,708
Are you letting him
cut his own hair now?

780
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:59,708
You can't watch the kids next weekend,
so me and Aurora can have.

781
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:03,208
Valentine's Day together?
I'm asking you <i>one</i> favor!

782
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:06,375
You don't have any plans. Because I know.

783
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,958
I'm sorry, but lizards do not talk.

784
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:12,750
Parrots, macaws, songbirds,
and certain killer whales.

785
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,666
Don't believe everything
you read on the Internet.

786
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:18,583
Why would you only talk to me?

787
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:23,291
'Cause you're nice. You're great
at school, answering all the questions.

788
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:27,750
- I love to learn things.
- You're a lot quieter around your family.

789
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:31,083
Don't you ever wanna let 'em see
how big that brain of yours is?

790
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:33,708
My brother and sister think I'm weird.

791
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:34,833
Really?

792
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:41,208
- You just looked like my grandpa.
- Yeah? Is that a good thing?

793
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,208
Uh-huh.

794
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:44,583
My grandpa used to talk to me.

795
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:48,625
He really liked science,
and he would ask me questions,

796
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:51,583
even if he knew the answer.

797
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,875
What? He sounds like a great guy.

798
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:57,583
He was my best friend.

799
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:00,375
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to get that going.

800
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,958
Please, kid, I hate that.

801
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,916
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no. Don't be sorry.

802
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:07,000
Just stop. I... I can't handle it.

803
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,375
But my mom says it's good to cry.

804
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,750
Not where I come from.
Here. Let me calm you down.

805
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,583
I'll sing you a lullaby,
and you'll go to sleep.

<i>♪ Boo-freaking-hoo ♪</i>

832
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,458
You're just doing
what my grandpa did,

833
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:58,833
pretending not to know something,
so I can tell you what's right.

834
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:01,916
Here. Scientific
research has established

835
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:05,416
that crying releases
oxytocin and endorphins.

836
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:08,958
These feel-good chemicals help ease
both physical and emotional pain.

837
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:12,958
I didn't know how to help her,
so I just listened. And that helped.

838
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,625
Wow. So you got this <i>E.T.</i> scam going.

839
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:18,375
Got every kid thinking he's Elliott?
This will end badly.

840
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:21,166
All I know is these kids'll remember me.

841
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:24,083
Did you hear about
Hammy #3's funeral last week?

842
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:26,708
- Hammy #3 died? Didn't know that.
- Exactly.

843
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:30,333
<i>They say the funeral was a snooze.
No one had anything to say.</i>

844
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:33,750
{\an8}I liked that white spot over his ear.

845
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,750
{\an8}I liked the way he breathed.

846
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,458
{\an8}He gave me pinkeye.

847
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:41,750
My funeral is gonna be packed
with fond remembrances and anecdotes.

848
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:45,958
Yeah, good for you
and your last week's vocabulary words.

849
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:49,916
And, buddy, that funeral
could come sooner than you think.

850
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:53,750
- Me! Me!
- My turn with the Geico thing!

851
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:59,291
Have fun, Anthony! Leo's awesome!

852
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:03,291
These things heads grow back too?
Or just their tails? I'll figure it out.

853
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:07,750
Oh, no. Call my next of kin.
This is how I want to divide my estate.

854
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:08,833
Help me!

855
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:12,791
- What?
- I got your back.

856
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:15,958
- I couldn't let you do this one alone.
- What are you gonna do?

857
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:19,000
You lay back. It's harder to hurt me.
I got the shell.

858
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,750
What about giving advice?

859
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,000
Oh, like I don't know anything?
I can do what you do.

860
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,500
Mm.

861
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,583
<i>That was an
incredible move! What strategy!</i>

862
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,541
- Hey!
<i>- ...starting to let his...</i>

863
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:34,875
<i>Go straight to his head.</i>

864
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,083
Hey, over here.

865
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:37,666
- What?
- Ah!

866
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,375
- Oh, come on!
- Forget that. I talk.

867
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,833
Oh my God. Grandma!

868
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,333
No, no, no. Stop, stop.
Can't do that or we'll all die.

869
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:49,125
- What? Why?
- I don't know. I... I'm telling you.

870
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,333
- You... You'll die. Just shut up. Calm down.
- Oh, okay.

871
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:56,125
Fix your phone later. I'm a
talking turtle. I picked you 'cause...

872
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:58,041
"I like your style."

873
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:01,833
- Take it down a notch.
- I got this. Now, tell me your problems.

874
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:04,666
- What?
- I... I can fix your problems. I... I... I...

875
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:06,750
I seen a lot of things
in that 5th grade room,

876
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,458
and I can help. So come on.

877
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:11,291
I don't have any problems.
Other than I broke my phone.

878
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,583
Ah-ha. Bully. I get it.

879
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,333
Come on. You're insecure, right?
Every class bully is.

880
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:19,083
No. I don't know.

881
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:22,750
You're sad, you got something
tearing you up inside.

882
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:26,416
Just say it. I'm a talking turtle.
I can't tell anyone else.

883
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:30,708
Of course I'm a bully.
I don't know what else to do.

884
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:36,041
- I'm just different. I'm not smart.
- Nah. Everyone's smart in some way.

885
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:39,625
You're just afraid of trying
and <i>looking</i> not smart. That's textbook.

886
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:42,083
- What's a textbook?
- You know what? Never mind.

887
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:46,750
- I'm different in other ways too.
- There you go. Come on. Out with it.

888
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,750
- You won't say anything?
- No. What is it? What's the sadness?

889
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,375
I don't know how babies are made.

890
00:54:57,416 --> 00:54:59,416
Perfect. That's very class bully.

891
00:54:59,416 --> 00:55:00,750
Tough on the outside,

892
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,625
a self-hating pile
of cottage cheese on the inside.

893
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:07,708
- Can you just tell me?
- Oh. About babies? Sure. Here we go.

894
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:12,375
First, the daddy climbs
on the mommy's back while she's swimming.

895
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,541
He reaches under the mommy
to find her cloaca.

896
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,250
This goes on for about 24 hours.

897
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:21,708
Then the mommy comes ashore, makes
a nest, and deposits eggs in the sand.

898
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:25,625
My mom made eggs in the sand?

899
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,041
Yes. So the fish don't eat 'em.

900
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,041
I crushed it.
Totally fixed the kid's problem.

901
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:38,416
The taping me up,
maybe it's 'cause he wants to keep me.

902
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:42,041
Stop!

903
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,791
You miss your friends
from being held back.

904
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:58,375
Worried about being behind?

905
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:02,666
This is a tough time, but these
are the best years. Believe me.

906
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,458
Enjoy not knowing everything.

907
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:09,125
Enjoy being a kid. You're a good one.

908
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:11,541
Do you miss being a kid?

909
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:14,833
I'm just glad I'm still here.

910
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:20,625
Okay, every one of you
has had a weekend with Leo here.

911
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:25,708
So from here on, you'll be taking home...
What's the turtle's name again?

912
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,541
Squirtle. My name is Squirtle.

913
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,458
I think it's Squirtle.

914
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:32,750
Squirtle sucks.

915
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,625
I beg your pardon? Why?

916
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,708
I don't know. He just sucks.

917
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:40,208
- I like Leo, though. He's nice.
- The best.

918
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:43,791
- Yeah! Come on...
- Leo's better than that turtle.

919
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:50,000
Oh, stop that noise. Stop it!
What is so special about this reptile?

920
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:54,708
I like his skin.

921
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:57,916
His skin is like my grandma's elbows.

922
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:58,916
Uh, same.

923
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,166
- Same.
- Same.

924
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,958
- Elbows.
- Same.

925
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:06,416
{\an8}All right. If you all so desperately
want to take home that lizard again,

926
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:08,041
{\an8}you'll just have to earn it.

927
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:11,291
{\an8}I wanna get picked!

928
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:14,041
{\an8}We'll do our homework
and promise to bring it in.

929
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:17,958
You will all make <i>my</i> class
a model of excellence,

930
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:23,541
and even win that Academicathalon,
or it's the turtle for all of you.

931
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:26,125
Yes! Thank you so much.

932
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:29,916
Was this your dying wish?
To turn a bunch of brats against me?

933
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:32,500
It's not about us. It's about the kids.

934
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,666
They're motivated.

935
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:35,750
They're gonna finish the year strong.

936
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:14,625
Yes!

937
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:25,458
Yeah, Louis Pasteur is the father
of microbiology.

938
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:29,916
<i>He discovered that dangerous
microorganisms could grow in open water.</i>

939
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:48,583
Wow! Well, now, that's impressive.

940
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,958
Class 5-C, you're one step away
from going to Magic Land Park!

941
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:01,333
How great a job has our teacher done?

942
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,750
Bravo, Ms. Malkin.

943
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,791
I know a lot of parents weren't happy
when I first brought you in,

944
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:08,875
due to your rep as a miserable person.

945
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:12,208
But if you win
the History Fair on Saturday, we'll..

946
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:14,250
You'll prove all the doubters wrong.

947
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:20,250
Well, Principal Spahn, in the classroom,
sometimes the old ways are the best ways.

948
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,916
I can't believe it.

949
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:25,041
Back to your posts. No five-highing.

950
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:28,125
- Oh, that pic is fire.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

951
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:32,250
Hey, what is the deal? I've been waiting
for your next Jenga move for 30 minutes.

952
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,666
Now did you make the costume
or did your mom?

953
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:37,416
Tell the truth.
You know I won't tell anyone.

954
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:39,625
I only talk to you.

955
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:41,583
- What?
<i>- Is that another phone?</i>

956
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:45,333
Uh, I don't know. Uh,
must be on Malkin's desk or something.

957
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:46,958
Oh.

958
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,750
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Come on.

959
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,000
<i>Leo, where'd you go?</i>

960
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,916
I... I'll be right there.

961
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,125
<i>Leo?</i>

962
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,083
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, pal, toss it here. I'll handle it.

963
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:02,000
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

964
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,416
<i>Leo?</i>

965
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:06,083
Yeah, I think Malkin
must have an extra phone.

966
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:08,458
Anywho, what did Summer say?

967
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:11,916
Oh my God,
you can't all play Jackie Kennedy.

968
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:15,000
And, like,
we so wanna slay this History Fair.

969
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,416
<i>I know. That Magic
Land Park trip would be awesome.</i>

970
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:21,625
<i>Hey, you're awesome
because you tried your best.</i>

971
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:23,958
<i>That's why</i> I'm <i>your special friend?</i>

972
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:25,791
<i>Yeah.</i>

973
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:30,416
You talk to Skyler too?

974
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:33,541
I... I just... Only because she..

975
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:36,458
That's Summer's phone in there,
right behind yours.

976
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:44,666
- You happy now? For ruining this?
- I don't know what happened.

977
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:47,333
I... I must've butt-dialed ya.
I mean, butt-shot ya.

978
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:48,916
You don't even have a butt.

979
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:50,583
How dare you?

980
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:55,583
- You talk to all of us?
- You said I was the only one.

981
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:57,375
You said <i>I</i> was the only one.

982
01:00:57,375 --> 01:01:00,375
- I thought I was special.
- You're all special. I..

983
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:04,625
I'm sorry! I just...

984
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:08,750
Seeing you guys getting along
and doing great in class,

985
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,958
it felt like
I was actually making a difference.

986
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:15,500
You did. This year would've been
a nightmare without you helping me.

987
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,583
Ms. Malkin's so mean.
Talking to you made the class bearable.

988
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:23,125
I was just worried if you all knew...

989
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:25,166
...other people would find out.

990
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:27,375
You told me not to tell anyone,
and I didn't.

991
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:30,875
- Nobody did. Because we can keep a secret.
- Yeah.

992
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:33,875
What, did you tell everyone
I shave my unibrow?

993
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,041
Because I don't.

994
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:38,958
Hey, the only one he told
about your unibrow,

995
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:41,333
or that you still eat your boogers,
was me.

996
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,666
- And I barely chuckled.
- What?

997
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:44,791
I'm leaving.

998
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:46,125
I tried.

999
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,791
Wait, it's Friday.

1000
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,166
Aren't you gonna take me home?

1001
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:52,333
Summer, it's your turn.

1002
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,583
Please, I'm so sorry.

1003
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:57,916
How can we trust you now?
That was a question.

1004
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:03,000
All right, what's everyone doing here?

1005
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,625
Oh, you're leaving.
Good. Take the whole day off.

1006
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:09,375
You need to rest up
for the history fair tomorrow. Go home.

1007
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:11,833
Go. Shoo. Come on, out you go.

1008
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,500
You and I have a lot to talk about.

1009
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:24,708
I don't understand.

1010
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:27,875
I... I know I lied to the kids.
What did I do to you?

1011
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:32,833
Excuse me, talking to my students
behind my back? Advising them?

1012
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:35,833
Okay. I feel terrible,
but I was just trying to..

1013
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:37,625
Undermine my methods!

1014
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:40,875
Cheat me out of feeling
any satisfaction from their success.

1015
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:44,875
What? They learned everything you
wanted. Why wouldn't that make you happy?

1016
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:48,000
Don't think you can analyze me.
I'm an adult.

1017
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,041
Not a shrieking brat who thinks
reading <i>Canterbury Tales</i> is torture.

1018
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:53,166
It's not torture?

1019
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:54,291
Quiet!

1020
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:59,250
Asking me to be happy when I
have nothing but these four walls.

1021
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:03,541
- What about your family?
- Excuse me, do you see any family?

1022
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:07,083
Oh. Uh, not unless you're related
to the gym coach.

1023
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,541
- Those pictures are none of your business.
- Gotcha. Never saw 'em.

1024
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:16,833
I put my whole life into teaching
just to be a mere substitute.

1025
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:21,666
{\an8}Never had my own class,
never got any respect.

1029
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,666
Like seeing the Everglades,
or spreading Salmonella.

1030
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:37,875
But this year,
I fell into something even better.

1031
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,250
I really clicked with these kids.

1032
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:45,625
Uh, maybe it helped, just a little,
that you're a talking animal?

1033
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:48,333
Yeah, but also, maybe it's you.

01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,125
And tell me, do you think she was...

1055
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:46,625
<i>♪ Happy? ♪</i>

1056
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:48,625
She made <i>you</i> her family.

1057
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:51,958
That's what great teachers do.
Even substitutes.

1058
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:55,375
With the little time they have,
they try to make a difference.

1059
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:58,041
And that's what keeps <i>them</i> happy.

1060
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:02,000
<i>♪ You can feel love
It's not the end ♪</i>

1061

01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:09,125

<i>♪ Happy ♪</i>

1071
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:42,875
- Well, that felt wonderful.
- I know you got it in you.

1072
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:45,708
You're gonna get those kids
first place tomorrow.

1073
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,875
- Oh, you're coming with me.
- No, please. They're mad.

1074
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:50,916
Let... Let them focus on winning.

1075
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:52,833
Well, I'm still taking you.

1076
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:53,750
After they win,

1077
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,916
we'll make sure they appreciate
all you were doing for them.

1078
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:00,750
You know what? You <i>are</i> special.

1079
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,625
I couldn't sleep last night.

1080
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:09,708
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Leo did to us.

1081
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:12,875
Let's just not talk about Leo.
We're done with Leo.

1082
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:15,208
We're ready.
We can win this thing ourselves.

1083
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:18,916
Good morning, my dear students.

1084
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:26,916
- They look confident.
- You sounded nice. Real warm.

1085
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,208
Thank you.
I'll keep you posted when I can.

1086
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,083
I'm Betsy Ross.

1087
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:39,500
I designed the first American Flag
in 1776.

1088
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,541
But I didn't just say what I
thought the flag should look like,

1089
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,958
I listened to others
to see what they thought.

1090
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:47,583
The result was
the superior design we have today,

1091
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:49,208
and also, people liking me more.

1092
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,916
{\an8}I'm Susan B. Anthony.

1093
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:54,500
{\an8}I played a pivotal role
in the women's suffrage movement

1094
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,125
{\an8}in the 19th century.

1095
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:59,416
{\an8}But I'm not that special or great.
And neither is my family.

1096
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:03,625
So I can relate to average women
who couldn't vote until 1920.

1097
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:06,916
I'm Winston Churchill.
"We shall fight on the beaches."

1098
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:09,666
"We shall fight them
in the fields and in the streets."

1099
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:11,083
"We shall never surrender,

1100
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:13,833
but we shall let them down easy,
with a nice letter."

1101
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:16,666
- "So they don't lose their minds."
- This is wonderful.

1102
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,708
You've taught them life lessons.

1103
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:21,333
I... I can't hear anything.
Can you open your pocket?

1104
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:25,916
{\an8}They burned me, Joan of Arc,
at the stake, but I am not afraid.

1105
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:28,958
{\an8}Boo-freaking-hoo!
Everyone's got problems.

1106
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:32,541
I talked about it to a friend
and felt a lot better.

1107
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:38,416
Aw, I think that friend is you.

1108
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:43,708
Malkin's Marvels,
you're going to Magic Land Park!

1109
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:46,833
Congratulations, class!

1110
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:47,750
Yeah!

1111
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:52,583
And to the first substitute
to ever win Teacher of the Year!

1112
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:58,458
You'll be chaperoned
by Ms. Malkin and Coach Kimura.

1113
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,500
Oh...

1114
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,708
Is it over? We win? When do I come out?

1115
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,208
What's happening?

1116
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,625
Ms. Malkin, can we go see Leo?

1117
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:12,416
- Honey, it's about to rain.
- We can't go to our class for one second?

1118
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:15,666
You know what the rain does
to my extensions.

1119
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:18,833
I gotta say, I thought you were
some kind of a twisted animal.

1120
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:22,541
A rabid, bitter bag
of mothballs foaming at the mouth.

1121
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:27,541
But I've never seen my Jayda speak
like that. It's like she's, uh, nice?

1122
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:28,958
That's our Ms. Malkin!

1123
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:30,916
You really got to know our kids.

1124
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:34,083
- What a special lady.
- Get this woman a full-time job next year.

1125
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:36,333
Oh,
I think we can arrange that.

1126
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:38,625
She's helped Summer make friends.

1127
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,875
Cole's proud
of his voice, thanks to you.

1128
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:43,083
- How'd you do it?
- Well... You know...

1129
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:48,166
That's,
um... my stomach. I... I better go.

1130
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,791
She's not gonna make it.

1131
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:54,541
What happened? I couldn't hear nothing.

1132
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:57,125
Did we win?
I thought I was gonna see the kids.

1133
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,375
We're going somewhere very special.

1134
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,375
We're all going to celebrate?

1135
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:02,666
What, a pizza party?

1136
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,833
Wow, this pizza's out in the boonies.

1137
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:16,708
What's goin' on?
You're leaving me here?

1138
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,250
What about the kids?

1139
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:22,125
They lost. The class
embarrassed themselves and blamed you.

1140
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,958
What? What was all that cheering?

1141
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:27,791
That was for the other class. I'm sorry.

1142
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:30,958
What did I do? I've never felt so bad.

1143
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,458
Don't say that.
You said the Everglades was your dream.

1144
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:36,916
Now you can live it out, with no chance
of ever running into the children.

1145
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:40,375
Or their parents.
Or the principal. Or the media.

1146
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:43,041
I said it <i>was</i> my dream.

1147
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:45,250
The kids are what I..

1148
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:15,083
- What?
- Where is he?

1149
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,125
- Is he hiding?
- He's not hiding.

1150
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,041
He was here.

1151
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:19,833
- You seen him?
- What happened?

1152
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:23,083
What a shame. He must've run away.

1153
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:35,000
- He left us?
- Oh, look.

1154
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:38,041
There seems to be some kind of note.

1155
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:41,541
- Leo could write?
- Of course. He could talk.

1156
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:47,041
Oh! He talked to you people too?
Oh, I thought I was special.

1157
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,708
"Dear class."

1158
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:53,625
"I've greatly enjoyed my time
with you this year,

1159
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:57,333
but I wish to move on
and finally see the world."

1160
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:01,000
"I realize I broke your trust,
and that can't be fixed."

1161
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:03,458
"But if you would be so kind,

1162
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:07,041
please keep our conversations secret,
so that I'm not harassed,

1163
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:10,083
like <i>E.T.</i> or <i>The Iron Giant</i>, or <i>Splash</i>,

1164
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:13,750
or the classic, <i>The Shape of Water</i>.<i>"</i>

1165
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:18,166
"Simply attribute your success
to Ms. Malkin,

1166
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:21,708
{\an8}whose integrity is beyond reproach."

1167
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,208
"Best Regards, Leo."

1168
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:30,375
Well, let's try and be happy for Leo.
He's doing what he wanted most.

1169
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,958
But we never even got to thank him.

1170
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:37,291
That's life, gang. Life gets
more difficult the older we get.

1171
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,041
It's called growing up.

Okay, everybody.
Be careful on the Dragon Coaster.

1206
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:02,208
Wipe the chair and the safety bar.

1207
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:05,000
Doesn't matter what the teacher says,
you call us every half hour.

1208
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,416
And don't lick anything.

1209
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:10,958
They tried to put the shift on Kabir
when he was up, but guess what?

1210
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:13,375
- He can hit to right field too.
- Oh!

1211
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,083
That is something.

1212
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:19,583
- What do you think Leo's doing right now?
- I have no idea.

1213
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:35,541
Sure, kids, why flip over
the musty old turtle before you leave?

1214
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:38,958
Even though he knows
the truth? But no, everyone's gone!

1215
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:41,291
Everyone but me and that pathetic...

1216
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:44,125
Wait.
Where's the allergy kid's phone? Ah.

1217
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:48,958
Ha.

1218
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:49,916
Here we go.

1219
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,583
There's no time for lettuce. Flip me!

1220
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,333
Okay, we gotta move!

1221
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,333
Follow those brats!

1222
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:26,208
Hey.

1223
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:29,083
Shake it off, man.
You're freaking everyone out.

1224
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,458
Okay, let's hit it.

1225
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:13,166
Ouch.

1226
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:17,333
{\an8}This is our last field trip together.

1227
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,208
Why does it feel like our worst?

1228
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:22,416

01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:38,083
- What is going on back here?
- She did it!

1232
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:41,333
- Excuse me?
- I saw it. I saw the whole thing.

1233
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:44,375
She took him out of the terrarium
after you guys left that day.

1234
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:46,541
She took him,
and I wanted to say something,

1235
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,833
but her and her vacuum,

1236
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:51,500
they gave me the stink eye, and I
slipped on, uh, somebody else's pee,

1237
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,166
and I flipped on my back,
and this whole thing is my fault

1238
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:57,166
'cause I got jealous of my best friend
instead of being happy for him.

1239
01:16:57,166 --> 01:17:01,000
I used the camera phone to bust him,
but now I gotta bust you, Demeritface!

1240
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,083
He's lying! This turtle can't
be trusted. He turned on Leo.

1241
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:09,166
Come on. You all know Leo's
the reason you got this stupid trip.

1242
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,416
He helped you
with your weird kid problems.

1243
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:12,625
That's why you won.

1244
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:16,375
He wanted to do something meaningful
with the rest of his pathetic time,

1245
01:17:16,375 --> 01:17:17,291
and he did it.

1246
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:19,250
Why did you say, "The rest of his time"?

1247
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,000
- He's dying!
- What?!

1248
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,708
He's gonna be 75.
That's lights out for lizards.

1249
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:25,208
- Oh, no!
- He's dying?

1250
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:27,875
But does Demeritface care? No!

1251
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:30,666
All Demeritface wants is all the credit!

1252
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:32,041
Another lie!

1253
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:34,208
Then where is he, Ms. Misery?

1254
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:37,125
Where's my best friend,
Demeritface? Where is he?

1255
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:40,166
- Out with it, Demeritface!
- Where is he, Demeritface?

- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it now!

1258
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:02,416
I took him, and I drove him away.

1259

- That's crazy! Seriously?
- I can't believe you!

1260
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:08,083
He's right, I wanted the credit.

1264
01:18:16,541 --> 01:18:19,291
The Everglades.

1265
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:22,250
You sent him to the Glades?
That's a terrible neighborhood!

1266
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:26,416
- Those crazy animals will rip him apart!
- Ms. Malkin, please help us find him.

1267
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:28,458
We can't not see him again.

1268
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:35,791
Hey there.

1269
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:39,083
We need to change course.
We're going to the Everglades.

1270
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:41,000
What? We're going to Magic Land Park!

1271
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,125
That's what the parents expect,
and that's where we're goin'.

1272
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:46,583
Oh my, our first fight.

1273
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,583
Thank you. I'm fine.

1274
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:04,541
Children,
we're going to Magic Land Park.

1275
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:20,291
Thanks, but a little too murky for me.
How... How close are we to a drip tube?

1276
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:23,333
Seriously, the microorganisms
will kill you.

1277
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,791
A kid told me that.

1278
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:27,125
You guys never heard of Louis Pasteur?

1279
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,833
What the...

1280
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:47,583
- Someone help me out here.
- Boss, is that you?

1281
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:50,541
Wha.. What?

1282
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:54,166
Hey, that's the guy!
The guy who set us free at that party.

1283
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:56,250
That's the guy?

1284
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,916
That's the guy.

1285
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:04,875
I don't know what Grandma's thinking.
We'll save him on our own, let's go.

1286
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:11,583
Get this guy some algae.

1287
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:17,250
And some of you.

1288
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:20,791
Boss, you're gonna love it here.
No trainers telling you what to do,

1289
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:24,041
no bratty kids joking
about your compact legs.

1290
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,333
But I miss those kids.

1291
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:27,291
What?

1292
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:30,541
They're not bratty.
You just gotta get to know them.

1293
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:34,458
Like this one kid whose father's back
had a gorilla situation.

1294
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:41,416
I got this. You go back to the kids.

1295
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:46,500
Hey, anybody see a buddy of mine?

1296
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,458
He's green with bumps,
got a tail, wicked ugly.

1297
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:53,291
Okay, moving on.

1298
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:59,125
- We're here, y'all!
- Yes!

1299
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:00,791
And I'm hungry.

1300
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:03,333
- Let's do this.
- Hi, welcome to Magic Land Park.

1301
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:05,000
- Okay. Let me get..
- A Cotton Dragon!

1302
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,875
- A Wizard Puffs, please?
- Me too!

1303
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,791
- I'll take a Unicorn Balls.
- Huh?

1304
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:10,458
They're jawbreakers. Please?

1305
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,750
Okay, gang.
You getting all of this?

1306
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,916
Oh, and I need one Fireblower hat.

1307
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,083
Okie doke. Now we're ready,
am I right, kids?

1308
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,625
Are you kidding me? Hey!

1309
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:25,000
- Go! Run fast!
- Come on. Move it!

1310
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,750
Come on!

1311
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:35,958
Oh my God!

1312
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:41,791
- Come on, Ms. Malkin. Hurry up.
- Faster!

1313
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:44,250
Just go. Go without me!

1314
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,208
But you have to drive us!

1315
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,625
Come on!

1316
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:02,166
Come on, Ms. Malkin!

1317
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:04,333
Huh?

1318
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:05,416
The Purell!

1319
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,916
Whoever did this will pay!
Help!

1320
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:16,708
He's coming!

1321
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:19,041
- We have to get out of here!
- I got this!

1322
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:20,458
- What?
- I'm from the Bronx.

1323
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:23,000
I've been driving since I was eight.

1324
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:31,041
- Yeah! Yeah! Do it!
- Woo-hoo!

1325
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:34,958
Oh my God!

1326
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:36,833
Hey, pick a lane, lady!

1327
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,208
A-ha!

1328
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:43,250
I knew it. Leo?

1329
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:50,208
Hey! Whoa, whoa. No.
No, no, no, no, no. I hate it out here!

1330
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:54,541
And I explained to them,
I was just afraid someone would tell.

1331
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,500
But now they're all mad at me,

1332
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:00,666
and my funeral's gonna be
even worse than Hammy #3's.

1333
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:03,416
- Who's Hammy #3?
- I think it's a sandwich at Arby's.

1334
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:05,333
Why you talking about your funeral?

1335
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:07,500
'Cause it's coming any day.

1336
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,666
I'm almost 75 years old.

1337
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:12,416
So what? We live to, like, 110.

1338
01:23:12,416 --> 01:23:14,625
What? But Skyler's dad said..

1339
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:17,583
A hundred and ten,
unless eaten by alligators.

1340
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:18,958
I'm 97.

1341
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:22,583
A hundred six. He's 74? He's a tween.

1342
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:24,333
Look how fast he blinks.

1343
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:31,250
I'm gonna live!
This is incredible!

1344
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,083
The guy's gonna live!

1345
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:35,666
The guy's gonna live!
The guy's gonna live!

1346
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:38,666
I gotta get back to those kids.
I can redeem myself!

1347
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:40,250
And we're gonna help you.

1348
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,208
The guy's gonna live! The..

1349
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:47,041
I said I was sorry!

1350
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:51,458
I'd kill for lateral movement.

1351
01:23:56,958 --> 01:24:01,625
Guys, before you do anything,
let's talk about <i>why</i> you're angry, okay?

1352
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,541
Anyone's parents getting divorced?

1353
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,458
- Aren't you gonna stop?
- I'm trying.

1354
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:12,166
But I weigh 80 pounds
and this thing needs oil.

1355
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:16,625
This looks scary. Oh, my God.

1356
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,166
Come on!

1357
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:31,041
What the... Is that
some kind of woolly mammoth?

1358
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,750
I don't know,
but it could kill us, right?

1359
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,458
Uh, definitely.

1360
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:39,333
We're here.

1361
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:47,000
Get back.

1362
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,708
- Oh, gosh.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1363
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:52,500
That's a demerit.

1364
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:03,375
You need to chill.

1365
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,333
Summer, talk to him.

1366
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:18,625
So I don't know if you know,
but it doesn't really matter.

1367
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:21,083
We were supposed to go to Magic Land,
which is cool.

1368
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:24,125
I've never been there.
I don't like magic and roller coasters.

1369
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:27,375
They just seem really boring.
They're scary, which isn't boring,

1370
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:29,500
but you're not doing anything,
you're just sitting,

1371
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,041
when you could be
playing soccer or baking a cake.

1372
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:35,041
I mean, my mom's on a diet, so..

1373
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:52,500
How could Leo ever survive
out here?

1374
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,958
How do we even start looking for him?

1375
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:56,916
I just don't know.

1376
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,791
What? Leo, no!

1377
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:14,000
- Oh, no. Leo!
- Leo!

1378
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:18,208
Leo,
we just wanted to thank you.

1379
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:21,625
I'm so sorry I got mad. We all are.

1380
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:25,291
We won the trip,
Leo. All because of you.

1381
01:26:25,291 --> 01:26:28,041
You made me feel
like I could do anything.

1382
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:29,583
You brought us all together.

1383
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:32,291
I never had a lizard
that taught me so much.

1384
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:34,416
Or any non-lizards either.

1385
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:38,958
I'm not scared.
I wanna hug you one more time.

1386
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:43,041
What? They ate his insides!

1387
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:45,375
I'm not..

1388
01:26:48,916 --> 01:26:51,083
Huh?

1389
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:53,958
I'm okay, pal.

1390
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,291
- I can't believe it.
- You're all right.

1391
01:26:56,291 --> 01:27:00,291
Sorry I scared you.
When I get nervous, I tend to molt.

1392
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:01,291
Old habit.

1393
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:02,250
Awesome!

1394
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:07,958
That was the best funeral
I could ever have.

1395
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:10,250
Wait, but if you guys won,

1396
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:13,375
shouldn't you be celebrating
in Magic Land Park?

1397
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:17,833
We couldn't celebrate.
We needed to see you before you die.

1398
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:21,000
Oh. Uh, who told you I was dying?

1399
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
The turt.. Uh, Squirtle told us.

1400
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,208
Well, I thought I was,
but I found out I'm not.

1401
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,083
- You're not?
- You're not gonna die?

1402
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:30,333
You're not still mad?

1403
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:31,916
This is incredible.

1404
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:34,000
- We love you, Leo.
- Are you crazy?

1405
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,458
This is amazing!

1406
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,458
I'm so happy!

1407
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:43,291
You're right about the endorphins.
It really feels awesome.

1408
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:49,750
Ah. Oh, boy! Ah!

1409
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:52,083
Still coming. Give me a second.

1410
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:56,833
Hey, glad you're okay.
Sorry about busting you.

1411
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,208
I want you to have something.

1412
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:06,333
- Least I could do.
- It's okay. Put it back on.

1413
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:07,750
You're gonna get arrested.

1414
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:18,708
You should all be proud.
We've all learned so much this year.

1415
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:22,083
Now, before I go,
I want to finish something else

1416
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,750
that Mrs. Salinas started.

1417
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,333
I'm going to read
the rest of <i>Charlotte's Web</i>.

1418
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:31,250
- Ugh, is she kidding?
- Let's just get through it.

1419
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:33,458
"Charlotte was dying."

1420
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:36,291
"'But I feel peaceful, ' she said."

1421
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:41,375
"'Your success in the ring was,
to a small degree, my success.'"

1422
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:44,125
"'Why did you do all this for me?'
Wilbur asked."

1423
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:47,291
"'Because I liked you, '
replied Charlotte."

1424
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:49,916
"'After all, what's life, anyway?'"

1425
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:52,916
"'We're born,
we live a little while, we die.'"

1426
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,833
"'Perhaps,
I was trying to lift my life a trifle.'"

1427
01:28:56,833 --> 01:29:00,166
"'Anyone's life can stand a little of...'"

1428
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:04,833
What? I was wrong, okay?
Crying's doin' so good for me.

1429
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:10,041
- Still wish I could eat spider babies.
- Nobody's eating any spider babies!

1430
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:11,791
Hi, guys!

1431
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,083
Mrs. Salinas.

1432
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:15,958
- I missed you. Come meet Cole!
- Yes!

1433
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:18,750
- Can I hold the baby?
- He's so tiny.

1434
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:19,958
Only one baby.

1435
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:23,166
I guess she didn't bury the other eggs
deep enough in the sand.

1445
01:30:03,166 --> 01:30:07,333
You trusted someone to hear

Your turtle.

1450
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:22,625
They're ready to listen.
I promise they'll make you feel better.

1451
01:30:32,291 --> 01:30:33,875
Ms. Malkin!

1452
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:36,291
Needless to say,
you've made your mark here.

1453

01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:44,958
Well, thank you, Principal Spahn.

1455
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:47,166
But I'll need one condition met.

1456
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:52,916
Whatever class I teach,
I want these two alongside me as pets.

1457
01:30:52,916 --> 01:30:55,750
Well, okay.
I don't see that being a problem.
