She had more reason than
anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,500
I know it was you.

159
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:49,471
And who helped me
with this conspiracy?

160
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,341
Well, there was Ser Dontos.

161
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:55,594
You used him to get
me out of King's Landing,

162
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:58,230
but you would never trust
him to kill the king.

163
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:01,900
- Why not?
- Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.

164
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:04,486
Then perhaps it was
your husband.

165
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,021
No.

166
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:07,823
<i>How do you know?</i>

167
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:10,492
I just do.

168
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:12,661
You're right.

169
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:15,163
He wasn't involved
in Joffrey's death.

170
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:17,199
But you were.

171
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:21,953
<i>Do you remember that lovely
necklace Dontos gave you?</i>

172
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:26,174
<i>I don't suppose you noticed
that a stone was missing</i>

173
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,460
<i>after the feast.</i>

174
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:31,046
The poison.

175
00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:35,050
I don't understand.

176
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:37,686
The Lannisters gave you
wealth, power.

177
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,521
Joffrey made you
the Lord of Harrenhal.

178
00:16:39,555 --> 00:16:42,390
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

179
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:45,110
<i>Always keep your foes confused.</i>

180
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:48,063
If they don't know who you
are or what you want,

181
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:51,199
they can't know
what you plan to do next.

182
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:56,121
I don't believe you.

183
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:00,292
<i>If they catch you, they'll
put your head on a spike</i>

184
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:01,710
<i>just like my father's.</i>

185
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:04,913
You'd risk that
just to confuse them?

186
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:10,085
So many men,
they risk so little.

187
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:13,088
They spend their lives
avoiding danger.

188
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:15,557
And then they die.

189
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:20,645
I'd risk everything
to get what I want.

190
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,815
And what do you want?

191
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:31,356
Everything.

192
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:36,528
My friendship with the
Lannisters was productive.

193
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:39,281
But Joffrey,

194
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:41,833
a vicious boy with
a crown on his head,

195
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,119
is not a reliable ally.

196
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,121
And who could trust
a friend like that?

197
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:48,423
Who could trust you?

198
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:51,960
I don't want friends like me.

199
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:54,462
My new friends are predictable.

200
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,014
Very reasonable people.

201
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:58,767
<i>As for what happened to Joffrey,</i>

202
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:03,104
well, that was something my new
friends wanted very badly.

203
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:05,607
<i>Nothing like a thoughtful gift</i>

204
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:08,226
<i>to make a new friendship
grow strong.</i>

205
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:10,145
I can't believe you're going.

206
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:12,814
Leaving me alone here
with these people.

207
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:15,150
<i>The time has come, my dear.</i>

208
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:18,236
There's nothing
more tedious than a trial.

209
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:20,739
Except perhaps these gardens.

210
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,491
If I have to take one
more leisurely stroll

211
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:26,745
through these gardens, I'll
fling myself from the cliffs.

<font color="#808080">(MARGAERY LAUGHS)</font>

213
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:30,298
Have you been to see Tommen yet?

214
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,300
No.

215
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:34,252
Have they even agreed
to the match?

216
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,004
No one tells me anything.

217
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:40,258
I wasn't originally meant to marry
your grandfather Luthor, you know.

218
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,677
He was engaged to my sister,

219
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,846
your great-aunt Viola.

220
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:48,149
I was to be given to
some Targaryen or other.

221
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:51,903
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

222
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:54,489
But the moment
I saw my intended,

223
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:57,859
with his twitchy
little ferret's face

224
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,861
and ludicrous silver hair,

225
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,913
I knew he wouldn't do.

226
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:04,499
So the evening

227
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,585
before Luthor was
to propose to my sister,

228
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,288
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

229
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:12,624
and happened upon his chamber.

230

<font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>

- How absentminded of me.
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:20,432
The following morning, Luthor
never made it down the stairs

233
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:24,219
to propose to my sister 'cause
the boy couldn't bloody walk.

234
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:26,554
And once he could,
the only thing he wanted

235
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,973
was what I'd given him
the night before.

236
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,192
I was good.

237
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:33,895
I was very, very good.

238
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,366
You are even better.

239
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,984
But you need to act quickly.

240
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:43,872
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

241
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,791
She'll turn the boy against
you as soon as she can.

242
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:50,128
And by the time you're
married, it'll be too late.

243
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:52,130
Luckily for you,
the Queen Regent

244
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:53,998
is rather distracted
at the moment,

245
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,468
mourning her dear departed boy.

246
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:58,887
Accusing her brother
of his murder,

247
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:00,889
which he didn't commit.

248
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,057
Well, he could have done.

249
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:04,008
He could have done,
but he didn't.

250
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,062
- You don't know, Grandmother.
- But I do know.

251

You don't think I'd let you
marry that beast, do you?

252
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:15,770
What?
I don't understand.

253
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:19,441
Shh. Don't you worry
yourself about all that.

254

I was a game warden
in the Stormlands.

317
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:23,818
Fed a prized partridge
to my hungry kids.

318
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:25,653
I was stupid enough
to get caught.

319
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:27,822
Chose the Wall
over losing my hand.

Figured I wouldn't have to suck

I promise you Tommen's safe.

We're protecting him.

336

The way you protected Joffrey?

337
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:28,750
Why did Catelyn Stark
set you free?

338
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:31,419
- What?
- I've been wondering for months.

339
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,256
Ever since that great cow brought
you back to the capital.

340
00:25:36,225 --> 00:25:37,925
Why did she set you free?

341
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,928
You know why. She'd hoped I'd
send her daughters back to her.

342
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,935
She hoped or did you promise?

343
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:49,771
I swore by all the gods

344
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:52,273
that if her daughters were
alive, I'd return them to her.

345
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:54,242
So you made a sacred vow
to the enemy.

346
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:56,944
I wanted to get back to you.

347
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,781
Should I have told
her to fuck off?

348
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,699
You didn't mean it, then?

349
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,752
You have no loyalty
to Catelyn Stark?

350
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:06,621
Catelyn Stark's dead.

351
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:08,956
So if I told you to leave the
capital right now and find Sansa,

352
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:13,127
if I told you to find that
murderous little bitch

353
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:15,179
and bring me her head,

354
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:17,448
would you do it?

355
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,238
I know you went to see Tyrion.

356
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:30,411
That creature
who murdered our son.

357
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:34,882
I had to see him.

358
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,400
I had to know for myself.

And?

360
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:42,657
He didn't do it, Cersei.

361
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,159
You've always pitied him.

362

Our poor little brother.

Abused by the world.

364
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,333
Despised by his father
and sister.

365

He'd kill us all if he could.

366

Before we decide to spend
our lives together,

382
00:28:31,516 --> 00:28:33,734
we ought to get
to know one another.

But if my mother
found out...
