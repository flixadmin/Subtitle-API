1
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:15,572
Hang on, hang on. Come on.

2
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:19,951
<i>Where are you, Charlie?</i>
<i>More importantly, where is my money?</i>

3
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,288
<i>- You're into me for 30 grand.</i>
- Jack, I'm going to pay you.

4
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,832
<i>This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.</i>

5
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,377
<i>You owe Jack money, too?</i>
<i>You pay me first!</i>

6
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:34,216
Bill. We're good, buddy. I got your
money. It's right here in my hand.

7
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,259
Why don't we meet up on the...?

8
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,892
<i>- Your phone's going all screwy. Hello?</i>
- I'm losing you.

9
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:46,436
<i>I can't hear what you're say...</i>

10
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,691
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

11
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,612
- Yeah.
- Can we see him?

12
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,282
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,701
Give me a minute.

14
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,126
This...

15
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:13,421
...is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

16
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:36,820
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually he's going to fight...

17
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:38,363
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

18
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,865
Can we get a picture with him?

19
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,575
Sure. For five dollars.

20
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,869
You want five dollars? Seriously?

21
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,538
No, I want five dollars immediately.

22
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:48,248
Come on, guys.

23
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,211
- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks.
- Whatever.

24
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:56,131
- How about $2.50?
- You suck!

25
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,720
It's going to be one
of those towns, huh?

26
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:07,517
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.</i>

27
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:11,229
<i>Please take your seats. We're almost</i>
<i>ready to get this thing stared.</i>

28
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:15,901
I was told my bot
was fighting an 800-pound steer.

29
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,653
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

30
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,742
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time
has not been good to you, my friend.

31
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:28,413
- Ricky, we got a big problem here.
- Slow down there, hoss.

32
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,210
Last time I saw you, you were staring
at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center

33
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,670
with the taste of my right cross
all over your face.

34
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,591
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:43,595
We agreed that my boxer would fight
an 800-pound steer for three grand.

36
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:45,388
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.

37
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,515
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.

38
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,267
I'll tell you something.

39
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:53,647
Your bot don't fight,
you don't get paid! How about that?

40
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,192
Get the hell out of here.

41
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:04,783
Why don't we make this more interesting.
My bot against your bull, straight up.

42
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,993
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

43
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,704
- Twenty grand. You got 20 grand?
- In a safe in my truck.

44
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,668
All right, Charlie.

45
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:18,964
Twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

46
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,466
I'll come after you and beat you
to within an inch of your life.

47
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,802
You know that I can do that
because I already done done it!

48
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:27,722
In life you get too close, in the ring
you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

49
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,978
All right. Shake and pow! Just like that
once again. You want to dance again?

50
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:36,481
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck.
He needs some luck, y'all.

51
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:39,567
Don't touch that bull.

52
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,821
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

53
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:45,407
do we have any fans
of robot boxing here today?

54
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,245
Now, listen, friends, I understand

55
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:54,165
we can't all afford to go
all the way over there to Dallas

56
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:59,170
and pay $300 for one of those
World Robot Boxing League fights.

57
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:02,465
So, I decided that I would bring
a robot boxing match

58
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:06,011
right here to our little fair
here in San Leandro.

59
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,429
How about that?

60
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:14,686
Ladies and gentlemen,
I introduce to you,

61
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:17,397
Ambush!

62
00:07:17,564 --> 00:07:18,898
Let's do it!

63
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:22,902
All right, big fella.

64
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,327
He's a big fella, ain't he?

65
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:33,997
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.

66
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:39,836
Show them some power.

67
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,757
Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

68
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,343
Yeah, big fella.

69
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,554
Ambush's opponent today,
he's last year's runner-up

70
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,723
in the baddest of the bulls competition,

71
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,642
ladies and gentlemen,

72
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,520
Black Thunder!

73
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:01,649
- Let's get it on!
- Let's get this thing started.

74
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:06,905
Is that all you got?

75
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,909
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

76
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,295
Take him, take him.

77
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:27,258
Ambush lays the smackdown
on that prime beef.

78
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:35,141
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.

79
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,105
OK. Jump, now!

80
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,697
Ambush, decks Black Thunder,

81
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:53,243
but when you mess with the bull,
you're going to get the horns.

82
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,373
You like that. I can tell.
You like that.

83
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,459
Turn around!

84
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,715
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

85
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:20,812
Come on. We're still in this thing.
Just hop. Hop.

86
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:23,314
That's it. Come on.

87
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,946
Ricky, enough! Enough!

88
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:33,283
I can't hear you over the sound
of your robot being destroyed.

89
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,786
Kill! Kill! Kill!

90
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:39,456
Come on, get up.

91
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:41,708
Get up! Come on!

92
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,421
No!

93
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,219
Come on, no. No, no, no!

94
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:03,021
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for our warriors out here today

95
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:05,732
at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

96
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,817
Thank you for coming out,

97
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:11,571
and we'll see you next time,
because there will be one.

98
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:13,698
Give me that leg.

99
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:15,700
Sure. For five dollars.

100
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:17,535
Boo-yah!

101
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:24,167
All right! That was ridonculous fun,
now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

102
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:28,671
I'm going to come by for my money,
Charlie boy. You best have it.

103
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,882
- Everybody say "hey!"
- Hey!

104
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:34,719
- Everybody say "ho!"
- Ho!

105
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:38,097
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?

106
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,491
My keys, damn it.

107
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,410
One more step
and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

108
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,662
Charlie, relax.

109
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,748
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus
fight. It cost me my last robot.

110
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:06,751
- Just listen to us.
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon?

111
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:10,421
She's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen
her in ten years. What does she want?

112
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,257
Nothing. She died.

113
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,551
Do you recall Max Kenton?

114
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,096
He's my son. He's got to be nine.

115
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:19,889
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

116
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:22,892
Is he dead, too?

117
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,770
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.

118
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:55,800
This court is convened
to address the custodial status

119
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:58,261
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

120
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:02,890
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.
Father, Charles Kenton.

121
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,101
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

122
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:10,565
Yes. As I've already told you,
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

123
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:14,152
and we can more than provide for Max.

124
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,697
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

125
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:19,741
next of kin retains custody.

126
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:23,077
Charles Kenton,
who is aware of this custody hearing,

127
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:24,621
and we are expecting him...

128
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,248
I need a new robot now.

129
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:29,751
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

130
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,294
I got to show up with something.

131
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:36,257
Noisy Boy is for sale?
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.

132
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,010
How much? That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

133
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:41,512
I can live with that.

134
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,223
I don't have it.

135
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,436
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights
to custody right after the boy was born.

136
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,105
I can more than provide for Max.

137
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:54,692
Please be Charles Kenton.

138
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:59,197
Charlie, yeah.

139
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,867
I'm here to sign some paper
that releases my rights

140
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,952
to the custody of my son.

141
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,038
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

142
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,498
Charlie.

143
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,875
Do you even remember me?

144
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:14,253
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, Debra. How are you?

145
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,339
Mr Kenton. Please take a seat.

146
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,804
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

147
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,013
Yes, you may.

148
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,890
- How about you, Mr Kenton?
- What?

149
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,559
You can spend some time
with him, if you'd like.

150
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,353
- With the kid?
- Yeah, the kid.

151
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,313
- Max. Your son?
- All right.

152
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,233
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

153
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,903
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

154
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,572
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

155
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,081
Your Honor, I'd like to,
at this juncture,

156
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:52,792
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

157
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,960
Please.

158
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:01,926
Come on. Come on. There you are.

159
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,763
He'll be in a foster home.

160
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,976
No, they find good families.
Young. Energetic. Yeah.

161
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:14,772
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

162
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,987
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

163
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:24,115
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

164
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:29,537
- I'm up for it. But...
- Seventy-five grand.

165
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:33,791
$75,000? You're serious?

166
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:37,962
The thing is...

167
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:41,215
...we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

168
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,050
with my oldest friend and his wife.

169
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,303
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

170
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,804
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

171
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,265
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

172
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,186
In August. A hundred.

173
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:55,271
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

174
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:57,648
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

175
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:01,152
if you tell her I just signed over
that kid to the state of Texas.

176
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:04,864
There's a real way everyone gets
what they want here.

177
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,158
So here's what you're going to do.

178
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:10,369
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

179
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,663
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

180
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,249
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

181
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,668
for being such
a terrible absentee dad,

182
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:21,881
how I want to make good with junior,
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

183
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:25,927
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero
and everybody wins.

184
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:32,725
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

185
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,269
I understand.

186
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:37,688
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

187
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,149
and the other 50
when we get back in August

188
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,109
and you deliver him to us in New York.

189
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,487
Pleasure doing business with you.

190
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,575
Your Honor,
I'm happy we all took the time

191
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:51,244
to make the best decision for everyone.

192
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:56,332
- Happy?
- Yeah, it's me.

193
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:59,710
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

194
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,421
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

195
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:18,729
Hello?

196
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:21,232
Bailey?

197
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,067
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

198
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,486
and it smells like disaster to me.

199
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:26,988
Nice to see you, too.

200
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,991
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up.

201
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,661
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower? Come on.

202
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:35,580
Let me make something clear.

203
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,583
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

204
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,043
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

205
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,045
Putting aside the fact
that you're doing

206
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,923
what I'm guessing is
a black market deal on my doorstep,

207
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,050
how will you pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

208
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,052
The money is on its way.
Just distract him.

209
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,596
I have been. It's exhausting.

210
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,598
- You're the best.
- Yeah? Really?

211
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,767
Is that why you're buying a $45,000
robot when you owe me six grand in rent?

212
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,269
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

213
00:16:58,436 --> 00:17:03,691
Six. There is a guy with real money
who wants to buy this place.

214
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,027
Come on. Like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

215
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,280
If you don't make rent, I can't make
payments and I won't have a choice.

216
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,282
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass

217
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,200
- if you sold this place.
- My father would climb out of his grave

218
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,702
and kick your ass.

219
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,372
Bailey?

220
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,504
- Don't.
- Don't what?

221
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,131
Don't do that.

222
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,260
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

223
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,681
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

224
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,975
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

225
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:42,021
I used to. Once. Briefly.
Now I like money more.

226
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:45,942
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

227
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:49,362
Marvin.

228
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,490
Your money has arrived.

229
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:55,868
Marv.

230
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:02,500
Fifty grand, as promised.

231
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:08,589
Here are all our numbers
and contact info over in Europe.

232
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,383
So that's everything there.

233
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:16,138
So Marvin tells me
you want this time with Max.

234
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:18,516
- Yeah.
- You did the right thing,

235
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:19,809
giving me custody.

236
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:21,310
Caroline would have wanted that.

237
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:25,189
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

238
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,817
That's a deal.

239
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:32,405
OK, let's go get Max.
OK? Let's get Max.

240
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:39,370
It's OK. You want to go around
the other side here and I'll get Max?

241
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:44,333
Hey. Max. See you, pal.

242
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:47,920
Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

243
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,223
I'm Charlie.

244
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:05,855
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

245
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:08,065
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

246
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,233
Do you know where they're going?

247
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,277
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

248
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:12,778
So how did I get stuck here with you?

249
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,781
Relax, kid. You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

250
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:16,949
Charlie!

251
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,577
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

252
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,873
- Did Marvin give you that money?
- Here, just close the deal.

253
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,541
I'll be right there, OK?

254
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,631
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

255
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:35,760
Max Kenton.

256
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,096
- So this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

257
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,598
Don't worry about it, OK?

258
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,184
I'm looking at you two and...

259
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,644
Just go and put Noisy
in the shop, please? Thank you.

260
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,570
You're going to stay here with her
while I'm on the road.

261
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:57,490
- How much did he give you?
- You're coming at this the wrong way.

262
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,325
No, tell me. I want to know.

263
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,703
Fifty thousand, OK?

264
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,206
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

265
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,832
Will you shut up now?

266
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,626
You sold me?

267
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:11,420
Sounds worse than it is.

268
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:14,215
- Really.
- It's to take care of you.

269
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,800
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

270
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,636
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

271
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:21,055
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

272
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:22,723
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

273
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:26,102
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

274
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:30,523
I don't have it! I spent the money
on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!

275
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,024
I'm through here.

276
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,660
What do we got?

277
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,495
Noisy Boy has arrived.

278
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:48,082
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

279
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:51,794
- He's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...

280
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:54,421
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

281
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,715
Maybe that's why you got
such a good price, genius.

282
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,345
Decided to stay?

283
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,141
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

284
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,977
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks.

285
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:10,855
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

286
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,525
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

287
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:16,277
Noisy Boy's in there.
You ever heard of him?

288
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:20,030
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

289
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,289
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

290
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:34,170
His composite armor has been replaced.
Let's see if the insides look as good.

291
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,923
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

292
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,842
He should have had him
in the third round,

293
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,678
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

294
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,694
Relax, kid, he's on our side.

295
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,738
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

296
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:02,406
You know he has voice recognition,
right?

297
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,283
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

298
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,368
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

299
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,079
Brazilians are crazy
about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

300
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,667
Right, left, uppercut!

301
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,883
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

302
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,260
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

303
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:25,930
- Let me see if I can fix it.
- Look how good he looks, too.

304
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,057
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

305
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:30,392
- Why didn't you ask to look at it?
- Relax!

306
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,399
Was that Japanese?

307
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,114
Let me see if I can reset him
to English.

308
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,783
How do you know Japanese?

309
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,368
Video games.

310
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,120
You play video games in Japanese?

311
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,956
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

312
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:59,171
Give me that.

313
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,549
He's reset to English,
and I found his command matrix.

314
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,969
They have pre-loaded
a bunch of combinations.

315
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,471
They should be listed here.

316
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,891
Top salvo!

317
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:15,187
What did I tell you?

318
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,107
Gravity One Downtown!

319
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,446
I was due for some good luck!

320
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,156
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

321
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:29,159
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

322
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,009
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

323
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,844
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

324
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,804
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

325
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:52,725
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

326
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,686
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

327
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,481
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

328
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,944
- Don't do that again.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

329
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,696
Don't do this again?

330
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,699
Get in. Just get in.
Give me the keys first.

331
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:11,410
Wait till I get in the truck.
Thanks, Big Pops.

332
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,376
Sweet ride.

333
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,212
Put on your seatbelt and don't talk.

334
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,736
I'm taking all bets!

335
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,055
Keep up. Stay close.

336
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,144
Charlie Kenton is in the house!

337
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,730
- All right, all right.
- Come on, man!

338
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,818
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

339
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,945
That's Noisy Boy!

340
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,827
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

341
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,246
- Sure you want to fight him tonight?
- What do you got?

342
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:39,540
He can take any bot in this place.
You know it.

343
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,751
You can have any undercard you want.

344
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,253
Five thousand guaranteed.

345
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,297
A thousand every round
your bot survives.

346
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,299
Fight till the death!

347
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,388
No. Give me the main event.

348
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:56,723
- Come on.
- This is Noisy Boy.

349
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,434
An original Tak Mashido bot.

350
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,270
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on!

351
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,858
You want to fight Midas?

352
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:09,153
Fifty thousand guaranteed,
winner takes all.

353
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:13,657
Fifty? Really, 50? Now you're talking.

354
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,659
Listen, listen. No, look.

355
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,453
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.

356
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,831
We should take an undercard fight,
make a little cash and get out of here!

357
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,291
First, there is no "we."

358
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,627
Second, he's going to crush Midas,
and I'm going to make real cash!

359
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,422
We'll take Midas!

360
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,645
Tonight, our main event

361
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:48,734
features the gold-blooded killer!

362
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,696
This pimped-out punk

363
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:56,533
is programmed for pain!

364
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:02,372
I give to you the mighty Midas!

365
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:46,083
Against a bot

366
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:51,004
who ran with the big boys in the WRB!

367
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:57,052
He's been on an exile tour overseas,
but now he's back home,

368
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:59,513
and he's ready to make some noise!

369
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,350
Take your first look in a long time

370
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:08,188
at Noisy Boy!

371
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,894
Crash Palace,

372
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:52,899
who's ready for some destruction?!

373
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:57,654
Let's make some money! Come on!

374
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,574
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

375
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,743
Noisy Boy against Midas.

376
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:06,163
You've been waiting all night
for this matchup, Crash Palace!

377
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:13,712
Scimitar right!

378
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,508
Did you see that?

379
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:21,803
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

380
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,098
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

381
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,309
Skull salvo! Firefight!

382
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,023
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

383
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:36,818
Shockfist!

384
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,865
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

385
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,702
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

386
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,707
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

387
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,379
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

388
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,634
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

389
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:03,220
I got something for you.

390
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:07,516
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

391
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,727
Get up!

392
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:14,940
That's illegal!

393
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:17,234
This is the underworld.
There are no rules!

394
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:19,695
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

395
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,071
No. Hands up!

396
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:24,241
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

397
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,830
He's getting killed in there!

398
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:36,628
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

399
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,088
Panic Shield!

400
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,091
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

401
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,848
No, no. Shatter Punch!

402
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,895
- Five Recall!
- Get some!

403
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,111
Jab, jab!

404
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:09,619
Right roundhouse!

405
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:13,123
Did he just spit his juice
in Midas's face?

406
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,834
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

407
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,378
It's party time now, Crash Palace!

408
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,629
Use your left!

409
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,382
Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

410
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,719
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

411
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,477
No, no! Get up!

412
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:36,188
Get some!

413
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,983
Move! Get out of the corner!

414
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,528
Midas! Midas! Midas!

415
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,825
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

416
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,994
I got something for you! You ready?

417
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:56,416
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

418
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,336
And so long to Noisy Boy.

419
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,203
That sucked. You hungry?

420
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,040
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

421
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,960
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

422
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,879
I need to find a mainframe. What?

423
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,340
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

424
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,844
Fine. More for me. Here, drink this.

425
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,679
You never should have taken that fight.

426
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,973
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

427
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:56,476
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

428
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,895
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

429
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:02,399
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

430
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:05,193
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

431
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,821
- You never gave him a chance.
- He wasn't that good.

432
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,489
Noisy Boy was a great robot.

433
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,409
Was. Was a great robot
back in the League, back in the day.

434
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:16,538
But look around you. This place is
where once great robots go to die.

435
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:18,081
So throw him away.

436
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:21,334
That's what you do, right?
Anything you don't need you throw away.

437
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:24,588
Wow.

438
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,341
It's been a long night.

439
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,760
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

440
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,680
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

441
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,002
They gave me 400 for his head.

442
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:24,230
You stay put.
I'm going to look for parts.

443
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm coming with you.
That drink has my heart pounding.

444
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:29,694
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

445
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:31,321
Whatever. Just keep up.

446
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,334
Crap.

447
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,835
Stay back.

448
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,224
All right, keep up.

449
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,395
These searchlights are automated,
but you got to time them right,

450
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:04,646
so stay close.

451
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:09,442
It's all right.

452
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,987
Come on, come on.

453
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,365
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

454
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:19,119
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

455
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:22,539
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

456
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,336
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

457
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,675
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!

458
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,444
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

459
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,113
Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

460
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,282
- Hey, look.
- What?

461
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:01,453
It's so small.

462
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,246
Yeah. That's before your time.

463
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:06,499
That's a Generation One,
the very first fighting bot.

464
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,919
They wanted them to look like us.
The more human, the better.

465
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,756
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Put that in the cart.

466
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:16,092
- What changed?
- A good question. Human boxing.

467
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:18,136
- It just faded.
- Why?

468
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:23,600
Because the money moved on.
People wanted more carnage, more show.

469
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,811
You had the whole Brazilian underground,
the Gracies, the Machados,

470
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:30,148
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,
and a thousand styles in between.

471
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,691
Full-on ground-and-pound.

472
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,109
- Look at this.
- What's that?

473
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,444
I don't know.

474
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:35,945
Not bad. Good spot.

475
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:39,115
You still had human fighters,
human bodies,

476
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,493
so you couldn't give the people
what they really wanted:

477
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,953
true, no-holds-barred violence.

478
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,792
The next logical step,

479
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,087
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

480
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,464
Do you miss it?

481
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,469
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

482
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,012
What? I want to know.

483
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,972
Careful, you're on a cliff.

484
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:10,563
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

485
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:22,325
Charlie, help me!

486
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:48,017
Charlie!

487
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:52,147
- Charlie!
- Max! Max!

488
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,066
Max!

489
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:01,531
- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.

490
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:05,702
Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

491
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:10,206
Very slowly. Good. Don't look down.
Look at me. Look at me.

492
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:14,210
That's it! I've got you!
You don't have to be scared. I got you!

493
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:16,713
- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

494
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,215
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

495
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:24,804
Just give me your other hand very
slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!

496
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:27,473
Look at me.
We're going to do this together.

497
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,894
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.

498
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:35,315
One... two... three!

499
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,739
That's it. I got you!
I got you. I got you. I got you.

500
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,581
You're safe. You're safe.

501
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:56,878
All right, I got you.

502
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:58,421
- You all right?
- Yeah.

503
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:00,965
Come here. Easy. Easy.

504
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,260
You all right?

505
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:05,762
- You all right?
- Yeah.

506
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,805
I told you it was dangerous.

507
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:10,266
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

508
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:26,282
Charlie, I think
there's a whole robot in there.

509
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:27,742
So what? Let's go. Come on.

510
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,411
I'm taking him with me.
He saved my life.

511
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:33,957
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.

512
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:37,085
Just bring the cart to the edge.
I'll use the winch to get him out.

513
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:40,630
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

514
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:27,362
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

515
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:28,488
That's it.

516
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,366
His head does make a nice addition
to the front of the Crash Palace.

517
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:35,578
- It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

518
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:38,873
Good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

519
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,793
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

520
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,252
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

521
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:45,546
- There's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

522
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:48,591
All your junk is... it's junk.

523
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,845
You're not even in the game anymore.

524
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:54,931
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

525
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:56,766
Don't get loud with me.

526
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,768
- You're your problem.
- What's that supposed to mean?

527
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:01,771
I have been here for you a long time.

528
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:05,608
In the ring, out of the ring, and the
whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

529
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:09,779
My father invested everything he had
in your fight career. We loved...

530
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:16,244
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

531
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:19,580
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

532
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:22,291
What's yours?

533
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:35,680
You're done, right?

534
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:40,643
You're finally done?
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

535
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:43,312
I got nothing left.

536
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:46,357
All right.

537
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,528
Maybe there's something here.

538
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:55,700
This robot the kid brought in last
night. Would you look at it for me?

539
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,410
Please?

540
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:10,965
I've never seen anything like it before.
He's Generation Two, but barely.

541
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:15,678
I found a power cell that fits him, and
I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.

542
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:17,972
You can move him around, but he's crap.

543
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:21,017
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

544
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,351
Stop.

545
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:24,103
It's my robot!

546
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:27,857
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there. He's mine.

547
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:31,569
He's yours? Yeah. But the parts
we're putting in him are mine!

548
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:36,324
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you fight over him.

549
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:37,742
What happened to you?

550
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,221
Watch out. Stay back.

551
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:19,700
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

552
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:22,912
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory.

553
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,873
- Is there anything here we could use?
- Not much.

554
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,083
There's a bucket...

555
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,503
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck.

556
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,548
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

557
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:36,509
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

558
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:39,845
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

559
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:42,390
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

560
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:45,893
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

561
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,771
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

562
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,481
Cool.

563
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,225
"Atom."

564
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:36,944
His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

565
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:38,404
I don't think he was
ever a boxing robot.

566
00:45:38,571 --> 00:45:42,617
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

567
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,035
They must have built robots
like this one

568
00:45:44,201 --> 00:45:46,287
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

569
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:48,581
OK, so can we get him a fight?

570
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:51,334
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

571
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,086
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

572
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:55,838
You could always sell him off for parts.

573
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:59,383
- Can't you get him a fight?
- "Why can't you get him a fight?"

574
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,302
God, you don't quit, do you?

575
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:04,347
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

576
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:07,350
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

577
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:11,687
The places that would let you fight this
robot would make you pee your pants.

578
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:14,190
Excellent. Get him a fight.

579
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:21,364
Stubborn kid.

580
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,366
Surprise, surprise.

581
00:47:04,657 --> 00:47:05,991
Let's take a walk.

582
00:48:15,728 --> 00:48:17,146
Can you understand me?

583
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,240
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

584
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:55,059
You've known Charlie a long time.

585
00:48:56,185 --> 00:48:59,522
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

586
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,817
My dad, he trained him.

587
00:49:04,193 --> 00:49:06,654
That's them. That's Charlie.

588
00:49:09,156 --> 00:49:11,075
- What was he like?
- As a boxer?

589
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:13,494
- As anything.
- He was something.

590
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:17,248
He was lean, tough.

591
00:49:17,414 --> 00:49:19,250
No quit, no fear.

592
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:25,798
Come here. I want to show you something.

593
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:31,637
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

594
00:49:31,804 --> 00:49:35,516
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

595
00:49:35,683 --> 00:49:37,059
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?

596
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:41,188
I was. Charlie was supposed to be
a warm-up fight, an easy win.

597
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:44,650
Nico wasn't even supposed
to break a sweat, but...

598
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:50,239
...nobody told Charlie that, so he
just kept coming and coming at him.

599
00:49:50,406 --> 00:49:51,740
Check this out.

600
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:55,911
That's Charlie.

601
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,416
First, Nico couldn't believe
the balls on this nobody.

602
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:05,170
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

603
00:50:05,337 --> 00:50:07,089
- Really?
- Really.

604
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:08,924
He was toying with Nico.

605
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:11,677
The top contender,
number two in the world,

606
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:13,929
and Charlie was dancing with him.

607
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:18,684
Charlie was floating
inches off the canvas that night.

608
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:21,687
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

609
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:24,440
I could.

610
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:28,444
He was beautiful.

611
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:30,946
He was beautiful.

612
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:36,535
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

613
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:40,372
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

614
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:42,333
Second time for good. Lights out.

615
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:43,834
You were ahead on the scorecards

616
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:46,128
- going into the 12th round.
- Nico Tandy rung my bell

617
00:50:46,295 --> 00:50:49,131
and went on to be the undefeated
world champ for the next three years.

618
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:51,300
- He knocked you out?
- Yeah. So did a lot of guys.

619
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:52,801
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

620
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:57,306
- 24 and 19. It's not exactly a career.
- But every fight a knockout.

621
00:50:57,473 --> 00:50:58,891
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

622
00:50:59,058 --> 00:51:00,517
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

623
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:03,145
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

624
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:05,481
- Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

625
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:07,483
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

626
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:11,070
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

627
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:12,947
Wow. Here.

628
00:51:15,157 --> 00:51:16,283
Keep it.

629
00:51:17,534 --> 00:51:20,037
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

630
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,418
I like that kid.

631
00:51:27,336 --> 00:51:28,671
He likes you.

632
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:37,137
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

633
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:40,391
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight

634
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:43,769
to see if I can get a partner
or raise money to get a new bot.

635
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:48,857
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

636
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:55,364
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

637
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:04,873
OK.

638
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:42,077
Look.

639
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:51,920
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

640
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:53,589
Yeah.

641
00:52:55,716 --> 00:53:01,096
<i>Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds</i>
<i>with this monster. Two rounds!</i>

642
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:04,433
<i>The champ puts his Real Steel world</i>
<i>championship belt on the line tonight.</i>

643
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,560
<i>He just may have a real fight</i>
<i>on his hands.</i>

644
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:12,066
<i>Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time.</i>
<i>Ever. End of story. Good night!</i>

645
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,402
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?

646
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:19,573
Come on.

647
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:24,495
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.

648
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:26,413
I want you to stay in this area.

649
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:30,542
Out of the way. Champ coming through.
Zeus coming through.

650
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:32,211
Move, move. Champ coming through.

651
00:53:44,473 --> 00:53:47,643
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind
the father/daughter Zeus team.

652
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:51,313
They say your father's the money
and you are the mind behind Zeus.

653
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,315
You're very kind,

654
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:57,361
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

655
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:02,157
What did it take to lure
the reclusive genius, former boy wonder

656
00:54:02,324 --> 00:54:05,494
and arguably the most important
bot designer in the history of the sport

657
00:54:05,661 --> 00:54:07,162
out of retirement?

658
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:10,457
Why don't you ask him yourself?

659
00:54:15,337 --> 00:54:17,965
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

660
00:54:19,508 --> 00:54:23,554
Zeus is autonomous
and constantly evolving during a fight.

661
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,722
With his adaptive operating system,

662
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:30,853
he recognizes patterns and rewrites
his fight code instantaneously.

663
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:35,440
For myself and Joe Six-pack out there,
are you saying that Zeus...?

664
00:54:35,607 --> 00:54:39,903
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring...

665
00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:44,199
...the result of any fight is inevitable.

666
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:46,910
What Zeus sees...

667
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:49,746
...he kills.

668
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:52,958
Sweet.

669
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:23,405
I'm never going into business with you.

670
00:55:23,572 --> 00:55:24,865
I just need a break here.

671
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:27,659
You got that old bot truck out there.
You always got something in there.

672
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:30,287
I got an old sparring bot,
ain't worth the paint left on it.

673
00:55:30,454 --> 00:55:32,039
What am I supposed to do with that?

674
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:34,875
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

675
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:37,002
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

676
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:39,004
I just need a little loan.

677
00:55:40,422 --> 00:55:41,590
What?

678
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,426
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

679
00:55:44,593 --> 00:55:46,762
Couple hundred. Few hundred.
Whatever you got.

680
00:55:47,888 --> 00:55:49,306
You know I'm good for it.

681
00:55:49,473 --> 00:55:53,268
I know you, and as much
as I like you, dude...

682
00:55:54,311 --> 00:55:56,104
...you're a bad bet, brother.

683
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:00,984
Right, yeah.

684
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:23,590
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.

685
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:25,509
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

686
00:56:25,676 --> 00:56:27,970
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

687
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:30,097
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

688
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:34,351
He was just peppering Axelrod with
punches, but so fast. It was incredible.

689
00:56:34,518 --> 00:56:38,063
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.
He didn't even survive the first round.

690
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,314
Is that what you think boxing is?

691
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:41,483
Zeus beating up some piece of steel
that they feed him?

692
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,486
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

693
00:56:44,653 --> 00:56:47,197
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

694
00:56:47,364 --> 00:56:50,367
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

695
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:53,954
He's more than that.
If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.

696
00:56:54,121 --> 00:56:57,082
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

697
00:56:57,249 --> 00:56:58,959
Tomorrow afternoon,
you'll get your fight.

698
00:56:59,126 --> 00:57:01,378
- Great.
- And it will be the end.

699
00:57:02,504 --> 00:57:04,840
I told you I hate hamburgers!

700
00:57:08,677 --> 00:57:09,845
It's a burrito!

701
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:20,397
Right uppercut.

702
00:57:23,108 --> 00:57:24,860
Left uppercut.

703
00:57:27,571 --> 00:57:31,408
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

704
00:57:33,368 --> 00:57:37,706
Again. Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

705
00:57:37,873 --> 00:57:40,125
You been up all night?

706
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:41,710
Yeah. I cleaned him up.

707
00:57:41,877 --> 00:57:45,213
I'm using shadow mode to program some
fight moves and sync them to the remote.

708
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,592
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch
you were showing him.

709
00:57:48,759 --> 00:57:51,011
That's lethal stuff.

710
00:57:51,178 --> 00:57:52,346
Let's do this.

711
00:57:54,056 --> 00:57:55,432
Let's do breakfast first.

712
00:58:32,803 --> 00:58:34,679
You know you're bringing him
home in pieces, right?

713
00:58:36,932 --> 00:58:38,100
We'll see.

714
00:58:46,316 --> 00:58:49,194
- Let me deal with this.
- Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

715
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:51,113
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

716
00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:53,782
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?

717
00:58:53,949 --> 00:58:55,492
We on a field trip?

718
00:58:57,786 --> 00:59:00,122
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

719
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:02,124
I'll give you a hundred bucks
for one two-minute round.

720
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,500
- Take it.
- Three hundred.

721
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:07,295
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to
give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

722
00:59:08,255 --> 00:59:09,965
How about 500 for two rounds?

723
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:14,594
Two rounds. Son, he ain't
going to survive one round.

724
00:59:14,761 --> 00:59:17,264
- What if he does?
- He ain't.

725
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:19,891
Let's just say he does.

726
00:59:21,852 --> 00:59:25,147
If he's still standing after one round...

727
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:27,732
...I'll give you a thousand bucks.

728
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:28,984
Shut it!

729
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:36,408
But if he dies in there,
which he will, junior...

730
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:40,662
...I get to keep what's left.

731
00:59:42,372 --> 00:59:43,665
Take the hundred.

732
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:45,333
Deal.

733
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:48,962
We're on. We on!

734
00:59:51,673 --> 00:59:53,341
Let's go!

735
00:59:53,508 --> 00:59:55,677
- You should have taken the hundred.
- I got us a thousand.

736
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:57,179
Yeah, if he wins.

737
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:24,498
You want me to drive?

738
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,166
He's my bot. I got this!

739
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:29,544
This ain't a video game.
This is for real. Right here.

740
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:32,881
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?

741
01:00:33,048 --> 01:00:34,216
All right.

742
01:00:36,218 --> 01:00:37,260
I got this.

743
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,679
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

744
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:43,475
Let's get it on like
Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

745
01:00:43,642 --> 01:00:46,311
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

746
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:00,742
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent.

747
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:03,245
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.

748
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:07,165
I told you to watch for that foot plant.
Come on.

749
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,627
Here comes the sledgehammer.

750
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:16,925
Did you see that?

751
01:01:17,092 --> 01:01:20,345
- Come on! Get him!
- Don't yell at him, control him.

752
01:01:20,512 --> 01:01:22,389
Slip right. Back step.

753
01:01:23,098 --> 01:01:24,266
Duck.

754
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:26,685
- You're welcome.
- Shut up! You're not helping!

755
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:27,894
Actually, I think I am.

756
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:34,150
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.
Just keep moving. Bob.

757
01:01:39,948 --> 01:01:42,701
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving! Bob and weave!

758
01:01:43,702 --> 01:01:46,871
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

759
01:01:56,965 --> 01:02:00,135
He can take a hit. I'll give you this.
Your bot can take a hit.

760
01:02:02,721 --> 01:02:05,056
You better slip that headlock.
This ain't gonna end well for you.

761
01:02:05,223 --> 01:02:06,266
I'm trying!

762
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:15,150
Thirty seconds!

763
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:18,320
Thirty... Half a minute.

764
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:21,990
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

765
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:26,870
You've got 20 seconds!

766
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,915
That's a thousand bucks.
Twenty seconds. Let me take over!

767
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:32,751
Move, then. Move!

768
01:02:39,883 --> 01:02:41,259
Come on.

769
01:02:41,426 --> 01:02:43,345
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

770
01:02:45,597 --> 01:02:47,891
Count with me! Count with me! One!

771
01:02:48,058 --> 01:02:51,269
- Get up!
- You know you're talking to a machine?

772
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:53,855
Four! Five! Six!

773
01:02:54,022 --> 01:02:55,440
Get up, Atom!

774
01:02:55,607 --> 01:02:58,026
All the way up! All the way up!

775
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:02,530
Yes! Yes!

776
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:08,828
I'm going to fix it!

777
01:03:10,664 --> 01:03:12,791
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

778
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:14,417
- This thousand bucks...
- Yeah, thousand.

779
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:16,378
...double or nothing
he can't make another round.

780
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:18,088
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.

781
01:03:18,254 --> 01:03:20,632
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

782
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,134
Are you crazy?
You threw away a thousand bucks!

783
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:25,345
He can barely stand up in there.

784
01:03:25,512 --> 01:03:28,056
Look. I really need the money.

785
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:31,476
I know. Let's work.

786
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:34,229
Jesus.

787
01:03:39,818 --> 01:03:41,903
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.

788
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:57,752
- I got it.
- That's a system failure!

789
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:01,047
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.

790
01:04:05,093 --> 01:04:07,762
- Yes!
- No!

791
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:11,474
Start the count!

792
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:12,851
Start the count!

793
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:16,563
One! Two! Three!

794
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:20,692
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

795
01:04:20,859 --> 01:04:22,694
Eight! Nine!

796
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:23,862
Ten!

797
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:28,283
You did it! We did it! Wow!

798
01:04:33,955 --> 01:04:36,166
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

799
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:40,879
I know, I know! I know! I know!

800
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:42,672
Kingpin, pay up.

801
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:45,884
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

802
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,470
- We owned!
- Let's go. Come on, come on.

803
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:51,556
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.

804
01:04:51,723 --> 01:04:56,186
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand.
Seven if he wins.

805
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:58,229
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

806
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:10,825
Bailey, it's me. He won.

807
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:14,120
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.

808
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:17,207
I know.

809
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:21,878
Happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

810
01:05:22,045 --> 01:05:24,506
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

811
01:05:28,259 --> 01:05:29,260
Anyway...

812
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:33,306
I just wanted you to know.

813
01:06:07,257 --> 01:06:09,092
Jab, jab, hook.

814
01:06:12,762 --> 01:06:14,389
Jab, jab, hook.

815
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:18,977
I think you have to move your feet.

816
01:06:21,688 --> 01:06:25,692
Your feet. Feet.

817
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:46,981
Nice moves, kid.

818
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:50,610
How long you been out here?

819
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:53,029
Check it out.

820
01:07:53,196 --> 01:07:55,531
I just spent the night
doing something I think is amazing.

821
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:57,575
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?

822
01:07:58,451 --> 01:08:00,620
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.

823
01:08:00,787 --> 01:08:03,957
I killed it. Got rid of it.
We don't need it anymore.

824
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:05,249
How did you...?

825
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,710
I had to start over.

826
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:10,505
But I was able to use
the spin frame from Ambush

827
01:08:10,672 --> 01:08:13,174
and take the circuitry sleeve
out of Noisy Boy,

828
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:14,384
and it works.

829
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:17,679
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.

830
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:18,888
What works?

831
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:21,766
I got to turn it on.

832
01:08:24,394 --> 01:08:25,895
Left jab, right uppercut!

833
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:29,023
Japan!

834
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:31,734
You put Noisy's voice recognition
into Atom?

835
01:08:31,901 --> 01:08:34,028
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart?

836
01:08:34,195 --> 01:08:35,488
It could be genius!

837
01:08:35,655 --> 01:08:38,324
It could be the most incredible thing
in the history of the entire world!

838
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:41,494
Easy there, chief.
Did you drink all these sodas?

839
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:44,706
I might have had a few.
I need you to teach him to box.

840
01:08:44,872 --> 01:08:48,876
Are you kidding me? He's not advanced
enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

841
01:08:49,043 --> 01:08:51,087
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

842
01:08:51,254 --> 01:08:53,756
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it.

843
01:08:53,923 --> 01:08:55,675
You were a boxer.

844
01:08:55,842 --> 01:09:00,221
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see
things happen before they even happened.

845
01:09:00,388 --> 01:09:02,724
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I'm not starting now.

846
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,268
- Who's going to teach him to fight?
- You're doing fine.

847
01:09:05,435 --> 01:09:07,270
You don't need me. Sorry.

848
01:09:11,691 --> 01:09:13,651
That was really cool,
though, that dance.

849
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:16,779
You should do that on Saturday night.

850
01:09:17,572 --> 01:09:19,699
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm serious.

851
01:09:19,866 --> 01:09:22,577
Before the fight, when you guys
take the ring, you should do it.

852
01:09:22,744 --> 01:09:25,997
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot
in front of a boxing crowd.

853
01:09:26,164 --> 01:09:29,417
Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

854
01:09:29,584 --> 01:09:31,753
People want to see something
they've never seen.

855
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:34,464
Look. You think of all the greats.

856
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:37,383
Think Ali, Sugar Ray,
Prince Rakim, Gammer,

857
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,260
they all had their nicknames.

858
01:09:39,427 --> 01:09:42,430
They had their personas.
They all had flair.

859
01:09:42,597 --> 01:09:47,018
Now you? You might not have much robot,
but with that dance, you got flair.

860
01:09:47,185 --> 01:09:50,480
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.

861
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:53,399
- What are you? Like nine? Ten?
- I'm 11.

862
01:09:53,566 --> 01:09:55,193
Are you sure you're 11?

863
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:58,488
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

864
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:02,909
Anyway, the point
is people want to see that.

865
01:10:06,704 --> 01:10:08,372
You're really not messing with me?

866
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:10,958
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.

867
01:10:14,796 --> 01:10:15,963
- Cool.
- But...

868
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:19,133
- What?
- I won't do it unless you help me.

869
01:10:21,469 --> 01:10:23,179
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

870
01:10:23,346 --> 01:10:25,056
No. Boxing.

871
01:10:25,223 --> 01:10:26,557
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.

872
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:28,893
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.

873
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,394
And you dance.

874
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:33,940
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

875
01:10:34,107 --> 01:10:35,108
Deal.

876
01:10:37,193 --> 01:10:38,277
Deal.

877
01:10:41,489 --> 01:10:42,824
It's going to be cool.

878
01:11:37,712 --> 01:11:39,088
Nice.

879
01:11:40,965 --> 01:11:43,759
You're going to be punching guys bigger.
You're going to have to punch up.

880
01:11:44,594 --> 01:11:45,678
That's it.

881
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:47,763
Nice.

882
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:54,812
You, too, old man?

883
01:11:55,938 --> 01:11:57,815
Come on. Let's get to work.

884
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:02,653
Nice! Let's do that again.

885
01:12:04,405 --> 01:12:06,490
Nice. Three-punch combo.

886
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:09,035
Combo.

887
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:11,746
Again. Again.

888
01:12:12,872 --> 01:12:16,292
Faster. Faster. Nice.

889
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,087
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.

890
01:12:20,796 --> 01:12:22,131
Let's see how you move.

891
01:12:29,222 --> 01:12:30,223
That's good.

892
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:08,511
Step around! Left hook! Left hook!

893
01:13:24,986 --> 01:13:26,946
That's it. Every time.

894
01:13:35,913 --> 01:13:37,373
Upper cut!

895
01:13:45,006 --> 01:13:46,340
Great fight, fellas.

896
01:13:54,265 --> 01:13:57,852
<i>105. 5, WRUT,</i>
<i>the satellite home of robot boxing.</i>

897
01:13:58,019 --> 01:13:59,687
<i>Caller two, what do you got for me?</i>

898
01:13:59,854 --> 01:14:01,939
<i>Have you heard about this little bot</i>
<i>out there, his name is Atom?</i>

899
01:14:02,106 --> 01:14:03,107
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

900
01:14:03,274 --> 01:14:05,818
<i>My buddies and I saw him</i>
<i>the other night, and he dances.</i>

901
01:14:05,985 --> 01:14:07,862
<i>- Did you say "dances"?</i>
<i>- You heard me.</i>

902
01:14:08,029 --> 01:14:10,197
<i>He dances pre-fight</i>
<i>with this little kid,</i>

903
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:11,741
<i>and the crowd went nuts for these two.</i>

904
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:14,702
<i>You put the gimmick aside</i>
<i>for a second,</i>

905
01:14:14,869 --> 01:14:17,371
<i>and I'm holding here a list</i>
<i>of the bots he's beaten.</i>

906
01:14:17,538 --> 01:14:22,126
<i>Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack.</i>
<i>No slouches on that list, right?</i>

907
01:14:22,293 --> 01:14:24,045
<i>Atom's fought them all, beat them all.</i>

908
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:28,382
<i>This bot is fast! He escapes shots</i>
<i>from these bigger bots, it's insane!</i>

909
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:31,510
<i>No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners,</i>
<i>remember this name:</i>

910
01:14:31,677 --> 01:14:36,432
<i>Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.</i>
<i>This bot is one to watch.</i>

911
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:44,106
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

912
01:14:44,273 --> 01:14:46,025
Great fight.

913
01:14:46,192 --> 01:14:47,651
- You guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

914
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:49,737
We'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

915
01:14:49,904 --> 01:14:51,906
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

916
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:55,534
Right. That's a WRB...
That's a League fight.

917
01:14:55,701 --> 01:14:59,747
Damn right it is. What do you say,
fellas? You ready for the show?

918
01:15:01,415 --> 01:15:02,750
Heck, yeah.

919
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:14,345
It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

920
01:15:15,346 --> 01:15:18,391
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed.

921
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:21,394
No freaking out.
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

922
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,771
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

923
01:15:23,938 --> 01:15:27,733
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.
You got to have fun, you understand me?

924
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,862
We've come too far to get out there
and freak out and blow this whole thing.

925
01:15:32,029 --> 01:15:35,408
We're going to have fun,
and we're going to not freak out!

926
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:38,953
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to bam him.

927
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,415
I've spent my whole life waiting
to get here. We're going to...

928
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:46,961
I tell you what. Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

929
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,922
- I got it.
- Good.

930
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:54,844
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

931
01:15:55,886 --> 01:15:57,513
What was that? One more time.

932
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,141
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

933
01:16:00,808 --> 01:16:03,686
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up
to the champ's suite. Sure.

934
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,383
Wow.

935
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:38,512
- Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.
- Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...

936
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:40,681
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.

937
01:16:40,848 --> 01:16:43,100
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

938
01:16:44,185 --> 01:16:47,396
I know you have a very important fight
tonight, so I'll get right to it.

939
01:16:47,563 --> 01:16:51,066
It's a little far from the action for
my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.

940
01:16:51,233 --> 01:16:55,112
Very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.

941
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:57,490
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind...?

942
01:16:57,656 --> 01:16:59,533
I'd like to buy your robot.

943
01:17:01,702 --> 01:17:06,040
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.
And for that I'm willing to pay.

944
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:10,211
$200,000.

945
01:17:10,377 --> 01:17:11,837
- Done.
- He's not for sale.

946
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:14,590
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

947
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:20,387
You are 15 minutes away from getting
in the ring with Twin Cities,

948
01:17:20,554 --> 01:17:22,389
a vicious League bot.

949
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:27,811
So, to be clear, my offer stands
until the starting bell.

950
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:32,149
OK. And just to be clear,
he's not for sale!

951
01:17:32,316 --> 01:17:34,443
Not now, not ever.

952
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:37,821
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

953
01:17:38,489 --> 01:17:40,824
Tak, how are you? Max!

954
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,412
Be smart. I know you love him,

955
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:47,998
but in 20 minutes
there may be nothing left to love.

956
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:51,252
- Think about it. Take the offer.
- You think about it.

957
01:17:51,961 --> 01:17:55,589
Why does she want Atom?
Because he's different from other bots!

958
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:57,633
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller, weaker,

959
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,927
- and he's going to get his ass kicked.
- He's a boxer.

960
01:18:00,094 --> 01:18:02,429
We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!

961
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:05,099
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

962
01:18:05,266 --> 01:18:08,769
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

963
01:18:08,936 --> 01:18:11,897
We can go round and round this
all night long.

964
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:13,357
Look at me.

965
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:15,985
But it's not going to happen.

966
01:18:17,236 --> 01:18:18,571
I got a fight to get to.

967
01:18:33,127 --> 01:18:36,964
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,

968
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:41,802
<i>the march towards</i>
<i>the Real Steel Championship</i>

969
01:18:41,969 --> 01:18:45,014
<i>makes its way through Detroit's</i>

970
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:49,226
Virgin America Spectrum!

971
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:57,651
Kicking off the evening,
in our first undercard,

972
01:18:57,818 --> 01:19:00,571
the two-headed tyrant,

973
01:19:00,738 --> 01:19:05,117
Twin Cities!

974
01:19:35,648 --> 01:19:40,736
Opposing Twin Cities,
in his first professional fight,

975
01:19:40,903 --> 01:19:44,490
hailing from parts unknown,

976
01:19:44,657 --> 01:19:46,283
Atom!

977
01:20:41,964 --> 01:20:43,424
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.

978
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:45,426
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

979
01:20:45,592 --> 01:20:48,262
- This bot is tough to put down.
- Atom can do it.

980
01:20:49,263 --> 01:20:52,266
Look over there. You see those geeks
with the joysticks and consoles?

981
01:20:52,433 --> 01:20:54,101
They're controlling
everything their bot does.

982
01:20:54,268 --> 01:20:55,436
They're monitoring his systems,

983
01:20:55,602 --> 01:20:58,105
seeing what he sees,
stadium feeds of the fights.

984
01:20:58,272 --> 01:21:00,190
This is not like the underground
handheld remote bots

985
01:21:00,357 --> 01:21:02,276
we've been fighting.
This is the League. Stand on that.

986
01:21:02,443 --> 01:21:04,403
So what do we do?

987
01:21:05,112 --> 01:21:08,699
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

988
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,952
Seriously, pray.

989
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:15,581
Ready!

990
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:18,584
- Ready!
- Hands up.

991
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:20,961
Fighters ready! Fight!

992
01:21:24,757 --> 01:21:25,883
Engage.

993
01:21:27,259 --> 01:21:32,347
Slip! Right! Lean back.
Right, left! Cover up!

994
01:21:35,601 --> 01:21:36,894
Duck! Left roundhouse!

995
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:41,023
Damn it.

996
01:21:48,447 --> 01:21:52,034
Lean left! Lean right!
Cover up! Cover up!

997
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:55,078
- What's going on in there?
- He's taking too many hits.

998
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:02,252
Get your hands up!

999
01:22:05,172 --> 01:22:06,924
Get out of that corner! Move!

1000
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:12,471
He's getting killed in there!
Tell him what to do!

1001
01:22:12,638 --> 01:22:15,349
That guy's got two heads, a foot
of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1002
01:22:15,516 --> 01:22:17,351
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1003
01:22:23,357 --> 01:22:24,566
Wait, wait, wait.

1004
01:22:25,275 --> 01:22:28,111
Right shoulder, right shoulder,
right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1005
01:22:28,278 --> 01:22:30,823
He's got a hitch in his shoulder
every time he throws that right bomb!

1006
01:22:30,989 --> 01:22:33,116
We got him!
See? Here it comes again!

1007
01:22:33,283 --> 01:22:35,953
Duck! Spin!
Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!

1008
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:39,373
Backstep. Backstep.
Backstep. Lean right.

1009
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,542
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

1010
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,169
Got to get in close where
he can't use that size and reach on us!

1011
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:47,506
Left to the body! Right to the body!
Left to the body!

1012
01:22:47,673 --> 01:22:49,007
Yeah, it's working!

1013
01:22:49,174 --> 01:22:50,968
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!

1014
01:22:52,553 --> 01:22:55,389
- These program modes aren't working.
- Left! Right hook, slip!

1015
01:22:55,556 --> 01:22:59,059
Right uppercut! Left uppercut!
Duck left. Counter right!

1016
01:22:59,226 --> 01:23:01,895
- Get him, Atom!
- Here comes the Charlie Special.

1017
01:23:02,062 --> 01:23:04,982
Three-punch combo to the body!
Out! In! Counter!

1018
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:07,025
- Two-one-two!
- Two-one-two.

1019
01:23:07,192 --> 01:23:08,652
Stay on him! Lunging right!

1020
01:23:11,572 --> 01:23:14,157
Don't let him go. Right to the body!
Straight right to the head!

1021
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:20,747
We got a systems crash!

1022
01:23:20,914 --> 01:23:22,249
Get him, Atom!

1023
01:23:25,544 --> 01:23:26,837
This is not happening, man.

1024
01:23:27,004 --> 01:23:29,256
- Put him away, Charlie!
- Spin left!

1025
01:23:30,257 --> 01:23:31,592
Spin right!

1026
01:23:33,844 --> 01:23:34,845
Finish him!

1027
01:23:35,012 --> 01:23:37,055
- Do it!
- Right uppercut!

1028
01:23:47,316 --> 01:23:48,442
He's down!

1029
01:23:49,443 --> 01:23:52,779
One! Two! Three!

1030
01:23:52,946 --> 01:23:55,782
Four! Five! Six!

1031
01:23:55,949 --> 01:23:57,868
We got him. Stay down!

1032
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:01,788
He's out! He's out!

1033
01:24:07,794 --> 01:24:08,837
Yeah!

1034
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,634
Corner!

1035
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,762
Corner! Corner.

1036
01:24:18,388 --> 01:24:19,640
Victory!

1037
01:24:20,933 --> 01:24:25,020
In a time of one minute, 47 seconds

1038
01:24:25,187 --> 01:24:27,648
of the first round,

1039
01:24:27,814 --> 01:24:29,441
Atom has defeat...

1040
01:24:30,609 --> 01:24:33,320
I want to thank everyone
for coming out tonight!

1041
01:24:35,989 --> 01:24:40,118
Our little bot from the junkyard
got a shot at a League fight.

1042
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:41,620
How about that?

1043
01:24:42,871 --> 01:24:47,459
And the last thing I want to say
to a special girl who won't be named,

1044
01:24:47,626 --> 01:24:49,419
Farra Lemkova.

1045
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,511
That instead of buying my robot, using
your money to control this sport...

1046
01:24:57,678 --> 01:24:59,429
- That's it!
- I'm not done.

1047
01:24:59,596 --> 01:25:02,140
Why not give the littlest guy
the biggest shot?

1048
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:06,645
Because I bet if you give him a shot,
he'll surprise you!

1049
01:25:06,812 --> 01:25:08,230
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy

1050
01:25:08,397 --> 01:25:10,399
get a shot at the
Real Steel Championship?

1051
01:25:14,486 --> 01:25:17,948
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

1052
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:24,037
Any time, any place, anywhere!

1053
01:25:24,204 --> 01:25:27,165
You name it! We will be there!

1054
01:25:34,965 --> 01:25:36,883
I'm going to get us that fight!

1055
01:25:40,804 --> 01:25:43,807
Atom, Atom, Atom...

1056
01:25:56,737 --> 01:25:58,989
That was a ballsy move,
you challenging Zeus like that.

1057
01:25:59,156 --> 01:26:00,490
That's one thing to call it.

1058
01:26:00,657 --> 01:26:02,075
A lot of people would like to see that.

1059
01:26:02,242 --> 01:26:05,078
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez!

1060
01:26:05,245 --> 01:26:07,080
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.

1061
01:26:07,247 --> 01:26:09,041
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

1062
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:12,294
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1063
01:26:12,461 --> 01:26:14,087
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.

1064
01:26:14,254 --> 01:26:18,258
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him.
- OK. No, no, no.

1065
01:26:18,425 --> 01:26:22,596
I remember now. Who's right?
Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

1066
01:26:22,763 --> 01:26:24,681
All right, all right. All right.

1067
01:26:24,848 --> 01:26:28,351
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.

1068
01:26:28,685 --> 01:26:30,979
That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.

1069
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:34,900
- We set?
- Yeah.

1070
01:26:35,067 --> 01:26:37,235
- Let's do it.
- Charlie boy.

1071
01:26:38,236 --> 01:26:41,531
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.

1072
01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:44,493
I actually really was going to call you.

1073
01:26:44,701 --> 01:26:46,453
Don't worry about that.

1074
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,622
That was a heck of a fight.

1075
01:26:48,789 --> 01:26:51,083
Congratulations to both of you.
That was good.

1076
01:26:51,249 --> 01:26:54,044
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.

1077
01:26:55,045 --> 01:26:56,379
- Come on, man.
- What?

1078
01:26:56,546 --> 01:27:00,634
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking

1079
01:27:00,801 --> 01:27:02,594
when I said I'd beat you
within an inch of your life?

1080
01:27:02,761 --> 01:27:05,806
He thought that was a joke.
It wasn't a joke.

1081
01:27:05,972 --> 01:27:10,143
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.

1082
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:12,979
I'm sure you do,

1083
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:16,149
but I think we know it's about
much more than money, don't we?

1084
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:21,488
All right. What do you want?
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1085
01:27:21,655 --> 01:27:23,323
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.

1086
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:26,618
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

1087
01:27:26,785 --> 01:27:30,122
- Run! Come on. Keep up, keep up!
- Get him now!

1088
01:27:30,288 --> 01:27:31,540
Run! Come on!

1089
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:35,168
Get off him! Get off him!

1090
01:27:38,505 --> 01:27:39,506
Come here!

1091
01:27:43,969 --> 01:27:45,011
Hey, Ricky.

1092
01:27:45,178 --> 01:27:46,721
That's his money!
Leave him out of this!

1093
01:27:59,192 --> 01:28:01,111
Stop!

1094
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,865
Stop!

1095
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:08,535
Take all his money. Take it all.

1096
01:28:11,204 --> 01:28:13,582
Your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.

1097
01:28:13,748 --> 01:28:15,333
He's my father!

1098
01:28:17,544 --> 01:28:22,257
Well. Looks like a little less
than an inch of your life.

1099
01:28:22,424 --> 01:28:25,218
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1100
01:28:30,807 --> 01:28:33,727
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

1101
01:28:33,894 --> 01:28:35,145
Let's go, boys.

1102
01:29:01,004 --> 01:29:05,258
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1103
01:29:45,799 --> 01:29:47,592
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...

1104
01:29:47,759 --> 01:29:50,804
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she?
We're going to get the Zeus fight.

1105
01:29:50,971 --> 01:29:55,141
It's not the Zeus people. I've been
thinking about all this, and...

1106
01:29:57,227 --> 01:29:58,311
Max!

1107
01:30:07,988 --> 01:30:09,739
It's so good to see you.

1108
01:30:09,906 --> 01:30:12,367
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.

1109
01:30:12,534 --> 01:30:14,619
We get beat up,
so you call her to come and get me?

1110
01:30:14,786 --> 01:30:16,579
He's been beat up. I told you
he couldn't take care of him!

1111
01:30:16,746 --> 01:30:19,499
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.

1112
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:21,668
We're fine. She can leave!

1113
01:30:21,835 --> 01:30:24,838
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.

1114
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:27,465
Charlie, please.

1115
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:29,592
Just...

1116
01:30:32,512 --> 01:30:35,056
Charlie, we're doing so good.

1117
01:30:37,017 --> 01:30:38,935
Charlie, please, no.

1118
01:30:40,353 --> 01:30:42,856
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1119
01:30:43,898 --> 01:30:46,818
Please. Please.

1120
01:30:51,406 --> 01:30:54,534
Trust me, kid.
It's better this way, all right?

1121
01:30:55,368 --> 01:30:58,121
I know you think you know
what's right, but you don't.

1122
01:30:58,288 --> 01:30:59,873
You're too young. You don't know.

1123
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,541
Look at me, trust me.

1124
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:05,003
And legally she has custody,
so what can I do?

1125
01:31:05,962 --> 01:31:07,714
What can I do?

1126
01:31:23,063 --> 01:31:24,689
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1127
01:31:25,857 --> 01:31:27,901
Max, we have our own swimming pool

1128
01:31:28,068 --> 01:31:32,655
and we have a hot tub and a lot
of super fun toys to play with.

1129
01:31:32,822 --> 01:31:35,492
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.

1130
01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:37,744
What's going on?

1131
01:31:37,911 --> 01:31:40,580
He won't even talk to me,
so thanks for that, Charlie.

1132
01:31:41,664 --> 01:31:43,208
I'm going to wait in the car.

1133
01:31:45,835 --> 01:31:48,421
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

1134
01:31:48,588 --> 01:31:50,465
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1135
01:31:50,632 --> 01:31:53,676
You knew from day one what this was.

1136
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:55,637
You decided to take the ride.

1137
01:31:56,304 --> 01:32:00,100
You thought me, you,
and a little robot from the junk heap

1138
01:32:00,266 --> 01:32:02,685
were going to ride off into the sunset?

1139
01:32:04,771 --> 01:32:07,273
No, you forgot who I was!

1140
01:32:13,405 --> 01:32:14,697
You deserve better...

1141
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:17,325
...than me.

1142
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:23,581
Will you say something, please?

1143
01:32:23,748 --> 01:32:26,209
I tried. What do you want from me?

1144
01:32:26,376 --> 01:32:28,086
I want you to fight for me.

1145
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:31,131
That's all I ever wanted.

1146
01:34:36,381 --> 01:34:37,715
Don't ask.

1147
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:41,386
So no Max.

1148
01:34:42,637 --> 01:34:46,391
It's better this way.
Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

1149
01:34:46,558 --> 01:34:48,268
Did you not see the way
he looked at you?

1150
01:34:49,561 --> 01:34:51,646
That's the way I looked at my dad.

1151
01:34:51,813 --> 01:34:54,065
Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

1152
01:34:54,232 --> 01:34:58,278
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

1153
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:00,905
Me, come on. I blew it.

1154
01:35:02,865 --> 01:35:04,284
I blew it.

1155
01:35:05,201 --> 01:35:07,120
When Max was born I just...

1156
01:35:07,787 --> 01:35:09,205
...freaked out.

1157
01:35:09,372 --> 01:35:11,624
But something
would have been better than nothing.

1158
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:13,042
I wouldn't know where to start.

1159
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:14,252
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

1160
01:35:14,419 --> 01:35:15,878
- You do.
- No.

1161
01:35:16,921 --> 01:35:17,964
You do.

1162
01:35:50,955 --> 01:35:51,998
I got to go.

1163
01:35:55,126 --> 01:35:56,669
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.

1164
01:35:58,171 --> 01:36:00,548
Worth it. Worth it.

1165
01:36:12,018 --> 01:36:13,561
Go get him, Charlie.

1166
01:36:16,939 --> 01:36:18,358
You sound like your dad.

1167
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:50,431
Look, I know you think I abandoned you,

1168
01:36:50,598 --> 01:36:53,393
and I guess I did originally.

1169
01:36:53,559 --> 01:36:54,560
Then you sold me.

1170
01:36:55,228 --> 01:36:56,396
Charlie.

1171
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,399
You have no business being here.

1172
01:36:59,565 --> 01:37:01,984
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.

1173
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:06,072
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong
by this kid, but if you'll let me...

1174
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:10,201
...I'd just like to do one thing right.

1175
01:37:13,162 --> 01:37:14,247
Right.

1176
01:37:15,873 --> 01:37:17,583
- Where were we?
- You sold me.

1177
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,877
Right, yeah, that happened.

1178
01:37:20,044 --> 01:37:22,255
- Wait, what?
- Then we had our asses kicked.

1179
01:37:22,422 --> 01:37:24,590
And you slept on a shelf in a truck,
and it was awful.

1180
01:37:24,757 --> 01:37:26,384
- And dangerous.
- Really dangerous.

1181
01:37:26,551 --> 01:37:30,304
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

1182
01:37:31,431 --> 01:37:34,434
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

1183
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,936
No. I mean, yes. Yes.

1184
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:43,609
But no. No, I came to tell you
that I heard you.

1185
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:47,947
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1186
01:37:49,532 --> 01:37:52,994
I know you had a bum ride, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

1187
01:37:54,328 --> 01:37:55,413
I should have been.

1188
01:37:56,664 --> 01:37:58,040
Your mom was...

1189
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:00,460
She was cool, wasn't she?

1190
01:38:02,003 --> 01:38:03,087
She was.

1191
01:38:03,963 --> 01:38:05,298
She was the coolest.

1192
01:38:06,132 --> 01:38:08,718
Yeah, she was.

1193
01:38:11,637 --> 01:38:16,601
And I'm sorry about...
what happened with her.

1194
01:38:19,854 --> 01:38:22,648
And I can't get those years back, Max,

1195
01:38:22,815 --> 01:38:25,860
but I'm here right now...

1196
01:38:27,361 --> 01:38:30,656
...and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.

1197
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,255
We got the Zeus fight.

1198
01:38:46,422 --> 01:38:47,632
What?

1199
01:38:47,799 --> 01:38:49,592
No, no, we didn't.

1200
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:52,512
You got the Zeus fight.

1201
01:38:56,474 --> 01:38:58,351
So what do you say, Debra?

1202
01:38:58,518 --> 01:38:59,894
Can we do this one last thing?

1203
01:39:03,397 --> 01:39:05,900
- One night.
- It's all we need. Thank you.

1204
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:14,742
We'll probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we'll go down swinging.

1205
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:17,745
Yeah? What do you say?

1206
01:39:19,914 --> 01:39:24,335
<i>Welcome to New York's Bing Arena</i>
<i>and the Real Steel Championship Bout.</i>

1207
01:39:24,502 --> 01:39:26,838
<i>Tim, it's the fight</i>
<i>we never thought we'd see.</i>

1208
01:39:27,004 --> 01:39:29,215
<i>Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion,</i>

1209
01:39:29,382 --> 01:39:32,677
<i>against the underdog, rising star Atom.</i>

1210
01:39:32,844 --> 01:39:34,679
<i>The champ's handlers</i>
<i>have agreed to fight</i>

1211
01:39:34,846 --> 01:39:37,390
<i>outside the circle</i>
<i>of well-known League bots,</i>

1212
01:39:37,557 --> 01:39:41,686
<i>and have decided to give the people</i>
<i>a true David versus Goliath spectacle.</i>

1213
01:39:41,853 --> 01:39:45,231
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1214
01:39:45,398 --> 01:39:47,066
The greatest robot boxer of all time

1215
01:39:47,233 --> 01:39:50,152
gives a shot at the belt
to a G-2 named Atom?

1216
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:54,240
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1217
01:39:54,407 --> 01:39:56,659
Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena,

1218
01:39:56,826 --> 01:39:59,829
but he has made no bones
about his disdain for this matchup.

1219
01:39:59,996 --> 01:40:02,748
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

1220
01:40:02,915 --> 01:40:05,918
Look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't
even stop to talk to the press,

1221
01:40:06,085 --> 01:40:09,255
<i>referring only to this fight</i>
<i>as an insult to his creation.</i>

1222
01:40:09,422 --> 01:40:13,217
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer,
did more than just challenge Zeus.

1223
01:40:13,384 --> 01:40:14,594
He did so publicly.

1224
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,347
The challenge went viral and created
a PR nightmare for the champ.

1225
01:40:18,514 --> 01:40:22,101
No argument there. And I think the Zeus
camp knows exactly what they're doing.

1226
01:40:22,268 --> 01:40:23,769
That they do. Come on.

1227
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:26,939
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

1228
01:40:27,106 --> 01:40:30,151
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

1229
01:40:30,318 --> 01:40:33,070
And judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

1230
01:40:47,418 --> 01:40:48,794
We can't win, can we?

1231
01:40:49,921 --> 01:40:50,963
We'll see.

1232
01:40:55,259 --> 01:40:57,470
As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

1233
01:40:57,637 --> 01:40:59,805
you can hear the surge of excitement.

1234
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:14,612
Atom has arrived
onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1235
01:41:14,779 --> 01:41:17,490
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

1236
01:41:17,657 --> 01:41:20,076
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1237
01:41:20,242 --> 01:41:22,495
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

1238
01:41:22,662 --> 01:41:25,414
and the look on
Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

1239
01:41:25,581 --> 01:41:27,792
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1240
01:41:27,959 --> 01:41:30,670
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

1241
01:41:30,836 --> 01:41:32,171
Who wants some?

1242
01:41:33,005 --> 01:41:34,590
I'll take some of that action.

1243
01:41:34,757 --> 01:41:37,969
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.

1244
01:41:39,178 --> 01:41:42,181
How's it going... partner?

1245
01:41:42,348 --> 01:41:43,808
Partner?

1246
01:41:44,266 --> 01:41:47,436
That's great. How about a hundred K?
Is that funny?

1247
01:41:47,603 --> 01:41:50,189
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

1248
01:41:50,356 --> 01:41:52,066
You carrying around
that kind of scratch?

1249
01:41:53,484 --> 01:41:55,695
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

1250
01:41:56,362 --> 01:42:00,533
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C,

1251
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:03,369
and you can bring me
my money right to my seat.

1252
01:42:03,536 --> 01:42:06,998
101, row C? Hundred K?

1253
01:42:07,707 --> 01:42:09,041
You heard me, homey.

1254
01:42:09,208 --> 01:42:10,960
- Homey?
- Right?

1255
01:42:11,127 --> 01:42:12,336
Homeboy!

1256
01:42:13,546 --> 01:42:15,923
All right. Peace out, posse.

1257
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:17,425
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1258
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,951
- Never beaten.
- It's showtime!

1259
01:42:44,118 --> 01:42:46,245
Never threatened.

1260
01:42:46,412 --> 01:42:49,582
The king of the ring,

1261
01:42:49,749 --> 01:42:51,834
the ruler of robots!

1262
01:42:53,085 --> 01:42:58,257
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

1263
01:43:24,033 --> 01:43:25,034
Oh, shit!

1264
01:43:31,582 --> 01:43:32,875
That was awesome.

1265
01:43:39,507 --> 01:43:40,674
Come on, let's go.

1266
01:43:47,473 --> 01:43:50,142
Ladies and gentlemen,

1267
01:43:50,309 --> 01:43:52,895
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

1268
01:43:53,062 --> 01:43:56,315
for the World Robot
Boxing Championship,

1269
01:43:56,482 --> 01:44:01,028
in the corner to my right,
the challenger, Atom!

1270
01:44:01,195 --> 01:44:02,321
Showboat!

1271
01:44:06,325 --> 01:44:08,786
And in the corner to my left,

1272
01:44:08,953 --> 01:44:11,956
the undeniable champion
of this universe

1273
01:44:12,123 --> 01:44:15,543
and any other universe known
or unknown,

1274
01:44:15,709 --> 01:44:20,005
the mighty Zeus!

1275
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:28,681
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready

1276
01:44:28,848 --> 01:44:33,853
for Real Steel!

1277
01:44:36,814 --> 01:44:37,982
This is what it's all about!

1278
01:44:38,149 --> 01:44:42,069
There's the starting bell
and we are underway.

1279
01:44:42,236 --> 01:44:44,113
The bots emerge from their corners.

1280
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:48,075
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.

1281
01:44:48,242 --> 01:44:49,368
On your feet!

1282
01:44:49,535 --> 01:44:52,079
Looks like we are in
for another Zeus clinic.

1283
01:44:54,498 --> 01:44:56,917
Referee Matt Geiger
coming in the ring to start the count.

1284
01:44:58,043 --> 01:44:59,086
Get up!

1285
01:45:00,671 --> 01:45:02,882
Push up! Stand up!

1286
01:45:03,966 --> 01:45:06,427
But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

1287
01:45:06,594 --> 01:45:09,180
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus!

1288
01:45:09,346 --> 01:45:12,266
Atom is down for the second time
in less than ten seconds.

1289
01:45:12,433 --> 01:45:16,395
- He's too strong!
- That's my boy right there!

1290
01:45:18,397 --> 01:45:20,065
Get up and get in the game!

1291
01:45:20,232 --> 01:45:23,235
Come on! No, please Atom, get up!
Please!

1292
01:45:23,402 --> 01:45:26,030
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1293
01:45:27,573 --> 01:45:31,076
Once again,
the challenger finds his feet!

1294
01:45:31,577 --> 01:45:32,578
Lean back!

1295
01:45:32,745 --> 01:45:35,080
Atom's getting pummelled into the corner!

1296
01:45:35,247 --> 01:45:37,416
- Get out of there!
- Move!

1297
01:45:39,793 --> 01:45:41,837
A demolishing inside shot.

1298
01:45:42,004 --> 01:45:43,130
Get your hands up!

1299
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,592
Hands up!

1300
01:45:47,593 --> 01:45:49,094
Crush that little can!

1301
01:45:49,261 --> 01:45:50,596
Get out of the corner!

1302
01:45:50,763 --> 01:45:54,099
Kenton desperately trying to command
his robot out of that suicide corner.

1303
01:45:59,021 --> 01:46:00,105
Get your feet under you!

1304
01:46:01,732 --> 01:46:03,776
Good night, sparring bot!

1305
01:46:03,943 --> 01:46:06,528
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again!

1306
01:46:06,695 --> 01:46:10,115
Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

1307
01:46:10,282 --> 01:46:12,451
- Stand up!
- Two!

1308
01:46:12,618 --> 01:46:14,036
Three!

1309
01:46:14,203 --> 01:46:15,371
Atom, get up!

1310
01:46:15,537 --> 01:46:17,623
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

1311
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:21,043
- Six! Seven!
- Get up!

1312
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:23,045
Eight! Nine!

1313
01:46:24,129 --> 01:46:28,509
I don't believe this! Against all odds,
this little bot is on his feet again.

1314
01:46:29,802 --> 01:46:30,844
Come on, Atom!

1315
01:46:34,056 --> 01:46:35,224
He can't survive this!

1316
01:46:39,019 --> 01:46:41,272
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!

1317
01:46:42,564 --> 01:46:45,317
Atom has landed a punch!

1318
01:46:45,484 --> 01:46:50,489
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from
an uppercut that he never saw coming!

1319
01:46:50,656 --> 01:46:52,157
Advance!

1320
01:46:52,324 --> 01:46:53,659
Fade back, counter right!

1321
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:55,577
Fade back, counter right!

1322
01:46:56,412 --> 01:47:00,833
Right cross! Right cross!
Right cross! Left hook!

1323
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,877
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!

1324
01:47:04,503 --> 01:47:06,547
For the first time in his dominant run,

1325
01:47:06,714 --> 01:47:10,509
Zeus has met a bot
who simply won't back down!

1326
01:47:12,344 --> 01:47:15,097
The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got

1327
01:47:15,264 --> 01:47:18,183
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one!

1328
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:22,313
Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists!

1329
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:25,399
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down!

1330
01:47:25,566 --> 01:47:28,610
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!

1331
01:47:32,323 --> 01:47:37,369
Only five seconds left, as here comes
that piston-packed right of the champ!

1332
01:47:38,787 --> 01:47:43,000
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

1333
01:47:43,167 --> 01:47:48,213
We will have a second round.
And the crowd here is thrilled!

1334
01:47:51,383 --> 01:47:54,470
He made it! Yeah! Corner!

1335
01:47:56,096 --> 01:47:59,892
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here now!

1336
01:48:02,686 --> 01:48:04,980
We got to go this way. Come on!

1337
01:48:10,486 --> 01:48:11,820
OK, you sit down.

1338
01:48:15,074 --> 01:48:17,659
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

1339
01:48:17,826 --> 01:48:19,370
I'll be back for you, baby.

1340
01:48:20,329 --> 01:48:22,498
Get your hands off me!

1341
01:48:25,042 --> 01:48:27,920
Both corners furiously working
on their bots.

1342
01:48:28,087 --> 01:48:31,423
This crowd came here tonight
expecting a massacre,

1343
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:33,592
but instead they're getting a war!

1344
01:48:33,759 --> 01:48:35,094
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1345
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:36,261
All right. Here we go.

1346
01:48:36,428 --> 01:48:38,514
What is happening?

1347
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:43,644
He is fully prepared for all possible
contingencies. He will be fine.

1348
01:48:43,811 --> 01:48:45,145
What next?

1349
01:48:46,063 --> 01:48:47,398
Round two.

1350
01:48:55,572 --> 01:48:58,867
Round two kicks off,
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,

1351
01:48:59,034 --> 01:49:01,036
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1352
01:49:02,788 --> 01:49:06,458
Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can!

1353
01:49:10,254 --> 01:49:15,175
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta
of straight rights to the champ's dome!

1354
01:49:20,305 --> 01:49:24,268
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows!

1355
01:49:27,354 --> 01:49:31,024
Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed!

1356
01:49:33,861 --> 01:49:37,281
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

1357
01:49:37,448 --> 01:49:39,658
This is a brawl!

1358
01:49:42,411 --> 01:49:47,291
The crowd is on their feet, watching two
machines driven to kill each other!

1359
01:49:47,458 --> 01:49:50,002
Something has to give, and it does!

1360
01:49:50,169 --> 01:49:51,962
Atom goes down again!

1361
01:49:52,129 --> 01:49:56,216
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put
on a heck of a show here tonight!

1362
01:49:58,385 --> 01:50:00,929
And yet again, Atom rises up.

1363
01:50:01,096 --> 01:50:05,559
Kenton must have hardwired
this bot with the will to go on!

1364
01:50:12,024 --> 01:50:17,029
Midway through round four, and Zeus
is looking to end this thing right now.

1365
01:50:17,196 --> 01:50:21,533
The champ is holding nothing back
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1366
01:50:31,710 --> 01:50:35,547
Atom is stumbling around the ring,
apparently disoriented and dazed!

1367
01:50:35,714 --> 01:50:37,174
- Hands up!
- What's going on?

1368
01:50:37,341 --> 01:50:40,219
I think the voice recog is shot!
He's not responding!

1369
01:50:43,555 --> 01:50:48,227
Zeus has found yet another gear of
violence, drilling Atom's midsection.

1370
01:50:48,393 --> 01:50:51,563
No! Stop! Do something!

1371
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:52,731
He can't hear me!

1372
01:50:54,233 --> 01:50:59,738
But the bell sounds, and once again
this little robot has stunned the world!

1373
01:51:01,907 --> 01:51:06,370
We're done, Max! He can't hear me.
This is murder. We've had enough.

1374
01:51:06,537 --> 01:51:08,914
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- He can't hear me!

1375
01:51:09,081 --> 01:51:11,458
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?

1376
01:51:12,876 --> 01:51:15,671
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

1377
01:51:15,837 --> 01:51:18,257
Without the voice recognition,
he'll move even faster!

1378
01:51:18,423 --> 01:51:19,591
No way. No way!

1379
01:51:19,758 --> 01:51:21,677
Look at them. They are freaking out!

1380
01:51:22,344 --> 01:51:24,429
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there!

1381
01:51:24,596 --> 01:51:26,598
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

1382
01:51:26,765 --> 01:51:28,934
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

1383
01:51:29,101 --> 01:51:30,894
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

1384
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:33,772
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1385
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:38,485
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

1386
01:51:38,652 --> 01:51:40,112
Don't ask me. Don't.

1387
01:51:40,279 --> 01:51:44,700
Charlie... please. I beg you.

1388
01:51:53,542 --> 01:51:54,876
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1389
01:51:56,795 --> 01:51:58,297
Damn it!

1390
01:51:58,463 --> 01:51:59,506
Yes!

1391
01:52:00,257 --> 01:52:01,800
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1392
01:52:02,884 --> 01:52:05,304
I know you're in there! I'm not sure
if you're getting this or what,

1393
01:52:05,470 --> 01:52:06,722
but I know you're in there!

1394
01:52:06,888 --> 01:52:09,182
- Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

1395
01:52:12,769 --> 01:52:17,441
I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me!

1396
01:52:17,608 --> 01:52:20,152
Watch... me.

1397
01:52:20,319 --> 01:52:23,822
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

1398
01:52:24,990 --> 01:52:26,700
Watch me.

1399
01:52:27,034 --> 01:52:28,994
An epic battle being waged here tonight,

1400
01:52:29,161 --> 01:52:31,246
as the fifth and final round
gets underway.

1401
01:52:31,413 --> 01:52:32,956
Come on, Atom!

1402
01:52:42,591 --> 01:52:44,843
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?

1403
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:48,096
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing
just outside the ring!

1404
01:52:48,263 --> 01:52:50,515
It looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

1405
01:52:50,682 --> 01:52:53,435
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

1406
01:52:53,602 --> 01:52:56,396
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

1407
01:52:56,563 --> 01:53:01,026
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom
is backed up against the ropes again.

1408
01:53:03,111 --> 01:53:04,946
Help him! Fight back!

1409
01:53:05,113 --> 01:53:06,198
Not yet.

1410
01:53:09,743 --> 01:53:13,622
Tak Mashido supervising personally
as Zeus hammers down,

1411
01:53:13,789 --> 01:53:16,708
furiously trying to end this thing
once and for all.

1412
01:53:17,709 --> 01:53:20,712
I got to tell you, folks,
the champ looks tired.

1413
01:53:20,879 --> 01:53:23,173
This robot seems to be running on empty.

1414
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:29,388
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

1415
01:53:29,554 --> 01:53:33,058
- Switch to turbo!
- He's actually asking for more.

1416
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:36,645
Please do something!

1417
01:53:36,812 --> 01:53:39,064
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1418
01:53:41,858 --> 01:53:43,235
Nitrous pistons, now!

1419
01:53:46,446 --> 01:53:48,407
He's not going to last much longer!

1420
01:53:48,573 --> 01:53:50,409
- Fight back!
- Not yet.

1421
01:53:51,159 --> 01:53:52,452
Hang in there!

1422
01:53:52,619 --> 01:53:57,916
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fuelled
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1423
01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:02,921
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

1424
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:08,468
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!

1425
01:54:11,054 --> 01:54:13,098
Zeus is slowing down!

1426
01:54:13,265 --> 01:54:16,101
The champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

1427
01:54:16,268 --> 01:54:17,269
Charlie, please!

1428
01:54:19,604 --> 01:54:20,731
Hey, kid.

1429
01:54:21,606 --> 01:54:23,024
- Now.
- Now!

1430
01:54:28,447 --> 01:54:29,448
Get in there!

1431
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:34,286
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

1432
01:54:43,253 --> 01:54:44,629
Yeah! That's right!

1433
01:54:46,131 --> 01:54:47,382
Do something!

1434
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:49,301
Move!

1435
01:54:50,802 --> 01:54:53,138
Override. Switching to manual.

1436
01:54:55,223 --> 01:54:59,978
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is
manually operating his robot personally!

1437
01:55:10,614 --> 01:55:13,158
- Work the body! Get inside him!
- Get him, Atom!

1438
01:55:14,910 --> 01:55:19,498
Look at this! The champ is trying
desperately to stay on his feet,

1439
01:55:19,664 --> 01:55:24,836
but Kenton is relentless, landing
blow after blow after blow to the body!

1440
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:09,339
Left! Right! Left! Right!

1441
01:56:09,506 --> 01:56:14,636
A huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!

1442
01:56:19,307 --> 01:56:22,477
This little bot has
dug deep here tonight

1443
01:56:22,644 --> 01:56:25,272
and shown something damn near heart!

1444
01:56:25,438 --> 01:56:29,693
One, two, three,

1445
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:34,739
four, five, six, seven...

1446
01:56:34,906 --> 01:56:35,907
He's good!

1447
01:56:36,074 --> 01:56:39,411
Zeus gets to his feet,
but Kenton has Atom on him again,

1448
01:56:39,578 --> 01:56:41,246
landing punch after punch!

1449
01:56:41,413 --> 01:56:43,874
Tak Mashido and his super bot
have no answer.

1450
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:47,085
Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted!

1451
01:56:47,252 --> 01:56:50,171
It all comes down to this, folks!

1452
01:56:50,338 --> 01:56:52,173
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1453
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:55,302
- Kenton is about to drop the champ...
- No! There's the bell!

1454
01:56:56,428 --> 01:56:58,597
Zeus is saved by the bell!

1455
01:57:05,562 --> 01:57:08,356
Amazingly, we will go
to the judges' cards!

1456
01:57:22,078 --> 01:57:25,957
Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

1457
01:57:26,124 --> 01:57:28,793
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1458
01:57:32,756 --> 01:57:37,135
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.

1459
01:57:37,302 --> 01:57:42,223
Judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.

1460
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:47,020
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46,

1461
01:57:47,187 --> 01:57:52,400
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1462
01:57:52,567 --> 01:57:54,903
Zeus!

1463
01:58:02,285 --> 01:58:04,454
Farra Lemkova,

1464
01:58:04,621 --> 01:58:06,915
you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

1465
01:58:07,082 --> 01:58:10,502
Some would say that your bot
won the decision but lost the fight.

1466
01:58:11,252 --> 01:58:12,545
She looks pissed.

1467
01:58:13,213 --> 01:58:15,507
It took a little longer
than we thought,

1468
01:58:15,674 --> 01:58:18,843
but the result is as expected.

1469
01:58:20,178 --> 01:58:24,599
We won. Zeus is still undefeated.

1470
01:58:30,021 --> 01:58:33,149
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

1471
01:58:33,316 --> 01:58:34,567
your bot suffered tonight?

1472
01:58:37,654 --> 01:58:40,115
- Nothing.
- No comment.

1473
01:58:40,281 --> 01:58:41,700
Max. Where's Max?

1474
01:58:45,286 --> 01:58:46,496
There he is. Max.

1475
01:58:48,206 --> 01:58:51,710
They're already calling your bot
"the people's champion."

1476
01:58:55,130 --> 01:58:57,048
What do you say to that?

1477
01:58:58,049 --> 01:58:59,384
People's champion?

1478
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:03,388
Sounds pretty good to me.

1479
01:59:09,269 --> 01:59:11,312
Dad? Dad!

1480
01:59:15,358 --> 01:59:16,526
Dad!

1481
01:59:27,412 --> 01:59:29,080
I really want you to know...

1482
01:59:29,247 --> 01:59:31,249
No, I need you to know.

1483
01:59:33,418 --> 01:59:34,711
Don't worry.

1484
01:59:35,754 --> 01:59:37,422
Your secret's safe with me.

1485
01:59:44,471 --> 01:59:46,139
Wait here. Wait here.

1486
02:00:31,017 --> 02:00:32,644
Yes!
