WEASEL: We'll take your word for it.

997
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,606
Thank you. Yeah. Listen, we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?

998
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,976
And this is the Vanisher.

999
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,447
But...

1000
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:46,983
Vanisher!

1001
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,652
(LAUGHS)

1002
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,321
Nice! Right?

1003
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:53,657
He's not here, is he?

1004
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,325
He may be running late.

1005
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,562
My name's Rusty, but I go by Shatterstar.

1006
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:00,864
BOTH: That's good, yeah.

1007
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,932
"Rusty" is terrible. Toughie.

1008
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,835
So, uh, where are you from? The planet Mojo World.

1009
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,871
So you're an alien, I guess. Bad name.

1010
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,639
How does that, uh, help us?

1011
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:12,609
I'm basically better than you at everything.

1012
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,411
Just once, I'm gonna find a planet of people

1013
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,912
that are worse than me at everything.

1014
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,114
A whole bunch of functional idiots.

1015
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,150
I'm gonna go there, and I'm gonna be their Superman.

1016
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:21,418
Isn't that Canada?

1017
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,787

1019

DEADPOOL: What's your shtick? I'm lucky.

1020
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,894
If you're so lucky, then what are you doing here with us?

1021
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,095
DOMINO: I don't know yet.

1022
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,430
What's that supposed to mean?

1023
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:34,898
It means that I don't know yet.

1024
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,499
But there's a reason why I'm here,

1025
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,634
and I'll know when I know.

1026

Everything usually works out for me.

1027
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,970
Luck isn't a superpower.

1028
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,505
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

1029
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:43,773
Yes, it is. No, ma'am.

1030
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,008
DOMINO: Mmm-hmm. Mario No-pez.

1031
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,142
Yeah. Nacho cheese.

1032
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,444
No, it definitely is. I really...

1033
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:48,511
There's no way that it...

1034
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,046
Sorry, I was interrupting you.

1035
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,581
Sorry. No, I interrupted you. No, no, no. You can go first.

1036
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,049
Oh, I was just gonna say, "No, it isn't."

1037
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,819
I was gonna just bring it back to that yes, it is.

1038
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,554
Let's meet in the middle and say, "No, it isn't."

And last, but not least...

1044
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,765
Peter.

1045
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,635
Am I getting catfished here or...?

1046
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,471
Any powers you wanna tell us about?

1047
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,106
PETER: No.

1048
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,907
I don't have one.

1049
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:21,010
Um, I just saw the ad and thought it looked fun.

1050
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,079
You're in.

1062

These restraints are pretty...

1063
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,036
CABLE: I've got a list.

1064
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,540
We're gonna work down it.

1065
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,108
Together.

1066
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:29,279
Number one, I'm gonna bend something.

1067
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,781
Something that was not meant to bend.

1068
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:32,682
I'm gonna stop you right there

1069
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,050
because I'm not gonna make it to two.

1070
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,585
I won't even make it to one.

1071

I don't do well with pain, you know.

1072

If I stub my toe, I'm done for the day.

1073

I cried when they canceled Felicity.

1074

When I get really scared, I get nervous erections.

I have one right now.

Don't look. It'll only make it worse.

1077
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,031
I don't want you to hurt me,

1078
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,633
and I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

1079
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,870
Except for where they are.

1080
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,071
Russell's in a convoy heading southbound

1081
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,606
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

1082

The monster's with them. I wouldn't fuck with him.

DEADPOOL: You all know the plan.

1084
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:01,144
Intercept the convoy,

1085
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,246
grab the boy. But not inappropriately!

Because he's built a team. He's unstoppable.

1089

He has an ass pen. He'll stab you with it.

Watch out for this guy, Cable!

1091

He's very short, 5'11". Not like in the comics.

1092
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,963

We're no longer accepting applications

1480
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:01,083

1481
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,684
Even if we were...

1482
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:04,252
there's a wind advisory in effect until at least...

1483
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,253
We don't have a lot of time.

1484
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,389
Your friend's about to make his first kill.

1485
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:08,991
No offense, but if you know so much...

1486
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:11,927
why not travel back to when he was a baby, kill him then?

1487
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,995
Or better yet, head back a little further,

1488
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:13,862
kill baby Hitler.

1489
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:16,098
I use a device to slide through time.

1490
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,867
The longer I travel, the harder it is to control.

1491
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,403
I got two charges: one to get me here,

1492
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:22,771
one to get me home.

1493

1497
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:30,979
After that, he gets a real taste for it.

1498
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:33,815
Like 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

1499
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:35,784
So he keeps killing...

1500
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,219
and killing, and killing,

1501
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,854
and killing. (GUNS COCKING)

1502
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:42,057

I'm retrieving something from my utility bag.

1506

1509

I'm sorry.

1511

No, I'm sorry that you said that...

1515
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:15,357
But she was funny...

1516
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:18,794
and filtered her pain through the prism of humor.

1517
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:20,996
Something I could never master.

1518
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,099
It was my fault she died.

1519
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:29,337
It was my job to stop people like him.

1520
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,306
I came close a few times. (TOMORROW PLAYING)

1521

He wasn't too happy about that.

1522
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,282
He was trying to hurt me...

1523
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:42,417
and he knew exactly how to do it.

and took the only thing that made it a home.

1528

I'm sorry. Uh-huh.

No, I'm really sorry.

1531
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:12,481
But that isn't Russell.

1532
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,449
It doesn't have to be him. If you knew what I knew...

1533
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:16,451
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

1534
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,120
maybe a small learning disability...

and stop the people that took your girl, would you?

1539

Of course I fucking would!

1540

But I wouldn't kill a kid.

What? You said...

1550
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,154
once he kills someone, he gets a taste for it.

1551

If we can get to him before that happens...

1552

We're definitely naming our kid Cher!

Walk away! Just walk away!

But we're X-Force!

2136
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:36,216
Nope! We're not, there's no X-Force!

2137
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:39,519
All right, well, this has been pretty scary!

01:52:54,334 --> 01:52:56,169
Wade, is that you?

2141
01:52:58,438 --> 01:52:59,939
I guess Stryker finally
