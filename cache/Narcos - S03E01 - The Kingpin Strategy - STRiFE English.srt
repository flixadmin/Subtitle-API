00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:17,471
_

2
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,355
Thank you for being here with
us, with the groom and the bride.

3
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,276
Come and dance with us,
everyone. Let's begin.

4
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,862
As they say, here we have the
most beautiful women in Laredo.

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,114
- Congratulations, Danny.
- Thank you for coming.

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,032
Congratulations.

7
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,136
The last time I saw Danny, he was
riding a big wheel down the sidewalk.

8
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,511
It means a lot to your
tía that you're here.

9
00:00:57,514 --> 00:00:59,349
- Don Chucho.
- Luis, how are you?

10
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,714
How are you, sir?

11
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:02,477
- Javi.
- Hey, Luis.

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,522
We heard about what you did in
Colombia. We sure are proud of you.

13
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,009
- Thanks, Luis. Have a good night.
- You, too.

14
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:09,111
Hola, Paco.

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,410
Everyone in Laredo is at this thing.

16
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,743
Hey!

17
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,169
- Be right back, Pops.
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,338
- Here you go, sweetheart. You got that?
- Yummy!

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,584
Hey, Lorraine.

20
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,012
Javi. Heard you were back.

21
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,182
I mean, the whole
town's talking about it.

22
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,391
I had some time off.

23
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,145
Decided to spend it here?

24
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,022
Actually, I'm...

25
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,786
trying to quit.

26
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,031
Doing the Nicorette thing.

27
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:56,619
Look at you. A whole new man.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,293
Listen, Lorraine...

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,840
I just wanted to say I've
thought about things...

30
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,841
and I'm real sorry about all of it.

31
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,803
You waited ten years
to tell me you're sorry?

32
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,847
I know what I did.

33
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,392
I was, um...

34
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,356
It was wrong.

35
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,566
I forgave you a long time ago, Javi.

36
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,071
The truth is, I'm grateful.

37
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,032
I ended up where I'm supposed to be.

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,159
Maybe we both did.

39
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,661
If you hadn't come into my
life and disappeared from it,

40
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,289
none of that would have ever happened.

41
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,709
Can you imagine if we
were actually married?

42
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,380
- Here you go, baby.
- Thank you.

43
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,634
- Hey, Jav.
- Randy.

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,759
- How are you?
- Good.

45
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,387
Yeah, I just... I just wanted to say hi.

46
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,390
Yeah.

47
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,351
You hungry?

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,646
Oh, you are getting so big.

49
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,620
I know you didn't like it
tonight, all the attention, but...

50
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,955
folks want to pay their respects.

51
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,583
You're a hero to them.

52
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,295
I'm not a hero.

53
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,530
Will you tell me something?

54
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:03,840
What happened to you over there?

55
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,476
- Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.
- But you want to go back?

56
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,719
When you were a kid, a little guy,

57
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,720
all you wanted to do
was get out of here,

58
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,515
out into the world.

59
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,100
But you didn't like what you found.

60
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,520
A lot of people don't.

61
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,064
But don't try to change it.

62
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,402
More likely, it'll change you.

63
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,655
It was right here, wasn't it?

64
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,991
The last time we had this conversation.

65
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,454
You didn't listen to me then, either.

66
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,414
Nope.

67
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,214
So, Cali.

68
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,302
Cali.

69
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:24,054

70
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,943
Sir, here you are.

71
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,778
Thank you.

72
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,579
I'm not a hero.

73
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,498
There were some in the hunt for Escobar.

74
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,586
A lot, actually.

75
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,839
But it's tough to see
them through all the blood.

76
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,531
To kill a monster, sometimes you have
to get in bed with other monsters.

77
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:09,387
If that surprises you,
pick up a history book.

78
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,889
It's what we do.

79
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,559
The enemy of my enemy is my friend,
until he becomes my enemy again.

80
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,397
When that happens, God help them.

81
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,943
The day Pablo went down, the Cali
cartel became Public Enemy Number One.

82
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,821
And the fact that they helped us
bring him down didn't mean shit.

83
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,659
Many observers fear Colombia's
other large cartel, the Cali cartel,

84
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,994
will now simply step up
its own drug production.

85
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,913
And that's exactly what happened.

86
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,678
While the world was focused on Escobar,

87
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:42,056
Cali's operations had
grown exponentially,

88
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,395
differing from their rival
in every possible way.

89
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:49,092
Where Pablo sought the love and
protection of the masses of Medellín,

90
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,427
these guys rubbed shoulders
with Colombia's elite

91
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,311
and called themselves
"the Gentlemen of Cali."

92
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:58,441
And whereas Escobar craved the spotlight,
these guys stayed in the shadows,

93
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,687
perfecting the game,

94
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,024
building complex smuggling and
distribution networks through Mexico,

95
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:10,071
Europe, and the Far East, without
leaving so much as a fingerprint.

96
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,761
Even the people working for them didn't

97
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:13,449
know it was Cali coke they were moving.

98
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,994
It was fucking Cocaine, Incorporated.

99
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,498
And they ran it like
a Fortune 500 company.

100
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,744
So, without further ado,

101
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:24,207
meet the management
team of the Cali cartel:

102
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,442
Pacho Herrera, head of
distribution and security.

103
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:30,503
Hello.

104
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:33,923
He led a team of young psychopaths
who would do anything he asked.

105
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:36,010
Yes. What's up?

106
00:08:36,803 --> 00:08:38,803
Chepe Santacruz-Londoño.

107
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:39,806
Let's see.

108
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,559
Grew up with the Rodríguez brothers.

109
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,521
He was in charge of U.S. operations

110
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:53,110
and responsible for Cali's
crown jewel: New York City.

111
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:57,698
He actually lived there, under
an assumed name, of course.

112
00:08:58,616 --> 00:09:02,284
Cartel's number two was operations
chief: Miguel Rodríguez.

113
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:04,203
Palmira's police superintendent.

114
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,632
Didn't we just take care of him?

115
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:08,541
- I'm talking about the new one, Arango.
- How much?

116
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:10,291
- Should I put $20,000?
- No.

117
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:12,672
Put 17.

118
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,464
- Seventeen?
- Yes.

119
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,883
Miguel watched over
all the money coming in,

120
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,846
and what bribes they were paying out.

121
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:23,722
And last but not least, cartel CEO, the

122
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:26,809
man with the plan: Gilberto Rodríguez.

123
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:30,231
They called him the Chess Player,
because he was always one move ahead.

124
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,151
They were the pinnacle of trafficking
evolution. Apex drug dealers.

125
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:38,612
And being number two
allowed them to quietly grow

126
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:41,699
into the biggest cocaine
cartel in history.

127
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,868
Except now, that was over.

128
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,495
Now that the guy that occupied
our attention was gone,

129
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,624
they were number one
with a fucking bullet.

130
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:53,460
And there was no chess move
that would get them out of it.

131
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,739
But I was looking forward
to seeing them try.

132
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:59,967
Anderson! Move all
that over to the left.

133
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,721
The tables are too close together.

134
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:10,187
Are you planning on
saying anything tonight?

135
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:12,773
No.

136
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,733
I'll speak for the both of us.

137
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:18,697
- Did you talk to the North Valley people?
- Yes.

138
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:21,822
And?

139
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:24,450
They said what they
thought I wanted to hear.

140
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:27,870
But tonight, after the
announcement, we'll know the truth.

141
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:33,453
You're more superstitious than Aunt Luz.

142
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:01,654
Hey, boss.

143
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:03,197
Is everything ready?

144
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,401
Yes, sir.

145
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:08,160
It took all night,
but... it's ready, sir.

146
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:10,414
You can handle it, you're young.

147
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:18,504
We're meeting Córdova.

148
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:20,798
He wants to go over the game plan.

149
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,885
Big night tonight, right?

150
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:25,846
Lots of company.

151
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:45,030
Gentlemen. Let's start with the obvious.

152
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:47,700
Tonight is fucking important.

153
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,785
The Rodríguez brothers never...

154
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:52,664
gather members of their
organization in one place.

155
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:56,806
That simply never happens. But
tonight, they're going to do it.

156
00:11:58,295 --> 00:11:59,714
So we have to be sharp.

157
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:03,549
- Eyes in the back of the head, understood?
- Yes, sir.

158
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,593
- Jorge.
- Stay focused.

159
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:09,555
Stay on the radio. Communicate.

160
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:11,350
Tonight is his last operation.

161
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:16,854
He's leaving us to become
a fancy businessman.

162
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:18,897
Let's leave a good impression.

163
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,358
Maybe he'll hire us one day.

164
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:24,029
Let's go.

165
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:33,914
What do you think Gilberto
is going to announce tonight?

166
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,125
I think it's a move
into the Asian market.

167
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:39,793
I have no idea.

168
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:42,045
After Friday, it's not my problem.

169
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:43,591
Are you really leaving?

170
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:45,843
I promised Paola.

171
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:51,305
I promise things to my
wife every day, brother.

172
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,423
Relax, you'll find someone
else to make you look good.

173
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,895
I hope so, buddy.

174
00:12:57,897 --> 00:13:00,733
Because right now, I'm
surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

175
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:14,077
Congratulations on the promotion, sir.

176
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,537
Tell me what you do again.

177
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,375
I'm the deputy country attaché.
I'll also be your driver.

178
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:20,544
I drive myself.

179
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:25,925
You know, you're kind of a big
deal around here. Since Escobar.

180
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,511
- Katie.
- Good morning.

181
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:33,098
Sir, can I ask?

182
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:35,184
What was Escobar like?

183
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:37,186
Never met him.

184
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:42,815
Just because we'd been focused
on Escobar the past few years

185
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,692
didn't mean we were completely
ignoring the Cali godfathers.

186
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:49,029
I want updates from Duffy and Lopez
on where we're at with Cornerstone.

187
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,524
- ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:02,835
Those are our intelligence
summaries on the Cali cartel.

189
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,504
I don't want summaries.
Where's everything else?

190
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:08,465
We had agents on them the whole time.

191
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:09,635
Good agents.

192
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,556
And recently, we had gotten lucky.

193
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:17,726
You got some kind of medical condition?

194
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:21,186
Oh. No, I got one.

195
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:23,272
The latest break in
the case against Cali

196
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:26,694
came from a joint Customs-DEA
operation called Cornerstone.

197
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:32,449
And it put a lot of mid-level Cali
guys behind bars in the States.

198
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,994
And while they weren't eager to help us,

199
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:39,913
you could always count on some
poor relative in Colombia...

200
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:45,226
who would do whatever it takes to
get their brother or son back home.

201
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:46,795
Who am I speaking with?

202
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:49,339
And if that sounds harsh,
that's because it is.

203
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:51,550
This is Andres, his brother.

204
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:53,010
The DEA doesn't fuck around.

205
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:54,346
And how can I help him?

206
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:09,319
Here we go.

207
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:13,157
Hey, brother. Have a seat.

208
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:17,661
Something to drink?

209
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:24,166
You're fine, brother.
Nobody out here knows us.

210
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,001
Cali cops don't even know we're here.

211
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:28,295
Relax. You're safe here.

212
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:30,130
Lay it on him.

213
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:32,549
Let's talk about tonight's party.

214
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:35,719
We need info on the people attending.

215
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,387
Cops, politicians.

216
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:39,395
- Cops and politicians?
- Yes.

217
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:43,486
Who work for the cartel. These
people are ruining your country.

218
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,120
And the why. Tell him.

219
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:49,659
Look, the thing is, these

220
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:52,277
people never get together in one place.

221
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,072
We need to know why now.

222
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:57,950
Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez

223
00:15:57,952 --> 00:16:00,246
is making some kind of
important announcement.

224
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:02,053
Understand?

225
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,347
If no...

226
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:07,644
bye-bye, hermano.

227
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:17,179
- How are things in Texas, Agent Peña?
- Hot.

228
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:22,683
How's the family? You know, you
had a few more weeks off coming.

229
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:24,248
Could've spent more time at home.

230
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,586
Yeah, well, I guess they
couldn't wait to get rid of me.

231
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:33,360
Sir, this operation in Miami,
Cornerstone, shook some leads loose.

232
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:34,905
Could be a break on Cali.

233
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:39,535
- Anyone testifying?
- No, but it put an asset in play.

234
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,301
Could shed some light
on their next move.

235
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,920
Things won't be like
Escobar, Agent Peña.

236
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,881
It can't be. Things
have changed down here.

237
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,218
New President coming in.

238
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:59,333
Gaviria put up with things
that this guy might not.

239
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:03,643
Just take it a little slowly.

240
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:06,399
Get your feet under you,
get used to the new job.

241
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:11,734
Sir, the CIA station chief...

242
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,611
he and I have history.

243
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,570
I'm hoping it won't be
an issue moving forward.

244
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:19,573
I know you and Stechner
have your differences.

245
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:22,284
- It won't be a problem.
- I'm not sure I share your confidence.

246
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:24,371
Stechner signed off on your appointment.

247
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,124
In fact, he wanted you back.

248
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,793
The CIA and the DEA need to
work together on this one.

249
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:33,297
We have the same goal.

250
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:52,107
Come in.

251
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:58,072
Hola, brother.

252
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:01,365
We were starting to
worry. Everything cool?

253
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:04,659
We were getting
worried. Everything okay?

254
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:07,037
Yes, but... I thought
someone was tailing me.

255
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,082
- He thinks he may have been followed.
- No, yeah, I figured.

256
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,169
I had to make sure I was alone.

257
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,369
Let's get you suited up.
Run through the plan again.

258
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:17,466
Take off your shirt. Sit.

259
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:23,512
Okay.

260
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:24,471
Ready.

261
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:25,474
We're good to go.

262
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,375
Look, don't you think you

263
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,552
should fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

264
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:23,490
He's a boss.

265
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,452
We're in their territory, right?

266
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:32,956
Yes. Yes.

267
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,334
I'll fix it tonight.

268
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,336
María.

269
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,671
María.

270
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:44,801
For our children, and
our children's children.

271
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,683
That sounded great, brother.

272
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:50,807
Let me do it from the top.

273
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:55,063
No one gives a shit about your
speech. We can hear it after...

274
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,898
- Pacho!
- Chepe!

275
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,985
Come here, you crazy motherfucker.

276
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:04,279
What's up?

277
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:07,032
Look at you. How's New York?

278
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:10,954
Cold. But if you ask nicely,
the girls make up for it.

279
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,707
I brought you something, baby-face.

280
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,587
Lovely. Thanks.

281
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:24,468
It's been too long since
we were all together.

282
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:30,924
Tonight is our night,
because we've earned this.

283
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:35,018
- Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!
- Cheers!

284
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,188
I think there is business
to discuss first, Gilberto.

285
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,902
You're acting like someone
just pissed you off.

286
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:45,986
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

287
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:47,405
But I work harder than him.

288
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:48,990
Cheers, then!

289
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:49,952
To the Pope!

290
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:52,494
Cheers.

291
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:53,872
Welcome, Chepe.

292
00:20:58,168 --> 00:20:59,575
Look, Gilberto...

293
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:03,672
you know I have a personal issue

294
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:06,677
with that son of a bitch,
Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

295
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,263
And he's downstairs.

296
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,348
I would like to solve it.

297
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:15,976
Okay, Pacho.

298
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:22,107
I understand your need for revenge,
but this isn't the time to get into it.

299
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:23,527
There's too much at stake.

300
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,698
Well... shall we enjoy this
expensive party or what?

301
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,579
No. Instead, let's listen
to Gilberto's speech again.

302
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,079
Chepe, you motherfucker.

303
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:58,757
Look, that's Menga's chief of police.

304
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:02,482
I pay him money every month.

305
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:05,775
I pay all these people.

306
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:08,737
Well done, big shot.

307
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:10,155
It's not your money.

308
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:12,073
But I'm the one who controls it.

309
00:22:12,075 --> 00:22:14,659
- Who bought you these earrings?
- Guillermo. Enough.

310
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:16,747
Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.

311
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:23,045
Shit. Get out of here.

312
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:40,185
- How are you, sir?
- Pallomari.

313
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:42,105
- Enjoying the party?
- Yes.

314
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,442
Yes.

315
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:48,028
Nice to see you.

316
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:51,154
Don Gilberto, good evening.

317
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:53,742
- Welcome, Mr. Mayor.
- Don Gilberto, how are you?

318
00:22:56,078 --> 00:22:57,704
Good evening, Don Gilberto.

319
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,920
- Look, here it is.
- Motherfucker.

320
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:20,682
Hello.

321
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:22,727
- Good evening.
- Can I have aguardiente with ice?

322
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:24,856
- Of course.
- Thank you.

323
00:23:44,793 --> 00:23:45,794
Are you...

324
00:23:47,504 --> 00:23:49,212
enjoying yourself?

325
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:51,716
Yes. Very much, thank you.

326
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:01,099
Miguel Rodríguez, nice to meet you.

327
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,477
María Salazar.

328
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:04,646
Thank you for having us.

329
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:27,876
Good evening.

330
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:29,711
Mr. Rodríguez would
like for his associates

331
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:32,048
to join him in the equestrian
ring for an announcement.

332
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:33,844
Please, go right ahead.

333
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:38,219
Gentlemen, please follow the
ushers towards the stables.

334
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:39,557
Thank you.

335
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:45,562
Stop there.

336
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:48,980
You must be using
some high-end equipment

337
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:51,109
if you're getting anything
in this shitty light.

338
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,602
Who are you?

339
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,774
I'm in charge of security
for the Rodríguez brothers.

340
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:57,949
See that man over there?

341
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:00,535
His name is Navegante.

342
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,454
Guess what he does?

343
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:07,999
Either you come with
me, or you go with him.

344
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,508
You understand?

345
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:11,963
Follow me.

346
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:31,773
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

347
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:33,818
You live with your mother
in commune number 3.

348
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,405
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

349
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:41,199
Your brother is Lucho.

350
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:44,661
He's in federal custody
in the United States.

351
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:47,121
That's why you agreed
to work for the DEA.

352
00:25:47,123 --> 00:25:48,750
Don't lie to me.

353
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:51,876
Andrés, you made a bad decision.

354
00:25:51,878 --> 00:25:55,298
But I think you're smart
enough to realize that.

355
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:57,842
You have another decision to make,

356
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,846
and it's the only way to get out alive.

357
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,055
Leave Cali.

358
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:07,350
Don't say goodbye to your
mother or to your girlfriend.

359
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:09,015
I need you to disappear.

360
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:14,651
Associates.

361
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:16,778
Friends.

362
00:26:18,113 --> 00:26:19,821
Our enemy is dead!

363
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:24,411
Our business is strong!

364
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:27,745
Together we have taken this business

365
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:31,374
to heights that our predecessors
couldn't have imagined.

366
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:38,049
But friends... there's circumstances
that we need to acknowledge.

367
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:45,888
Stoddard!

368
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,890
Listen to me.

369
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:51,150
The law enforcement spotlight will shine

370
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:54,568
brightly on us, as it
once did on Escobar.

371
00:26:55,817 --> 00:26:58,901
And so, while we celebrate,

372
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:03,742
they will do everything they can
to take away everything we've built.

373
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,120
An American named Joseph Kennedy

374
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:12,540
made his fortune selling
bootlegged liquor,

375
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,876
but he turned that
money into legitimacy.

376
00:27:14,878 --> 00:27:17,128
His children, great politicians.

377
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,717
And one of them was
even elected president.

378
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:26,304
Yes, gentlemen, we have been
negotiating with the authorities,

379
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:28,139
and soon we will reach an agreement.

380
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:39,277
Our organization, within six months,
will be out of the cocaine business.

381
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:44,113
We will surrender our labs,

382
00:27:44,115 --> 00:27:46,366
our safe houses,

383
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:48,618
and our trafficking routes.

384
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,081
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake

385
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:55,541
of thinking it won't be on our terms.

386
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:58,878
Any prison sentences will be minimal.

387
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,673
Our money will remain ours.

388
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:04,594
Our legitimate businesses
will continue to grow.

389
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:09,265
We have six months to make
as much money as possible!

390
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:13,059
And gentlemen, as a
token of our friendship,

391
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:18,439
we'll give each of you a juicy share

392
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:21,444
of the final profits from this year.

393
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:31,828
To the bright future
we'll all soon enjoy.

394
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,834
For our children... and
our children's children!

395
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:40,338
- Cheers...
- Cheers!

396
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:43,297
- Cheers, gentlemen!
- Cheers!

397
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:46,428
- What did you think?
- I think it's a great move.

398
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:50,974
- Congratulations!
- For the future!

399
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:56,980
Thank you, brother.
Thank you for coming.

400
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:16,789
What would you like?

401
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,084
Whiskey. Dry.

402
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:24,507
Hey, sir!

403
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:28,885
We were wondering if we
could get you a drink.

404
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,972
I'm good. Thanks.

405
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,851
Okay.

406
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:40,231
Six months.

407
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,026
I'm going to bleed New York dry.

408
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:47,612
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty
and fuck her right up her ass.

409
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:54,913
And then what?

410
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,959
We only have six months of
doing whatever the fuck we want?

411
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:10,166
Hello.

412
00:30:14,808 --> 00:30:15,934
I love you, brother.

413
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,022
I'll see you on the dance floor.

414
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,668
- Can you get in the car, please?
- Why do you want to leave so early?

415
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,128
Because it's time, okay?

416
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,930
- Why are you treating me like this?
- Enough!

417
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:49,050
Get in the car.

418
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:17,585
How was everything tonight, Jorge?

419
00:31:18,718 --> 00:31:19,956
Very good, sir.

420
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:25,710
Do you think we surprised them?

421
00:31:25,712 --> 00:31:29,048
Yes. I think you surprised many people.

422
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:35,513
I'm told we had an uninvited
guest. What happened there?

423
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:40,935
Don't be modest.

424
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:43,146
Córdova told me.

425
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:45,857
It's your talent.

426
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:49,527
Spotting the threat, knowing
when they're going to fuck us.

427
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:52,697
It's priceless.

428
00:31:57,327 --> 00:31:59,329
I'm told you want to leave.

429
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:06,419
I'm grateful to you
and your family, but...

430
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:11,132
I'm starting my own security firm.

431
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:17,138
I only wanted to stay until...
Escobar stopped being a threat.

432
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:21,726
And we are very grateful. Honestly.

433
00:32:22,894 --> 00:32:25,770
You have done great things
for us over the years.

434
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:28,274
For my family. For me.

435
00:32:30,735 --> 00:32:33,238
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

436
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:47,792
With all due respect, I've
already made arrangements...

437
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:49,295
Arrangements can change.

438
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:55,176
Look, we didn't get where we are
by allowing good people to leave.

439
00:32:57,011 --> 00:33:00,014
We will need you more than
ever in the months ahead.

440
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:03,601
It's only six months.

441
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:08,189
Can I count on you, Jorge?

442
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:11,526
Yes?

443
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:16,990
Of course, boss.

444
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:19,158
Miguel.

445
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,597
Pretty girl.

446
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:46,185
Displays some shaky
judgment in men, though.

447
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:51,774
Welcome back, Agent Peña.

448
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:54,275
Mazel tov on the promotion.

449
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:59,113
That extra, what, 9K a year
is really gonna come in handy.

450
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:00,158
The same.

451
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:02,657
So?

452
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,785
You signed off on me
coming back to Bogotá.

453
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:06,245
Did indeed.

454
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:09,081
Because you know how things work.

455
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,044
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

456
00:34:14,047 --> 00:34:17,340
To the folks back in
D.C., Escobar was a win.

457
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:18,426
Thanks.

458
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:23,264
But down here... we know
what it cost, don't we?

459
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,043
Medellín was a failure.

460
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:27,503
Thousands of Colombians dead,

461
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:30,144
and coke still flooding
American streets by the ton.

462
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:33,900
Oh, come on. You don't care about
American streets or dead Colombians.

463
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,131
What was accomplished, Agent Peña?

464
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:46,829
We do Cali differently.

465
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:50,333
No swallowing the spider
to catch the fly this time.

466
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,169
America's got plans for Colombia.

467
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,631
Another bloodbath complicates them.

468
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,053
So...

469
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:05,181
what's the play?

470
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:08,681
Surrender.

471
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:10,226
Cali cartel throws in the towel.

472
00:35:10,228 --> 00:35:13,523
Hands over the keys to the biggest
criminal enterprise in history.

473
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:17,441
As far as I'm concerned, the
DEA can even take the credit.

474
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:19,112
And these fucking guys walk?

475
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:22,321
Negotiations are on the two-yard line,

476
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:25,410
but it has backing from Washington.

477
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:31,288
So, what the fuck do you need me for?

478
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,335
Well, you're the dashing DEA
agent that took down Escobar.

479
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:37,755
Always helps to have a hero on board.

480
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:41,551
Don't worry. Cali will serve some time.

481
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,178
Technically speaking.

482
00:35:46,222 --> 00:35:47,265
And that's enough for you?

483
00:35:48,558 --> 00:35:53,646
If there were any justice in this
world, Javier, you'd be in jail.

484
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,572
I know your guys are running
an operation on Cali tonight.

485
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,490
Please.

486
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:10,788
I can tell you this:
it'll come up double zeros.

487
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,251
These guys don't make mistakes.

488
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:19,380
You try to go after the Cali bosses,
all you'll get are more bodies.

489
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:43,696
I don't know, man.

490
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:46,655
I met him at an embassy
thing about a year ago.

491
00:36:46,657 --> 00:36:47,573
Yeah?

492
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:49,742
Couldn't drink it or fuck
it, dude wasn't interested.

493
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:55,333
I hear you. I mean, he's not a bad guy.

494
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:59,253
He was in my class at the Academy.

495
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:09,887
Kid's been gone eight hours.
He better have something good.

496
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:22,902
Fucking retard.

497
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,704
Something's up.

498
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:42,479
Maybe he got made. Or just spooked.

499
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:44,857
Either way, we stay here tonight.

500
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:46,895
- Head out when it's light.
- Yeah.

501
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,625
Does Andrés have this number?

502
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:04,378
We don't know the phone
number. How could he?

503
00:39:08,966 --> 00:39:10,009
Answer it.

504
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,472
Hello?

505
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:17,767
Hello? Who is this?

506
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:21,580
Hang up! And get away
from the fucking window!

507
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,442
They're fucking watching us.

508
00:39:28,194 --> 00:39:31,612
Turns out that break from
Cornerstone wasn't much of a break.

509
00:39:31,614 --> 00:39:34,740
Cali spent a billion
dollars a year on payoffs.

510
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:39,995
That's "billion," with a B. Which
bought eyes and ears everywhere.

511
00:39:39,997 --> 00:39:42,373
Anyone visiting Cali was
ID'd and background checked

512
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,043
before they put their bags down.

513
00:39:45,294 --> 00:39:48,295
Walk into a police
station, they know about it.

514
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:50,591
Get into a taxi, they know.

515
00:39:51,634 --> 00:39:54,051
Make a phone call, forget it.

516
00:39:54,053 --> 00:39:56,637
They basically owned the
fucking phone company.

517
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,972
Operators were told to pay
close attention to calls

518
00:39:58,974 --> 00:40:00,947
that came from places of interest,

519
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,147
like, say, the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá.

520
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:05,604
Get a call from them...

521
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:09,735
you got flagged.

522
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,028
Who am I speaking with?

523
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,073
And from that point on...

524
00:40:14,907 --> 00:40:16,117
Bye-bye, hermano.

525
00:40:17,368 --> 00:40:18,369
Understand?

526
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:21,745
They were on you.

527
00:40:21,747 --> 00:40:24,206
It was like the Soviet
Union with nice weather.

528
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:27,418
- Fuck!
- Even called it the Cali KGB.

529
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,295
- Juan.
- Here it is, sir.

530
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:31,298
Thank you.

531
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:49,316
Don Gilberto.

532
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:52,445
This just arrived.

533
00:41:00,953 --> 00:41:01,954
Put them on.

534
00:41:10,254 --> 00:41:12,588
Subject's name: Díaz.

535
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:17,134
Recorded at El Nacional Hotel. Room 117.

536
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:22,264
Retirement works for these
motherfuckers. They're rich.

537
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:24,224
I just bought a brand new plane.

538
00:41:24,226 --> 00:41:27,478
So that motherfucker Gilberto
can shove it up his ass.

539
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,733
Besides, who are they to make a
deal without consulting with us?

540
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:33,944
They don't get to
surrender on our behalf.

541
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,531
That son of a bitch, Díaz.

542
00:41:40,075 --> 00:41:41,450
I'm going to send Navegante.

543
00:41:41,452 --> 00:41:45,829
Subject's name: Santos.
Recorded in zone 4.

544
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:51,796
They're going to have to give me
more than that fucking wrapping paper.

545
00:41:52,922 --> 00:41:58,258
Fucking balls on the old goat to
tell me how to run my business.

546
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,556
That's not going to be so
easy. These men are weak.

547
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:06,225
I'll handle that one myself.

548
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:07,478
The man is an animal.

549
00:42:08,145 --> 00:42:11,104
Subject name: Beltre.

550
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:15,150
I'm not going to wait for Rasguño or
Henao to snatch the good territories.

551
00:42:15,152 --> 00:42:18,153
Let's organize so we can
put a move together now.

552
00:42:18,155 --> 00:42:21,992
Fuck Joseph Kennedy,
whoever that asshole is.

553
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:24,370
Córdova...

554
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:28,038
El Pecas will handle that one.

555
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,250
You got it, sir.

556
00:42:32,878 --> 00:42:35,381
Subject name: Salazar.

557
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:39,216
María, I'll be back soon. I'm
going out with some friends.

558
00:42:39,218 --> 00:42:42,012
What do you mean, Claudio?
You're going out now?

559
00:42:43,472 --> 00:42:46,139
Please don't look at me like that.

560
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:48,100
It's one o'clock in the morning.

561
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:50,143
Exactly, María. It's one o'clock.

562
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:53,105
Keep your voice down so
you don't wake the guests.

563
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:55,899
Fuck off, Claudio! Go with your whores!

564
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:57,568
Don't fuck with me, María, I'm tired

565
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,823
from clapping all night for
that motherfucker's bullshit.

566
00:43:02,324 --> 00:43:03,576
Don't fuck with me.

567
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:14,461
Well... that's husband
and wife business.

568
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:16,672
Leave him out.

569
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:20,134
No, brother.

570
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:25,890
Salazar shows no respect.

571
00:43:29,268 --> 00:43:30,978
Better safe than sorry.

572
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:13,479
Honey. What time is it?

573
00:44:14,313 --> 00:44:15,314
It's late.

574
00:44:16,649 --> 00:44:17,858
Go back to sleep.

575
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:20,817
How was work?

576
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,260
Fine.

577
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:27,284
I spoke with Miguel.

578
00:44:31,622 --> 00:44:32,456
And?

579
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:36,543
He asked me not to leave.

580
00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:39,213
Just for a little while.

581
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:41,298
How long?

582
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:45,926
I'm asking you how long.

583
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:48,347
- Six months.
- Six months?

584
00:44:49,932 --> 00:44:51,308
What did you tell him?

585
00:44:53,936 --> 00:44:56,522
What could I tell him? It's six months.

586
00:44:57,856 --> 00:44:59,900
We've talked about this for a long time.

587
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:02,418
You're telling me we can't start our new

588
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:04,060
lives because we have
to wait six months?

589
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:09,866
You know what? I don't think you
really want to leave this job.

590
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:12,285
- How can you say that?
- You think I'm an idiot?

591
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:13,789
You like working for them.

592
00:45:14,832 --> 00:45:16,917
It's become your life, Jorge.

593
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:20,838
You are my life. The girls are my life.

594
00:45:21,714 --> 00:45:24,172
- What do you want me to do?
- Don't say another word.

595
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:26,844
- It's six months, not six years.
- Not another word.

596
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:26,651
She owns a spa.

597
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:28,781
Let's go. We should go!

598
00:47:11,156 --> 00:47:12,364
What can I get you?

599
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:15,450
A bottle of aguardiente, and
play "Dos Gardenias" for me.

600
00:47:15,452 --> 00:47:16,703
Gladly, Don Pacho.

601
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,665
Thank you.

602
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:33,929
Please, Claudio...

603
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:39,641
accept this as a token of respect.

604
00:47:39,643 --> 00:47:42,271
To let bygones be bygones.

605
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:49,361
You know what, Pacho?

606
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:55,951
I think our differences are in the past.

607
00:48:01,665 --> 00:48:04,332
I'll be right back to share it with you.

608
00:48:04,334 --> 00:48:05,792
Excuse me.

609
00:48:05,794 --> 00:48:06,628
Please.

610
00:50:26,393 --> 00:50:30,061
- Claudito.
- And now... the bottle.

611
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:31,979
Go ahead.

612
00:50:34,192 --> 00:50:36,025
Claudito!

613
00:50:36,028 --> 00:50:38,278
- Pacho, motherfucker!
- Pacho, please.

614
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,780
Don't do this. Don't do this to me.

615
00:50:40,782 --> 00:50:42,657
Please, Pacho.

616
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:44,080
Pacho.

617
00:50:44,703 --> 00:50:47,871
Pacho, please! Pacho, wait!

618
00:50:47,873 --> 00:50:51,124
Please, let's talk. Pacho!

619
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:54,171
Motherfucker. He didn't
do anything to you.

620
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:58,548
Pacho, you motherfucker!

621
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,468
Wait, Pacho! Pacho, son of a bitch!

622
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:02,512
Pacho!

623
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,186
Please, no!

624
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:08,769
Son of a bitch!

625
00:51:10,145 --> 00:51:11,897
Pacho, son of a bitch!

626
00:51:13,732 --> 00:51:16,733
No! No, no, no!

627
00:51:16,735 --> 00:51:18,153
Son of a bitch, Pacho!

628
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:24,367
Motherfucker!

629
00:51:25,077 --> 00:51:26,119
Claudio!

630
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:41,635
When Pablo Escobar killed you, he
wanted everyone to know about it.

631
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:44,721
But the Gentlemen of Cali...

632
00:51:46,598 --> 00:51:48,315
they did that differently, too.

633
00:51:51,895 --> 00:51:54,028
They wrapped your body with chicken

634
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:56,397
wire and dumped you in the Cauca River.

635
00:51:56,399 --> 00:51:58,900
When you bloated and your body expanded,

636
00:51:58,903 --> 00:52:01,281
the wire cut you into little pieces...

637
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:03,490
for fish food.

638
00:52:04,116 --> 00:52:07,452
Not very "gentlemanly,"
but it did the trick.

639
00:52:10,622 --> 00:52:12,249
And that's all they wanted.

640
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:17,043
You and whatever your beef
with them was... vanished.

641
00:52:17,045 --> 00:52:18,586
Forever.

642
00:52:18,588 --> 00:52:21,049
No body, no crime.

643
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:23,510
No murder statistics...

644
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:25,929
no problem.

645
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:28,849
I suppose that's for the best.

646
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:33,228
It makes it easier
to look the other way.

647
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:36,356
To let them fucking slide.

648
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:41,818
To pretend that these guys weren't just

649
00:52:41,821 --> 00:52:43,721
as evil as the guy
that came before them.

650
00:52:44,614 --> 00:52:47,367
And to a country that had
seen enough of the drug war...

651
00:52:48,493 --> 00:52:50,328
maybe that worked for Colombia.

652
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:54,061
It certainly worked
for the Cali godfathers.

653
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,551
Because God forbid anyone
thinks they're the bad guys.
