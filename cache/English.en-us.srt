1
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,499
<i>It's the sense of touch.</i>

2
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,332
What?

3
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,665
<i>Any real city, you walk, you know?</i>

4
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,540
<i>You brush past people.
People bump into you.</i>

5
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,749
<i>In LA, nobody touches you.</i>

6
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,040
We're always behind this metal and glass.

7
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,249
I think we miss that touch so much

8
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,832
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,374
You guys okay?

10
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,290
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,165
<i>You don't think that's true?</i>

12
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,165
<i>Stay in your car.</i>

13
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,082
<i>Graham, I think we got rear-ended.</i>

14
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,499
<i>I think we spun around twice.</i>

15
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,165
And somewhere in there,
one of us lost our frame of reference.

16
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,540
And I'm gonna go look for it.

17
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,874
<i>- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!</i>

18
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,957
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,249
Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!

20
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,082
- She do this!
- My fault?

21
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,249
Ma'am, you really need to wait
in your vehicle.

22
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,249
- My fault?
- Stop in middle of street!

23
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,999
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,707
<i>- She blake too fast.
- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.</i>

25
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,749
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" light.
- Ma'am.

26
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,540
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

27
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,415
Maybe you see over steering wheel,
you "blake" too!

28
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,665
- Ma'am!
- Crazy Mexican.

29
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,749
I call immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

30
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,707
<i>Officer, can you please write down
in your report</i>

31
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,582
<i>how shocked I am to be hit
by an Asian driver.</i>

32
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,707
<i>- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, it's Detective...</i>

33
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,374
All right. You've got to calm down.

34
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,207
- Hey, Detective. Nice entrance.
- Fuck you.

35
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,915
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezing.

36
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:58,207
Shit. I heard it might snow.

37
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,582
- Get out of here.
- That's what I heard.

38
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,082
- You got a smoke?
- No. I quit.

39
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,207
Yeah, me, too.

40
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,040
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

41
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,499
Hey, Bob.

42
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,207
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

43
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,790
Yo, Osama!

44
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,540
Plan a jihad on your own time.
What do you want?

45
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,874
- Are you making insult at me?
- Am I making insult "at" you?

46
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,374
Is that the closest
you can come to English?

47
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,415
Yes, I speak English!
I am American citizen.

48
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,582
- Oh, God, here we go.
- I have right like you.

49
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,790
- I have right to buy gun.
- Not in my store, you don't.

50
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,165
- Andy, get him out of here now!
- Dad, go wait in the car.

51
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,249
Now. Get out!

52
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,624
You're an ignorant man!

53
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,832
Oh, yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're liberating my country

54
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:49,124
and I'm flying 747s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

55
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,165
- Get the fuck out of my store!
- No, you get the fuck!

56
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,415
- Now, come on.
- Get out!

57
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,082
No, don't touch me! He cheat me this man!

58
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,874
- Andy, now!
- Come on, let's go.

59
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,624
Okay.

60
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,874
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

61
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,415
And I am really hoping for the money.

62
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,415
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

63
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,415
Oh, we got a lot of kinds.

64
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,082
We got long colts, short colts, ball heads,

65
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,707
flat nose, hollow points, wide cutters,

66
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,040
and a dozen more that'll fit any size hole.

67
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,707
Just depends upon
how much bang you can handle.

68
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,207
I'll take the ones in the red box.

69
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,249
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

70
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,540
Did you see any white people in there

71
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,415
waiting an hour and 32 minutes
for a plate of spaghetti, huh?

72
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,165
And how many cups of coffee did we get?

73
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,790
You don't drink coffee,
and I didn't want any.

74
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,124
Man, that woman in there
poured cup after cup

75
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,915
to every single white person around us,

76
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,540
but did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

77
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,124
We didn't get any coffee
that you didn't want and I didn't order,

78
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,582
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

79
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,540
Did you notice that our waitress was black?

80
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,999
And black women
don't think in stereotypes?

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,082
You tell me something, man.

82
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,874
When was the last time you met one
who didn't think she knew everything

83
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,999
about your little, lazy ass
before you even opened your mouth, huh?

84
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,040
That waitress sized us up in two seconds.

85
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,915
We're black, and black people don't tip.
So she wasn't gonna waste her time.

86
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,207
Now, somebody like that,
nothing you can do to change their mind.

87
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,624
Yeah, well, how much did you leave?

88
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,040
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

89
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,582
What?

90
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,374
What the fuck is you laughing at, man?

91
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,332
I'm seriously starting to think
that you're jealous of Karen.

92
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,707
Hardly. I'd just like to see you
get through a meal

93
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,582
without calling her
or anyone else for that matter.

94
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,415
Okay, look, no more phone calls tonight.

95
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,249
As a matter of fact,
here, you can hold the battery.

96
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,332
Okay?

97
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,165
$10 says she calls you in the car.

98
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,957
Wait, wait, wait.
You see what that woman just did?

99
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,999
- You see that?
- Why, she's cold.

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,790
She got colder
as soon as she saw us, dawg.

101
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,582
- Oh, man, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

102
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:12,124
You couldn't find a whiter, safer
or better-lit part of this city right now.

103
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,290
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

104
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,124
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

105
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,374
and her reaction is blind fear?

106
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,249
I mean, look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed like gangbangers?

107
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,707
Huh? No. Do we look threatening? No.

108
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,707
Fact. If anybody
should be scared around here, it's us.

109
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:33,790
We're the only two black faces surrounded
by a sea of over-caffeinated white people

110
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,290
patrolled by the trigger-happy LAPD.

111
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,040
So you tell me. Why aren't we scared?

112
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,999
'Cause we got guns?

113
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,040
You could be right.

114
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,415
- Get the fuck out of the car!
- Give me the keys!

115
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,457
- Come on. Hurry up!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

116
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,582
Get down!

117
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,415
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me!

118
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,082
Motherfuck, I said don't look at me.
Turn around!

119
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,374
Move. Let's go, come on.
We're good. We're fine. Just keep moving.

120
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,832
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-ass thing
off of there right now.

121
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,415
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

122
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,540
Man's the patron saint of travelers, dawg.

123
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,249
You had a conversation with God, huh?
What did God say?

124
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,540
"Go forth, my son,

125
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,165
"and leave big slobbery suction rings
on every dashboard you find?"

126
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,540
Why the hell do you do that?

127
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,165
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

128
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,249
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

129
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,082
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the
Mercedes gets pissed, pulls a gun.

130
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,582
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

131
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,874
Wait a minute,
this Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

132
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,624
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

133
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,207
I got the Mercedes.

134
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,749
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

135
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,874
Mercedes rolls to a stop.
Driver opens the door, falls out dead.

136
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,790
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

137
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,499
He says he kept trying to drive away.

138
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,082
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

139
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,040
Shot back in self-defense.

140
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,374
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,665
Find me a witness.

142
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,874
That is a nice gun.

143
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,249
Well, the car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

144
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,874
And that's not Cindy.

145
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,415
That is a William Lewis.

146
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,415
Found it under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

147
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:50,249
Looks like Detective Conklin shot himself
the wrong nigger.

148
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,207
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

149
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,499
Thank you.

150
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,790
You don't think reporters
listen to police calls?

151
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,582
I need to talk to you for a second.

152
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,165
You just give me a minute, all right?

153
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,124
- And find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

154
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,290
Yes, honey?

155
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,249
I want the locks changed again
in the morning.

156
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,332
You want...

157
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,082
Look, why don't you just go lie down, huh?
Have you checked on James?

158
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,707
Well, of course I've checked on James.

159
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,624
I've checked on him every five minutes
since we've been home.

160
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,457
- Do not patronize me.
- I'm...

161
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,082
I want the locks changed again
in the morning.

162
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,957
It's okay. Just go to bed.

163
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,332
You know what, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

164
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,124
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.

165
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,999
Is okay I go home now?

166
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,832
It's fine.
Thank you very much for staying, Maria.

167
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,999
You're welcome. No problem.

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,249
- Good night, Miss Jean.
- Good night.

169
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,040
We'll see you tomorrow.

170
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,415
I would like the locks changed again
in the morning.

171
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,165
And you know what?
You might mention that we'd appreciate it

172
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,999
if next time
they didn't send a gang member.

173
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,332
- A gang member?
- Yes, yes.

174
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,749
- What, you mean that kid in there?
- Yes.

175
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,082
The guy in there with the shaved head, the
pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

176
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,207
Those are not prison tattoos.

177
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,082
Oh, really?
And he's not gonna go sell our key

178
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,332
to one of his gangbanger friends
the moment he is out our door?

179
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,665
We've had a really tough night.

180
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,874
I think it'd be best
if you just went upstairs right now...

181
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,457
And, what? Wait for them to break in?

182
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,582
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

183
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,874
You lower your voice!

184
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,749
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

185
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,749
But if a white person
sees two black men walking towards her,

186
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,249
and she turns and walks in the
other direction, she's a racist, right?

187
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,665
Well, I got scared and
I didn't say anything.

188
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,582
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

189
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,749
Now, I am telling you.

190
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,665
Your amigo in there is gonna sell our key
to one of his homies.

191
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:54,165
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

192
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,874
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

193
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,915
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

194
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,624
I'm the goddamn District Attorney
of Los Angeles.

195
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,457
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

196
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,124
Fuck!

197
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,457
Why did these guys have to be black?
I mean, why?

198
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,874
No matter how we spin this thing,

199
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,957
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

200
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,540
You know, I think you're worrying
too much.

201
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,207
You have a lot of support
in the black community.

202
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,290
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

203
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,707
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

204
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,499
Bruce?

205
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,207
The firefighter.
The one who saved the camp or something.

206
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,874
Northridge. What's his name?

207
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,207
He's Iraql.

208
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,415
He's Iraql?

209
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,707
Well, he looks black.

210
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,040
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraql.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

211
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,707
Saddam? His name's Saddam?

212
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,374
Well, that's real good, Bruce.

213
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,749
Yeah, I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraql named Saddam.

214
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,415
Give yourself a raise, will you?

215
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,374
It's been good doing business with you.

216
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,415
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

217
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,957
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

218
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,499
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

219
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,082
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to
the clinic three times in the last month.

220
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,082
He is being treated
for a urinary tract infection.

221
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,499
<i>That is by no means an emergency.</i>

222
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,082
Now, if you have any more questions
about your HMO plan,

223
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,124
why don't you make an appointment
to come in between 10:00 and 4:00,

224
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,415
Monday through Friday?

225
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,582
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

226
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,540
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

227
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,332
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor.

228
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,040
- Yeah, what is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

229
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,415
Shaniqua. Big fucking surprise that is.

230
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,457
Oh...

231
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,874
<i>1005 Bronson Avenue, Westwood.</i>

232
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,915
<i>Vehicle described as a black,
late-model Lincoln Navigator.</i>

233
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:35,290
<i>California plates, 4 Peter Charles Ida 315.</i>

234
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,374
<i>Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.</i>

235
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,332
That's not it.

236
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,874
That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

237
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,374
The driver's gotta be 40, and nobody
jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.

238
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,957
They were doing something.

239
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,332
Enthusiastic.

240
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,707
Keep your hands
where I can see them, please.

241
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,582
I'm gonna need to see your driver's license
and registration.

242
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,332
No problem. I'm gonna have to

243
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,332
reach inside of the glove compartment
to get the registration.

244
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,707
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

245
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,790
Okay.

246
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,540
How are you tonight, Officer?

247
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,790
Excellent.

248
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,832
Here you go.

249
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,207
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

250
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,790
Let's do it again right now.

251
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,040
Step out of the car, please, sir.

252
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,915
Wait, wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

253
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,582
Then we shouldn't have a problem.

254
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,582
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

255
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,165
No, it's okay.

256
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,999
It's fine.

257
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,290
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

258
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,874
That's good. Right there.

259
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,915
Look at me.

260
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,624
I want you to stand on your right foot.

261
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,957
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your left hand.

262
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,082
I told you he doesn't drink.

263
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,582
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you one time
to stay in the vehicle.

264
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,082
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

265
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,374
Don't you "ma'am" me.

266
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,415
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

267
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,582
Look, Officer,
my wife has had a couple of drinks...

268
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,082
All right, both of you turn around.

269
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,999
Put your hands on top of your head
and interlock your fingers.

270
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,165
No, wait. Wait a minute.
We're only a block away from our house.

271
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,415
Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.

272
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,915
- That's not even necessary.
- Hands on your head.

273
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,957
Interlock your fingers.

274
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,832
Look, I'm a television director.

275
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,374
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

276
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,665
Get your hands off him.
He has done nothing wrong.

277
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,415
Put your hands
on top of your head, ma'am.

278
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,374
- Will you just do what he says?
- Fuck you!

279
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,165
Put your hands
on top of your head, ma'am.

280
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,290
And you keep
your filthy fucking hands off me!

281
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,499
- You motherfucking pig!
- Christine, just stop talking.

282
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,957
That's quite a mouth you have.

283
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,040
Of course you know that.

284
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,790
Fuck you!
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

285
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,249
You thought you saw
a white woman blowing a black man,

286
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,957
and that just
drove your little cracker ass crazy.

287
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,915
Will you just shut your fucking mouth?

288
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,332
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

289
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,499
Put your legs open.

290
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,665
Now, do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

291
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,374
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

292
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,999
You'd be surprised some of the places
I've found weapons.

293
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,374
He's clean.

294
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,374
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

295
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,290
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

296
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,999
while you were operating a motor vehicle.

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,790
That's reckless endangerment,
which, incidentally, is a felony.

298
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,540
Now we can charge your wife here

299
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,957
with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

300
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,707
Now you say you're a block from home.

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,957
Now, we could use our discretion

302
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,332
and let you go with a warning,

303
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,040
or we can cuff you
and put you in the back of the car.

304
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,707
What do you think we should do, sir?

305
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,374
Look, we're sorry,

306
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:24,707
and we would appreciate if you would
just let us go with a warning, please.

307
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,040
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

308
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,374
I think we can let him go. Don't you?

309
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,165
Yeah.

310
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,957
All right.

311
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,999
You can go.

312
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,124
You folks drive safe now, huh?

313
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,832
Let's go, Tommy.

314
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,665
It won't close.

315
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,124
I can do that.

316
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,082
Dad, you couldn't even get it open.

317
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,582
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun.

318
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:54,540
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

319
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,415
Dorri, that man could've
killed your mother.

320
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:00,790
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

321
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,915
Farhad, it won't close.

322
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,540
Dorri, you should be at work.

323
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,582
Who are you calling?

324
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,457
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

325
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,165
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

326
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:34,290
Do you have any idea how that felt?
To have that pig's hands all over me?

327
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,207
And you just stood there.

328
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,082
And then you apologized to him?

329
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,249
I mean, what did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

330
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,957
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard? Pathetic.

331
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,540
Yeah, well, maybe you would've
been satisfied with just being arrested.

332
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:54,749
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

333
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,915
than get your name in the paper.

334
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,415
You know, you finally got me figured out,

335
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:02,582
'cause see, that's exactly
what I was worried about, right there.

336
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,874
Oh, and it wasn't? You weren't afraid
that all your good friends at the studio

337
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,082
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize that,

338
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,165
you know what, he's actually black?

339
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,207
You need to calm down right now.

340
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,790
No, what I need is a husband
who will not just stand there

341
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,415
while I am being molested!

342
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,874
I mean, they were cops, for God's sakes!
They had guns!

343
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,915
You know what?
Maybe I should've let them arrest your ass.

344
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:30,582
I mean, sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

345
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,790
Fuck you, man. Like you know.

346
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:36,415
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.

347
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:39,832
Yeah, well, at least I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

348
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,082
Yeah, you're right, Cameron.

349
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,624
I got a lot to learn 'cause I haven't
quite learned how to shuck and jive.

350
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:48,207
Let me hear it again.
"Thank you, Mr. Policeman.

351
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,749
"You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

352
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,624
"You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife."

353
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,707
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

354
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,624
You know, fuck you!

355
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:07,457
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

356
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,707
- How's it going?
- Okay.

357
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:03,082
You didn't get scared or something,
did you?

358
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,374
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

359
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:09,790
- There's no such thing as monsters.
- Oh, that's a good thing.

360
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,540
I heard a bang.

361
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,457
Like a truck bang?

362
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,374
Like a gun.

363
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:27,082
That's funny, because we moved out
of that bad neighborhood.

364
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,999
And there's not too many guns
around here.

365
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,540
How far can bullets go?

366
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,749
They go pretty far.

367
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,124
But they usually get stuck in something
and stop.

368
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,832
What if they don't?

369
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:45,207
You thinking about that bullet
that came through your window?

370
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,374
Because we never did find it, did we?

371
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,624
I think it didn't see me
'cause I was under the covers.

372
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:59,040
And you think it was that same bullet
that you heard tonight?

373
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,582
- You think we should move again?
- I like it here.

374
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,582
Me, too. But if that bullet found out
where we lived...

375
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,832
Oh, hold on.

376
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:11,999
What?

377
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,749
So stupid! How can I forget?

378
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:16,457
What?

379
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,457
No, forget it. You ain't gonna believe me.

380
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:21,665
Tell me.

381
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:23,915
Okay.

382
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:29,124
When I was five,
this fairy came into my room one night.

383
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,249
Right.

384
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,374
See, I told you
you weren't gonna believe me.

385
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:35,249
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

386
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,540
Okay.

387
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:43,374
So this fairy comes into my room and
I'm like, "Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

388
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,249
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

389
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,915
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

390
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,457
She was flying?

391
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:54,874
Yeah, but she had these little stubby
wings. She could've glued them on, you know?

392
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,582
Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.

393
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,624
So she said, "I'll prove it."

394
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:02,040
So she reaches into her backpack,

395
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,540
and she pulls out this invisible cloak.

396
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:08,415
She ties it around my neck,
and she tells me that it's impenetrable.

397
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,249
You know what "impenetrable" means?

398
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,957
It means that nothing can go through it.

399
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,707
No bullets. Nothing.

400
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:19,499
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

401
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,124
So I did.

402
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:25,582
And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed. Nothing.

403
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,999
I mean, how weird is that?

404
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,874
Only she told me
that I was supposed to give it

405
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,457
to my daughter on her fifth birthday
and I forgot.

406
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:35,832
Can I touch it?

407
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,832
Sure, go ahead.

408
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,624
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

409
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,624
If you want I can take it off
and tie it around your shoulders.

410
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,624
She told me how to do it.

411
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,957
Unless you think it's stupid then...

412
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,874
- Don't you need it?
- No, not anymore.

413
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,707
So what do you think? You want it?

414
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,707
Okay, let's get out of here.

415
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,624
Okay.

416
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:27,332
Hold your chin up.

417
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,874
Okay. Is that too tight?

418
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,374
Do you feel anything at all?

419
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,124
Good. Then it's just right.

420
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,957
Do I take it off when I have a bath?

421
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:54,249
No, you leave it on all the time.
Until you have a daughter.

422
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,457
When she turns five,
then you give it to her.

423
00:29:58,416 --> 00:29:59,499
Okay?

424
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,332
Okay.

425
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,707
Okay.

426
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,040
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

427
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,957
No, no. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

428
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:57,749
How in the lunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

429
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,915
Listen to it, man.
"Nigger this, nigger that."

430
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:04,415
You think white people go around
calling each other honkies all day, man?

431
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:06,124
Hey, honky, how's business?

432
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,457
Going great, cracker. We're diversifying.

433
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,499
How about this, huh? How about that?
Listen to that. You like that?

434
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,040
Man's singing about lynching niggers.

435
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,249
And you think there's a difference,
don't you? Huh?

436
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,999
<i>Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger</i>

437
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,249
You got absolutely no idea
where hip-hop music comes from, do you?

438
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,499
<i>I'd shoot them dead first
but I done broke my trigger</i>

439
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,499
You see, back in the '60s
we had smart, articulate black men.

440
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,665
<i>Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head</i>

441
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,665
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

442
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:34,124
<i>Gonna string them up good</i>

443
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,624
These brothers were speaking out,
and people were listening!

444
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:37,832
<i>Then they'll be dead</i>

445
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,082
And then the FBI said,
"Oh, no, we can't have that."

446
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,124
<i>In the home of the brave
and the land of the free</i>

447
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:45,707
"I know, let's give the niggers this music
by a bunch of mumbling idiots

448
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,415
"and sooner or later, they'll all copy it,

449
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:50,165
"and nobody will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

450
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,374
"End of problem."

451
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,290
What the fuck was that, dawg?

452
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,415
Holy shit!

453
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:19,540
- What?
- Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

454
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,082
You're saying there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

455
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,499
What part don't you understand?

456
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,624
There's a Chinaman
stuck underneath the fucking truck.

457
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,707
Help me.

458
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,790
Oh, God.

459
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,874
What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

460
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,082
Man, this is so completely fucked up.

461
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,457
Oh, really? No shit!

462
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,874
Okay, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

463
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,290
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

464
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:49,082
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

465
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,915
No, no we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

466
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,249
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.
You know why?

467
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,374
Because he's stuck underneath
the fucking truck!

468
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,624
Now, if he could've let go,

469
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:01,915
he probably would've considered
that option about a half a block back.

470
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,624
Now, what you and I gotta do,

471
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,707
just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

472
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,540
You grab his arm, it's gonna fall off.

473
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:10,957
Then you gonna be standing in the middle
of the street holding a Chinaman's arm.

474
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,749
Then what your ass gonna do, huh?

475
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,957
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

476
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,207
Now just grab his arm.
Why not just pull him out?

477
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,874
I don't wanna
cause any problems, Lieutenant.

478
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,415
I just want a new partner.

479
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:31,874
I understand. Your
partner's a racist prick.

480
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,207
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

481
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,374
Well, he's been on
the force for a long time.

482
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:39,624
- Seventeen years.
- And I do have to work here, sir.

483
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,915
So you don't mind
that there's a racist prick on the force.

484
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:45,915
You just don't want
him to ride in your car.

485
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:48,790
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

486
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:51,374
That'd be great. Write a full report.

487
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,915
Because I'm anxious to understand
how an obvious bigot

488
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,749
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years,

489
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,249
11 of which he was under
my personal supervision,

490
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,999
which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

491
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,290
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

492
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,124
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

493
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,957
So now you're saying
he's not a racist prick,

494
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,874
you just don't like him.

495
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:16,207
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

496
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:19,374
Well, then, I guess I should think
of a better one and get back to you.

497
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,749
So you think
I'm asking you to make one up.

498
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:25,540
No, sir. I just can't
think of one right now.

499
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,540
You wanna know what I heard?

500
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,540
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

501
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:36,040
- You want me to say he has flatulence?
- Not him. You.

502
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,624
You have uncontrollable flatulence.

503
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,457
You're too embarrassed
to ride with anybody else,

504
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,124
so you're requesting a one-man car.

505
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:44,124
I'm not... comfortable
with that, Lieutenant.

506
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,582
I wouldn't be either.

507
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,582
Which is why I understand
your need for privacy.

508
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:51,082
Just like I'm sure you understand
how hard a black man has to work to get to,

509
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:54,790
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the LAPD

510
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:57,124
and how easily that can be taken away.

511
00:34:57,125 --> 00:35:00,165
Now, that being said, it's your decision.

512
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:04,665
You can put your career and mine
on the line in pursuit of a just cause,

513
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:08,624
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

514
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,040
of a personal nature.

515
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,040
Fuck.

516
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:48,874
Excuse me.

517
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:51,415
Excuse me. Sir?

518
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:55,124
- You finished?
- I replaced the lock.

519
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,499
But you got a real problem with that door.

520
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,415
- You fix the lock?
- No, I replaced the lock.

521
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:05,707
- But you gotta fix that door.
- Just fix the lock.

522
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,874
Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.

523
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,832
What you need is a new door.

524
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,332
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

525
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:16,332
Okay. How much?

526
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,415
I don't...

527
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:21,124
Sir, you're gonna have to call somebody
that sells doors.

528
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,874
You try to cheat me, right, huh?
You have a friend that fix door?

529
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,874
No, I don't have a
friend that fix doors, bro.

530
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:29,790
Then go and fix the fucking lock,
you cheater.

531
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:32,040
You... You know what?

532
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:35,290
Why don't you just pay for the lock,
and I won't charge you for the time.

533
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,540
You don't fix the lock! I pay?
What, you think I'm stupid?

534
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:41,207
You fix the fucking lock, you cheater!

535
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:43,249
Hey, I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop calling me names.

536
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,915
- Then fix the fucking lock!
- I replaced the lock!

537
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:50,082
- You gotta fix the fucking door!
- You cheat! You fucking cheater!

538
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,082
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

539
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:56,790
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

540
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:59,915
Wait! You come back here! You fix the lock!

541
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:03,582
Come here! You fix my lock!
Fix the fucking lock!

542
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,874
No, I understand.

543
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,749
You run over a Chinaman,
stuff him in the back,

544
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,749
then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

545
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,582
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

546
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,207
Georgie, burn this thing.

547
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:24,582
Burn it? It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

548
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,915
You watch the Discovery Channel?

549
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,999
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

550
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,707
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a little blue light

551
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:38,165
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

552
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:42,582
bathroom fixtures and special-edition
plastic Burger King tray cups.

553
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:46,415
Then the next thing they show
is some stupid redneck in handcuffs

554
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:50,082
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

555
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:53,957
Sometimes the redneck
is actually watching the Discovery Channel

556
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:55,915
when they break in to arrest him.

557
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:59,999
And he still can't figure out
how on earth they could've caught him!

558
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:12,249
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

559
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,082
- No.
- Then get the fuck out of my shop.

560
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,499
Oh, yeah, make sure you get that.

561
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,624
Without him, things could've gone
really fucking wrong tonight.

562
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,707
- Fuck! This could be a...
- Graham, don't! Don't! Don't you dare.

563
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,790
Don't.

564
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,249
Graham Waters.

565
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:39,249
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

566
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,249
- It's your mother?
- Yeah.

567
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,874
I'm not gonna go looking for him.

568
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:48,040
Look, he'll be home when he...
Just leave it alone, Mom.

569
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:51,415
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

570
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,582
Okay, where were we?

571
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,665
I was white, and you were about
to jerk off in the shower.

572
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,874
Oh, shit.

573
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,124
Come on.

574
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,915
I would've said you were Mexican,

575
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:07,415
but I don't think
it would've pissed her off as much.

576
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,540
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

577
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,540
What, you start to feel something
and panic?

578
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,082
Come on, Ria.

579
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,415
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

580
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,499
That's just where I begin to get pissed.

581
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,499
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way, huh?

582
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,124
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

583
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:31,832
I know if I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

584
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,415
Okay. I was raised badly.

585
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:38,082
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back in the bed and teach me a lesson?

586
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,415
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.

587
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,415
How about a geography lesson?

588
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:46,249
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

589
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,040
Neither one of those is Mexico.

590
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,290
Well, then I guess the big mystery is

591
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:55,415
who gathered all those
remarkably different cultures together

592
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:58,415
and taught them all
how to park their cars on their lawns?

593
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,207
Pop, you okay?

594
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:31,374
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

595
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,707
I'm... Jesus.

596
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,790
I'm done now.

597
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,624
Give me a hand.

598
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,374
Wait a goddamn minute.

599
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:48,207
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

600
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,457
- All right. Okay. Okay.
- Okay. There you go.

601
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,040
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.

602
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:05,540
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

603
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,457
What, are you gonna stand there
and stare at me?

604
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:33,415
So Conklin just shot him?

605
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,249
- They know each other?
- Sir.

606
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,165
- This a grudge thing?
- Not as far as we can tell.

607
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,874
You think this is racially motivated?

608
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:45,249
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

609
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,915
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

610
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:51,207
Waters. All right, well, tell him
that he speaks to no one but me.

611
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:54,582
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

612
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,457
And would someone please find Flanagan?

613
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,374
- Oh, what up, Mo Phat?
- What's up?

614
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,999
Man robs purses from old ladies
and you all,

615
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,124
"Hey, how's it going, Mo Phat?"

616
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,915
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

617
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:12,082
You calling him a thief? And we do what?

618
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,040
The man steals from black people.

619
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:16,332
Only reason black people
steal from their own

620
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,207
is 'cause they terrified of white people.

621
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:19,665
Oh, man, please.

622
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:23,249
Think about it.
Sherman Oaks. Burbank. Santa Monica.

623
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,790
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

624
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:28,332
Now, drop Mo Phat off
at a Starbucks in Toluca Lake,

625
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:32,332
that nigger will run like a rabbit
soon as somebody say "decaf latte."

626
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,540
What the fuck did you do to my car?

627
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:46,165
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

628
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,249
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

629
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:54,665
James wanted to take this to school,
but I don't want the kids to fight over it.

630
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:58,082
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, seora.

631
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:00,999
You know, Maria,
just once I would like to wake up

632
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,290
and find these dishes in the cabinet.

633
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,165
- Okay?
- S, seora. No problem.

634
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:10,540
I'm starting to understand now.

635
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:13,874
By your work, you're setting an example
for our neighborhood.

636
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,374
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

637
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,957
Well, yeah, you laugh, man.

638
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:23,040
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

639
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,290
What the hell do you think
you doing right now, man?

640
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,999
Waving down the bus.

641
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,624
Man, put your hand down, dawg!
Are you out of your mind?

642
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:33,749
You actually expect me to get on a bus?

643
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,082
No. I was hoping we could push your car
across town.

644
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,832
You know why? 'Cause we just
don't do stuff like that no more.

645
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:40,915
You have no idea, do you?

646
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:43,124
You have no idea
why they put them great big windows

647
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,707
on the sides of buses, do you?

648
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:47,290
- Why?
- One reason only.

649
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,999
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to riding on them.

650
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:52,957
How do you know that?

651
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:56,374
You know, you could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

652
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,374
Oh, you know,
the Kings are playing tonight.

653
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:01,874
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

654
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:03,832
I love hockey.

655
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,957
Cut! Print. Moving on.

656
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:10,082
Okay, that takes us into scene 12,
and we are in the bathroom.

657
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:13,374
Jamal, that's what I'm talking about.

658
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:14,582
Right on.

659
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:20,207
- Cam, Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred. I just wanna grab some coffee.

660
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,874
Yeah, listen,
I think we needed another take, buddy.

661
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:25,374
That looked pretty terrific, man.

662
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:29,749
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

663
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,540
What do you mean?

664
00:45:31,916 --> 00:45:33,582
Have you noticed...

665
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:35,999
I mean, this is weird
for a white guy to say,

666
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,582
but have you noticed
he's talking a lot less black lately?

667
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,915
- No, I haven't noticed that.
- Really?

668
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:47,415
Like in this scene, he was supposed to say,
"Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

669
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:49,749
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

670
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,415
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You think because of that,

671
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,832
the audience won't recognize him
as being a black man?

672
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:58,374
- Come on.
- Is there a problem, Cam?

673
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,290
- Excuse me?
- Is there a problem, Cam?

674
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:10,040
No, we don't have a problem.

675
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:13,999
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,
it's not his character.

676
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,624
Eddie's supposed to be the smart one,
not Jamal, right?

677
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,874
I mean, you're the expert here,
but to me, it rings false.

678
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:27,749
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

679
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,999
Everybody back to one, please.
Let's do it one more time.

680
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,707
Jamal...

681
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:43,290
- Morning, Carol. Who do I have?
- Hold for a minute, please.

682
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:47,040
Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,
but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.

683
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,790
Send him in.

684
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,374
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

685
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:58,582
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

686
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,374
I believe we spoke last night.

687
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:03,915
Oh, yeah. I wanted to apologize about that.

688
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:07,999
I haven't been getting too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

689
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,082
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

690
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:14,499
This doctor he's been seeing
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

691
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,624
But he's been taking this medicine
for a month now,

692
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,999
and he just keeps getting worse.

693
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,832
- And he's been back to see Dr. Robertson?
- Yeah.

694
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:24,374
- Between you and me, the man's an idiot.
- Really?

695
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,999
Well, no offense,
but the guy sees 100 patients an hour.

696
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,082
I think his nurses
are doing most of the work.

697
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:34,207
If you're unhappy, your father's welcome
to see a doctor outside the network.

698
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:38,415
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

699
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:41,665
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

700
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:45,290
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- Then what good is that gonna do?

701
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,749
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

702
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:51,290
All right. Well, you know what I can't do?

703
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,874
I can't look at you
without thinking about the five or six

704
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,499
more-qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

705
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,915
It's time for you to go.

706
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:02,207
Now, I'm saying this 'cause
I'm really hoping that I'm wrong about you.

707
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,165
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

708
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,290
someone who may have been given
a helping hand,

709
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:09,082
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

710
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:11,207
Carol, I need security in my office.

711
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:14,040
You know, you don't like me, that's fine.
I'm a prick.

712
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,415
But my father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

713
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:19,582
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

714
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:21,540
Saved enough to start his own company.

715
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:23,290
Twenty-three employees, all of them black.

716
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,290
Paid them equal wages
when no one else was doing that.

717
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:28,665
For 30 years
he worked side by side with those men,

718
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:31,124
sweeping and carrying garbage.

719
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,790
And then the city council decides

720
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:36,540
to give minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

721
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,999
And overnight, my father loses everything.

722
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,040
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything.

723
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,707
Not once does he blame your people.

724
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:49,665
I'm not asking you to help me.

725
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:54,290
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

726
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:57,165
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

727
00:48:57,166 --> 00:49:00,249
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you? Nothing.

728
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:03,290
Just a flick of your pen.

729
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,749
Your father sounds like a good man.

730
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:12,124
And if he'd come in here today,
I probably would've approved this request.

731
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:16,915
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

732
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,415
- Get him the hell out of my office.
- Prick.

733
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:28,915
Yeah, sir, I spoke to our employee,

734
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:31,374
and he told you you needed to replace
or repair the door.

735
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:33,374
He say he fix the lock.

736
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:36,415
<i>- You come here, see how fixed it is!
- You're yelling again.</i>

737
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:38,124
I am not yelling! I'm upset!

738
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,040
- Yes, I am.
- Mom, are you all right?

739
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:47,415
Stop washing. Insurance must take picture.
Okay?

740
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:50,790
- Yes.
- Look what they wrote.

741
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:54,582
- They think we're Arab.
- Please, you come see my store.

742
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:56,207
When did Persian become Arab?

743
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:59,290
I want... I want his name. Yes.

744
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,624
Oh, my God.

745
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,707
- I want his name!
- Dad.

746
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,082
- Give me his name!
- Dad.

747
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:05,540
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

748
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:06,915
Dad, did they take the gun?

749
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,415
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!
- Baba.

750
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:11,707
<i>- I'm gonna hang up now, sir.
- Don't hang up!</i>

751
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,832
Don't hang up! Shit!

752
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,957
Oh, thank God.

753
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:03,999
Mom?

754
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:08,040
Mom, it's cold. Come on.

755
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:33,040
Did you find your brother?

756
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,207
No, Mom.

757
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,457
I was doing good.

758
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:53,499
I was... I was doing real good.

759
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:58,207
- I know, Mom.
- I was doing good.

760
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:04,374
It's okay.

761
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,415
Did you find your brother?

762
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,249
No, Mom.

763
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:26,790
Tell him to come home.

764
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:31,790
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?

765
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,332
Okay, baby?

766
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,040
- Okay, Mom.
- Okay, baby.

767
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:40,749
Okay.

768
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,040
Okay.

769
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:22,290
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

770
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:28,290
Internal Affairs called.
Found something in the Mercedes.

771
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,374
That's lunch. One hour.

772
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:03,457
I tried to call.

773
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:06,249
Sounded like you were having
a bad day, huh?

774
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,290
Yeah.

775
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,040
What?

776
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:16,624
I got scared, Cam.

777
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:21,707
You know, it's not like I haven't been
pulled over before, you know?

778
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:24,165
But nothing like that.

779
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:28,290
And, yes, I was a little drunk

780
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,124
and I was mouthing off.

781
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:33,165
I'm sorry.

782
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:38,624
But when that man
was putting his hands on me...

783
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:39,915
I don't wanna talk about it.

784
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:42,749
I couldn't believe
you'd let him do that, baby.

785
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:48,165
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

786
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,624
But I was humiliated.

787
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:53,915
For you.

788
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,874
I just couldn't stand to see that man
take away your dignity.

789
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:02,457
Yeah. That's what happened.

790
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:04,374
Oh, baby, don't do this.

791
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:06,207
- No. No, you're right.
- Come on.

792
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:07,624
I ain't doing it.

793
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:09,665
You gonna walk away from me?

794
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,874
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

795
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:23,957
I understand.

796
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:25,999
Thanks.

797
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:32,874
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

798
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,040
Mr. Golzari,
you said that you called the locksmith?

799
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:43,082
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

800
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,707
They said that their man told you

801
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,499
to fix the door, and you didn't do so.

802
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:53,332
Are you saying it's his fault?

803
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:59,457
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering any of this.

804
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:08,874
No.

805
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,790
This store is all we have.

806
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,874
I really am sorry.

807
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:56,082
What time you must go to work?

808
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,707
Not until tonight.

809
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,707
Go home and sleep.

810
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,707
It's okay. It's okay. Go home and sleep.

811
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:30,915
Hey.

812
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:36,082
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

813
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:37,540
Yeah, they told me.

814
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:42,665
I just wanted to say good luck
and it was good riding with you.

815
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:44,374
You, too.

816
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:51,499
Wait till you've been on the job
a few more years.

817
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,457
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

818
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:58,374
Wait till you've been
doing it a little longer.

819
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,790
You think you know who you are?

820
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:05,457
You have no idea.

821
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:13,124
Yo, Gomez, you ready to roll, homie?

822
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:14,540
Ready, amigo.

823
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,499
Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

824
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:31,415
<i>21-L-23, picking up strange noises
from your car.</i>

825
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,999
<i>Likewise, 21-L.
Is your mike open by any chance?</i>

826
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,582
Call it in.

827
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:30,249
Ma'am? Can you hear me?

828
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:33,249
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

829
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,624
All right. Get an extinguisher,
and get that fire out.

830
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:36,707
Jesus.

831
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:42,624
Ma'am, are you hurt?

832
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:47,290
- Can you move?
- I can't breathe.

833
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:52,165
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

834
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,957
It's okay.

835
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,249
Okay. Okay.

836
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:09,874
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

837
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:17,040
- No.
- It's okay.

838
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:19,165
- Get away from me.
- It's okay.

839
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:21,749
Get away from me. Stay away from me.

840
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,457
- Not you!
- Fuck it.

841
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:26,624
- Not you!
- It's okay.

842
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:30,332
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Keep away from me!

843
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,582
Lady, I'm trying... I'm trying to help you.

844
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:35,749
Fuck you! Not you!

845
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,999
Somebody! Anybody else!

846
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,915
- Please, somebody!
- Stop moving!

847
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:41,124
Not you!

848
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:45,165
No! Get your filthy fucking hands off me!

849
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,582
- Stop moving.
- No!

850
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:48,749
Lady, I'm not gonna fucking hurt you!

851
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,290
Okay. Okay.

852
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,915
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

853
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:02,207
I'm not gonna touch you.

854
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:05,540
But there's nobody else here yet,
and that's gasoline there.

855
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:10,415
We need to get you out of here
right away. Okay?

856
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:14,207
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Okay.

857
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,124
I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

858
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,540
Yeah. Yeah.

859
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:26,332
Thanks.

860
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,540
Is anything broken?

861
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,457
I don't think so.

862
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,540
Okay. I think that's good.

863
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,540
- Are you gonna get me out?
- Yeah.

864
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,165
I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

865
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:48,874
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

866
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:56,957
Oh, fuck!

867
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,457
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

868
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:04,582
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

869
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,374
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

870
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,249
It's okay, it's okay.

871
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,790
It's okay. It's okay.
Okay, we're gonna get you out.

872
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:15,124
Everything's gonna be fine. Look at me.

873
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:17,707
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you out of here.

874
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:19,540
Everything's gonna be fine.

875
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,707
Ryan!

876
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:14,999
Pull!

877
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:31,874
It's okay.

878
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:43,665
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

879
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:47,332
All right. Here we
go. It's okay, it's okay.

880
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,957
It's all right. I got it now. I got it.

881
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:52,665
Ma'am? Ma'am, can you walk with me?

882
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:54,957
It's cool, it's cool. It's okay.

883
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:59,624
Here we go. All right, you're doing great.
You're doing great.

884
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:33,624
The DA wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

885
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:34,915
No, he didn't.

886
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:36,749
If he did his own dirty work,
none of us would have jobs.

887
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:39,165
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

888
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,749
- Thanks for coming in, Detective.
- He just pulled into the garage.

889
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:45,040
Great, great. Press conference
is in 10 minutes, so we'll make this short.

890
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:48,749
Internal Affairs says this Conklin has
two suspicious shootings on his record.

891
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,999
Both black men.
Both times he was cleared, but only just.

892
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,749
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

893
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:57,540
You know any reason
why we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?

894
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:01,999
Well, it's... It's more complicated
than we originally thought.

895
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:08,082
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

896
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:10,707
Shit!

897
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:13,707
Go down to the garage.

898
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:15,874
Tell him to stay in the car
until he hears from me.

899
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:20,082
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

900
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:22,707
Well, the car's actually registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

901
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:24,665
We haven't been able
to get in touch with her, yet.

902
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,499
Apparently, she left town this morning.

903
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,749
So it wasn't Lewis' car.

904
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,040
He may not have even known
the money was in it.

905
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:41,165
Do you really think you're gonna be able
to make that fly?

906
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,749
Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.

907
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,499
- These names ring a bell, Detective?
- Yeah, vaguely.

908
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,124
We have attorneys
for this slain police officer

909
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:54,707
camping in our offices.

910
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:57,207
We have his mother
and a half a dozen men of the cloth

911
01:07:57,208 --> 01:08:00,749
who swear that Lewis
was one of the twelve apostles of Christ.

912
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,624
We have two black city councilmen
and a congresswoman

913
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:06,332
who call on the hour, every hour,
demanding to know

914
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:08,582
what the District Attorney
intends to do about this.

915
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,415
And you want him
to walk into that press room

916
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:13,707
and tell them all
that the situation is complicated?

917
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:22,415
Give us a minute.

918
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,040
No problem.

919
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:35,082
Who knows about the money?

920
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,374
You gotta be kidding me.

921
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:39,540
There are only two people in this room.

922
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:44,999
Myself, my partner, Ferguson
and Internal Affairs.

923
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,707
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

924
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:54,165
Okay. Okay, I guess I don't see a problem.

925
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:57,415
As it wasn't Lewis' car, the money
isn't clear evidence of any wrongdoing.

926
01:08:57,416 --> 01:09:00,249
And even if it was,
we aren't going to prosecute a dead man.

927
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,249
Which means
the money Internal Affairs is holding

928
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,457
can't even be considered evidence.

929
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:07,124
What? You know, you can
do this whole dance if you want to,

930
01:09:07,125 --> 01:09:08,832
but I'm willing to bet

931
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,874
when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

932
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:14,207
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

933
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:16,832
Fucking black people, huh?

934
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:19,790
- What did you just say?
- I mean...

935
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:23,040
You know, I know
all the sociological reasons

936
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:26,540
why per capita eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

937
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:28,249
Schools are a disgrace.

938
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,624
Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

939
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,582
All that stuff. All that stuff!

940
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:36,999
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man.

941
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,999
They just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

942
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:47,290
Of course, you and I know
that's not the truth,

943
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:49,415
but that's the way it always plays,
doesn't it?

944
01:09:49,416 --> 01:09:53,040
And assholes like Lewis just keep
feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.

945
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:56,790
What did you say you did for the DA again?

946
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,832
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

947
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,874
Oh, please, don't do that.

948
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:03,665
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

949
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:07,832
What do you think those kids need?
To make them believe, to give them hope?

950
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:10,415
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

951
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:13,124
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

952
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,332
Why don't you cut through
the bullshit, Flanagan,

953
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:17,540
and just tell me what it is you want?

954
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:23,207
The DA's squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

955
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:26,749
Rick is quite adamant
that his replacement be a person of color.

956
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:30,957
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

957
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:34,874
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

958
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:38,374
Well, fuck you very much,
but thanks for thinking of me.

959
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,790
Actually, we were thinking of you.

960
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:44,790
Until we saw that.

961
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,582
It's your brother's file.

962
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:51,165
Twenty something years old
and already three felonies.

963
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:54,082
Three-strikes law. Kid's going
away for life for stealing a car.

964
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,624
Christ, that's a shitty law.

965
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:58,624
There's a warrant in there.

966
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:02,290
But still, hey,
he had every opportunity you had.

967
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,749
Fucking black people, huh?

968
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,040
So all...

969
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:19,415
All I need to do to make this disappear
is to frame a potentially innocent man?

970
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:22,415
What are you?
The fucking defender of all things white?

971
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:26,165
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

972
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:29,540
And you're arguing with me
that maybe we're not being fair to him?

973
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:32,749
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe you're right.

974
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:33,957
Maybe Lewis did provoke this

975
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,165
and maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

976
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:39,624
Or maybe, stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

977
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:41,624
was enough to get him killed.

978
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:45,790
There was no one there to see
who shot first, so there is no way to know.

979
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:48,790
Which means we could get this wrong.

980
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:54,832
Maybe that's what happened
with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

981
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:58,249
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

982
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:03,290
You're the one closest to all this.
You need to tell us.

983
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:09,499
What does your gut tell you?

984
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:25,582
So, Graham.

985
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:27,707
What do I tell them?

986
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,707
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

987
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,957
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

988
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,249
it's pretty clear what happened last night.

989
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:47,832
Okay.

990
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:07,707
<i>Before I get to why we're here,</i>

991
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:11,374
<i>I know that many of you have heard
that we had our car stolen last night.</i>

992
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:16,249
<i>And as you could imagine,
my wife and I are both pretty shaken up.</i>

993
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,124
<i>But we're okay.</i>

994
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:21,790
<i>And Jean and I truly appreciate
all your calls and your concern.</i>

995
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:23,082
<i>Thank you.</i>

996
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:27,040
<i>Now, just after 9:00 p. m. last night,</i>

997
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:29,832
<i>Detective William Lewis,
an eight-year veteran of the force</i>

998
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,707
<i>and an active member
of the black community,</i>

999
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,582
<i>was gunned down by a fellow officer.</i>

1000
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:50,915
Hi, sweetie.

1001
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,207
Bye, Lara.

1002
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,790
Get out of the car!

1003
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:38,249
Give me the keys! Get out the...
What the fuck?

1004
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:41,874
Whoa! What the fuck are you doing, man?

1005
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:42,957
Shit!

1006
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:44,624
- You wanna get killed, nigger?
- Say that again!

1007
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:45,874
What the fuck?

1008
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,249
- Say that again, bitch!
- You stupid motherfucker!

1009
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,707
- Say it again, huh! Call me a nigger again!
- Christ!

1010
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:55,457
- Yo, man, what the fuck? Get off of him.
- Fuck you!

1011
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,749
- Shoot him!
- Fucking blow your head off!

1012
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,124
Shoot this motherfucker, man!

1013
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,165
Look, man, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow your head off!

1014
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:02,790
Stop talking and shoot!

1015
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:04,499
Come on, stop! Let's go!

1016
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,415
- Shit, here comes the po-po.
- Shit.

1017
01:15:06,416 --> 01:15:07,874
- Get off of me.
- Fuck off.

1018
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:10,582
- Jesus.
- Hey, hey. Where you going, man?

1019
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:11,749
Hell, no!

1020
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,707
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

1021
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:18,249
Get the fuck out of my car!

1022
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,665
Shit! Damn!

1023
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:21,582
What are you doing, man?
Get out of the car!

1024
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:22,665
Fuck you!

1025
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:25,374
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- You get the fuck out of the car!

1026
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:29,040
Unit 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
Westbound on...

1027
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:32,207
I will blow you away. Get the fuck out!

1028
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:38,707
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...

1029
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:40,249
Oh, Christ!

1030
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,957
- Get the fuck out of the car!
- You get the fuck out of the car!

1031
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:50,457
- Get out of the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

1032
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:52,540
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

1033
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:54,040
You just give me my fucking gun!

1034
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,540
Fuck!

1035
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:09,582
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

1036
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:16,207
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

1037
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:22,582
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

1038
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:24,290
Get out of my car.

1039
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:26,707
Oh, you so brave, you get out the car, man.

1040
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:32,624
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

1041
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:48,749
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

1042
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,915
Lie face down on the ground.
Spread your arms and legs.

1043
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:53,415
No, you lie face down on the ground
and spread your arms and legs.

1044
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:55,207
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

1045
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:56,749
Fuck you, man! What are you gonna do?

1046
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,999
- Pull the fucking trigger, then!
- On your knees now!

1047
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,124
You get on your knees

1048
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,290
and suck my motherfucking dick
while you down there.

1049
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:04,249
Do I look like I'm fucking joking with you?

1050
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:06,415
Yeah, that's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

1051
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:08,832
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

1052
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:11,874
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture for you.

1053
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:14,790
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

1054
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:16,540
Fuck off. Give me some space.
I know this guy.

1055
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:18,165
- Get out of the way.
- You don't fucking know me.

1056
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,374
Step away.

1057
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:21,540
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

1058
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:25,457
- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

1059
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:27,915
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

1060
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:29,915
'Cause these guys really wanna shoot you.

1061
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:32,790
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

1062
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:34,624
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me? Fuck me?

1063
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:36,999
I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one who's fucked here.

1064
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,749
'Cause you're the one whose head's
gonna be blown off

1065
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,124
and onto that man's patio.

1066
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:42,624
- Officer Hanson, step away.
- He's a friend of mine, okay?

1067
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:45,290
He's a fucking friend of mine!
This man is not armed!

1068
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:48,040
He's not gonna shoot you, or me,
or anybody else, all right?

1069
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:50,582
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

1070
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,207
Lower your firearm! Lower your firearm!

1071
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:00,915
Are you starting
to understand the situation?

1072
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:03,665
What do you want from me?

1073
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:06,582
Unless you think your wife

1074
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:09,582
is gonna be better off with a husband
who has a bloody stump for a head,

1075
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:11,832
I want you to sit down on that curb,
put your hands on your head,

1076
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,832
and do nothing
until I speak with these officers.

1077
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:17,332
I'm not sitting on no curb. I'm not putting
my hands on my head for nobody.

1078
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:18,790
Then stand right where you are

1079
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:21,707
and keep your hands in plain sight.
Can you do that, huh?

1080
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,207
Yeah, I can do that.

1081
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,582
Good.

1082
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:32,207
I told this man to stay where he is
and keep his hands in plain sight.

1083
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:37,040
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

1084
01:18:37,416 --> 01:18:39,040
I need this favor.

1085
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:43,124
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1086
01:18:43,458 --> 01:18:45,415
I need to let him go with a warning.

1087
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:50,457
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

1088
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:55,374
Thank you.

1089
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:00,540
You've been warned.
Do you understand me?

1090
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:03,040
Do you understand me?

1091
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:05,915
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1092
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:10,415
- Look, I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help, did I?

1093
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:13,624
Go home.

1094
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:19,915
Yeah, that I can do.

1095
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:40,707
Look at me.

1096
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:43,999
You embarrass me.

1097
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:47,207
You embarrass yourself.

1098
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,665
Daddy's home!

1099
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:53,540
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

1100
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,790
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

1101
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:59,457
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1102
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,957
- You give me my money.
- Daddy.

1103
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,290
I want my fucking money!
Give me that truck.

1104
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:05,790
That's not my truck, bro.

1105
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:07,582
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

1106
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:08,915
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

1107
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:12,082
You know what? Hey, I got $50. Here, here.

1108
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:14,332
$50? You took everything!

1109
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:15,457
Mommy?

1110
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:19,040
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1111
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:22,832
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1112
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:26,415
I have it. He doesn't have
the impenetrable cloak.

1113
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,165
Lara, stay out of the street!

1114
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58,999
It's okay, Daddy.

1115
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:02,999
- What? What?
- I'll protect you.

1116
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:31,540
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1117
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:36,374
- It's a really good cloak.
- Good.

1118
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,290
How's it going?

1119
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:28,040
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1120
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,707
Well, you know what? You are one to talk.

1121
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:34,374
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year.

1122
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:38,665
I'm not snapping at you. I am angry.

1123
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:42,290
Yes. At them! Yes!

1124
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:46,749
At them, the police, at Rick, at Maria,

1125
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:50,582
at the dry cleaners
who destroyed another blouse today,

1126
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:54,457
at the gardener
who keeps over-watering the lawn.

1127
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:55,499
I...

1128
01:25:56,916 --> 01:25:58,540
I just thought that...

1129
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:02,624
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

1130
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,707
and I would feel better, you know?

1131
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:09,290
But I was still mad. And I realized...

1132
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:14,165
I realized that it had nothing to do
with my car being stolen.

1133
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:18,707
I wake up like this every morning.

1134
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:24,082
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

1135
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:26,457
Carol, I don't know why. And I...

1136
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:31,165
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

1137
01:26:32,416 --> 01:26:33,499
Bye.

1138
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:26,874
I really appreciate this.

1139
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:29,040
No problem.

1140
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:37,957
So how long you been out there tonight?
It's cold.

1141
01:28:37,958 --> 01:28:39,332
Hour, maybe.

1142
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:41,832
Big surprise, huh?

1143
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:44,749
Yeah, this ain't exactly
pick-up-a-brother territory.

1144
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:46,374
True.

1145
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:51,415
- So where you headed?
- Anywhere the other side of the hill.

1146
01:28:52,125 --> 01:28:53,832
I'm going to El Segundo.

1147
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,249
El Segundo's cool.

1148
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:58,707
- You've been there?
- Fuck, no.

1149
01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:07,207
That's some good music.

1150
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:12,832
No, really. I'm starting to understand it.

1151
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:17,124
Wrote me a country song myself
just yesterday.

1152
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:19,082
I'll bet you did.

1153
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:21,582
Whatever.

1154
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,082
So what was going on
in the Valley tonight?

1155
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,499
Ice-skating.

1156
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,332
Ice-skating.

1157
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:45,082
Love the ice-skating, man.

1158
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:48,874
You know, when I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a goalie.

1159
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:51,124
Come on.

1160
01:29:51,916 --> 01:29:54,749
What, you think that's funny or something?

1161
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,915
I think you're having fun.

1162
01:29:56,916 --> 01:29:58,415
Yeah. Whatever.

1163
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:11,374
- Something else funny?
- Oh, yeah.

1164
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,374
Yeah? What's that?

1165
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:17,874
People, man. People.

1166
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:20,957
People like me.

1167
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,540
No, no, no. I'm not laughing at you, man.

1168
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:28,915
Yeah, I can see that.
Why don't you laugh outside?

1169
01:30:28,916 --> 01:30:31,124
Dawg, why are you getting
all bent out of shape?

1170
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:33,790
I'm not getting bent, man.
I'm just pulling over.

1171
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:40,124
Come on, man, keep driving.
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1172
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:42,915
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1173
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:45,249
Why you being a fucking jerk, man?
Just drive the car.

1174
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:47,207
I've got a better idea. Get out now.

1175
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,082
Fine. You want me to show you?
I'll show you.

1176
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:51,540
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see them.

1177
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:52,790
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

1178
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:53,999
Put your hands where I can see them.

1179
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,332
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fucking hands.

1180
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:23,374
Oh, God.

1181
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:34,040
Oh, God.

1182
01:32:09,791 --> 01:32:11,624
<i>Thank you, brother Merle, for that.</i>

1183
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:16,165
<i>That was Merle Haggard here on KYHA,
the scene of country music here in LA.</i>

1184
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:18,999
<i>It's a cold night, and it's getting colder.</i>

1185
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,249
<i>And we're giving out tickets to the rodeo
coming to the Fairplex in Pomona,</i>

1186
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,374
<i>so give us a call...</i>

1187
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:30,374
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezing.

1188
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:33,665
Shit. I heard it might snow.

1189
01:32:33,666 --> 01:32:36,249
- Get out of here.
- That's what I heard.

1190
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:38,707
- You got a smoke?
- No. I quit.

1191
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:40,915
Yeah, me, too.

1192
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:44,332
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

1193
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,707
Hey, Bob.

1194
01:34:17,208 --> 01:34:20,415
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1195
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:23,249
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

1196
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:27,374
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1197
01:34:29,208 --> 01:34:30,790
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

1198
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,249
Kim Lee.

1199
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,749
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1200
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:46,207
It's okay. I'm okay.

1201
01:34:46,666 --> 01:34:50,165
I went crazy speeding. I drove into a car.

1202
01:34:50,416 --> 01:34:52,624
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1203
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:56,082
Got into big fight with poor woman.
I called her names.

1204
01:34:58,041 --> 01:35:01,207
Oh, fine. I die from worry and you laugh.

1205
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:07,040
Thank you for finding me.

1206
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:13,790
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

1207
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,374
Go to the locker.

1208
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:21,207
No, next one.

1209
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,874
In my wallet there's a check.

1210
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:28,624
Bring it here.

1211
01:35:38,041 --> 01:35:41,249
Oh, I get it. When I said
get me a black Lincoln Navigator,

1212
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,457
you thought I said
get me a white piece-of-shit panel van.

1213
01:35:44,458 --> 01:35:47,790
Fine, it's fine.
Just give me whatever for it, man.

1214
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,040
You should see this.

1215
01:36:06,208 --> 01:36:07,832
I'll take the van.

1216
01:36:08,583 --> 01:36:10,332
They're chained to the van.

1217
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:11,874
So I'll take them, too.

1218
01:36:13,333 --> 01:36:14,999
You wanna buy these Chinamen?

1219
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,415
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1220
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:19,582
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1221
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:23,040
- What the hell are you gonna do with them?
- Sell them. What the hell do you think?

1222
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:26,582
I'll give you $500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1223
01:36:45,791 --> 01:36:47,749
Oh, no!

1224
01:36:51,916 --> 01:36:53,874
No! No!

1225
01:37:10,875 --> 01:37:12,165
This is Dorri.

1226
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:27,999
My baby. My poor baby.

1227
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:32,207
Mom.

1228
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:38,457
I promise you. I promise
I'm gonna find out who did this, Mom.

1229
01:37:40,291 --> 01:37:42,665
Oh, I already know.

1230
01:37:45,791 --> 01:37:46,999
You did.

1231
01:37:49,083 --> 01:37:52,499
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1232
01:37:53,916 --> 01:37:56,832
We weren't much good to you anymore,
were we?

1233
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:05,540
You got things to do.
You go ahead. I'll sign the papers.

1234
01:38:05,541 --> 01:38:06,999
Mom, I wanna stay with...

1235
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,999
I just wanna wait with my baby.

1236
01:38:21,666 --> 01:38:24,249
He came home. Did you know that?

1237
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:27,707
My little boy.

1238
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:32,040
When I was sleeping,
he brought me groceries.

1239
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:35,207
It's the last thing he did.

1240
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:01,915
Baba.

1241
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:16,332
What happened?

1242
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:24,915
What did you do?

1243
01:39:26,416 --> 01:39:28,040
Baba, what did you do?

1244
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:33,499
I shoot a little girl.

1245
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,040
What?

1246
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:37,915
No, she's okay. She's...

1247
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,040
She's... Here.

1248
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,290
The gun shoot her,

1249
01:39:46,041 --> 01:39:48,540
but she's okay, Dorri. Nothing happened.

1250
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:53,540
She's my farishte.

1251
01:39:55,416 --> 01:39:58,332
- What are you talking about, Daddy?
- My farishte, Dorri.

1252
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:01,874
My angel.

1253
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:05,999
My angel.

1254
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:10,207
She came to protect me.

1255
01:40:12,333 --> 01:40:13,790
To protect us.

1256
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:17,749
You understand?

1257
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,707
Take this. Please.

1258
01:40:26,291 --> 01:40:27,499
Take it.

1259
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:33,790
Hey, hey.

1260
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:37,332
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1261
01:40:38,916 --> 01:40:40,207
It's okay.

1262
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:47,874
- Okay, Daddy.
- Okay.

1263
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:13,582
Jean?

1264
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:15,707
<i>- Rick?
- Yeah. What's wrong?</i>

1265
01:41:16,375 --> 01:41:18,040
I fell down the stairs.

1266
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:21,499
<i>- Are you all right?
- I tried calling you.</i>

1267
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:24,415
I couldn't get through to anyone. Not...

1268
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,165
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie, not...

1269
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:31,249
<i>I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in
my car. I'll be home in 20 minutes.</i>

1270
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:34,540
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1271
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,540
<i>Carol was the only one that was home</i>

1272
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:41,040
and she said she couldn't come get me
because she was getting a massage.

1273
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:43,165
Well, that's because she's a bitch.

1274
01:41:43,708 --> 01:41:45,790
She's been my friend for 10 years.

1275
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,957
<i>All right, honey. Feel better.</i>

1276
01:41:49,791 --> 01:41:51,457
I'll be there soon.

1277
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:55,540
I love you.

1278
01:41:56,416 --> 01:41:57,957
I love you, too.

1279
01:42:30,916 --> 01:42:32,207
Miss Jean.

1280
01:42:34,416 --> 01:42:36,374
Would you like to sit up?

1281
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:43,499
Here.

1282
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:45,332
Good.

1283
01:42:54,666 --> 01:42:58,124
- Do you want to hear something funny?
- What, Mrs. Jean?

1284
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:02,832
You're the best friend I've got.

1285
01:46:16,125 --> 01:46:17,124
Hi.

1286
01:46:18,416 --> 01:46:19,374
Hi.

1287
01:46:26,125 --> 01:46:27,457
I love you.

1288
01:47:57,875 --> 01:47:59,165
All right.

1289
01:48:00,083 --> 01:48:03,332
Everybody out, man. You're free to go.

1290
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:08,040
All right, come on.

1291
01:48:08,958 --> 01:48:11,999
Come on, now. This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop.

1292
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,457
Come on, y'all.

1293
01:48:16,708 --> 01:48:17,999
Come on.

1294
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,624
That's $40.

1295
01:48:56,625 --> 01:48:58,874
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

1296
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:03,457
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

1297
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:42,374
Oh, my God!
What the hell is wrong with you people?

1298
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:47,374
Don't talk to me,
unless you speak American!
