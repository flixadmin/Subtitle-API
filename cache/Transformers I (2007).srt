26
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,625
Oh God, 5 months of this.

27
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,781
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

28
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,619
A plate of mama's Alligators Étouffée.

29
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,923
You have been talking
about barbecued aligators and crickets

30
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:27,969
for the last 2 weeks.

31
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:29,571
I am never going
to your mama's house,

32
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,014
Fig, I promise.
But Bobby, Bobby,

33
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:33,553
Bobby, aligators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

34
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,644
I understand.

35
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,521
English, please. English.

36
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,025
I mean, how many times have we...

37
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,610
We don't speak Spanish.

38
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:45,904
I told you that.
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?

39
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:46,977
That's my heritage.

40
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,790
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,243
Hey, you guys remember weekends?

42
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,508
The Sox at Fenway.

43
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,415
Cold hot dog and a flat beer.

44
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,571
Perfect day.

45
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,835
What about you, Captain?

46
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:02,638
You got a perfect day?

47
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,670
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

48
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:07,516
He is adorable.
That's too...

49
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,508
Shut up!

50
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,862
Hey, I am ready to do this.

51
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,648
Hey, any of you all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

52
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:33,765
Hey, hey!

53
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,016
Watch this crossover, baby.

54
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:40,670
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

55
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,149
Step aside, ladies.
Oh, man. What?

56
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,521
Lennox!
Hey, what are you doing?

57
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:47,590
Water?

58
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:49,323
Thank you.

59
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,784
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

60
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,060
Colonel Sharp,

61
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:01,396
we have an inbound unidentified infiltrator,

62
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,582
10 miles out.

63
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,032
<i>Unidentified aircraft,</i>

64
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:11,755
<i>you are in restricted US military airspace.</i>

65
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,653
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

66
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,163
Raptors 1 and 2,

67
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:20,453
snap to heading 2-5-0 to intercept.

68
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,318
Bogie is in the weeds 10 miles out,
not squawking.

69
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,716
<i>Unidentified aircraft,</i>

70
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,815
we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

71
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,804
If you do not comply,

72
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,346
we will use deadly force.

73
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,298
Copy the bogie.

74
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,298
Tail 4500 X-ray.

75
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,863
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down 3 months ago.

76
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:46,887
Afghanistan.
That's got to be a mistake.

77
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,997
Check again, then recheck.
I did sir.

78
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,535
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

79
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:52,810
<i>Unidentified aircraft,</i>

80
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,087
<i>we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

81
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,527
Radar, where is the inbound?
Bogie is 5 miles out, sir.

82
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,265
My wife on?
Yes Captain.

83
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,268
My ladies!
Look.

84
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,477
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She is getting so big.

85
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:14,766
<i>Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.</i>

86
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,321
<i>Baby, we made a good-looking kid.</i>

87
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,274
I know that people say that
all the time but,

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,016
we made one good-looking kid.
Nice work.

89
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,469
She has your laugh.

90
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,188
<i>She laughed?</i>

91
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:26,717
Her first one yeah.

92
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,607
<i>You...</i>

93
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,435
<i>sure she didn't just fart?</i>

94
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,536
No, she is a lady.

95
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:34,255
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

96
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,491
4500 X. Something is not right.

97
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,991
Bogie is on the deck.

98
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:48,642
Radar is jammed.

99
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,272
It's coming from the chopper.

100
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,299
Will?

101
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:54,541
Sarah?

102
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,468
Hey.

103
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,219
<i>Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I will be home soon.</i>

104
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,903
To the right. Go to the right.
Check fire.

105
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:11,098
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

106
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,765
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

107
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,959
Hold your fire!

108
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:29,619
Stand by to engage!

109
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,855
My God.

110
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,154
They bombed the antenna farm!

111
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,887
We are under attack!

112
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,192
Go! Move! Move!

113
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,983
It's going after the files!

114
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,454
Cut the hard lines!

115
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,492
I need a key! It's locked!

116
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,815
Move! Move!

117
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,062
Here, come here! Come here!

118
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,086
Hide in here!

119
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,355
Oh, my God.

120
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,647
No!

121
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,365
What the...

122
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,479
Epps, let's go!

123
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,044
Ok, Mr. Witwicky, you are up.

124
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,716
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

125
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,044
Watch.

126
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,388
Ok.

127
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,948
For my family ge...

128
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,372
Who did... Who did that?

129
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,026
People! Responsibility.

130
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,375
So, for my family genealogy report,

131
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,203
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

132
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,766
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

133
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
Very famous explorer.

134
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,850
In fact, he was one of the first...

135
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,143
to explore,

136
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,187
the Arctic Circle,

137
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:35,703
which is a big deal.

138
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,900
In 1897,

139
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:42,994
he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.

140
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,406
Move faster!

141
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,116
Move! Chop!

142
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,214
Heave!

143
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,912
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting!

144
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,803
Chop faster! Heave, men!

145
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,082
Heave!

146
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:56,417
No sacrifice!

147
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:58,656
No victory!

148
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,164
We will get to the Arctic Circle lads!

149
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,668
So that's the story, right?

150
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,760
And here we have some of the basic

151
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:08,603
instruments and tools
used by 19th-century seamen.

152
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,182
This here is the quadrant,

153
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:13,108
which you can get for 80 bucks.
It's all for sale, by the way.

154
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,102
Like the sextant here.

155
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:18,093
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

156
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,683
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

157
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,516
I have not quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they ave seen many cool things.

158
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,510
Are you going to sell me his liver?

159
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,990
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.

160
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:30,062
It's the 11th grade.
I don't think your grandfather would be

161
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:31,994
particularly proud of what you are doing.
I know. I am sorry.

162
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:34,156
I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

163
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,667
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

164
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,033
Cold hard cash works, too.

165
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,622
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

166
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:41,779
Sam!
Sorry.

167
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,129
Unfortunately, my great-great-grandfather,

168
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:45,216
the genius that he was,

169
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:48,584
wound up going blind and crazy
in a psycho ward,

170
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,130
drawing these strange symbols

171
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:51,639
and babbling on about some...

172
00:10:51,913 --> 00:10:54,155
giant ice man that he thought
he had discovered.

173
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,155
Ok. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

174
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,689
Sleep in fear tonight.
Here, you want? Here.

175
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,190
50.40? 30?
Sam?

176
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:02,250
Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

177
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:03,943
Ok.

178
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:05,859
Pretty good, right?

179
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,134
I would say a solid B-.

180
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,826
A B-?

181
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,088
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap,

182
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:16,317
in my classroom.
No, kids enjoy...

183
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,570
Look, can you do me a favor?
What?

184
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,412
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

185
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,568
He is the guy in the green car.
Yeah.

186
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,879
Ok, I wanna tell you about a dream.

187
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:24,409
A boy's dream.

188
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
And a man's promise to that boy.

189
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,633
He looked at me in the eye, he said.

190
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:29,218
Son, I am gonna buy you a car.

191
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
But I want you to bring me $2,000
and 3 A's.

192
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,818
Ok? I got the 2,000 and I got 2 A's.

193
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,057
Ok? Here is the dream.

194
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,267
Your B-.

195
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:38,150
Dream gone. Kaput.

196
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,520
Sir,

197
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:40,897
just ask yourself,

198
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:42,891
what would Jesus do?

199
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,601
Yes! Yes, yes.

200
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:48,015
So?

201
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,441
A. It's an A, though.

202
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,305
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

203
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,763
So I am good?
You are good.

204
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,661
I got a little surprise for you, son.

205
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,110
What kind of sur...

206
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,441
Yeah, a little surprise.

207
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,292
No.

208
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:04,376
No, no, no, no. Dad!

209
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,547
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
See?

210
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,965
Yeah. I am.

211
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,674
You are not getting a Porsche.

212
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:13,888
You think that's funny?

213
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:15,598
Yeah, I think it's funny.
What's wrong with you?

214
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:17,767
You think I would really get you
a Porsche

215
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,434
for your first car?

216
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,231
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

217
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:25,050
Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
It's not a funny joke.

218
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,748
Manny!

219
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:30,034
What?

220
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,493
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

221
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,830
He is having a heat stroke again.

222
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,016
Scaring white folks.

223
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,941
I am hot! Makeup is melting.
It hurts my eyes.

224
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,497
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said...

225
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:41,767
You said half a car,
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

226
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,438
When I was your age, I would have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

227
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,783
Ok, let me explain something to you. Ok?

228
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,314
You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
Yeah.

229
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,478
Ok, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

230
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,266
Ok.
You want me to live that life?

231
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,700
No sacrifice, no victory.
Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

232
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,069
The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
Right.

233
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,233
Gentlemen.

234
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,299
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,

235
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:01,459
except without the runs.

236
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,271
How can I help you?
Well, my son here,

237
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:06,318
looking to buy his first car.

238
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,037
You come to see me?
I had to.

239
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,486
That practically makes us family.

240
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,238
Uncle Bobby B, baby.

241
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:14,240
Uncle Bobby B.
Sam.

242
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:16,125
Sam, let me talk to you.

243
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,203
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom,

244
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,167
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

245
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,165
Let me tell you something, son.

246
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:24,839
A driver don't pick the car.

247
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,776
The car will pick the driver.

248
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,999
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

249
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,465
Son, I am a lot of things,

250
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:32,913
but a liar is not one of them.

251
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,719
Especially not in front of my mammy.

252
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,387
That's my mammy.

253
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,952
Hey, Mammy!

254
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,575
Don't be like that. If I had a rock,
I would bust your head, bitch.

255
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,153
I tell you man, she deaf, you know?

256
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,357
Well over here,

257
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:52,353
every piece of car
a man might want or need.

258
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,682
This ain't bad.

259
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,226
This one is got racing stripes.
Yeah.

260
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,279
It got racing...

261
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,091
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

262
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,708
I don't know nothing about this car.

263
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,372
Manny!
What?

264
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,070
What is this? This car! Check it out!

265
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,670
I don't know, boss! I have never seen it!
That's loco!

266
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:12,186
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

267
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,354
Feels good.

268
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,483
How much?
Well,

269
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,251
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

270
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,516
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

271
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,021
Yeah, but the paint is faded.

272
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:29,602
Yeah, but it's custom.

273
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
It's custom faded?

274
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,784
Well, this is your first car.
I would not expect you to understand.

275
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,696
5 grand.
No, I am not paying over 4.

276
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,437
Sorry.

277
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,542
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

278
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,315
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

279
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,793
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

280
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,114
Now, this one here for 4 Gs is a beaut.

281
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,912
There is a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

282
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,296
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

283
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,559
This is a classic engine right here.

284
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,530
I sold a car the other day...

285
00:14:58,346 --> 00:14:59,779
Gee. Holy cow.

286
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:01,198
No, no, no. No worries.
You alright?

287
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,307
I will get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out.

288
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:04,854
Hey, hey, Manny!

289
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,945
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

290
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,829
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

291
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,185
<i>Greater than man...</i>

292
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,852
That one is my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

293
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:32,663
$4,000.

294
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:45,791
Steve.

295
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,745
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

296
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,541
They are so young.

297
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,178
They are the top
subject matter experts, sir.

298
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,550
NSA is recruiting right out of
high school these days.

299
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,444
Guys,

300
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,022
that's the Secretary of Defense.

301
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,123
I am so under dressed.

302
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,620
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

303
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,236
Please be seated.

304
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:12,103
I am John Keller.

305
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,837
Obviously, you are wondering
why you are here,

306
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:16,298
so these are the facts.

307
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,443
At 1900 local time yesterday,

308
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,553
the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.

309
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,444
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

310
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,208
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

311
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:32,149
We are not sure
exactly what they are after,

312
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,355
but we do know,

313
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:35,327
they were cut off during the assault,

314
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,333
which would lead us to assume
they are going to try it again.

315
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,278
Now, no one is taken responsibility
for the attack.

316
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,492
And the only real lead we have so far,

317
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:47,531
is this sound.

318
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,840
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

319
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,010
NSA is working at full capacity,
to analyze it

320
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,808
and intercept further communications,

321
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,161
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

322
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,389
Now, you have all shown considerable
ability...

323
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,348
in the area of signals analysis.

324
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,981
We are on a hair-trigger here people.

325
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,992
The President has dispatched
battle groups

326
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:18,737
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.

327
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,351
Now I am gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.

328
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:23,229
You will break up into teams
and you will start your work.

329
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,833
Good luck to us all.

330
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,825
Alright Mojo, I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

331
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,989
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

332
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,513
Zero bids.

333
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,514
Great. Broke.

334
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,373
Come on Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

335
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,203
No. Premature.

336
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,521
Good. What's up?

337
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,575
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

338
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,983
It's like clockwork.

339
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:04,858
Alright, I know you get wasted
on these things,

340
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,907
but if you piss in my bed again,
you are sleeping outside. Ok?

341
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,351
That's it for today, no more.
Crackhead.

342
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,372
Ron, this one is uneven.
Yeah.

343
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,552
Probably.

344
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:15,927
This one is wobbly.

345
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:19,614
Yeah. I will take care of that real soon.
Could not we have hired a professional?

346
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:21,459
Sam. I...
What?

347
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:24,044
Do not like footprints on my grass.

348
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,006
What foot... There is no footprints.
That's why I built my path.

349
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,066
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, ok?

350
00:18:28,203 --> 00:18:30,384
It's family grass, Dad.
Well, when you own your own grass,

351
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,502
you will understand.
This... I can't do it anymore.

352
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,871
You are putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
What?

353
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,226
He is got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

354
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,640
That's his bling.

355
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,951
I want you home at 11.00!

356
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,522
Yeah, alright.
11.00!

357
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,387
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

358
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:46,640
Seat belt on!

359
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:56,497
You are so cheap.

360
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,325
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

361
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,508
At this time,

362
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:08,385
we can't confirm...

363
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,154
whether there were any survivors.

364
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:14,214
Oh, my God.
<i>Our bases worldwide are as of now,</i>

365
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,144
<i>at DEFCON Delta,
our highest readiness level.</i>

366
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:20,776
We are dealing with
a very effective weapons system

367
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,714
that we have not come across before.

368
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:25,296
<i>But our prayers are with the families</i>

369
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,602
<i>of the brave men and women...</i>
Honey.

370
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:28,126
Daddy is gonna be ok.

371
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,059
I have never seen a weapons system
like this.

372
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:34,551
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

373
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:37,233
like it's cloaked by some kind
of invisible force field.

374
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,145
That's impossible. There is no
such thing as invisible force fields

375
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,185
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

376
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,545
Man, I don't know.
What is that?

377
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:45,286
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

378
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,757
She saw things.

379
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:48,669
I got the gene too and...

380
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,511
that thing that attacked us?

381
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:52,873
I got a feeling it ain't over.

382
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,536
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

383
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,019
and get us the hell out of here?

384
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,602
When I took that picture,

385
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,906
I think it saw me.

386
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,086
It looked right at me.

387
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:08,625
Alright, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

388
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,083
They got to know what
we are dealing with here.

389
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,439
My radio is fried.

390
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,583
I got no communication with aerial.
Hey, Mahfouz.

391
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:16,662
How far do you live from here?
Not far.

392
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:17,691
Just up that mountain.

393
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
Do they have a phone?
Yes.

394
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,474
Alright, let's hit it.

395
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,583
Dude, are you sure
we are invited to this party?

396
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,757
Of course Miles.
It's a lake.

397
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:30,407
Public property.

398
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh my God.

399
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,514
Oh my God, dude, Mikaela is here.

400
00:20:35,774 --> 00:20:37,076
Just don't do anything weird, alright?

401
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,994
I am good, right?
Yeah, you are good.

402
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:39,912
Ok.

403
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:44,928
Hey guys, check it out.

404
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,213
Oh, hi.

405
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:49,695
Hey, bro. That car.

406
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:50,968
It's nice.

407
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:52,535
Hey.

408
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,878
So, what are you guys doing here?

409
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,714
We are here to climb this tree.

410
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

411
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,606
Yeah.
You know, I thought I recognized you.

412
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,743
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

413
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,243
Let's go call your mom.

414
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,969
Oh, no, no, that... No.

415
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:16,499
That was not like a... real tryout.

416
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:18,586
I was researching a book I was writing.

417
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,297
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

418
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:21,602
Yeah? What's it about?

419
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,164
Sucking at sports?

420
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,188
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

421
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,435
No, it's a good book.
Your friends will love it.

422
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,446
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know,

423
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,531
little coloring areas sections,

424
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:36,563
pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

425
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,071
That's funny.

426
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,024
Ok, ok. You know what? Stop.

427
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,228
Hey guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

428
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:48,228
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

429
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,416
Just get out of the tree right now, please.

430
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,104
What are you doing?

431
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,343
Did you see that dismount?

432
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:55,486
All the chicks were watching.

433
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,814
You are making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

434
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,140
Hey, how about you let me drive?
Oh, no. No, no, no.

435
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,392
This is not a toy.
These 22's...

436
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:04,331
I don't want you grinding them.
No.

437
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,523
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

438
00:22:08,147 --> 00:22:11,514
Oh God, I can't even tell you how much
I am not your little bunny.

439
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,299
Ok.

440
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:16,891
You will call me.

441
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:27,842
Hey, man, what's wrong with your radio?

442
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,378
I am gonna drive her home tonight.

443
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:30,113
What?

444
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,926
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

445
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,819
She lives 10 miles from here, ok?
It's my only chance.

446
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:35,948
You got to be understanding here, alright?

447
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:37,591
Alright. We will put her in the back.
I will be quiet.

448
00:22:37,616 --> 00:22:39,183
Did you say, Put her in the back?
I called shotgun.

449
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,129
I am not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car right now.

450
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:42,485
That's a party foul.
What rules?

451
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,984
Bros before hos.

452
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:45,883
Miles, I am begging you to get out
of my car. Ok?

453
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,431
You can't do this to me.
You got to get out of my car right now.

454
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:57,281
Mikaela!

455
00:22:57,904 --> 00:22:59,069
It's Sam.

456
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,368
Witwicky.

457
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,847
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

458
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,006
You sure?

459
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,979
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

460
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:07,874
I mean, I give you a ride home,

461
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:09,487
in my car to your house.

462
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,567
There you go.

463
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,897
So...

464
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,559
I can't believe that I am here right now.

465
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,950
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

466
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,481
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean...

467
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:34,151
I mean here with you.
I just meant here like...

468
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:35,861
in this situation,
Oh?

469
00:23:36,107 --> 00:23:37,853
This same situation that I am always in.

470
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:39,239
I don't know, I guess I just have a...

471
00:23:39,263 --> 00:23:40,870
weakness for hot guys,

472
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,576
for, for tight abs and...

473
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:44,528
really big arms.

474
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,887
Big arms?

475
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,553
Well, there is a couple new additions
in the car.

476
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,249
Like, I just put in that light there.

477
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,505
And that disco ball.

478
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,991
And so the light reflects off the disco ball.

479
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,872
Yeah.

480
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,477
Are you... Are you new to school this year?

481
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:07,510
It's your first year here?

482
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,188
Oh, no, no.

483
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
We have been in the same school
since first grade.

484
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,847
Really?
Yeah.

485
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:14,480
Yeah a long time.

486
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,586
Well do...
do we have any classes together?

487
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:17,986
Yeah, yeah.

488
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,060
History.
Which?

489
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:22,029
Language arts. Math. Science.

490
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,373
Sam.
Sam. Yeah.

491
00:24:23,404 --> 00:24:24,701
Sam Wilkicky.

492
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:26,864
Witwicky.

493
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:28,246
You know, I am so sorry.
Yeah.

494
00:24:28,404 --> 00:24:30,519
I just... I just didn't recognize you.
No, it's cool.

495
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:32,521
Yeah, well, I mean, that's understandable.

496
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,504
No, no, no, no. No.

497
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:37,134
Come on.

498
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,821
Sorry, I am just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

499
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,764
This radio is, like you know...

500
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,160
It's an old radio too, so...

501
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,567
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know, ok.

502
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,619
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I would not try this on you.

503
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,792
Because this is like a romantic
romantic thing that I am not trying to do.

504
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:58,890
Not that you are not worthy
of trying something like this on.

505
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,106
No, of course not.
I am a friend of yours.

506
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,597
I am not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

507
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:05,682
I mean, I am not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.

508
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,606
Just pop the hood.

509
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,325
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

510
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,041
Nice headers.

511
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,281
You have got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

512
00:25:18,938 --> 00:25:20,216
That's pretty impressive Sam.

513
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,445
Double-pump?

514
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,949
It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster.

515
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,880
I like to go faster.

516
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:31,101
And it looks like your
distributor cap is a little...

517
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:32,403
loose.

518
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,093
Yeah? How did you know that?

519
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,846
My dad. He was...

520
00:25:38,062 --> 00:25:39,276
a real grease monkey.

521
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,111
He taught me all about this.
I could...

522
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:43,774
take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

523
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,070
That's weird.
I just would not peg you for mechanical.

524
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:47,254
Oh, my God.

525
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,028
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

526
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:51,685
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

527
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,331
Especially not Trent.

528
00:25:53,355 --> 00:25:54,583
He hates it.

529
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,686
Yeah, no, I am cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

530
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,347
I prefer it, actually.

531
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,631
Ok. You want to fire it up for me?

532
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:02,799
Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.
Thanks.

533
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:04,575
You know, I was thinking.

534
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,361
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

535
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,611
You know what? I am just...
I am gonna walk.

536
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,013
Good luck with your car.

537
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,145
Alright.

538
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,927
Walking is healthy, right?

539
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,171
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

540
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:25,363
Come on, please.

541
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:26,743
Please, you got to work for me now.

542
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:29,284
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

543
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:34,986
Hey!

544
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,538
Hey!

545
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,660
Wait a second!

546
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,613
There it is.

547
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,647
I had fun.

548
00:26:59,188 --> 00:27:01,595
So, you know, thanks for listening.

549
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,443
Oh, yeah, yeah.

550
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:06,184
You... You think I am shallow?

551
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,120
You are shal... No, no, no, no.

552
00:27:09,585 --> 00:27:10,617
I think...

553
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,202
there is a lot more,

554
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:13,537
than meets the eye...

555
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,346
with you.

556
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:17,991
Ok.

557
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:19,944
Yeah.

558
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,069
Alright, I will see you at school.

559
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,699
Alright.

560
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,059
That's stupid.

561
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,640
That was a stupid line.

562
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,143
There is more than meets
the eye with you. Stupid.

563
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,018
Oh, God.

564
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,317
Oh, my God. I love my car.

565
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,411
Hey guys,

566
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:56,496
I think the other team figured it out.

567
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,952
Iran.

568
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,041
Come on man.

569
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:02,640
This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

570
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:04,274
Think about it.

571
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:06,332
What do you think, kid? Chinese?

572
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,348
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

573
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:14,893
This is Air Force One. Level of flight,

574
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:16,224
level 3-3-0.
<i>We will hunt down this enemy.</i>

575
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:18,856
<i>And when we do, we will know
just what to do with them.</i>

576
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,387
Thank you.
You are welcome.

577
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,664
<i>Apparently,</i>

578
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:41,612
<i>there are very few survivors.</i>
Yes, Mr. President?

579
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,467
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

580
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,600
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs.

581
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:00,863
I will be in storage.

582
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,198
Shit.

583
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,204
Do you hear that?

584
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,891
Are you getting this?

585
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,942
I think they are hacking
the network again.

586
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,113
Oh, my God.

587
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,293
This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

588
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,658
Are you running a diagnostic?

589
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,201
Should I be?
Yes, you should.

590
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:41,486
So I am.

591
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,339
Someone!

592
00:30:53,363 --> 00:30:54,913
They are hacking into Air Force One!

593
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,264
We need a senior analyst.

594
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,352
I think they are planting a virus.
A virus?

595
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,763
It's streaming right now.

596
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:01,096
They are planting a virus

597
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:04,152
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

598
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,087
Code Red. We have a breach.

599
00:31:06,112 --> 00:31:08,927
Air Force One, someone on board
has breached the military network.

600
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,148
I am in the cargo hold.

601
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,716
Clear. Clear.

602
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,640
You got to cut the hard lines.
What?

603
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,657
Whatever they want, they are getting it.

604
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:20,614
Sir?

605
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,879
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

606
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,330
Cut all server hard lines now.

607
00:31:25,588 --> 00:31:27,559
Cut all server hard lines now.

608
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,400
Someone is tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

609
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,221
What the...

610
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,398
<i>Shots fired in the under deck.
Repeat, shots fired.</i>

611
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,968
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency descent.</i>

612
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,665
I want our President in that bunker.

613
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,151
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till, that becomes reality.

614
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,607
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

615
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,479
Air Force One is on the ground.

616
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,205
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

617
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,228
That's my car!

618
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,152
No!

619
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,383
No, no, no, no.

620
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,669
Dad, call the cops!

621
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,091
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

622
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:03,905
Hello?

623
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:06,986
911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

624
00:34:07,064 --> 00:34:08,952
I am in pursuit right!
I need all units,

625
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:10,578
the whole squadron.

626
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:11,996
Bring everyone!

627
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,406
No, no, no, don't ask me questions, alright?

628
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:15,337
My father is the head
of the neighborhood watch!

629
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:49,652
Oh, my God.

630
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,299
My name is Sam Witwicky.

631
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:10,388
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
ok?

632
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:12,410
You saw that?

633
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:14,502
This is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad,

634
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:17,541
I love you and if you find Busty
Beauties under my bed, it was not mine.

635
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:18,646
I am holding it for Miles.

636
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:20,606
No, no, wait that...
Ok, that's not true.

637
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,942
It's mine and Uncle Charles
gave it to me. I am sorry.

638
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,347
Mojo, I love you.

639
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:37,763
No! No! No! No!

640
00:35:41,537 --> 00:35:42,443
Oh, my God.

641
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,498
No, you are a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

642
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,224
Oh, my God.

643
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,055
Hey, hey, hey! Alright!

644
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,687
Please, please don't kill me!

645
00:35:59,712 --> 00:36:00,480
I am sorry!

646
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:02,790
Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car is yours!

647
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:07,363
Listen, listen, listen.

648
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:08,719
Good, you are here.
Let me see your hands!

649
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,563
No, no, no, no, no! It's not me!
Let me see your hands.

650
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:12,450
The guy is inside.
Shut up!

651
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:13,860
Walk towards the car.

652
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,024
Put your head on the hood.

653
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,445
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

654
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,041
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

655
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:37,742
What did they get?
We still don't know.

656
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,060
Talk to me about the virus.

657
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:40,923
It's a Spider-bot virus.

658
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,660
We are not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

659
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:45,931
Can we stop it?
Every time we try an ant-virus,

660
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:47,235
it adapts and speeds up.

661
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:49,698
It's like it's not a virus anymore.
It's become the system.

662
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:52,837
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

663
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,002
The only countries
with this kind of capability

664
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:57,099
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

665
00:36:57,124 --> 00:36:58,663
I am sorry, that's not correct.

666
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,530
Excuse me, young lady.
I didn't see you standing there.

667
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:02,509
You would be who?

668
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:04,271
I am just the analyst
who detected the hack.

669
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,169
Hold on.

670
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:06,295
It was you?

671
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:07,833
You did it?

672
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,756
Her team.

673
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:10,462
Sir, I was just trying to say,

674
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,196
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

675
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,290
Ok. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

676
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:18,044
would take 20 years to do that.

677
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,856
Maybe you can explain then,
how our latest satellite imagery

678
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:23,137
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

679
00:37:23,162 --> 00:37:26,240
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we are doing?

680
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,401
The signal pattern is learning.

681
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:30,122
It's evolving on its own.

682
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,581
And you need to move past Fourier transfers

683
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:34,864
and start considering quantum mechanics.

684
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:37,292
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

685
00:37:37,317 --> 00:37:38,578
What about an organism?

686
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:39,832
A living organism?

687
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,433
Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer?

688
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,542
And I know that that sounds crazy...
That's enough.

689
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:45,669
That's enough.

690
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,057
We have 6 floors of analysts
working on this thing.

691
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,756
Now, if you can find proof...

692
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,925
to back up your theory, I am
gonna be happy to listen to you.

693
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:55,595
But if you don't get a filter
on that brain-mouth thing,

694
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,538
you are gonna be off the team.
You understand?

695
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,313
Look, I can't be any clearer,

696
00:38:05,454 --> 00:38:07,300
than how crystal clear I am being.

697
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,275
It just stood up.

698
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:10,318
It just stood up?

699
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:13,682
That's really neat.

700
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,580
Ok, chiefie.

701
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,158
Time to fill her up.

702
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,690
And no drippy-drippy.

703
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,455
What are you rolling?

704
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,121
Whippets? Goofballs?

705
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:23,873
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

706
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:25,420
No. I am not on any drugs.
What's these?

707
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,127
Found it in your pocket.

708
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:29,368
Mojo.

709
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,889
Is that what the kids are doing now?

710
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,319
Little bit of Mojo?

711
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,550
Those are my dog's pain pills.

712
00:38:34,574 --> 00:38:36,684
You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

713
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,021
What was that?

714
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,904
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

715
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,357
You wanna go?

716
00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:51,276
Make something happen. Do it.

717
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,985
Because I promise you.

718
00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:54,941
I will bust you up.

719
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,629
Are you on drugs?

720
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,016
Let's hope this telephone line works.

721
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:13,526
Hey, heads up!

722
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,799
Heads up!

723
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:16,793
Hey! Heads up!

724
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,322
What the heck was that?

725
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:29,814
English, dude.

726
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:31,502
English.

727
00:39:39,497 --> 00:39:40,628
Watch out!

728
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,220
Open fire!

729
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:49,628
Contact! Contact!

730
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,711
Everybody quiet. Settle.

731
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:52,774
Mother... What the hell is...

732
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:02,770
Get up! Get up! Come on!

733
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,197
Go! Move it!

734
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,622
Take cover!

735
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,456
Fig! Cover the rear!

736
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:32,877
Cover fire!

737
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,296
Move it! Fig, cover the rear!

738
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,699
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

739
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:37,506
Come on!

740
00:40:38,746 --> 00:40:39,646
Give me a mag!

741
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:42,881
Where is your papa?
Where is your papa?

742
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:43,998
Papa!

743
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,181
Sir,

744
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:46,904
we need... I need a telephone.

745
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:49,210
Telephone, telephone, yes!
Telephone!

746
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:51,129
Hey, I need a mag!
Give me a mag!

747
00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:52,312
Cell phone!
I don't know how to thank you.

748
00:40:52,337 --> 00:40:53,102
Fire!

749
00:40:54,366 --> 00:40:55,808
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you...

750
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:58,203
Do you understand?
It's an emergency...

751
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,518
I don't have a credit card!

752
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,799
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

753
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,967
I am going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

754
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:14,346
I am in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

755
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,804
Ammo!

756
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,913
I need a credit card!

757
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,053
Epps! Where is your wallet?

758
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:25,277
Pocket!

759
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,139
Which pocket?

760
00:41:27,163 --> 00:41:28,483
My back pocket!

761
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,393
You got 10 back pockets!

762
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:32,950
Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

763
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:36,197
Alright, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

764
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,509
Ok, it's Visa.

765
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,692
Also sir, have you heard about

766
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:42,005
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

767
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,830
No, I don't want a premium package!

768
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:46,973
Epps! Pentagon!

769
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,330
Give me a status.

770
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,236
Sir, we are tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

771
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,040
They say they are survivors
of the base attack.

772
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,113
Survivors?

773
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,747
I ain't never seen this in my life!

774
00:42:02,836 --> 00:42:04,654
<i>Need gunships on station ASAP!</i>

775
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:05,943
Predator is coming up in a minute.

776
00:42:05,988 --> 00:42:07,576
We are linking the call
to the nearest AWACS.

777
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,749
Unknown man. I don't...
Man if you seen this shit...

778
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,882
Predator ETA 2 minutes.

779
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,775
Hey! Make way!

780
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,694
What is that?
I don't know.

781
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,088
We need air support and we need it now.

782
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,288
Roll in strike package Bravo
on unknown target.

783
00:42:47,468 --> 00:42:49,279
I authenticate Tango Whiskey

784
00:42:49,303 --> 00:42:51,219
at time 0300 Zulu.

785
00:42:51,244 --> 00:42:54,219
<i>Attention all aircraft. This will be
a danger close-fire mission.</i>

786
00:42:54,244 --> 00:42:55,729
<i>Weapons, I just got a call
from Falcon Ops.</i>

787
00:42:55,754 --> 00:42:57,449
<i>Who is closer to Kill Box One Alpha?</i>

788
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:58,230
Send the Hogs, sir.

789
00:42:58,254 --> 00:43:00,804
<i>Ok, send the Hogs over to Kill
Box One Alpha. It's a danger close...</i>

790
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,649
<i>Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha,</i>

791
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:03,737
<i>300 feet danger close.</i>

792
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:04,754
<i>Friendlies in the area.</i>

793
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,230
7-man team north of orange smoke!

794
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:10,576
Received Kill Box One Alpha.

795
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,801
Engage hostile.

796
00:43:14,439 --> 00:43:15,915
Attack direction west!

797
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:17,346
You are clear and hot!

798
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,129
Strike, tell me status of Hog right now.

799
00:43:22,154 --> 00:43:23,630
Hog One-One Dark Star status.

800
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,301
Lennox!

801
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,407
The heat is coming!
Laze the target!

802
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,233
We got a beam-rider incoming!
Laze target!

803
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,234
Ready! Heat is coming!
What?

804
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,208
Bring it!

805
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,585
<i>Receiving radar jamming
in vicinity of target.</i>

806
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,280
No frigging way
that thing is still not down.

807
00:44:03,305 --> 00:44:05,464
Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells.

808
00:44:05,488 --> 00:44:06,788
Bring the rain.

809
00:44:08,872 --> 00:44:11,544
<i>Be advised, ground team
is requesting 105 sabot rounds.</i>

810
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,402
Did we lose them?

811
00:44:41,427 --> 00:44:42,376
Warthog One.

812
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,833
<i>Confirm visual on friendlies.</i>

813
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,311
Where is Fig?

814
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,846
Fig? Fig?
Oh, God!

815
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,620
God damn it!
Get a medic!

816
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,817
Get a medic!

817
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:57,063
I am sorry.
Black Hawk...

818
00:44:57,088 --> 00:44:58,127
We will get a medic. Just hold on.

819
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,205
He is got a pulse. Get in there.

820
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:07,075
Bring them home.

821
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,505
You get those men stateside right now.

822
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,801
I want them debriefed in 10 hours.

823
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:23,744
There is only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.

824
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,454
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!

825
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,799
I am sorry to bother you.

826
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:43,020
I... a... Maggie?

827
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:44,280
Listen, I need your help.
No!

828
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:45,940
This is my private area,

829
00:45:45,964 --> 00:45:47,920
my place of Zen and peace.

830
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,606
Listen to me.
Glen! Who is it?

831
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:51,758
Shut up, Grandma!

832
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,268
What are you doing here?

833
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,530
Just give me a break, will you, please?

834
00:45:54,555 --> 00:45:56,648
Grand mama! Drink your prune juice!

835
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,483
What level are you on, man?
Six.

836
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,594
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

837
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,426
Glen, seriously,

838
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,279
don't you want to see something classified?

839
00:46:16,304 --> 00:46:17,971
Yeah. Get low.

840
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,796
Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.

841
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,321
Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

842
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:23,940
Hey. I need a moment.

843
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,378
Please.
Sorry.

844
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,412
Hey man, save my game.

845
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,951
How classified?

846
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,530
Like I will go to jail for the rest of my life...

847
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,166
for showing you classified.

848
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:37,241
Yes!

849
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:38,504
One quick peek.

850
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:42,259
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

851
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,891
I want to see it.
Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

852
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,700
The rangers are en route with the imager,

853
00:46:46,725 --> 00:46:48,625
but we also have a security issue.

854
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,102
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

855
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:52,788
of the network intrusion signal.

856
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:59,011
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

857
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,931
It hacked the national military air-guard

858
00:47:00,955 --> 00:47:02,640
frequency in less than a minute.

859
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,842
No way.
Yeah.

860
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,565
Looks like there is a message
embedded in the signal.

861
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:11,433
Let me work my magic.

862
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,025
Project Iceman?

863
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,451
What's Sector 7?

864
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,459
Who is Captain Witwicky?

865
00:47:23,151 --> 00:47:25,483
Are you playing
those video games again?

866
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,601
Cops! Cops!

867
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,433
FBI! Clear right!

868
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,644
Lock it down! Lock it down!

869
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:37,910
Cops!

870
00:47:38,193 --> 00:47:39,353
Lock it down.

871
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,680
Wait! I am just a cousin!

872
00:47:41,704 --> 00:47:43,048
I am just a cous...

873
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:45,934
Get off my Grand mama's carpet!

874
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:47,915
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

875
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,567
Especially police!

876
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,831
<i>It was an awesome spectacle here
an hour ago,</i>

877
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,213
<i>when over 40 C-17s</i>

878
00:47:55,237 --> 00:47:56,873
<i>lifted off of this very base.</i>

879
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,178
<i>We are not told where they are going.</i>

880
00:47:59,663 --> 00:48:01,075
<i>The government has been very quiet,</i>
Morning Mo.

881
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:02,159
<i>About what's going on.</i>

882
00:48:02,184 --> 00:48:03,926
<i>But in our opinion, they were</i>
Mojo. Mojo.

883
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:05,716
<i>Headed directly towards North Korea.</i>

884
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,680
Stop with the barking, Mojo.

885
00:48:07,704 --> 00:48:08,855
It's too early. Please?

886
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,751
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

887
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,673
My car, it stole itself, ok?

888
00:48:16,697 --> 00:48:17,949
What are you talking about, man?

889
00:48:17,974 --> 00:48:19,426
Satan's Camaro.

890
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,141
In my yard.
It's stalking me.

891
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,729
Stop!

892
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,347
No, no, no, no, no, no.

893
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,207
Oh, my God!

894
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,017
Sam?

895
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,022
Hi.

896
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,329
That was... That was really...

897
00:48:47,647 --> 00:48:48,701
awesome.

898
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,059
Well, it felt awesome.
Are you ok?

899
00:48:51,084 --> 00:48:53,038
I am not ok, alright?
I am losing my mind a little bit.

900
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,928
I am getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

901
00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:57,521
You know what?
I am gonna catch up with you guys later.

902
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:31,852
Oh, great. Cops.

903
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,034
Officer!

904
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,537
Listen!

905
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:44,056
Oh, that hurt.

906
00:49:47,456 --> 00:49:49,224
Listen to me!
Thank God you...

907
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:51,764
I have had the worst day ever!
I have been...

908
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:53,092
I have been followed here

909
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:54,917
on my mother's bike! Right?

910
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,619
And my car is right there
and it's been following me here!

911
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,026
So get out of the car!

912
00:50:01,213 --> 00:50:02,529
No! Stop!
Oh, God.

913
00:50:02,553 --> 00:50:04,401
Ok, ok! Ok, alright!

914
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:06,074
Ok! I am sorry! I am...

915
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:08,955
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

916
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:11,849
Ok, look, look, look!

917
00:50:11,873 --> 00:50:12,732
Stop!

918
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:19,213
Please!

919
00:50:19,237 --> 00:50:20,701
Ok, what do you want from me?

920
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:24,201
Ok.

921
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,861
Oh, God. No!

922
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:35,395
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

923
00:50:35,848 --> 00:50:36,730
Oh, my God!

924
00:50:38,356 --> 00:50:39,246
Shit!

925
00:50:42,974 --> 00:50:44,147
It's a bad dream.

926
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:48,548
Are you user name LadiesMan217?

927
00:50:48,573 --> 00:50:51,649
I don't know what you are talking about!
Are you username LadiesMan217?

928
00:50:51,893 --> 00:50:52,724
Yeah.

929
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,183
Where is eBay item 21153?

930
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,980
Where are the glasses?

931
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,705
Get back!

932
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,580
Stop!

933
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:15,805
God!

934
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,550
What is your problem, Sam?

935
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,442
Ok, there is a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

936
00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:21,733
Here he comes!

937
00:51:22,592 --> 00:51:23,993
Alright, get up.
Get up and run!

938
00:51:24,017 --> 00:51:25,489
You have to run! Ok.

939
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,813
Sam, what is that thing?

940
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:35,203
You have to get in the car. Get in.
I don't want to.

941
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:37,321
Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
Sam.

942
00:51:37,983 --> 00:51:38,875
Get in!

943
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:42,438
Go, go, go, go, go. Go!

944
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,908
Go, go, go, go!

945
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:01,313
Oh, God! We are gonna die!
We are gonna die!

946
00:52:01,338 --> 00:52:03,045
No, we are not.
No, we are not gonna die.

947
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,384
Oh, my God!
Trust me. He is a kick-ass driver!

948
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,421
Oh, my God! No!

949
00:52:07,446 --> 00:52:08,695
We are gonna die!

950
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,230
Oh, my God!

951
00:52:33,486 --> 00:52:34,612
We are locked in.

952
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,518
The car won't start.

953
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,573
At least we ditched the monster, right?

954
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,439
Ok.

955
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,509
Time to start.

956
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,428
He is got me! Oh, God!

957
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,385
He is going to kill me!

958
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,500
No, no, no!

959
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,312
Get off!

960
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,100
Kill it! Kill it!

961
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,769
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

962
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:51,298
Not so tough without a head, are you?

963
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,783
Here, come on.

964
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:14,962
What is it?

965
00:55:16,572 --> 00:55:17,923
It's a robot.

966
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,486
But like a...

967
00:55:21,163 --> 00:55:24,221
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

968
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,288
It's probably Japanese.

969
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,924
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

970
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:32,640
What are you doing?

971
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,116
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

972
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,822
Really?

973
00:55:38,116 --> 00:55:39,483
Well, do you speak robot?

974
00:55:39,508 --> 00:55:42,246
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

975
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,747
I think it wants something from me.

976
00:55:46,535 --> 00:55:47,364
What?

977
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:49,684
Well, because the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

978
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,389
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

979
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,173
Can you talk?

980
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:56,245
XM Satellite Radio...

981
00:55:56,626 --> 00:55:58,051
Digital cable brings you...

982
00:55:58,075 --> 00:55:59,743
Columbia Broadcasting System...

983
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,786
So you... You talk through the radio?

984
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,055
Thank you too.

985
00:56:03,414 --> 00:56:04,792
You are wonderful, you are wonderful.

986
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,885
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

987
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,540
Message from Starfleet, Captain...

988
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,312
Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...

989
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:12,604
Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!

990
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,529
Visitors from heaven? What...

991
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,165
What are you like an alien or something?

992
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,122
Any more questions you want to ask?

993
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,591
He wants us to get in the car.

994
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,526
And go where?

995
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,860
50 years from now,
when you are looking back at your life,

996
00:56:33,885 --> 00:56:35,877
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

997
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,985
This car is a pretty good driver.

998
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,170
I know.

999
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,562
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

1000
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,051
I am not going to sit in that seat.
He is driving.

1001
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,169
Yeah.

1002
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:19,903
You are right.

1003
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,345
Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.

1004
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:24,774
Why?

1005
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,926
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

1006
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,812
Yeah, alright.

1007
00:57:33,015 --> 00:57:33,897
Right?
Yeah.

1008
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,707
Ok.

1009
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,745
There, see? That's better.

1010
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,808
Ok.
Ok.

1011
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:47,080
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

1012
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,132
Thank you.

1013
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,799
You know what I don't understand?

1014
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,496
Why, if he is supposed to be like,
this super-advanced robot,

1015
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,475
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

1016
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,052
Oh, see, no. Get.
No, that doesn't work.

1017
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:04,949
See?

1018
00:58:04,974 --> 00:58:06,721
Move it, you moron!
Great, now...

1019
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:08,287
See?

1020
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,645
Fantastic.

1021
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,098
Now you pissed him off.

1022
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,466
That car is sensitive.

1023
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,480
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

1024
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,805
What?

1025
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:35,746
This is you...

1026
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,524
Oh, my God!

1027
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,548
Come on, let's go.

1028
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,500
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen!

1029
00:59:58,788 --> 01:00:00,157
Explosions everywhere!

1030
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:02,712
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon.

1031
01:00:02,736 --> 01:00:03,846
I swear to God!

1032
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:05,494
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

1033
01:00:21,213 --> 01:00:21,843
Sweet!

1034
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,234
Oh, dude, I hope this guy is got
asteroid insurance,

1035
01:00:24,259 --> 01:00:25,470
because he is so boned!

1036
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,212
What is that?

1037
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,878
There is something in the tree, dude.

1038
01:00:32,903 --> 01:00:34,889
No, there is something
in the thing by the tree!

1039
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:36,458
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

1040
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,225
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

1041
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,499
Hey sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

1042
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,882
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

1043
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,219
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,

1044
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:58,168
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

1045
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,670
They know your name.

1046
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,011
Yeah.

1047
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,035
My name is Optimus Prime.

1048
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:09,709
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

1049
01:03:09,826 --> 01:03:12,281
But you can call us Autobots for short.

1050
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:13,193
Autobots.

1051
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:14,940
What's cracking, little bitches?

1052
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:16,364
My first lieutenant.

1053
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,830
Designation, Jazz.

1054
01:03:18,855 --> 01:03:20,826
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

1055
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,730
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

1056
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:28,429
We have learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

1057
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:32,526
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

1058
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,591
You feeling lucky, punk?

1059
01:03:35,615 --> 01:03:37,227
Easy, Ironhide.

1060
01:03:37,252 --> 01:03:40,172
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

1061
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,789
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

1062
01:03:43,976 --> 01:03:47,849
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

1063
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,992
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

1064
01:03:53,912 --> 01:03:55,573
Bumblebee, right?

1065
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,293
Check on the rep
Yep, second to none

1066
01:03:57,318 --> 01:03:58,692
So you are my guardian?

1067
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:02,702
His vocal processors
were damaged in battle.

1068
01:04:03,202 --> 01:04:05,163
I am still working on them.

1069
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,277
Why are you here?

1070
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,755
We are here looking for the All Spark.

1071
01:04:14,156 --> 01:04:16,613
And we must find it before Megatron.

1072
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,015
Mega-what?

1073
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,980
Our planet was once a powerful empire,

1074
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,846
peaceful and just,

1075
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:37,528
until we were betrayed by Megatron,

1076
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:39,799
leader of the Decepticons.

1077
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,424
All who defied them were destroyed.

1078
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:46,788
Our war finally consumed the planet,

1079
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:50,112
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.

1080
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,169
Megatron followed it to Earth,

1081
01:04:54,499 --> 01:04:56,781
where Captain Witwicky found him.

1082
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,397
My grandfather.

1083
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,469
It was an accident,

1084
01:05:01,827 --> 01:05:03,994
that intertwined our fates.

1085
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:08,895
<i>Come back!</i>

1086
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,427
<i>I think the dogs have found something.</i>

1087
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,721
<i>The ice is cracking!</i>

1088
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,015
<i>Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!</i>

1089
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,562
<i>I am alright, lads!</i>

1090
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,322
<i>Can we throw you a rope, Captain?</i>

1091
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,388
Megatron crash-landed,

1092
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:48,319
before he could retrieve the Cube.

1093
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:52,812
<i>Men!</i>

1094
01:05:52,836 --> 01:05:55,140
<i>We have made a discovery!</i>

1095
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,249
He accidentally activated
his navigation system.

1096
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,419
The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth,

1097
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:18,908
were imprinted on his glasses.

1098
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:20,814
How did you know about his glasses?

1099
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:22,508
eBay.

1100
01:06:23,364 --> 01:06:25,386
eBay.
If the Decepticons,

1101
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,088
find the All Spark,

1102
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,725
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines,

1103
01:06:30,934 --> 01:06:32,985
and build a new army.

1104
01:06:33,127 --> 01:06:36,017
And the human race will be extinguished.

1105
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,940
Sam Witwicky,

1106
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:41,736
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

1107
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,204
Please tell me that you have those glasses.

1108
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,462
It's like a self-regenerating molecular armor.

1109
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,702
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

1110
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,075
Melted right through.

1111
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,236
Hey, are not sabots hot-loaded for like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

1112
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,713
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

1113
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,015
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

1114
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,397
Heads up!

1115
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,335
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

1116
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:14,352
Strap it down!

1117
01:07:14,608 --> 01:07:16,660
Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

1118
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,476
Alright, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

1119
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,845
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

1120
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,713
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

1121
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:28,787
You want that piece?

1122
01:07:29,374 --> 01:07:30,493
Ok, Maggie, look.

1123
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:32,522
Let me break it down to you
how it's gonna happen.

1124
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:34,837
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

1125
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:36,276
Don't fall for that, alright?

1126
01:07:37,026 --> 01:07:38,279
That's why I ate their food.

1127
01:07:38,383 --> 01:07:40,943
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

1128
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:42,667
If you don't touch it, you are guilty.

1129
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:44,840
I ate the whole plate.

1130
01:07:45,268 --> 01:07:47,327
The whole plate. Ok?

1131
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:48,719
It's me and you.

1132
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:50,788
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

1133
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:06,779
She did it!

1134
01:08:06,803 --> 01:08:08,577
She did it!
She's the one you want!

1135
01:08:08,602 --> 01:08:10,474
Alright? I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

1136
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:12,724
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

1137
01:08:12,749 --> 01:08:13,781
And then...
Glen, you freak.

1138
01:08:13,806 --> 01:08:16,036
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

1139
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:18,582
I have done nothing bad my entire life!

1140
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,786
Hey, man, I am still a virgin.

1141
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:22,019
Ok, so what?

1142
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:24,137
I have downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

1143
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:26,013
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

1144
01:08:26,038 --> 01:08:27,093
I promise!
Glen, shut up!

1145
01:08:27,118 --> 01:08:29,302
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!

1146
01:08:29,326 --> 01:08:30,952
Don't talk to me, criminal!

1147
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:35,334
Oh, sugar rush.
This is... This is not his fault.

1148
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,050
See? So can I go home now?

1149
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,305
Oh, ok. I won't.
But just listen to me.

1150
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:41,731
Ok, whoever hacked into
your military system,

1151
01:08:41,755 --> 01:08:44,208
downloaded a file, alright?
It was something about

1152
01:08:44,341 --> 01:08:46,444
someone named Witwicky and...

1153
01:08:46,468 --> 01:08:49,213
some government group, right?
Named Sector 7.

1154
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,294
You have to let me talk
to Defense Secretary Keller

1155
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:53,487
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

1156
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,731
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...</i>

1157
01:08:56,756 --> 01:08:57,990
What did he say?
What?

1158
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,697
Did he hear it too?
Yeah, Jack heard it too. Yeah.

1159
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:02,358
What does he think it is?
He thinks it's a military experiment.

1160
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:04,110
What a knucklehead.
Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

1161
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:11,108
<i>Still no official word as to what happened.</i>

1162
01:09:11,133 --> 01:09:11,927
You can see...
Yeah!

1163
01:09:11,951 --> 01:09:12,720
Call Sam.
Yeah.

1164
01:09:12,744 --> 01:09:14,168
Why?
He should be home in 15 minutes.

1165
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:15,584
Well, I will call him in 15 minutes.

1166
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,274
If you wait 15 minutes, he will be late
and you will have to ground him.

1167
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:19,926
Well, I can't ground him
if he is not late, can I?

1168
01:09:25,335 --> 01:09:26,613
I need you to stay here, alright?

1169
01:09:26,793 --> 01:09:28,103
You got to stay here
and you are gonna watch them.

1170
01:09:28,128 --> 01:09:29,557
Ok.
All of them, do you hear what I am saying?

1171
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,862
Yeah, ok, ok.
5 minutes, alright?

1172
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,027
Thanks for staying on my path.
Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

1173
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,285
The... Oh, the path. I am sorry.

1174
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:38,162
I forgot about the path. I am gonna
sweep the whole thing right now.

1175
01:09:38,186 --> 01:09:39,372
How about that?
You know, I-I...

1176
01:09:39,396 --> 01:09:40,825
I buy half your car...

1177
01:09:40,849 --> 01:09:42,083
Yeah.
Then I bail you out of jail...

1178
01:09:42,294 --> 01:09:44,512
and then I just...
decided to do all your chores.

1179
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:46,411
The chores.
Yeah. Life is great?

1180
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:49,350
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

1181
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:52,178
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I am gonna do the trash cans now.

1182
01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:53,299
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

1183
01:09:53,324 --> 01:09:55,127
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

1184
01:09:55,152 --> 01:09:56,427
I will do it.
It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

1185
01:09:56,452 --> 01:09:57,864
You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
I promise...

1186
01:09:57,889 --> 01:09:59,276
No, no, no, I am gonna do it.

1187
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:02,008
I am gonna do the trash cans and I am
gonna scrape the grill and I am gonna...

1188
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:05,338
I am gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

1189
01:10:05,363 --> 01:10:07,152
Tonight, right now?
Right now.

1190
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:08,633
The...

1191
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:11,737
I love you.

1192
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:13,070
God, I love you

1193
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:14,900
just so much right now.

1194
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:16,525
You know, Mom wanted me to ground you.

1195
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,065
You are 3 minutes late.
Right?

1196
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:20,955
Oh, well, just another thing you did
for me Dad, because you are such a...

1197
01:10:21,272 --> 01:10:22,843
swell guy.
One more thing?

1198
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:25,257
Alright, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

1199
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,338
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1200
01:10:28,363 --> 01:10:29,630
No, watch the path! Watch the path!

1201
01:10:29,654 --> 01:10:31,554
Watch the... Please, please, please.

1202
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,611
No, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

1203
01:10:34,636 --> 01:10:36,345
Sorry. My bad.
Oh, I...

1204
01:10:36,853 --> 01:10:39,248
You could... You could not wait
for 5... You could not wait for 5 minutes?

1205
01:10:39,273 --> 01:10:42,106
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

1206
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:46,367
I told you to watch them.

1207
01:10:46,391 --> 01:10:47,137
I told you.
Ok.

1208
01:10:47,162 --> 01:10:48,735
You know what, they seem
to be in a little bit of a rush.

1209
01:10:48,759 --> 01:10:49,733
Oh, this is bad.

1210
01:10:50,505 --> 01:10:51,155
No!

1211
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:55,138
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

1212
01:10:55,647 --> 01:10:56,807
Oh, wet.

1213
01:10:56,831 --> 01:10:58,338
No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

1214
01:10:58,363 --> 01:10:59,768
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.

1215
01:10:59,792 --> 01:11:01,239
This is Mojo. He is a pet of mine.

1216
01:11:01,264 --> 01:11:02,663
He is a pet. Ok? That's all.

1217
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:05,111
If you could just put the guns away.
Put the... Put them away.

1218
01:11:05,288 --> 01:11:07,543
You have a rodent infestation.
Please. A what?

1219
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:09,295
Shall I terminate?
No! No, no, no, no.

1220
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:10,663
He is not a rodent, he is a Chihuahua.

1221
01:11:10,695 --> 01:11:12,840
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We-we love...

1222
01:11:13,031 --> 01:11:14,059
Chihuahuas! Don't we?

1223
01:11:14,084 --> 01:11:15,511
He is leaked lubricants

1224
01:11:15,535 --> 01:11:16,780
all over my foot.

1225
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:19,680
He peed on you?

1226
01:11:19,704 --> 01:11:21,640
Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!

1227
01:11:21,664 --> 01:11:23,136
Bad Mojo!
I am sorry.

1228
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,718
He is got a male dominance thing.
That's all it is.

1229
01:11:25,915 --> 01:11:27,853
My foot is gonna rust.
Alright.

1230
01:11:29,713 --> 01:11:30,954
Ok, ok.

1231
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,103
Shut up and go hide!
Just hurry.

1232
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:39,547
Autobots recon.

1233
01:11:41,516 --> 01:11:43,649
I hope he is ok. He is in the kitchen.

1234
01:11:44,276 --> 01:11:45,672
Got some ice on his nose.

1235
01:11:45,877 --> 01:11:47,789
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1236
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,965
You did not.

1237
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:53,656
You didn't even ground him.
Almost, almost.

1238
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,665
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1239
01:11:58,477 --> 01:11:59,757
Come on, come on.

1240
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:05,935
What?

1241
01:12:06,253 --> 01:12:08,277
What is this?
Time is short.

1242
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:10,980
They really want those glasses.
Come on. What are you doing?

1243
01:12:11,089 --> 01:12:12,292
I am gonna help you.
Ok.

1244
01:12:12,857 --> 01:12:14,848
Please hurry.
Ok.

1245
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:18,375
Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
What do you mean?

1246
01:12:18,415 --> 01:12:19,439
My glasses were in the bag.

1247
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,452
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1248
01:12:21,477 --> 01:12:23,106
Well, they are gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1249
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:25,454
So what I think you should do is you
should... you should check this whole...

1250
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,734
This whole section here.
Alright.

1251
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,118
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I will get the corner here.

1252
01:12:29,574 --> 01:12:32,008
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1253
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,543
Sorry. That's nothing.
You just...

1254
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:34,629
You just told me to look...
I know,

1255
01:12:34,654 --> 01:12:36,156
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1256
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:39,088
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1257
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:40,745
I am already stressed out enough.

1258
01:12:41,019 --> 01:12:42,509
Ok. What now?

1259
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:46,350
No. No.

1260
01:12:47,391 --> 01:12:48,359
No, no, no.

1261
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:49,770
This isn't hiding.

1262
01:12:49,794 --> 01:12:52,298
This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1263
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,352
Oh, God.

1264
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:54,817
<i>Ok, I saw it.</i>

1265
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:57,521
<i>The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.</i>

1266
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:00,466
<i>My moped is under there, man!
Who is gonna pay for that?</i>

1267
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:03,368
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1268
01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:05,904
He is back here.
I can't deal with this. I can't...

1269
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:08,103
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1270
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:09,292
This is my mother's flower...

1271
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,776
Ok, listen. You got to listen to me.

1272
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:12,861
If my parents come out here
and see you, they are gonna freak out.

1273
01:13:12,886 --> 01:13:14,437
My mother is got a temper, ok?

1274
01:13:14,462 --> 01:13:16,020
We must have the glasses.

1275
01:13:16,054 --> 01:13:17,775
I know you need the glasses.
I have been looking everywhere.

1276
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,485
They are not here.
They are definitely not here.

1277
01:13:20,204 --> 01:13:21,296
Keep searching.

1278
01:13:21,321 --> 01:13:22,982
I need you to be quiet for 5 minutes.

1279
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:24,337
10 minutes. Ok?

1280
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:25,681
Please, I am begging you. You got to...

1281
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:27,600
You are making a racket.
I can't concentrate.

1282
01:13:27,624 --> 01:13:29,299
You want me to look and I am hearing...
Calm down, calm down.

1283
01:13:29,324 --> 01:13:31,314
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1284
01:13:31,339 --> 01:13:32,938
Autobots, fall back.
Thank you.

1285
01:13:32,962 --> 01:13:34,251
Please, for 5 minutes.

1286
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:35,903
Good? Good? Ok.

1287
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:37,470
Move!
Get away!

1288
01:13:37,495 --> 01:13:39,259
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1289
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:40,752
He wants us to be quiet.

1290
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:45,826
Earthquake!

1291
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:47,893
Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

1292
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,622
Judy!

1293
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,540
Judy, get under the table! Move it!

1294
01:13:51,782 --> 01:13:54,521
Duck and cover right now!
How did you get over there so fast?

1295
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:57,259
That was tingly!

1296
01:13:57,996 --> 01:14:00,366
You got to try that!
Yeah, that looks fun.

1297
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:06,513
Sam?

1298
01:14:06,896 --> 01:14:07,905
Sammy?

1299
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:11,762
What the hell is that?

1300
01:14:11,899 --> 01:14:13,110
I don't know.

1301
01:14:13,642 --> 01:14:15,371
Sam?
That's weird.

1302
01:14:15,511 --> 01:14:17,206
Sam!
Ratchet, point the light.

1303
01:14:17,312 --> 01:14:19,872
Come on, hurry.
Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1304
01:14:19,982 --> 01:14:21,394
What's with the light?
You got to stop the light.

1305
01:14:21,419 --> 01:14:23,127
What's going on? Turn it off.
You got to tell him to shut it off.

1306
01:14:23,152 --> 01:14:24,106
Shut it off.
Sam, are you in there?

1307
01:14:24,286 --> 01:14:25,477
How come the door is locked?

1308
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:26,909
You know the rules.

1309
01:14:26,933 --> 01:14:28,833
No doors locked in my house!

1310
01:14:29,324 --> 01:14:30,728
You know he will start counting

1311
01:14:30,753 --> 01:14:32,089
if you don't open the door!
One more chance. 5...

1312
01:14:32,127 --> 01:14:33,116
Oh, dear.

1313
01:14:33,228 --> 01:14:34,957
4. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
He is counting!

1314
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:36,462
Sam, just open the door.
3.

1315
01:14:36,565 --> 01:14:37,532
Oh, my.
2.

1316
01:14:37,633 --> 01:14:39,182
He is counting.
Stand back.

1317
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:41,965
What's up?
What's with the bat?

1318
01:14:41,989 --> 01:14:43,463
Who were you talking to?

1319
01:14:43,878 --> 01:14:44,916
I am talking to you.

1320
01:14:45,034 --> 01:14:46,964
Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1321
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:48,667
I am a child. You know, I am a teenager.

1322
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:51,166
We heard voices and noises
and we thought

1323
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:52,433
maybe you were...
It doesn't matter what we thought.

1324
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:53,644
What was that light?
No, what light?

1325
01:14:53,668 --> 01:14:54,878
What? There is no light, Dad!
There is no light!

1326
01:14:54,903 --> 01:14:56,472
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1327
01:14:56,497 --> 01:14:57,879
Maybe it bounced...
There was light under the door.

1328
01:14:57,904 --> 01:14:59,929
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1329
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:01,453
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1330
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:02,921
We knocked for 5 minutes.
I am a teenager.

1331
01:15:02,946 --> 01:15:04,172
We knocked.
You didn't knock.

1332
01:15:04,197 --> 01:15:05,866
You were screaming at me, ok?
No.

1333
01:15:05,891 --> 01:15:07,307
This is repression,
what you are doing here.

1334
01:15:07,332 --> 01:15:09,698
You are ruining my youth, ok?
Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1335
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:11,412
You are so defensive!

1336
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,454
Were you...

1337
01:15:12,962 --> 01:15:14,534
masturbating?

1338
01:15:16,156 --> 01:15:17,214
Judy?
Was I mas...

1339
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:18,396
Zip it, ok?
No Mom!

1340
01:15:18,421 --> 01:15:19,841
It's ok.
No, I don't masturbate!

1341
01:15:19,866 --> 01:15:20,927
That's not something for you to bring up.

1342
01:15:20,952 --> 01:15:22,553
That's a father-and-son thing, ok?
Father-son thing.

1343
01:15:22,589 --> 01:15:24,383
I mean, you don't have
to call it that word,

1344
01:15:24,407 --> 01:15:26,510
if that makes you uncomfortable
you can call it...

1345
01:15:27,143 --> 01:15:29,076
Sam's happy time or...

1346
01:15:29,184 --> 01:15:31,913
Happy time? Stop.
My special alone time

1347
01:15:31,937 --> 01:15:32,933
Mom.
Judy?

1348
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:33,979
Stop.
Mom, you can't...

1349
01:15:34,004 --> 01:15:34,751
I am sorry.

1350
01:15:34,776 --> 01:15:37,104
It's just been a weird night.
I have had a little bit to drink.

1351
01:15:37,129 --> 01:15:39,088
No, no, Dad.
Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1352
01:15:39,127 --> 01:15:40,666
Oh, parents.

1353
01:15:41,797 --> 01:15:43,566
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1354
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:47,906
Earthquake! It's another one!

1355
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,709
Another earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1356
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:51,780
Ok!
Aftershock! Aftershock!

1357
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,404
Oh, I hate these.

1358
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:54,585
Quick, hide.
Got to ride it out. Ride it out!

1359
01:15:54,648 --> 01:15:55,780
Hey, the lights are back on.
Hide? What?

1360
01:15:55,805 --> 01:15:57,268
Where?
Come on, get out of that tub.

1361
01:15:57,379 --> 01:15:58,900
Can't you take safety seriously?

1362
01:15:58,925 --> 01:16:01,385
Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
Oh, oh, man! Man.

1363
01:16:01,528 --> 01:16:03,184
Oh, no!

1364
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:05,229
Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1365
01:16:10,192 --> 01:16:11,096
Judy?

1366
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,770
Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1367
01:16:13,795 --> 01:16:16,286
Power pole is sparking all over the place!

1368
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:18,628
Oh, man. Yard is a waste.

1369
01:16:18,734 --> 01:16:19,563
Trashed.

1370
01:16:19,869 --> 01:16:20,711
Gone.

1371
01:16:20,736 --> 01:16:22,203
It's a wash. The whole yard.
You are kidding.

1372
01:16:22,304 --> 01:16:24,609
The parents are very irritating.

1373
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:26,297
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can I take them out?

1374
01:16:26,322 --> 01:16:29,052
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1375
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,354
What is with you?

1376
01:16:30,379 --> 01:16:32,493
Well, I am just saying we could.

1377
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:33,867
It's an option.

1378
01:16:33,892 --> 01:16:35,636
We heard you talking to somebody, Sam.

1379
01:16:35,661 --> 01:16:37,176
We wanna know who.
Mom, I told...

1380
01:16:38,086 --> 01:16:39,981
Hi. I am Mikaela.

1381
01:16:40,656 --> 01:16:43,106
I am a... I am a friend of Sam's.

1382
01:16:44,393 --> 01:16:46,006
Gosh, you are gorgeous.

1383
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:47,123
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1384
01:16:47,229 --> 01:16:50,096
She can hear you talking, Mom.
Thank you.

1385
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:53,430
Oh, my goodness. I am sorry you had
to hear our little family discussion about...

1386
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:55,233
Sorry that we are bugging you.
Do you have my backpack?

1387
01:16:55,258 --> 01:16:56,736
Come on, hon. Let's go.
Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1388
01:17:13,488 --> 01:17:14,868
Oh, yes.

1389
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,900
Ok. Ok.

1390
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,370
Yeah.
Your mom is so nice.

1391
01:17:19,027 --> 01:17:22,393
I want you to distract my parents while
I slip out and get these glasses to them, ok?

1392
01:17:28,337 --> 01:17:29,508
Ronald Wickity?

1393
01:17:29,844 --> 01:17:31,164
It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1394
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:32,914
We are the government. Sector 7.

1395
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:34,805
Never heard of it.
Never will.

1396
01:17:35,377 --> 01:17:38,071
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1397
01:17:38,096 --> 01:17:39,222
It's Witwicky.

1398
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:42,041
May I enter the premises, sir?

1399
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:43,564
Ron,

1400
01:17:43,853 --> 01:17:45,519
there is guys all over the front yard.

1401
01:17:45,752 --> 01:17:46,969
What the heck is going on here?

1402
01:17:46,994 --> 01:17:49,133
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1403
01:17:49,158 --> 01:17:51,188
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1404
01:17:51,293 --> 01:17:52,803
They are ripping up my rose bushes!
National security?

1405
01:17:52,828 --> 01:17:54,055
That's right. National security.

1406
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,810
My God, Ron, they are everywhere.

1407
01:17:55,835 --> 01:17:58,279
There is guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1408
01:17:58,304 --> 01:18:00,120
Could you stay off the grass?

1409
01:18:00,145 --> 01:18:01,785
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1410
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,437
They are pulling bushes out of the ground!

1411
01:18:03,462 --> 01:18:04,654
Good Lord!

1412
01:18:04,816 --> 01:18:06,788
They ave got to get
their hands off my bush!

1413
01:18:06,813 --> 01:18:08,456
Drop the bat, ma'am.
Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1414
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:09,812
I am carrying a loaded weapon.

1415
01:18:09,837 --> 01:18:11,369
But you would better get those guys
out of my garden

1416
01:18:11,394 --> 01:18:13,404
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1417
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:15,679
Are you experiencing any flu like symptoms?

1418
01:18:15,703 --> 01:18:17,264
Aching joints? Fever?
No!

1419
01:18:17,366 --> 01:18:18,413
What is this?

1420
01:18:18,687 --> 01:18:19,808
How you doing, son?

1421
01:18:20,054 --> 01:18:21,308
Is your name Sam?

1422
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:23,483
Yeah.
Well, I need you to come with us.

1423
01:18:23,508 --> 01:18:24,486
Way out of line.

1424
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,940
Sir, I am asking politely.

1425
01:18:27,631 --> 01:18:28,538
Back off.

1426
01:18:28,563 --> 01:18:30,463
You are not taking my son.
Really?

1427
01:18:30,733 --> 01:18:31,825
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1428
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,168
No, but I am gonna call the cops

1429
01:18:33,193 --> 01:18:35,598
because there is something fishy
going on around here.

1430
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:38,262
Yeah. There is something a little fishy
about you, your son,

1431
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:39,635
your little Taco Bell dog

1432
01:18:39,659 --> 01:18:41,726
and this whole operation
you got going on here.

1433
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,440
What operation?
That is what we are gonna find out.

1434
01:18:44,546 --> 01:18:47,106
I think direct contact.

1435
01:18:52,554 --> 01:18:54,112
Son?
Yeah.

1436
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,091
Step forward, please.
Just stand?

1437
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:05,332
14 rads.

1438
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:08,661
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1439
01:19:09,137 --> 01:19:11,245
If you hurt my dog, I will kick your ass!

1440
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:13,238
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1441
01:19:13,263 --> 01:19:14,652
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1442
01:19:14,677 --> 01:19:16,741
Yeah.
Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1443
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:21,820
So...

1444
01:19:23,405 --> 01:19:26,863
LadiesMan217.

1445
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:30,044
That is your eBay username, right?

1446
01:19:30,425 --> 01:19:32,297
Yeah, but, you know, it was a typo

1447
01:19:32,321 --> 01:19:33,828
and I ran with it.
What do you make of this?

1448
01:19:33,929 --> 01:19:36,489
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, ok?
And my...</i>

1449
01:19:36,514 --> 01:19:37,640
Is that you?

1450
01:19:37,665 --> 01:19:39,860
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1451
01:19:40,135 --> 01:19:44,845
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

1452
01:19:46,308 --> 01:19:48,517
Enlighten me.
Well, here is what I said, ok?

1453
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:51,203
Because this is a total misunderstanding

1454
01:19:51,227 --> 01:19:53,203
that my car had been stolen...

1455
01:19:53,315 --> 01:19:55,512
Really?
From me, from my home,

1456
01:19:55,537 --> 01:19:57,817
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1457
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,518
Well, not by itself.
Well, no.

1458
01:20:00,543 --> 01:20:03,612
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1459
01:20:06,973 --> 01:20:08,705
That's funny. That is so funny.

1460
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:10,347
So what do you kids know about aliens?

1461
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,755
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?

1462
01:20:13,779 --> 01:20:15,356
Like what, E.T.? No.

1463
01:20:15,381 --> 01:20:16,888
It's an urban legend.
Yeah.

1464
01:20:16,955 --> 01:20:17,959
You see this?

1465
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:20,700
This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1466
01:20:20,809 --> 01:20:23,573
Right.
I am gonna lock you up forever.

1467
01:20:23,678 --> 01:20:25,153
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1468
01:20:25,178 --> 01:20:27,413
He is just pissy because he is got
to get back to guarding the mall.

1469
01:20:27,516 --> 01:20:30,295
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1470
01:20:30,685 --> 01:20:32,778
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1471
01:20:32,888 --> 01:20:34,443
What? Parole?

1472
01:20:34,468 --> 01:20:35,277
It's nothing.

1473
01:20:35,301 --> 01:20:37,125
Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1474
01:20:37,826 --> 01:20:40,097
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1475
01:20:40,122 --> 01:20:41,754
Well, they... They were not always his.

1476
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:42,855
You stole cars?

1477
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:44,894
Well, we could not always afford
a babysitter,

1478
01:20:44,919 --> 01:20:46,563
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1479
01:20:46,668 --> 01:20:48,966
She has got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1480
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:50,333
She is a criminal.

1481
01:20:50,661 --> 01:20:52,002
Criminals are hot.

1482
01:20:52,841 --> 01:20:57,471
That had be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1483
01:20:57,579 --> 01:20:59,877
It is time to talk!

1484
01:21:06,589 --> 01:21:07,830
Big! It's big!

1485
01:21:12,794 --> 01:21:14,762
Go, go, go, go!

1486
01:21:15,197 --> 01:21:18,032
I can't see it! I can't see it!
Shift your weight towards the front!

1487
01:21:18,057 --> 01:21:19,490
Alright! Alright!

1488
01:21:33,949 --> 01:21:35,667
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1489
01:21:36,273 --> 01:21:37,421
Gentlemen,

1490
01:21:38,058 --> 01:21:39,633
I want to introduce you to my friend,

1491
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:42,933
Optimus Prime.

1492
01:21:45,126 --> 01:21:48,803
Taking the children, was a bad move.

1493
01:21:48,997 --> 01:21:50,185
Autobots,

1494
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,365
relieve them of their weapons.

1495
01:21:56,004 --> 01:21:57,144
Freeze!

1496
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:00,021
Give me those!

1497
01:22:14,222 --> 01:22:15,354
Hi, there.

1498
01:22:15,857 --> 01:22:18,130
You don't seem afraid.

1499
01:22:18,497 --> 01:22:20,737
Are you not surprised to see us?

1500
01:22:21,296 --> 01:22:22,050
Look,

1501
01:22:22,628 --> 01:22:25,010
there are seven protocols,

1502
01:22:25,698 --> 01:22:26,471
ok?

1503
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:28,450
I am not authorized
to communicate with you

1504
01:22:28,475 --> 01:22:30,466
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1505
01:22:30,572 --> 01:22:33,166
Get out of the car.
Alright.

1506
01:22:33,808 --> 01:22:34,934
Me? You want me to get...
Now!

1507
01:22:34,959 --> 01:22:36,449
Alright, alright. Get out. Hey.

1508
01:22:36,645 --> 01:22:38,567
Alright, I am... I am getting out.

1509
01:22:38,591 --> 01:22:40,012
I am. I am getting out. You see?

1510
01:22:40,474 --> 01:22:42,904
Very nifty how you put us down
without, really...

1511
01:22:43,138 --> 01:22:43,927
killing us.

1512
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,297
You are good with handcuffs too now?

1513
01:22:45,353 --> 01:22:46,342
How you doing?

1514
01:22:46,454 --> 01:22:48,183
You were not supposed to hear all that.
How is it going?

1515
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:49,119
Yeah.

1516
01:22:49,551 --> 01:22:50,533
This is real.

1517
01:22:53,828 --> 01:22:54,541
Sam,

1518
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:57,495
I have a record because
I would not turn my dad in.

1519
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:01,806
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1520
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,797
Big guys. Big guys with big guns?

1521
01:23:05,822 --> 01:23:07,029
What is Sector 7?

1522
01:23:08,072 --> 01:23:10,322
Answer me.
I am the one who asks questions around here.

1523
01:23:10,434 --> 01:23:11,587
Not you, young man!

1524
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,652
How did you know about the aliens?
Where did you take my parents?

1525
01:23:13,677 --> 01:23:15,668
I am not at liberty to discuss it.
No?

1526
01:23:15,693 --> 01:23:17,731
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1527
01:23:17,756 --> 01:23:19,485
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1528
01:23:19,521 --> 01:23:22,478
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1529
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:24,685
Where is Sector 7?
Would not you like to know?

1530
01:23:30,932 --> 01:23:31,963
Hey! Hey!

1531
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,127
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1532
01:23:35,161 --> 01:23:37,064
Get that thing to stop?

1533
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,961
Alright, tough guy, take it off.

1534
01:23:40,299 --> 01:23:41,518
What are you talking about?

1535
01:23:41,843 --> 01:23:43,381
Your clothes all of it, off.

1536
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:44,940
For what?

1537
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,315
For threatening my dad.

1538
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:51,723
Little lady,

1539
01:23:52,052 --> 01:23:53,892
this is the beginning...

1540
01:23:54,766 --> 01:23:56,778
of the end of your life.

1541
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,453
You are a criminal.

1542
01:24:00,695 --> 01:24:02,852
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1543
01:24:04,966 --> 01:24:06,112
Those are nice.

1544
01:24:06,653 --> 01:24:07,799
Now get behind the pole.

1545
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:09,741
Alright.
This is such a felony,

1546
01:24:09,765 --> 01:24:10,856
what you are doing.

1547
01:24:13,141 --> 01:24:15,041
I will hunt you down, ok?
He will hunt you down.

1548
01:24:15,176 --> 01:24:17,180
Without any remorse!
No remorse.

1549
01:24:17,445 --> 01:24:18,547
Enjoy.
Ok?

1550
01:24:19,078 --> 01:24:21,211
We have got to alert everyone.

1551
01:24:21,235 --> 01:24:23,495
They already know. Speaker.

1552
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:31,607
Optimus! Incoming!

1553
01:24:39,434 --> 01:24:40,329
Roll out.

1554
01:24:47,575 --> 01:24:50,908
<i>Ok, I am picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.</i>

1555
01:24:54,078 --> 01:24:56,664
<i>Ok, I am getting really good rad
readings. 42 and higher.</i>

1556
01:24:57,285 --> 01:24:58,485
Up you get.

1557
01:25:03,519 --> 01:25:04,968
<i>Ok, we are dropping in.</i>

1558
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:11,924
<i>Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.</i>

1559
01:25:12,033 --> 01:25:13,681
<i>Ship one and two, come on in.</i>

1560
01:25:15,532 --> 01:25:17,898
<i>That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.</i>

1561
01:25:18,006 --> 01:25:20,602
<i>Ok, there he is. 11.30.11.30.
Right off the nose.</i>

1562
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:23,368
<i>I got it. 12 o'clock</i>

1563
01:25:27,449 --> 01:25:29,014
<i>Ok, I am tracking him. 
I have got him.</i>

1564
01:25:32,141 --> 01:25:33,774
<i>Got him going down the street.</i>

1565
01:25:37,659 --> 01:25:39,456
<i>Ok. Where did he go, guys? 
I lost him.</i>

1566
01:25:39,948 --> 01:25:41,924
<i>Got no IR signature. 
Where did he go?</i>

1567
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:44,323
<i>Ok, I lost him. I lost him.</i>

1568
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,487
<i>Ok, we are coming around.</i>

1569
01:26:09,991 --> 01:26:11,282
Easy, you two.

1570
01:26:20,902 --> 01:26:22,415
No! No! No, Sam!

1571
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:24,011
Sam, don't drop me!

1572
01:26:24,806 --> 01:26:26,419
Sam, don't! Sam, don't!

1573
01:26:26,443 --> 01:26:27,798
I am slipping!
I am slipping!

1574
01:26:29,121 --> 01:26:30,131
Hold on!

1575
01:26:30,155 --> 01:26:31,386
No!

1576
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:35,714
Sam!

1577
01:26:41,656 --> 01:26:44,065
<i>Alright, we have got him pinned.
We have got him pinned in the river.</i>

1578
01:26:44,893 --> 01:26:46,155
<i>I am in for the shot.</i>

1579
01:26:46,261 --> 01:26:47,694
Stop! Stop!

1580
01:26:48,897 --> 01:26:49,818
Wait!

1581
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,022
No!

1582
01:26:54,068 --> 01:26:56,278
<i>Take the shot, get him.
Take the shot.</i>

1583
01:26:57,238 --> 01:26:58,432
No!

1584
01:27:14,522 --> 01:27:15,218
No!

1585
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:16,778
Stop!

1586
01:27:17,225 --> 01:27:18,380
Stop!

1587
01:27:19,127 --> 01:27:20,723
<i>Get down on the ground!</i>

1588
01:27:20,747 --> 01:27:22,458
Get down!
Get down!

1589
01:27:23,565 --> 01:27:24,744
What? Ok.

1590
01:27:26,768 --> 01:27:28,658
Look, he is not fighting back!

1591
01:27:29,537 --> 01:27:31,732
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1592
01:27:38,112 --> 01:27:39,501
Stop hurting him!

1593
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:50,379
Don't let him move!

1594
01:27:51,526 --> 01:27:52,855
I got him here!

1595
01:28:16,284 --> 01:28:17,151
No!

1596
01:28:21,356 --> 01:28:22,813
Happy to see me again?

1597
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:26,742
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1598
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:36,052
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1599
01:28:44,512 --> 01:28:46,526
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1600
01:28:49,617 --> 01:28:50,722
Optimus,

1601
01:28:53,385 --> 01:28:55,578
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1602
01:28:55,923 --> 01:28:59,164
There is no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1603
01:28:59,727 --> 01:29:01,525
But it's not right. He...
Let them leave.

1604
01:29:14,704 --> 01:29:17,070
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1605
01:29:17,095 --> 01:29:18,221
in the western Pacific.

1606
01:29:18,246 --> 01:29:20,441
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1607
01:29:20,548 --> 01:29:23,510
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1608
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:30,834
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1609
01:29:30,859 --> 01:29:32,035
of cruise missile range.

1610
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:35,757
Tell the strike group commander that
he is not to engage unless fired on first.

1611
01:29:35,782 --> 01:29:37,625
Yes, sir!
Mr. Secretary?

1612
01:29:40,068 --> 01:29:41,197
Tom Banachek.

1613
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:42,949
I am with Sector 7,

1614
01:29:42,973 --> 01:29:44,755
Advanced Research Division.

1615
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:46,244
Never heard of it.

1616
01:29:46,268 --> 01:29:48,436
I am a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

1617
01:29:51,579 --> 01:29:53,756
What's going on here?
I don't know.

1618
01:29:57,719 --> 01:29:58,548
Sit rep!

1619
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:00,540
Talk to me!

1620
01:30:00,565 --> 01:30:02,965
The whole room is gone down, sir.
I can see that!

1621
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:04,796
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1622
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:05,805
General?

1623
01:30:06,188 --> 01:30:07,324
I will take a seat.

1624
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:09,357
What do you mean, shut us down?

1625
01:30:09,382 --> 01:30:11,916
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1626
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,654
The blackout is global.

1627
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,650
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1628
01:30:16,675 --> 01:30:19,110
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone

1629
01:30:19,298 --> 01:30:20,745
and call my family?

1630
01:30:27,014 --> 01:30:28,202
Mr. Secretary?

1631
01:30:29,186 --> 01:30:31,572
I am here under
direct order from the President.

1632
01:30:33,321 --> 01:30:35,687
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1633
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,487
You will have to accept that
there are certain things

1634
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:42,202
you won't understand right away.

1635
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:45,655
Sector 7 is a special-access
division of the government

1636
01:30:46,067 --> 01:30:49,168
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1637
01:30:50,338 --> 01:30:54,234
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1638
01:30:55,543 --> 01:30:58,066
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure.

1639
01:30:58,488 --> 01:30:59,707
It was not.

1640
01:31:00,281 --> 01:31:02,424
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1641
01:31:03,284 --> 01:31:05,809
This was classified above top secret.

1642
01:31:20,802 --> 01:31:23,430
<i>EDA ended at 170 hours...</i>

1643
01:31:23,538 --> 01:31:25,809
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1644
01:31:27,441 --> 01:31:29,098
This is the image from Mars.

1645
01:31:30,378 --> 01:31:32,354
Here is the image your
Special Ops team,

1646
01:31:32,379 --> 01:31:34,362
was able to retrieve
from the base attack.

1647
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:38,877
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1648
01:31:39,754 --> 01:31:42,036
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1649
01:31:42,924 --> 01:31:44,153
Are we talking about...

1650
01:31:44,908 --> 01:31:46,906
an invasion?
We intercepted the message

1651
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:48,455
from your Special Ops team.

1652
01:31:48,896 --> 01:31:51,853
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1653
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:54,223
That's why the virus shut us down,

1654
01:31:54,248 --> 01:31:56,793
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1655
01:31:57,572 --> 01:32:00,711
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming...

1656
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:02,251
soon.

1657
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:08,435
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1658
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:09,887
It's a shortwave radio channel.

1659
01:32:09,911 --> 01:32:11,587
It might be still working.

1660
01:32:11,886 --> 01:32:13,891
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home.

1661
01:32:13,915 --> 01:32:14,884
ASAP!

1662
01:32:15,323 --> 01:32:16,686
And inform all commands,

1663
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:18,494
to prepare for imminent attack.

1664
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:31,848
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1665
01:32:31,873 --> 01:32:32,840
Let's go!

1666
01:32:37,879 --> 01:32:38,899
She is in here.

1667
01:32:39,747 --> 01:32:41,000
What's going on?

1668
01:32:41,949 --> 01:32:43,243
You are coming with me.

1669
01:32:44,218 --> 01:32:45,548
You are going to be my advisor.

1670
01:32:45,822 --> 01:32:46,861
Me, too?

1671
01:32:47,922 --> 01:32:48,892
Who is this?

1672
01:32:50,024 --> 01:32:51,387
He is my advisor.

1673
01:32:52,457 --> 01:32:53,462
He comes, too.

1674
01:33:04,405 --> 01:33:05,109
So...

1675
01:33:05,892 --> 01:33:07,153
What did they get you for?

1676
01:33:07,975 --> 01:33:09,128
I bought a car.

1677
01:33:10,726 --> 01:33:12,241
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1678
01:33:13,981 --> 01:33:14,937
Who knew?

1679
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:33,598
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1680
01:33:44,612 --> 01:33:45,608
Please,

1681
01:33:45,632 --> 01:33:46,978
let this work.

1682
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:50,510
Fire it up, Optimus.

1683
01:33:51,619 --> 01:33:53,109
The code.

1684
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:58,766
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1685
01:34:00,428 --> 01:34:04,228
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1686
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:07,219
They must know it's here, as well.

1687
01:34:07,347 --> 01:34:08,678
What about Bumblebee?

1688
01:34:08,992 --> 01:34:10,591
We can't just leave him to die,

1689
01:34:10,615 --> 01:34:12,764
and become some human experiment!

1690
01:34:12,873 --> 01:34:16,304
He will die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1691
01:34:16,978 --> 01:34:19,433
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.

1692
01:34:19,457 --> 01:34:21,376
This is what he would want.

1693
01:34:21,401 --> 01:34:24,336
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1694
01:34:25,653 --> 01:34:26,899
They are a primitive,

1695
01:34:27,524 --> 01:34:29,168
and violent race.

1696
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:33,350
Were we so different?

1697
01:34:34,261 --> 01:34:36,075
They are a young species.

1698
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:38,302
They have much to learn.

1699
01:34:38,733 --> 01:34:40,872
But I have seen goodness in them.

1700
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:45,099
Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.

1701
01:34:45,906 --> 01:34:50,138
You all know there is only one way
to end this war.

1702
01:34:50,244 --> 01:34:52,940
We must destroy the Cube.

1703
01:34:53,748 --> 01:34:55,553
If all else fails,

1704
01:34:55,784 --> 01:34:58,499
I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1705
01:34:58,524 --> 01:34:59,976
That's suicide.

1706
01:35:00,001 --> 01:35:03,654
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1707
01:35:03,758 --> 01:35:08,006
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1708
01:35:08,329 --> 01:35:11,628
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1709
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,615
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1710
01:35:15,903 --> 01:35:18,534
Autobots, roll out!

1711
01:35:18,558 --> 01:35:19,703
We rolling!

1712
01:35:31,752 --> 01:35:33,299
Team attention!

1713
01:35:33,323 --> 01:35:34,915
Present arms!

1714
01:35:35,589 --> 01:35:36,469
At ease.

1715
01:35:36,727 --> 01:35:37,803
Captain, Sergeant.

1716
01:35:38,337 --> 01:35:39,821
Got your Intel. Excellent work.

1717
01:35:39,927 --> 01:35:41,622
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1718
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:43,856
They are being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1719
01:35:43,964 --> 01:35:45,226
If they hit us again,
we will be ready for them.

1720
01:35:45,332 --> 01:35:48,685
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1721
01:35:49,937 --> 01:35:50,934
Hey, kid.

1722
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,387
I think we got off to a bad start?

1723
01:35:55,443 --> 01:35:56,535
You must be hungry?

1724
01:35:56,644 --> 01:35:58,831
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1725
01:35:58,856 --> 01:36:00,026
Where is my car?

1726
01:36:00,481 --> 01:36:01,243
Son,

1727
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,042
I need you to listen to me very carefully.

1728
01:36:04,552 --> 01:36:05,947
People can die here.

1729
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:09,316
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1730
01:36:09,423 --> 01:36:10,279
Ok.

1731
01:36:10,724 --> 01:36:12,463
But first, I will take my car, my parents.

1732
01:36:12,487 --> 01:36:13,935
Maybe you should write that down.

1733
01:36:14,562 --> 01:36:15,883
Oh, and her juvie record.

1734
01:36:16,091 --> 01:36:17,343
That's got to be gone.

1735
01:36:18,223 --> 01:36:19,261
Like, forever.

1736
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:22,786
Come with me.
We will talk about your car.

1737
01:36:23,971 --> 01:36:25,005
Thank you.

1738
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,469
The man is an extortionist.

1739
01:36:30,211 --> 01:36:31,542
Alright, here is the situation.

1740
01:36:31,645 --> 01:36:34,045
You have all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1741
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:35,162
NBEs?

1742
01:36:35,349 --> 01:36:37,321
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.

1743
01:36:37,345 --> 01:36:38,944
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1744
01:36:39,053 --> 01:36:42,682
What you are about to see
is totally classified.

1745
01:36:51,866 --> 01:36:53,695
Dear God. What is this?

1746
01:36:55,269 --> 01:36:56,257
We think...

1747
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:58,834
when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1748
01:36:58,859 --> 01:37:01,820
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1749
01:37:02,262 --> 01:37:03,764
He crashed in the ice,

1750
01:37:03,788 --> 01:37:05,855
probably a few thousand years ago.

1751
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,625
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1752
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:12,050
We call him NBE One.

1753
01:37:12,543 --> 01:37:15,222
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know but...

1754
01:37:15,894 --> 01:37:17,129
that's Megatron.

1755
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:19,816
He is the leader of the Decepticons.

1756
01:37:20,425 --> 01:37:22,969
He has been in cryostasis since 1935.

1757
01:37:23,664 --> 01:37:25,244
Your great-great-grandfather...

1758
01:37:25,742 --> 01:37:28,667
made one of the greatest
discoveries in the history of mankind.

1759
01:37:28,769 --> 01:37:31,704
Fact is, you are looking at
the source of the modern age,

1760
01:37:31,805 --> 01:37:33,002
the microchip,

1761
01:37:33,026 --> 01:37:33,961
lasers,

1762
01:37:33,985 --> 01:37:36,380
spaceflight, cars, all reverse-engineered...

1763
01:37:37,204 --> 01:37:38,352
by studying him.

1764
01:37:38,746 --> 01:37:40,509
NBE One.

1765
01:37:41,258 --> 01:37:42,546
That's what we call it.

1766
01:37:43,278 --> 01:37:45,906
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1767
01:37:45,931 --> 01:37:48,297
that you are keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1768
01:37:48,322 --> 01:37:52,013
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1769
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:53,933
Well, you got one now.

1770
01:37:55,229 --> 01:37:56,400
So why Earth?

1771
01:37:56,424 --> 01:37:57,629
It's the All Spark.

1772
01:37:57,817 --> 01:37:59,341
All Spark? What is that?

1773
01:37:59,366 --> 01:38:01,800
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1774
01:38:02,036 --> 01:38:05,075
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron,

1775
01:38:05,699 --> 01:38:06,803
that's what they call him,

1776
01:38:06,907 --> 01:38:09,341
who is pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

1777
01:38:09,443 --> 01:38:11,123
to transform human technology

1778
01:38:11,147 --> 01:38:12,537
to take over the universe.

1779
01:38:12,646 --> 01:38:13,816
That's their plan.

1780
01:38:14,281 --> 01:38:16,430
And you are sure about that?
Yeah.

1781
01:38:19,019 --> 01:38:20,657
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1782
01:38:22,723 --> 01:38:23,849
Follow me.

1783
01:38:27,494 --> 01:38:30,343
You are about to see our crown jewel.

1784
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:42,613
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

1785
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:44,990
The first Seven,

1786
01:38:45,014 --> 01:38:47,039
didn't find it until 1913.

1787
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:51,798
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1788
01:38:51,823 --> 01:38:53,347
as well as NBE One.

1789
01:38:53,487 --> 01:38:56,047
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1790
01:38:56,156 --> 01:38:58,783
4 football fields thick of concrete.

1791
01:38:58,845 --> 01:39:02,716
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone or...

1792
01:39:03,546 --> 01:39:05,843
any alien species on the outside.

1793
01:39:44,471 --> 01:39:48,271
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1794
01:39:48,909 --> 01:39:51,400
What kind exactly?
Good question.

1795
01:39:55,983 --> 01:39:57,396
Please step inside.

1796
01:39:57,669 --> 01:39:59,099
They have to lock us in.

1797
01:40:06,612 --> 01:40:08,637
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1798
01:40:08,662 --> 01:40:09,856
Oh, no, man.

1799
01:40:09,997 --> 01:40:12,956
Freddy Krueger have 4 blades, man.
That's only 3. That's Wolverine!

1800
01:40:14,568 --> 01:40:17,003
Right? That's Wolverine!
That's very funny.

1801
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,065
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1802
01:40:22,176 --> 01:40:23,419
I got a phone.

1803
01:40:26,814 --> 01:40:29,408
Nokias are real nasty.

1804
01:40:29,516 --> 01:40:31,639
You have got to respect the Japanese.

1805
01:40:31,663 --> 01:40:33,953
They know the way of the samurai.

1806
01:40:34,755 --> 01:40:36,340
Nokia is from Finland.

1807
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:39,021
Yes, but he is, you know,

1808
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:41,887
a little strange.
He is a little strange.

1809
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:46,654
We are able to take the Cube radiation

1810
01:40:48,137 --> 01:40:49,870
and funnel it into that box.

1811
01:41:03,584 --> 01:41:04,964
Mean little sucker?

1812
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:06,962
That thing is freaky!

1813
01:41:06,987 --> 01:41:10,105
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell?

1814
01:41:21,668 --> 01:41:22,987
He is breaking the box.

1815
01:41:41,522 --> 01:41:42,648
Go! Go! Go!

1816
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:43,848
Move!

1817
01:41:52,242 --> 01:41:53,387
Gentlemen,

1818
01:41:53,778 --> 01:41:55,237
they know the Cube is here.

1819
01:41:55,803 --> 01:41:57,292
Banachek. What's going on?

1820
01:41:57,317 --> 01:41:59,280
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1821
01:41:59,305 --> 01:42:00,507
What?
<i>And the backup generator</i>

1822
01:42:00,532 --> 01:42:02,308
<i>is just not gonna cut it.</i>
Do you have an arms room?

1823
01:42:08,715 --> 01:42:10,290
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1824
01:42:12,233 --> 01:42:15,012
Get everyone 
to the NBE One chamber now!

1825
01:42:15,037 --> 01:42:16,398
The lights are out!
Move it! Move it!

1826
01:42:16,423 --> 01:42:17,263
Let's go!

1827
01:42:17,891 --> 01:42:19,654
They are popping our generators!

1828
01:42:31,672 --> 01:42:32,875
Megatron melting!

1829
01:42:35,290 --> 01:42:36,819
<i>We are losing pressure.</i>

1830
01:42:36,844 --> 01:42:38,916
Stand by! Set!

1831
01:42:39,231 --> 01:42:40,486
<i>We are losing pressure!</i>

1832
01:42:41,315 --> 01:42:44,425
<i>The cryogenic system is failing!
We are losing NBE One!</i>

1833
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:52,097
40 millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1834
01:43:01,835 --> 01:43:03,123
You got to take me to my car.

1835
01:43:03,522 --> 01:43:04,705
You have to take me to my car.

1836
01:43:04,730 --> 01:43:05,670
He is gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1837
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:07,821
Your car? It's confiscated.
Then unconfiscate it.

1838
01:43:07,846 --> 01:43:09,641
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1839
01:43:09,666 --> 01:43:11,032
You don't know.
Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1840
01:43:11,057 --> 01:43:12,586
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1841
01:43:12,611 --> 01:43:14,731
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

1842
01:43:14,756 --> 01:43:15,881
Take him to his car!

1843
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:18,951
Drop it.

1844
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:25,677
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1845
01:43:26,393 --> 01:43:28,430
There is an alien war going on
and you are gonna shoot me?

1846
01:43:28,455 --> 01:43:29,485
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1847
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:31,821
I am ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1848
01:43:31,846 --> 01:43:33,149
S-Seven don't exist.

1849
01:43:33,174 --> 01:43:34,885
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1850
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:36,839
I am gonna count to 5. Ok.
Well, I am gonna count to 3.

1851
01:43:40,674 --> 01:43:41,620
Simmons?

1852
01:43:41,932 --> 01:43:43,497
Yes, sir?
I would do what he says.

1853
01:43:44,232 --> 01:43:46,317
Losing is really not an option
for these guys.

1854
01:43:50,984 --> 01:43:51,797
Alright.

1855
01:43:52,091 --> 01:43:52,928
Ok.

1856
01:43:53,053 --> 01:43:53,674
Hey,

1857
01:43:54,092 --> 01:43:56,385
you want to lay the fate
of the world on the kid's Camaro?

1858
01:43:57,045 --> 01:43:57,847
That's cool.

1859
01:44:01,128 --> 01:44:02,390
No, no!

1860
01:44:03,363 --> 01:44:06,025
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1861
01:44:06,133 --> 01:44:08,656
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1862
01:44:10,904 --> 01:44:11,953
Are you ok?

1863
01:44:14,174 --> 01:44:15,467
They didn't hurt you, right?

1864
01:44:25,018 --> 01:44:25,914
Listen to me.

1865
01:44:25,938 --> 01:44:27,611
The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1866
01:44:31,224 --> 01:44:32,754
No, no, don't worry about them.
They are ok.

1867
01:44:32,778 --> 01:44:33,464
Right?

1868
01:44:33,489 --> 01:44:34,755
They are not gonna hurt you.

1869
01:44:35,762 --> 01:44:37,050
Just back up a little bit.

1870
01:44:37,074 --> 01:44:38,169
He is friendly. He is fine.

1871
01:44:39,399 --> 01:44:40,554
Ok, come on.

1872
01:44:40,578 --> 01:44:42,428
Put the guns down.
They are not gonna hurt you.

1873
01:44:43,018 --> 01:44:44,771
Here, come with me.
I am gonna take you to the All Spark.

1874
01:45:06,326 --> 01:45:08,248
Ok, here we go. He doing something.

1875
01:45:08,787 --> 01:45:10,115
He doing something.

1876
01:45:29,950 --> 01:45:31,281
Oh, my God.

1877
01:45:36,089 --> 01:45:37,643
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain.</i>

1878
01:45:37,668 --> 01:45:39,067
Let's get to it.

1879
01:45:39,092 --> 01:45:41,932
He is right. We stay here, we are screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1880
01:45:42,229 --> 01:45:43,789
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1881
01:45:43,814 --> 01:45:45,336
We are gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1882
01:45:45,361 --> 01:45:46,704
and we are gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1883
01:45:46,729 --> 01:45:47,600
Good! Right.

1884
01:45:47,701 --> 01:45:49,705
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1885
01:45:50,622 --> 01:45:52,681
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1886
01:45:52,706 --> 01:45:54,698
Yes. Shortwave, CB.
Right, yes.

1887
01:45:54,723 --> 01:45:56,797
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them.

1888
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:58,707
Let's move!
In the alien archive, sir!

1889
01:45:58,912 --> 01:46:00,903
The alien...
There is an old Army radio console.

1890
01:46:01,177 --> 01:46:02,824
Will it work?
Anything is possible!

1891
01:46:02,849 --> 01:46:03,887
Did you see that...

1892
01:46:03,911 --> 01:46:05,278
Alright, Sam, get it in the car!

1893
01:46:05,303 --> 01:46:07,231
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1894
01:46:07,256 --> 01:46:09,020
When we get to the city,
we are gonna find a radio,

1895
01:46:09,045 --> 01:46:10,832
and I will have Epps vector them in, ok?

1896
01:46:11,045 --> 01:46:12,076
Affirmative!

1897
01:46:12,406 --> 01:46:13,438
<i>Warning!</i>

1898
01:46:13,631 --> 01:46:16,240
<i>NBE One, cryo-containment failing.</i>

1899
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:18,820
Check that backup system!

1900
01:46:19,299 --> 01:46:20,696
The cryo is failing!

1901
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:22,197
You got to bump up the cryo!

1902
01:46:22,221 --> 01:46:23,463
The cryo is failing!

1903
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:24,894
Come on! Get out of here!

1904
01:46:25,172 --> 01:46:26,696
Heads up! Look out!

1905
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:30,108
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1906
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:31,790
This way, this way, this way!

1907
01:46:31,814 --> 01:46:33,336
Up there! Let's go!

1908
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:46,416
I am Megatron!

1909
01:47:05,143 --> 01:47:06,199
The Cube is ok?

1910
01:47:06,426 --> 01:47:08,087
Yeah, it's fine.
Well, put the seat belt on.

1911
01:47:08,112 --> 01:47:09,272
Pour it on him!

1912
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:25,208
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1913
01:47:25,233 --> 01:47:27,161
Where is the Cube?

1914
01:47:27,367 --> 01:47:29,177
The humans have taken it.

1915
01:47:32,806 --> 01:47:35,771
You fail me yet again, Starscream.

1916
01:47:35,795 --> 01:47:36,943
Get them!

1917
01:47:36,968 --> 01:47:38,435
Come on, Mags!

1918
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:41,014
Over here, sir!

1919
01:47:43,517 --> 01:47:44,946
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1920
01:47:45,685 --> 01:47:47,199
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.

1921
01:47:47,223 --> 01:47:48,286
Plugged in there.

1922
01:47:49,898 --> 01:47:50,952
We are hot!

1923
01:47:50,976 --> 01:47:52,079
We are live!

1924
01:47:52,103 --> 01:47:53,356
Where are the mikes?

1925
01:47:54,528 --> 01:47:55,517
Mikes?

1926
01:47:55,629 --> 01:47:57,222
This doesn't work without mikes, Simmons.

1927
01:47:57,247 --> 01:47:58,598
No, no, no!

1928
01:47:58,623 --> 01:47:59,798
Let's find them.

1929
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,925
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, alright?

1930
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:04,029
Ok, I will sit. I will sit.
They steal everything out of this place.

1931
01:48:04,137 --> 01:48:05,467
How do we get the signal out?

1932
01:48:05,683 --> 01:48:07,168
How do we call the Air Force?

1933
01:48:07,307 --> 01:48:08,222
Glen?

1934
01:48:08,324 --> 01:48:10,269
Glen, can you hot-wire this computer

1935
01:48:10,294 --> 01:48:12,424
to transmit a tone through the radio?

1936
01:48:12,449 --> 01:48:13,466
What good is that?

1937
01:48:13,491 --> 01:48:15,975
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1938
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,145
Ok, I will do it!

1939
01:48:17,169 --> 01:48:19,077
Turn it around.
Ok, let's see.

1940
01:48:19,586 --> 01:48:21,757
Simmons? I need a screwdriver!

1941
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,317
There is Optimus.

1942
01:48:52,686 --> 01:48:53,853
Almost done.

1943
01:48:55,989 --> 01:48:57,533
What the hell was that?

1944
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:02,297
Barricade the door!

1945
01:49:05,398 --> 01:49:06,582
Get something.

1946
01:49:06,606 --> 01:49:07,764
Watch out!

1947
01:49:08,078 --> 01:49:09,633
6, 5, 4, 6, 3.

1948
01:49:14,727 --> 01:49:15,620
Here!

1949
01:49:15,917 --> 01:49:17,110
Put some rounds in!

1950
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,119
Master search.

1951
01:49:22,353 --> 01:49:23,587
I got it!

1952
01:49:23,697 --> 01:49:25,626
We are transmitting!
Send exactly what I say!

1953
01:49:25,689 --> 01:49:27,090
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1954
01:49:27,785 --> 01:49:30,245
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1955
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:31,720
This is Defense Secretary Keller.

1956
01:49:31,744 --> 01:49:33,621
Get me NORTHCOM commander.

1957
01:49:37,163 --> 01:49:38,355
What was that?

1958
01:49:38,446 --> 01:49:40,061
Authenticate emergency action.

1959
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:41,703
Blackbird 1195...

1960
01:49:43,303 --> 01:49:45,766
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1961
01:50:10,230 --> 01:50:12,035
No, no, no, no, no.
What?

1962
01:50:12,416 --> 01:50:13,523
It's the same cop!

1963
01:50:14,805 --> 01:50:16,082
Block them, block them, block them.

1964
01:50:36,957 --> 01:50:38,061
Oh, my God.

1965
01:51:06,519 --> 01:51:07,663
Cool, Mom!

1966
01:51:33,747 --> 01:51:35,517
This is so not good.

1967
01:51:54,234 --> 01:51:55,522
He's behind the pillar!

1968
01:52:02,069 --> 01:52:03,246
Shoot that mother fuc...

1969
01:52:03,808 --> 01:52:05,114
Maggie, cover fire!

1970
01:52:08,425 --> 01:52:10,401
It's the Air Force! They are responding!

1971
01:52:14,522 --> 01:52:16,026
Sucker, burn!

1972
01:52:22,162 --> 01:52:23,054
Oh, shit!

1973
01:52:23,837 --> 01:52:26,351
Yes! They are sending F-22s to the city!

1974
01:52:27,285 --> 01:52:29,310
<i>Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.</i>

1975
01:52:30,552 --> 01:52:32,356
<i>Strike and Dark Star roll call.</i>

1976
01:52:34,908 --> 01:52:36,375
<i>Looking out the right side.</i>

1977
01:52:37,277 --> 01:52:39,138
<i>Push to Kill Box One Alpha...</i>

1978
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:47,999
Come on, let's go!

1979
01:52:48,776 --> 01:52:49,709
Mount up!

1980
01:52:50,807 --> 01:52:52,377
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1981
01:52:53,426 --> 01:52:55,621
Wait. What am I supposed
to do with these?

1982
01:52:55,728 --> 01:52:57,549
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1983
01:52:58,454 --> 01:53:01,682
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

1984
01:53:01,707 --> 01:53:03,972
I am only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1985
01:53:04,673 --> 01:53:07,027
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1986
01:53:07,959 --> 01:53:09,551
F-22 at 12 o'clock.

1987
01:53:09,576 --> 01:53:12,491
Alright, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1988
01:53:12,516 --> 01:53:14,186
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1989
01:53:16,749 --> 01:53:18,936
Air Force has arrived!
Pop smoke!

1990
01:53:19,452 --> 01:53:21,079
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1991
01:53:22,355 --> 01:53:23,647
We have you visual.

1992
01:53:25,449 --> 01:53:26,780
Green smoke is the mark.

1993
01:53:26,805 --> 01:53:30,128
Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.

1994
01:53:34,734 --> 01:53:36,532
It's Starscream!

1995
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:38,610
Please tell me you copy.

1996
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,618
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1997
01:53:45,278 --> 01:53:47,246
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1998
01:53:47,347 --> 01:53:48,977
Back up! Back up!

1999
01:53:49,001 --> 01:53:50,510
Retreat! Fall back!

2000
01:53:50,617 --> 01:53:51,845
Incoming!

2001
01:54:17,075 --> 01:54:18,872
Anybody hurt? Everyone ok?

2002
01:54:19,025 --> 01:54:20,212
Clear the area!

2003
01:54:26,119 --> 01:54:27,478
Oh, my God.

2004
01:54:28,521 --> 01:54:31,244
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

2005
01:54:31,824 --> 01:54:32,790
Your legs.

2006
01:54:34,727 --> 01:54:36,649
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!

2007
01:54:37,477 --> 01:54:38,492
You alright?

2008
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:42,258
Please get up.
Bumblebee? Get up!

2009
01:54:43,903 --> 01:54:45,097
Ratchet!

2010
01:54:47,049 --> 01:54:48,516
What the hell was that?
What are you talking about?

2011
01:54:48,541 --> 01:54:50,643
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

2012
01:54:50,682 --> 01:54:52,943
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

2013
01:54:53,046 --> 01:54:55,207
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

2014
01:54:55,315 --> 01:54:58,113
You got to get up. You are ok.
You are ok.

2015
01:54:59,385 --> 01:55:00,409
Come on!

2016
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,953
<i>Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.</i>

2017
01:55:04,424 --> 01:55:06,692
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

2018
01:55:06,792 --> 01:55:09,124
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

2019
01:55:27,455 --> 01:55:28,711
Move out! Let's go!

2020
01:55:35,088 --> 01:55:36,783
Let's go! Move!

2021
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,709
I am not gonna leave you.

2022
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:26,195
Come on, Decepticon punk!

2023
01:56:32,512 --> 01:56:34,036
Oh, my God!

2024
01:56:46,592 --> 01:56:48,526
Concentrate your fire!

2025
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:00,633
Come on. Come on.

2026
01:57:03,209 --> 01:57:04,904
Megatron!

2027
01:57:09,615 --> 01:57:11,346
It's Megatron! Retreat!

2028
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,168
Move! Fall back!

2029
01:57:17,557 --> 01:57:18,808
Fall back!

2030
01:57:25,164 --> 01:57:27,657
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

2031
01:57:27,682 --> 01:57:29,507
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

2032
01:57:29,532 --> 01:57:31,690
We need air cover down here, now!

2033
01:57:37,877 --> 01:57:39,398
Sam, help me with this.

2034
01:57:43,449 --> 01:57:45,588
That all you got, Megatron?

2035
01:57:45,612 --> 01:57:47,590
Come here, little cretin.

2036
01:57:48,012 --> 01:57:50,245
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

2037
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:52,512
No! I want two!

2038
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:54,994
What's going on?

2039
01:57:57,163 --> 01:57:59,791
Sir! That tank thing is getting back up.

2040
01:58:00,666 --> 01:58:02,455
Oh, these things just don't die.

2041
01:58:06,506 --> 01:58:07,996
Oh, we are so dead.

2042
01:58:08,107 --> 01:58:09,153
Wrap it around the head.

2043
01:58:09,543 --> 01:58:10,419
Sam!

2044
01:58:10,906 --> 01:58:11,895
Where is the Cube?

2045
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:12,933
Right there.
Ok.

2046
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:14,980
And take that and wrap it around the
base and then put it around his neck.

2047
01:58:15,081 --> 01:58:15,785
Ok?

2048
01:58:15,926 --> 01:58:17,860
Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

2049
01:58:19,185 --> 01:58:20,471
That building.

2050
01:58:24,424 --> 01:58:25,754
Ok.
What?

2051
01:58:26,325 --> 01:58:29,160
Alright, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

2052
01:58:29,395 --> 01:58:31,893
Ok, there is a tall, white building
with statues on top.

2053
01:58:31,918 --> 01:58:34,118
Go to the roof. Set the flare.
No.

2054
01:58:34,143 --> 01:58:36,077
Signal the chopper and set the flare.
No, no. I can't do this!

2055
01:58:36,102 --> 01:58:37,627
Listen to me! You are a soldier now!

2056
01:58:38,650 --> 01:58:40,505
Alright? I need you to take this Cube.

2057
01:58:40,606 --> 01:58:42,836
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

2058
01:58:42,942 --> 01:58:44,682
or a lot of people are gonna die.

2059
01:58:45,231 --> 01:58:46,357
You got to go. You got to go.

2060
01:58:46,381 --> 01:58:47,709
No, I am not leaving.
You need to go. Go.

2061
01:58:47,734 --> 01:58:49,882
No, I am not leaving till
I get Bumblebee out of here, ok?

2062
01:58:52,192 --> 01:58:53,474
Army Black Hawk requested.

2063
01:58:53,499 --> 01:58:55,877
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

2064
01:58:55,988 --> 01:58:58,107
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.

2065
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:01,396
Sam, we will protect you.
Ok.

2066
01:59:03,329 --> 01:59:05,168
Epps, where are those planes?

2067
01:59:05,894 --> 01:59:06,841
Sam!

2068
01:59:10,636 --> 01:59:11,841
No matter what happens,

2069
01:59:12,638 --> 01:59:14,487
I am really glad I got
in that car with you.

2070
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:19,887
Sam! Get to the building!

2071
01:59:19,911 --> 01:59:20,721
Move!

2072
01:59:20,746 --> 01:59:22,935
Decepticons, attack!

2073
01:59:22,959 --> 01:59:23,977
Hit it!

2074
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:28,812
Cover fire!
Move to cover!

2075
01:59:35,261 --> 01:59:36,558
Watch out!

2076
01:59:42,168 --> 01:59:44,040
Girl, get that tow truck out of here!

2077
01:59:44,064 --> 01:59:45,357
I am going! I am going!

2078
01:59:45,452 --> 01:59:46,713
Get out of here now!

2079
02:00:15,021 --> 02:00:15,988
Megatron!

2080
02:00:16,195 --> 02:00:17,495
Prime.

2081
02:00:43,029 --> 02:00:45,288
Humans don't deserve to live.

2082
02:00:45,313 --> 02:00:47,975
They deserve to choose for themselves.

2083
02:00:48,301 --> 02:00:50,946
Then you will die with them!

2084
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:58,850
Join them in extinction!

2085
02:01:17,964 --> 02:01:19,433
Keep moving, Sam!

2086
02:01:20,633 --> 02:01:21,798
Don't stop!

2087
02:01:38,165 --> 02:01:39,154
No!

2088
02:01:54,233 --> 02:01:56,326
Sam, get to the building!

2089
02:02:04,243 --> 02:02:06,736
Give me that Cube, boy!

2090
02:02:19,025 --> 02:02:21,118
Did that jerk just dent my car?

2091
02:02:42,481 --> 02:02:43,636
You are not gonna get me.

2092
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:45,025
You are not gonna get me!

2093
02:02:51,257 --> 02:02:53,354
I smell you,

2094
02:02:53,682 --> 02:02:54,689
boy!

2095
02:03:06,807 --> 02:03:07,967
Maggot!

2096
02:03:26,792 --> 02:03:28,384
Oh, no!

2097
02:03:52,952 --> 02:03:54,589
I will drive! You shoot!

2098
02:04:15,741 --> 02:04:17,187
This isn't going well!

2099
02:04:17,212 --> 02:04:18,611
Shoot! Shoot!

2100
02:05:04,390 --> 02:05:05,407
Nice shot.

2101
02:05:05,724 --> 02:05:07,321
That tank is definitely dead now.

2102
02:05:07,345 --> 02:05:09,182
Alright, let's go! We got business!

2103
02:05:19,672 --> 02:05:20,523
Hey!

2104
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:25,089
Hey!

2105
02:05:25,511 --> 02:05:27,686
I am over here!

2106
02:05:39,992 --> 02:05:41,687
We have got the boy.

2107
02:05:46,298 --> 02:05:47,622
Watch out!

2108
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:49,130
Missile!

2109
02:05:59,981 --> 02:06:01,414
Hang on, Sam!

2110
02:06:09,955 --> 02:06:10,785
No!

2111
02:06:16,996 --> 02:06:19,977
Is it fear or courage,

2112
02:06:20,001 --> 02:06:22,509
that compels you, fleshling?

2113
02:06:35,581 --> 02:06:36,779
Where do I go?

2114
02:06:38,384 --> 02:06:40,265
Give me the All Spark

2115
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:42,558
and you may live to be my pet.

2116
02:06:43,656 --> 02:06:45,283
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2117
02:06:49,461 --> 02:06:51,837
I am never giving you this All Spark!

2118
02:06:52,031 --> 02:06:55,087
Oh, so unwise.

2119
02:07:06,779 --> 02:07:08,591
I got you, boy.

2120
02:07:10,082 --> 02:07:11,685
Hold on to the Cube!

2121
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:32,841
Oh, no. Oh, no!

2122
02:07:32,951 --> 02:07:34,523
Disgusting.

2123
02:07:39,445 --> 02:07:40,469
Sam?

2124
02:07:44,897 --> 02:07:48,128
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

2125
02:07:48,721 --> 02:07:50,000
No sacrifice,

2126
02:07:51,557 --> 02:07:52,528
no victory.

2127
02:07:52,552 --> 02:07:54,617
If I cannot defeat Megatron,

2128
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,451
you must push the Cube into my chest.

2129
02:07:57,863 --> 02:08:01,152
I will sacrifice myself, to destroy it.

2130
02:08:01,533 --> 02:08:02,870
Get behind me.

2131
02:08:04,703 --> 02:08:07,465
It's you and me, Megatron.

2132
02:08:07,490 --> 02:08:10,617
No, it's just me, Prime.

2133
02:08:12,745 --> 02:08:14,258
At the end of this day,

2134
02:08:14,617 --> 02:08:16,260
one shall stand,

2135
02:08:16,557 --> 02:08:18,158
one shall fall.

2136
02:08:23,288 --> 02:08:25,728
You still fight for the weak!

2137
02:08:25,752 --> 02:08:28,343
That is why you lose!

2138
02:08:47,279 --> 02:08:48,876
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

2139
02:08:49,782 --> 02:08:52,353
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

2140
02:08:52,378 --> 02:08:53,205
Hey.

2141
02:08:54,718 --> 02:08:55,999
Bring the rain.

2142
02:08:57,156 --> 02:08:58,679
Alright, let's kill these things.

2143
02:09:01,212 --> 02:09:02,770
Move, move, move!
Remember, aim low.

2144
02:09:02,795 --> 02:09:04,537
Armor is weak under the chest.

2145
02:09:14,873 --> 02:09:16,431
Target marked. Still waiting.

2146
02:09:16,542 --> 02:09:18,266
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

2147
02:09:25,517 --> 02:09:27,536
F-22s, we are still waiting.

2148
02:09:32,858 --> 02:09:33,880
Move out!

2149
02:09:37,529 --> 02:09:38,757
Incoming!

2150
02:09:47,306 --> 02:09:49,120
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

2151
02:10:08,060 --> 02:10:09,891
Run! Move!

2152
02:10:17,402 --> 02:10:18,800
<i>Second wave is on approach.</i>

2153
02:10:22,441 --> 02:10:24,033
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

2154
02:10:24,143 --> 02:10:26,611
<i>Copy.
It's either a massive amount of...</i>

2155
02:10:35,354 --> 02:10:37,339
<i>Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!</i>

2156
02:10:41,593 --> 02:10:43,480
<i>Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.</i>

2157
02:10:44,062 --> 02:10:45,073
Take him out!

2158
02:10:59,578 --> 02:11:00,757
Two is down!

2159
02:11:10,355 --> 02:11:11,910
I will kill you!

2160
02:11:12,391 --> 02:11:13,516
Mine!

2161
02:11:14,047 --> 02:11:15,418
All Spark!

2162
02:11:16,128 --> 02:11:16,982
Sam! Put

2163
02:11:17,006 --> 02:11:19,098
the Cube in my chest! Now!

2164
02:11:19,698 --> 02:11:20,540
Sam!

2165
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:22,794
No, Sam!

2166
02:11:48,627 --> 02:11:49,622
Hold up.

2167
02:11:52,898 --> 02:11:55,867
You left me no choice, brother.

2168
02:12:05,477 --> 02:12:06,448
Sam,

2169
02:12:06,713 --> 02:12:08,585
I owe you my life.

2170
02:12:09,481 --> 02:12:11,210
We are in your debt.

2171
02:12:30,736 --> 02:12:33,136
Prime, we could not save him.

2172
02:12:34,006 --> 02:12:35,303
Jazz.

2173
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:40,705
We lost a great comrade

2174
02:12:42,047 --> 02:12:43,912
but gained new ones.

2175
02:12:44,182 --> 02:12:46,480
Thank you, all of you.

2176
02:12:46,818 --> 02:12:49,184
You honor us with your bravery.

2177
02:12:50,222 --> 02:12:51,891
Permission to speak, sir?

2178
02:12:52,691 --> 02:12:55,776
Permission granted, old friend.

2179
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:57,138
You speak now?

2180
02:12:58,063 --> 02:13:00,156
I wish to stay with the boy.

2181
02:13:01,033 --> 02:13:02,864
If that is his choice.

2182
02:13:07,806 --> 02:13:08,830
Yes.

2183
02:13:29,494 --> 02:13:30,501
Gentlemen,

2184
02:13:30,525 --> 02:13:32,826
the President has ordered Sector 7...

2185
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:34,536
be terminated

2186
02:13:34,766 --> 02:13:36,580
and the remains of the dead aliens

2187
02:13:36,735 --> 02:13:37,923
disposed of.

2188
02:13:38,437 --> 02:13:39,917
The Laurentian Abyss,

2189
02:13:40,191 --> 02:13:41,963
is 7 miles below sea level,

2190
02:13:41,988 --> 02:13:43,425
deepest place on our planet.

2191
02:13:44,261 --> 02:13:47,949
The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,

2192
02:13:48,047 --> 02:13:49,738
would crush and entomb them,

2193
02:13:51,817 --> 02:13:53,293
leaving no evidence.

02:15:18,358 --> 02:15:23,386
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

2215
02:15:26,244 --> 02:15:27,566
Do you know what?

2216
02:15:27,590 --> 02:15:28,984
I think that...

2217
02:15:29,589 --> 02:15:31,683
if there was some sort of an alien

2218
02:15:32,350 --> 02:15:34,113
infestation...
Yeah.

2219
02:15:34,619 --> 02:15:36,941
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

2220
02:15:37,155 --> 02:15:38,816
The government would let us know.

2221
02:15:38,990 --> 02:15:40,582
I mean, this is America.
Yeah.

2222
02:15:40,692 --> 02:15:43,410
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

2223
02:15:43,442 --> 02:15:44,938
because there is no secrets.

2224
02:15:44,963 --> 02:15:47,270
