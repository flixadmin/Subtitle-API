1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,804
Jackie: If the Hana fuda
cards are correct,

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,673
then the next <i> oni</i> mask...

3
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,808
Has gotta be...There!

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:15,414
Where is card indicating
mask removal ingredient?

5
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,449
Right here, unc.
Whoop--

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,018
aiyaa!

7
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,121
(All gasp)

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,927
Whew!

9
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,396
Snatched from the jaws
of defeat.

10
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:31,530
Whoa!

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,934
Well, at least you guys
got a good look

12
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,537
at the ingredient
on the card...Right?

13
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,841
Heh heh.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,261
No removal ingredient?
No problem.

15
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,063
We just make mega-sure

16
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,532
no one wears the mask
this time. Right?

17
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,170
(Gasp)

18
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,312
Dark magic
resides here.

19
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,048
Quickly, we must
find mask before--

20
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,416
hey, wait a sec.

21
00:01:57,418 --> 00:02:00,285
I've seen this place...
On TV!

22
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,321
We're in miss Kimber's
psychic shack.

23
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,956
Miss who's
psychic what?

24
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,159
Miss Kimber,
from the psychic hot line.

25
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,227
Duh.

26
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,294
Pfft!

27
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,762
No one can see future.

28
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,064
All psychics are--

29
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,500
phonies?
Ha ha ha ha ha.

30
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,568
I knew you was gonna
say that.

31
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,739
Whoa!
She's good!

32
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,107
A cheap trick.

33
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,610
Fortune teller
saw us approach.

34
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:28,247
Hmm. But she's
very skilled
dollmaker.

35
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:32,217
You are here
for the mask, hmm?

36
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,387
(Gasp) How do you
know this?

37
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,890
The boy's not too quick
on the uptake, huh?

38
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,491
I'm psychic, hon.

39
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,626
Ho ho ho.

40
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,361
Then I guess you knew
we'd be taking it.

41
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,428
Thank you.

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,596
Hmm.

43
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,232
The stars don't say
you take it, sugar.

44
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,301
He does.

45
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,903
Jackie, Jade: Hak foo?

46
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,572
(Scoffs)
Stars do not talk.

47
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,008
Hak foo:
So <i> that</i> is the mask...

48
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,544
Destined for my face.

49
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,512
Jackie, take mask!

50
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,849
I knew he was going
to say that, too.

51
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,423
Whoa!

52
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,325
Whoo! Aah! Oh!

53
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,360
Oh, sorry. Aah!

54
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,804
Jade: Faster, Jackie,
he's gaining!

55
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,306
Jade! This is...

56
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:28,507
Dangerous?

57
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,676
Hey, I must be psychic.

58
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,246
And what do you think
you're whipping up, sugar?

59
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,348
If you can truly
see future,

60
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,884
you would know
uncle is devising
removal spell

61
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,386
in case mask is worn
by hak foo.

62
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,322
Only...Uncle
must learn

63
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:46,325
of missing
key ingredient.

64
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,460
(Gasp) You hear that?

65
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,162
The stars are talking.

66
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:53,465
And they say you can have
the answer you seek

67
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:57,836
revealed by yours truly
for only 9.95 a minute.

68
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,238
(Gasp)
You are fraud...

69
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,206
And money grubber!

70
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,349
Unh!
Unh!

71
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,052
Whoa!

72
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,520
All hands on deck!

73
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,022
Hyah!

74
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,523
Unh! Unh!

75
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:21,860
Whoa!

76
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,963
Uhh!

77
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,741
Hyah!

78
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,676
Aah! Ooh!

79
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:43,215
Uh, not too much
off the top, please.

80
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,850
Let him go!

81
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,953
Uh, Jade,
who is steering?

82
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,655
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

83
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,957
And here is prediction
for you:

84
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,294
I see piece of uncle
in your future!

85
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,828
Whenever you're done, hon,

86
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,032
you're gonna want to scooch
a tad to the left.

87
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,933
(Boat approaching)

88
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,503
Whoa!
Aah!
Whoa!

89
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,977
Unh!
Oh!

90
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,779
Whoa! Unh!

91
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,114
Mud slide!

92
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,717
(Groaning)

93
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,320
Jade, where is
the mask?

94
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,391
At last!

95
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,460
Uh...Found it.

96
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,629
And now, chans,

97
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,098
prepare to meet
the fiercest tribe

98
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,334
of shadowkhan yet--

99
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:36,968
mine.

100
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,605
Demon summons
ninja army!

101
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,973
(Both gasp)

102
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,849
They--they are--

103
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,017
they are so...

104
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,486
Cute!

105
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,988
(Growling)

106
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,827
Demon compensates
for inferior ninja army!

107
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,863
Unh! Ooh!

108
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,499
Uhh! Uh!

109
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,868
No!
Aah!

110
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,871
Jackie, grab on!

111
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,342
Jackie!

112
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:21,913
I will not see you later,
alligator.

113
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,115
(Grumbling)

114
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,750
...little shrimps!

115
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,520
Jackie?

116
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,391
(Gasping for air)

117
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,494
Ah, Jackie,

118
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:36,695
you are trying
to find card

119
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,597
with mask removal
ingredient?

120
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,599
No, uncle.

121
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:44,603
I am trying
not to become
alligator bait!

122
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,905
Well, you must learn
to multi-task.

123
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,876
Now come.
We must research
mask removal ingre--

124
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:57,783
ah...Teeny tiny
shadowkhan.

125
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,257
Mmm...Milk and--

126
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,027
uncle: Tohru! Research!

127
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,264
Crumbs.

128
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,932
Oh...I hope
you do not mind

129
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,034
if we roll out
the futons.

130
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,869
Jade: Good night.

131
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,704
This is monumental.

132
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:24,109
Never before
have we captured
a shadowkhan.

133
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,979
It is...So cute!

134
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,482
Do not be deceived
by appearances.

135
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,851
Uncle will bring
Japanese reference book

136
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,753
so you can get busy.

137
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:40,125
Who knows what close study
of our captive may uncover.

138
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,595
(Sighs) Yes, <i> sensei.</i>

139
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,530
(Glass jar rattles)

140
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,746
Cookie-eating
shadowkhan.

141
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,251
Huh?

142
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,786
My shadow!

143
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,066
Ohh...

144
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,434
<i>Sensei.</i>

145
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,936
One more thing.

146
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,338
Keep blowfish handy.

147
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,405
Cannot be
too careful with--

148
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,040
(thud)

149
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,879
(Gasp) Ooh.

150
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,514
(Tohru snoring)

151
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,149
(Glass jar clinks)

152
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,285
(Gasp)

153
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,620
(Growling)

154
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,023
Aiyaaa!

155
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,662
(Snarling)

156
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,764
(Gasp)

157
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,266
Aah!

158
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,336
Uncle!

159
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,171
(Growling)

160
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,873
(Growling)

161
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,044
Jackie, fire blowfish!

162
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,449
Uncle is waiting!

163
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,018
Jade: I got it!

164
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,860
Fish fry!

165
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,566
Ooh!

166
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:33,104
Tohru is in
very deep sleep.

167
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,774
Shadows contain our yin--

168
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,909
one half of our chi.

169
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,513
Clearly this
shadowkhan tribe
grows stronger

170
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:45,216
by feeding
upon human shadows.

171
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,819
And without this part
of our life force,

172
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:51,389
we are doomed
to a state of limbo.

173
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,224
Well, how can we get
tohru's shadow back?

174
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:57,495
We must end
hak foo's control
over his shadowkhan,

175
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,332
but we cannot
remove mask from him

176
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,068
without spell ingredient.

177
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,502
Hmph! Stupid gator!

178
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,973
And without tohru
to translate Japanese,

179
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,509
learning spell ingredient
will be difficult.

180
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:12,644
Well, until you do,

181
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,579
that shadow eater
is out there.

182
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,882
We must find it
before it harms
anyone else.

183
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,618
Ninja hunt.

184
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,620
Do not be foolish.

185
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:25,724
Your own shadows
are at risk.

186
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,425
T'ch.

187
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,927
If the li'l freaks
are hungry,

188
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,997
they can eat this!
Hyah!

189
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,465
Jade: Oops.

190
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,666
Aaah!

191
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,901
The way to keep
shadow eaters

192
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,370
from eating shadow

193
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:41,339
is to not cast one.

194
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,609
Now, exhale and...

195
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,046
Attack!

196
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,748
Hak foo:
- Fight like warriors!

197
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,423
Eye of the tiger!
Eye of the tiger!

198
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,492
How charming.

199
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,895
Grr! Show master tarakudo
your war faces!

200
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,333
Ooh. If I
had a spine,

201
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,368
it would
be tingling.

202
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,770
Grr!

203
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,939
Hak foo,
all shadowkhan
are deadly.

204
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,743
You just need
to be aware
of their strengths.

205
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,746
You call these strong?

206
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:24,315
I see a demonstration
is in order.

207
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,218
Chow: Aah!

208
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,355
Hello!

209
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,691
Kinda in the middle
of something here!

210
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,960
Ho ho ho.

211
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,897
Where'd you get
the mini-'Khan?

212
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,098
Grrrrr!

213
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,867
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Wait for it.

214
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,002
(Whistles)

215
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,037
Tarakudo: Uh, fellas?

216
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,440
Chow: Ha! Hey, hak,
are these guys

217
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,275
on loan from Santa?

218
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:51,910
Ha ha ha!

219
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,445
Huh?

220
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,750
Hey, how--
what are you--

221
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,685
(gasp)

222
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:04,222
Ohh. Uhh.

223
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,393
Growing boys need
their nutrients.

224
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,496
And an entire city
of shadows

225
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:14,466
awaits my army!

226
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,604
Uncle: Ninja-suction unit?

227
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,672
Check.

228
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,640
Chi-powered
night-vision goggles?

229
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:23,708
Check.

230
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,543
Hand-held
dark chi detector?

231
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,611
Check.

232
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,147
And, in case back-up
is needed...

233
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,615
Check!

234
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,751
Base potion,
in the event
uncle discovers

235
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:37,088
missing ingredient
for removal spell.

236
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,058
(Sigh)
Uncle will remain here

237
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,129
armed with
Japanese-to-Chinese
dictionary.

238
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:49,200
Let's bring tohru
back from dreamland.

239
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,637
(Crackling)

240
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,706
We found tohru's
shadow eater.

241
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,674
More like a new batch
of shadow eaters.

242
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,220
Run!

243
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,156
(Gasp)

244
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,195
Huh?
(Crackles)

245
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,897
Ooh! Ooh!

246
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,567
Bwaaa!
Whoa. Ninja swarm.

247
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,337
don't worry, Jackie.
No shadow, no lunch.

248
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,909
Uhh!

249
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,446
Aah! Ohh!

250
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,388
You've been hosed.

251
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,924
(Sigh)
Thank you, Jade.

252
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:53,765
"Substitute mask removal
ingredient is often

253
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:57,302
shoelace of giraffe."

254
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,938
Aiyaaa!

255
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,007
Giraffes do not wear shoes!

256
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,846
Jade chan, pest control.

257
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,190
Huh!

258
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,969
Huh?

259
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,806
My bag is full.

260
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,644
I'm betting
this little guy

261
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:40,845
will lead us
to the big one

262
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,447
who munched
tohru's shadow.

263
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,082
Oh!
Jade?

264
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,183
Uh...

265
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,551
Found our boy.

266
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,989
And he has been snacking
between meals.

267
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,423
Ohh!
Ohh!

268
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,958
(Growling)

269
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,099
I thought you were
gator food, chan.

270
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,602
Time to hand over
tohru's shadow.

271
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,738
Huh?

272
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,108
Jackie, he's too big!

273
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,377
Jade, run!

274
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,314
Run after tiny, right!

275
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,951
And stay out
of the light!

276
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,954
Uh, Jackie...

277
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,790
That may be
a problem.

278
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,928
Good morning, chan...

279
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,397
And good night.

280
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,832
Bear feeds on honey!

281
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,900
Uhh!

282
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,870
Uhh! Whaa!

283
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:42,340
Where is that
removal spell, uncle?

284
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,574
(Sighs)

285
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,878
Japanese translation is
not going well, tohru.

286
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Unless ingredient
we seek is

287
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,916
"lobster wearing
corduroy pants."

288
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,152
(Softly)
Aiyaaa.

289
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,553
Hmm?

290
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,422
(Gasp)
You!

291
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:01,292
Looks like you in need
of some good fortune, sugar.

292
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,728
Who says uncle
needs fortune?!

293
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,229
Hmm?

294
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:09,801
Phone me now,
and we can fix whatever
is ailing you...

295
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,135
Together.

296
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,705
Pfft! If uncle
wanted quack,

297
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,841
he would phone take-out
for Peking duck!

298
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:21,212
Only <i> I</i> have the answers
you seek.

299
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,715
Ohhh!

300
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,685
Oh!

301
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,820
Ooh!

302
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,289
Imagine, chan,

303
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,191
an army
of these creatures,

304
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,960
obeying my every command!

305
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,429
Huh! Aah!

306
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,301
Come on out, tiny.

307
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,436
don't you want to
party with your pals?

308
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,972
Whoa!

309
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,073
Unh!

310
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,142
Grrrr!

311
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,410
(Click click)

312
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,882
There's more than one way
to skin a ninja!

313
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,090
Gone fishin'.

314
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,658
(Blows)

315
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,027
(Sigh)

316
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,230
For you, my apprentice.

317
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,933
(Ring)

318
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,536
Welcome to miss Kimber's
psychic hotline,

319
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,439
where I reveal
what the stars tell.

320
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,775
Uncle needs helps finding
mask-removal ingredient

321
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,544
and for you to never speak
of this to anyone!

322
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,128
Yes. Yes. I see.

323
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,732
And it's high time
you pursued
your true passion.

324
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,800
(Gasp)

325
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,601
Oil painting?!

326
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,803
That's right.

327
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,638
'Cause the stars say

328
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,575
uncle needs to take
time out for <i> uncle.</i>

329
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,810
(Gasp)

330
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:03,781
It is like you have
window into uncle's soul.

331
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,149
Here, tiny!

332
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,217
(Kissy sounds)

333
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,952
Here, boy. Come on.
Where are you?

334
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,153
(Rumbling)

335
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,557
Oh, boy.

336
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,060
You may have survived
a gator, chan,

337
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,529
but how about
a land shark?!

338
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,171
(Sniffing)

339
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,910
Grrr! Enough
with the shadow puppets!

340
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,279
Rrrr!
Oh!

341
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,348
It's chow time.

342
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,520
(Distant pounding
and shaking)

343
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,624
Huh! Uh!

344
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,927
Jackie, I think tiny
had a big breakfast.

345
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,498
(Roar)

346
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,767
Now <i> that's</i> what
I call a warrior!

347
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,537
(Cell phone rings)

348
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,738
Uncle?

349
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,174
Jackie, if psychic
speaks truth,

350
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:06,611
there is good chance
uncle will be taking
unexpected trip.

351
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:10,081
Oh, the mask-removal
ingredient is fish.

352
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,751
Oh! Uncle, we are about
to be swallowed
by a whale!

353
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,453
Where are we supposed
to find a fish

354
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,256
in the middle
of downtown?!

355
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,390
Duh!

356
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,825
Hit it, unc!

357
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:25,396
Uncle, on phone:
<i>Dokeru kimen yaaku.</i>

358
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,599
<i>Dokeru kimen yaaku.</i>

359
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,568
Uhh!

360
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,870
(Struggling)

361
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,174
Whoa!

362
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,049
Aah!

363
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,284
Oof!

364
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,186
Ohhh!

365
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,190
Jade:
Think one of those
belongs to tohru?

366
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,932
Jackie,
all is right again.

367
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,266
(Groan)

368
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,536
<i>Sensei?</i>

369
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,004
Aiyaaa!

370
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,106
Who told you
to move, tohru?

371
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,976
What...What <i> is</i> that?

372
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,979
Oil painting.

373
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:18,616
Uncle must learn
to take time out for uncle.

374
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,125
If you could have
a superpower,
what would it be?

375
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,627
If I have superpower,

376
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,964
I can stop everything,
like, "freeze!"

377
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,100
Then, after I fix
everything, "continue."

378
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:39,770
Yeah, like tornado
coming, I can, "freeze."

379
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,872
Tell people, "run away."

380
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,341
"Ok, keep coming."

381
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:47,612
And, yes, I'd really like
to have this kind of power.
