1
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,702
<i>Listen carefully...</i>

2
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:25,398
<i>... my son.</i>

3
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:27,708
<i>By now, Kal-El...</i>

4
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:32,474
<i>... you are entering the atmosphere</i>
<i>of the planet known as Earth.</i>

5
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,447
<i>I pray you have made a safe journey.</i>

6
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:41,324
<i>The yellow sun of your new home</i>
<i>will give you great physical powers.</i>

7
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:44,390
<i>But it cannot console your spirit.</i>

8
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:49,722
<i>Placed aboard this vessel</i>
<i>is an energy module...</i>

9
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:54,064
<i>... all that remains</i>
<i>of a once-powerful civilization:</i>

10
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:56,797
<i>Krypton, your mother planet.</i>

11
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,977
<i>It is my last gift to you.</i>

12
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:05,481
<i>Once removed, the ship will</i>
<i>grow cold and silent...</i>

13
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,111
<i>... and you will be finally alone.</i>

14
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:13,756
<i>The power in the module</i>
<i>can be used but once.</i>

15
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:18,689
<i>Use it wisely, my son.</i>

16
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:52,322
Clark, you out here?

17
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,390
Clark Kent!

18
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:56,099
Hi, Mr. Hornsby.

19
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,264
Over here.

20
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,333
- There you are.
- How are you, sir?

21
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:02,665
- I'm fine, Clark. How are you?
- Nice to see you.

22
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,898
- It's been a long time.
- A long time.

23
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,600
I was tidying up for when
you show the place.

24
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:11,612
Didn't I mention there was
an offer to buy, sight unseen?

25
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:14,944
I don't want to sell this place
to a big developer.

26
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:18,952
The buyer has to want a real farm,
not another shopping center.

27
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:22,125
Now darn it, Clark,
why are you so stubborn?

28
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:25,625
Today, nobody wants a farm.

29
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,130
You blink your eye and they'll
all be gone. That's progress.

30
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:34,370
Oh, my gosh, look at this.

31
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:40,273
Oh, what a joker
old Jonathan Kent was.

32
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:44,780
You know, I asked him
what happened to the baby's crib.

33
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,574
And he said:

34
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:52,085
"Oh, little Clark must've had
a bad dream and kicked it."

35
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,723
- I swear, Dad liked a good joke.
- Yeah.

36
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,753
I was wondering, maybe you'd like
to keep these for your grandchildren.

37
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:02,592
Why, thank you very much, Clark.

38
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,462
Here, batter up.

39
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:05,566
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

40
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,533
- No, really...
- We'll hit a few.

41
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,145
Watch out now, these will
come in pretty fast.

42
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:25,817
You never could hit a curve ball!

43
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,726
That's my final decision
about the place.

44
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:32,919
I'm holding out for a real farmer.

45
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:34,457
You are?

46
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:39,436
And you're just as obstinate
as your father was too.

47
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:41,798
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is.

48
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:44,998
You be careful when you get back
to Metropolis, Clark.

49
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,501
It's a long, long way from
where you were born.

50
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:51,738
Yes, sir. I never forget that, sir.

51
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:56,815
- Bye.
- Bye, Clark.

52
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:18,302
What is that God-awful noise
you're making?

53
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,336
Mozart, my low-forehead friend.

54
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,949
Even this wretched pit can't diminish
the spirit of true genius.

55
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:30,485
Life itself started in a murky pit
much like this.

56
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,751
A true genius like myself
learns to seize the moment.

57
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,056
You're the first to know...

58
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:41,721
...that I now have plans
to re-create life itself.

59
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:46,366
Luthor, start breaking a sweat
or we'll throw you to the wolves.

60
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,629
Luthor, let's get them duds dirty.

61
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,239
- Move it, meathead.
- Let's see a little sweat.

62
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,841
What's that car doing here?!

63
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:54,908
Stop that vehicle!

64
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,705
- Hey, stop!
- Hold it there, son.

65
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:05,111
Yo! Where the hell is this and how
the hell do I get to Cedar City?

66
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,322
You on the wrong side
of the state, boy.

67
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,460
- No chance.
- Oh, no.

68
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,028
You got a fine, fine super-fine
sound system here, son.

69
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:21,936
I guess you dudes have never seen
one of these Sensurround 100s?

70
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,505
Yeah, I seen one once in a magazine.

71
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,006
Well, heck. Come on, get in.

72
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:28,643
- Really?
- Come on.

73
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:29,778
Really?

74
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,676
- You wanted to hear it, come on!
- All right.

75
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,975
Hop in, Bubba.
Let's give it a listen.

76
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:38,983
Hey, this is great!

77
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,815
Doors...

78
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:45,359
What's going on?

79
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:46,495
Windows...

80
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:50,157
- What's happening?
- The top.

81
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:51,466
Seats!

82
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,470
Lordy! Lordy!

83
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,272
And away!

84
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:02,302
Y'all come back and see us!

85
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,343
Oh, no!

86
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:05,848
Launch.

87
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:12,913
All right!

88
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:16,985
Did I do okay or what, Uncle Lex?

89
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:21,062
Lenny, you've always been the
Dutch elm disease of my family tree.

90
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:22,698
But this time you did fine.

91
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:29,705
You gonna skip the country, Uncle Lex?

92
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:32,101
You pathetic product
of the public schools...

93
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,743
...I've had nothing
on my awesome mind...

94
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:37,436
...since I've been incarcerated
except one thing:

95
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:40,116
- Destroy Superman!
- Destroy Superman!

96
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,882
Sorry.

97
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:02,837
Clark!

98
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,470
Help!

99
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:39,802
Help! Help!

100
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,001
Somebody get help!

101
00:13:57,594 --> 00:13:58,686
Superman!

102
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:24,615
He's okay. He needs a doctor.

103
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,188
Superman!

104
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,358
Gentlemen, one moment.

105
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,854
I want people to know that
our subway system...

106
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:35,259
...is the safest and most reliable
means of public transit.

107
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:36,490
Thank you.

108
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:41,629
Thanks.

109
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:45,773
You're late, Kent.

110
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,804
Sorry, Mr. White, won't happen again.

111
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:51,172
Where is everybody?

112
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:52,473
Boring.

113
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:55,676
Tedious.

114
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:59,253
- Hey, what's going on?
- Abominable!

115
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:03,550
<i>- Regardez, voilà</i> David Warfield.
- David Warfield...

116
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,661
...who owns those sleazy tabloids?

117
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:10,698
<i>Au contraire.</i> Who owns all those
sleazy tabloids and <i>The Daily Planet.</i>

118
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:12,565
Tedious.

119
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,362
You only read the pictures?

120
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:18,939
The fact is, Mr. White,
that I only read the ledger.

121
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:23,170
A ledger which the previous owners
paid so little attention to...

122
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,405
...I bought the paper from them.

123
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:28,881
<i>The Daily Planet</i> hasn't made
any money in three years.

124
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:31,586
And the name of the game
is making money.

125
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:36,152
Ladies and gentlemen,
my daughter, Lacy Warfield.

126
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,385
- Thanks, Daddy.
- It's nice to meet you.

127
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,031
Mr. White, Lacy will be helping you.

128
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,224
Helping me? Helping me what?

129
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:48,063
I have some mock copies
of our new layout.

130
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:50,263
It's super.

131
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:52,738
The suit's not right,
but we can change that.

132
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:54,501
Excuse me, Mr. Warfield.

133
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:59,205
The world isn't really on the brink.
Isn't that headline irresponsible?

134
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,907
Maybe, but it'll sell
a lot of newspapers.

135
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,483
Mr. White, don't do anything rash.

136
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:09,455
I won't let you turn this grand
old lady into one of your bimbos...

137
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,359
Mr. White, may I point out that Daddy
holds all of your contracts...

138
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,658
...which you will have to honor.

139
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:19,301
<i>Excusez-moi,</i> your spoiled-ness...

140
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:21,164
Why is Lois speaking French?

141
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:26,138
...I have a plane to catch to Paris for
the emergency Ministers' Conference...

142
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:29,278
Not so fast. All trips are canceled.

143
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,342
You mean my trip to Paris is canceled?

144
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:34,744
Mr. White, you come with me.

145
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,750
I want to see your books.
Everyone get back to work.

146
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,753
We're not being treated fairly.
I'm speaking to Lacy.

147
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,925
Me too.

148
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,649
Excuse me, Miss Warfield.

149
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:47,797
I speak for us all when I say
we'll do our best to cooperate.

150
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:49,597
Thank you.

151
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,667
But a reporter's first allegiance
is to the truth.

152
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:56,667
The people of this city depend on us
and we can't let them down.

153
00:16:57,674 --> 00:16:58,800
Thank you.

154
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,005
Is he for real?

155
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:09,542
100 percent, and I like him that way.

156
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:11,345
Oh, you have a thing for him.

157
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:14,217
For Clark?! No!

158
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,324
He's kind of cute.

159
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:19,293
Look, Miss Warfield...

160
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,954
...Clark is the oldest
living boy scout, okay?

161
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,464
He's trustworthy, he's helpful...

162
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,365
...he's loyal, he's obedient, he...

163
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:30,633
I don't know how to tell you this.

164
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:35,540
I just don't think he'd be attracted
to somebody like you.

165
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:40,410
Don't be silly. All men like me.
I'm very, very rich!

166
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:45,221
Why are there no air travel expenses
for you, Mr. Kent?

167
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:47,913
I get airsick, especially
when it's bumpy.

168
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:50,323
Lois, get in here!

169
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:55,190
Lois, explain this column of figures.

170
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,030
- The president is coming on live.
- What, right now?

171
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:02,133
- It won't be very good news.
- You always overreact.

172
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:06,605
- It won't be that terrible.
- Hopefully very terrible, Miss Lane.

173
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,836
We can double our circulation
with an international crisis.

174
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,709
<i>And because the summit has failed...</i>

175
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:18,019
<i>... we have no choice but</i>
<i>to strive to be second to none...</i>

176
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:20,121
<i>... in the nuclear arms race.</i>

177
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:24,920
<i>Therefore, I am announcing</i>
<i>the following measures...</i>

178
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:30,596
I know you're all upset
by the crisis.

179
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:35,227
The best thing we can do
is to try to think positively.

180
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:40,409
Now, is there anything we can do?
Doesn't anyone have a suggestion?

181
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:45,574
All right, I'll make a suggestion.

182
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,416
Why don't we write to our congressman?

183
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:53,419
- That'll do a lot of good.
- Somebody has to be an optimist.

184
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:56,254
Jeremy?

185
00:18:58,328 --> 00:19:02,264
- What could we do about the crisis?
- He doesn't know what's going on.

186
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:07,269
I know who I'd write a letter to
that would do some good.

187
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:10,907
- Who? Santa Claus?
- No, Superman!

188
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,235
Superman, the subject
of our exhibit...

189
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,742
...has donated a strand
of his hair to the museum...

190
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,916
...so we can have the fun
of seeing how strong he really is.

191
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,312
Here you see a 1000-pound load...

192
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,080
...easily suspended
by his single hair.

193
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:30,419
The museum will be closing soon,
so we should hurry a little.

194
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:34,691
Know what I can do with a single
strand of Superman's hair?

195
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:37,196
You could make a toupee that flies.

196
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:41,366
That hair is a sample
of Superman's genetic material.

197
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,835
The building blocks of his body.

198
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:48,440
With my genius and enough nuclear
power to mutate the genes...

199
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,842
...I can create a being
who's more powerful than him.

200
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:56,149
With total allegiance to me.

201
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:07,826
You better stand back.
Keep your eye out.

202
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,726
- Miss Warfield, you wanted to see me?
- Hi, Clark. Please come in.

203
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,928
I've come up with a brilliant idea.

204
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:47,603
Oh, really?

205
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:49,533
Well, Daddy thinks it's brilliant.

206
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:53,698
I want you to write a new series
called "Metropolis After Hours."

207
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,571
Who, me? I...

208
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:58,805
It's wonderful. It's great, isn't it?

209
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:03,082
- I don't think I'd be right for this.
- Oh, you're perfect for it.

210
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:06,949
I mean, you're young, you're single,
you're successful.

211
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:08,818
I'm usually in bed by 10:30.

212
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:11,721
That's just it, see, you don't
have to flaunt it.

213
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:14,658
I mean, you're no slave to fashion.
Although...

214
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:18,926
...have you ever thought of contacts?
- They make my eyes itch.

215
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:22,503
Don't worry about it. I thought
we could do this together.

216
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:25,072
- Oh?
- I know all the right places.

217
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:27,175
I'm a member of all the right clubs.

218
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:30,073
We'll start tonight at the opening
of the Metro Club.

219
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,215
- Oh, tonight.
- Yeah, it's a date.

220
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,405
A date!

221
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:35,607
A date?

222
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,481
Well, it's just business, actually.

223
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:42,421
I've got a letter here for Superman,
care of me.

224
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:44,685
- What?
- Superman gets mail here?

225
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:47,762
It's probably a picture request.
I can take care of it.

226
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:51,923
I think it's more than just
a fan letter. You should read it.

227
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:57,465
"Dear Superman, my teacher spoke about
the president's speech on the arms race.

228
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:02,340
We're all very unhappy about it.

229
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,683
And I said we should get Superman
to rid the world of nuclear arms...

230
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:10,581
...because only he could do it.

231
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:17,455
Once you've destroyed all the nuclear
missiles, they'll see I'm right.

232
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:21,188
Superman can make sure we don't
blow ourselves up, quick and easy.

233
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:24,492
I know you'll come through.
Your friend, Jeremy."

234
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:27,864
Poor kid. Oh, well,
I better get back to work.

235
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:31,871
- No, there's an angle in this.
- An angle! He's just a kid!

236
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:36,876
Daddy loves whipping up campaigns.
Oh, boy, and the public loves it!

237
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,547
Lacy!

238
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:40,647
We'll make him a celebrity.

239
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,946
Everybody in the world is gonna be
wondering what Superman's reply is.

240
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,619
Welcome to Metropolis, Jeremy.

241
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:54,388
I'm Mr. Warfield and this is
my daughter, Lacy Warfield.

242
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:57,328
- Hi, Jeremy.
- Now come along and meet the press.

243
00:22:57,534 --> 00:23:00,002
- Don't you trip.
- The car had a flat.

244
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:02,068
Sorry to hear that.
Turn around.

245
00:23:02,272 --> 00:23:04,536
Let everybody get a picture of you.

246
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:06,936
- That's it, everyone.
- Here, Jeremy.

247
00:23:07,143 --> 00:23:09,668
What a boy! Now come along...

248
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:13,042
...and tell the American public
what you told me.

249
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,242
I just said I wish Superman
would've said yes.

250
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:18,114
- Did you get that?
- No, we didn't.

251
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:20,653
Well, say it again. Loudly.

252
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,985
I just said I wish Superman
would've just said yes!

253
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,127
Miss Lane!

254
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,372
Miss Lane. Take a look at this.
Hot off the press.

255
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:39,507
Oh, my God!

256
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:43,236
This time he's gone too far.
Look, Clark. Look at that.

257
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,539
Can't wait to see
the chief's reaction.

258
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:48,648
I'm through taking it lying down.

259
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,183
Anybody wants me, I'll be downtown.

260
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:53,385
Chief look different to you?

261
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:57,591
He looks like my father when he went
to the bank to ask for a loan.

262
00:23:58,094 --> 00:23:59,994
I'm gonna make sure he's all right.

263
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,467
There's nothing we can do about it.
It's Superman's decision now.

264
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:08,269
I'm sure he'll do the right thing.

265
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:48,533
<i>May the elders watch over you...</i>

266
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:50,609
<i>... my son.</i>

267
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:55,709
<i>Their wisdom is all that is left</i>
<i>of a once powerful...</i>

268
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,114
<i>... and enlightened planet.</i>

269
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:03,485
<i>You must listen to them, Kal-El.</i>

270
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:06,020
<i>Listen.</i>

271
00:25:11,434 --> 00:25:13,800
I know I'm forbidden to interfere.

272
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:18,940
And yet the Earth is threatened
by the same fate as Krypton's.

273
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,610
The Earth is too primitive.

274
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,938
You can flee to new worlds...

275
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:27,544
...where war is long forgotten.

276
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,382
If you teach the Earth to put
its fate in any one man...

277
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:35,855
...even yourself, you're teaching them
to be betrayed.

278
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:41,353
Betrayed... betrayed...

279
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:44,533
...betrayed... betrayed!

280
00:25:47,203 --> 00:25:50,730
<i>And because the summit has failed...</i>

281
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,205
<i>... we have no choice but to strive...</i>

282
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:59,348
<i>... to be second to none</i>
<i>in the nuclear arms race.</i>

283
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,273
<i>To that end...</i>

284
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:04,510
<i>... this administration has pursued...</i>

285
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:07,519
<i>... and will continue to pursue...</i>

286
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:09,851
<i>... the most vigorous policy.</i>

287
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,592
<i>Therefore...</i>

288
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,290
Just a minute.

289
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,964
- Lois?
- There you are. What happened?

290
00:26:23,173 --> 00:26:26,006
- What do you mean, what happened?
- Nothing, just:

291
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,677
"Meet in the lobby at 6 for
the awards dinner.

292
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,108
Wear something nice
and don't be late."

293
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:35,114
- Was it some other Lois?
- I'm sorry, I completely forgot.

294
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:38,219
Okay, go get your penguin suit on
and we'll go.

295
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:43,249
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.

296
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,189
But you go ahead. Okay?

297
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:49,555
Clark?

298
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,398
Something's wrong, isn't it?

299
00:26:55,939 --> 00:27:00,171
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes, you can, as a matter of fact.

300
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:03,106
- What?
- Could we go get some fresh air?

301
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,643
Fresh air?

302
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,950
Fresh air. Fresh air, sure.

303
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:11,984
Sure, Clark. Sure.

304
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:14,789
Who needs chicken with
all the fixings anyway?

305
00:27:14,991 --> 00:27:17,551
Let's go. Come on.
Let's get some fresh air.

306
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:20,987
Breathe. Do you feel better?

307
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:23,132
Clark?

308
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:26,097
Clark? Clark, things aren't
that bad! Stop!

309
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:27,496
Oh, Clark!

310
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,966
Clark! Clark!

311
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:40,949
Superman!

312
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:02,398
You okay?

313
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,931
Great.

314
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,811
Hey, look at that.

315
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:29,026
There you go. Bye-bye!

316
00:28:59,495 --> 00:29:02,464
- How'd you like going solo?
- I loved it.

317
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:04,633
But not as much as being with you.

318
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:07,701
I needed to be with you too.
You make me laugh.

319
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:13,904
You're the only one
I can talk to, Lois.

320
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:18,714
See, sometimes I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

321
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:23,581
I'm always here for you, you know that.

322
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:27,782
And you'll do the right thing,
no matter what. You always have.

323
00:29:28,324 --> 00:29:29,450
Thank you.

324
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,457
- You know something?
- What?

325
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:36,728
- You don't even know my name.
- Kal-El.

326
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:40,727
You remember, don't you?

327
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,698
I remember everything.

328
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,877
"Never set one of them above the rest.
Love all humanity instead."

329
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,579
That's not fair.

330
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,273
Lois.

331
00:30:21,878 --> 00:30:24,438
Lois, it's time to go. We'll be late.

332
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,116
What am I doing out here
freezing my butt off?

333
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,117
Oh, you wanted some fresh air.

334
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,257
Oh, no that's okay.
I don't want to catch a cold.

335
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,829
I feel kind of weird,
like I'm jetlagged or something.

336
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,999
- Jeepers!
- Like I'm going crazy.

337
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:50,171
- How about you? Are you still down?
- Nope. Things are pretty clear.

338
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:54,507
Good. Too much thinking
wears down your batteries.

339
00:30:56,245 --> 00:31:00,477
Clark, you gotta go with your gut.

340
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,110
Come on.

341
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,614
Okay, here you go, Jeremy.

342
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:12,492
Mr. Warfield wants me to get shots
of you with local color...

343
00:31:12,695 --> 00:31:14,458
...but I can't think of anything.

344
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:18,123
- Hi, Jeremy.
- Superman!

345
00:31:18,968 --> 00:31:20,026
Jimmy.

346
00:31:20,636 --> 00:31:21,967
What a scoop!

347
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,633
- How'd you like to take a walk?
- Sure!

348
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,434
Jimmy, come on.

349
00:31:41,657 --> 00:31:43,557
You can't! You'll get towed.

350
00:31:44,894 --> 00:31:47,226
Do you know how much
a ticket costs?

351
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,988
Lacy, it's only money.

352
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,468
Will you wait for me
upstairs in the gallery?

353
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:01,665
Sure, okay.

354
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,039
- Good luck, Superman.
- Thanks.

355
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:14,553
I saved you a seat.

356
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:21,356
All right, Superman!

357
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:27,891
I don't represent any country but
I'd like to address the delegates.

358
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:32,097
Well, in that case,
you will need a sponsor.

359
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,238
I believe that will do. Please.

360
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:42,309
Thank you.

361
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,054
What's he gonna say?

362
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,587
Something wonderful.

363
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:51,249
Madam Secretary...

364
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:55,319
...honorable delegates,
ladies and gentlemen.

365
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:58,591
For many years now
I've lived among you as...

366
00:32:58,801 --> 00:33:02,635
...a visitor. I've seen
the beauty of your many cultures.

367
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:06,002
I've felt joy in your magnificent
accomplishments.

368
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,309
I've also seen the folly of your wars.

369
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:14,147
As of today I'm not a visitor
anymore, because the Earth...

370
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:16,778
...is my home too.

371
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:20,383
We can't live in fear.
And I can't stand...

372
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,117
...idly by and watch us
stumble into the madness...

373
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:26,318
...of possible nuclear destruction.

374
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:28,328
I've come to a decision.

375
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:32,665
I'm going to do what our governments
have been unwilling to do.

376
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:38,069
Effective immediately, I'm going to
rid our planet of all nuclear weapons.

377
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:41,705
All right, Superman!

378
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,771
Way to go, Superman!

379
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,726
Missile test Alpha, all systems go.

380
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:08,563
<i>- Three... two... one.</i>

381
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,772
Oh!

382
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:01,541
Oh. Nice to see you guys!

383
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:07,852
Why don't you just relax there.
I'll get on with the introductions:

384
00:36:08,057 --> 00:36:09,183
Dixie.

385
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,221
And Trixie.

386
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:18,593
From the land of the free, the home of
the great cost overrun, Harry Howler:

387
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:22,367
Nuclear strategist from
America's top think tank.

388
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:25,131
And a great little warmonger
in his own right.

389
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:27,832
A hearty <i>bienvenue</i>
to Jean-Pierre Dubois:

390
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:31,339
Nuclear warhead dealer to the world.

391
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,372
His motto is:

392
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,114
"If you didn't buy it
from Jean-Pierre...

393
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,479
...you didn't buy it
on the black market."

394
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:41,022
General Romoff.

395
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:44,655
A lot of people think of you
as the "Mad Russian."

396
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:49,530
I like to think of you
as just madly eccentric.

397
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:51,199
Please be seated.

398
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:57,371
Look guys. I know you're all choked
up, kind of overcome with joy...

399
00:36:57,573 --> 00:37:00,337
...that Superman has ended
the arms race.

400
00:37:01,877 --> 00:37:05,472
But if we work together,
we can make the world safe...

401
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,012
...for war profits.

402
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:08,508
Get to the point.

403
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:12,447
The point is, I, Lex Luthor, greatest
criminal mind of the modern era...

404
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:14,919
...have found a way
to destroy Superman.

405
00:37:15,157 --> 00:37:17,819
Behold, my unscrupulous friends...

406
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:21,660
Shut those blinds.

407
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:25,459
- The sun is hurting my eyes!
- Exactly.

408
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:27,393
You know what the sun is?

409
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:30,401
It's nothing more than
a huge nuclear bomb...

410
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:35,236
...a bomb with so much radiation, it'd
incinerate the average man like that!

411
00:37:35,945 --> 00:37:39,039
Yes, but Superman is no average man.

412
00:37:39,315 --> 00:37:41,010
Aha, right!

413
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:43,874
What is your plan?

414
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,422
Boys, old Lex here
has kind of a secret recipe...

415
00:37:48,624 --> 00:37:52,424
...a genetic stew in this dish,
if you will.

416
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,895
If you'll help me put this
on one of your missiles...

417
00:37:56,098 --> 00:38:00,728
...I promise you, Superman will have
the biggest surprise of his life.

418
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:05,364
I'll introduce him to his first
nightmare, a "Nuclear Man."

419
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:09,943
He'll pierce his skin. He'll make
him mortal. He'll become sick.

420
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:12,080
We'll dance on his grave.

421
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,039
Why should we deal with
a notorious scoundrel like you?

422
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,446
Remember my motto:

423
00:38:17,653 --> 00:38:20,486
"The more fear you make,
the more loot you take."

424
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:22,748
And the more missiles you guys sell...

425
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:26,450
Yes, but what's in it for you?

426
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:30,529
A tiny commission.

427
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:32,957
Something appropriate.

428
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,167
A number...

429
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:39,071
...with a lot of zeros behind it.

430
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:47,676
Lenny.

431
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,113
The new genetic material.

432
00:38:52,888 --> 00:38:54,412
And now, Leonard...

433
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,716
...your Uncle Lex...

434
00:38:56,926 --> 00:39:01,454
...with this protoplasm that I have
grown from Superman's hair cells...

435
00:39:02,765 --> 00:39:05,598
...will duplicate creation itself.

436
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,668
Now the fabric.

437
00:39:11,006 --> 00:39:13,497
Uncle Lex, this ain't gonna cover him.

438
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:18,338
The computer inside will...

439
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:22,910
...leave enough material to maintain
the high moral standards...

440
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:26,519
...that I've always subscribed to.

441
00:39:26,722 --> 00:39:28,587
Know what this means, Uncle Lex?

442
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,049
What?

443
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:31,817
We're gonna be parents.

444
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,690
- What's your name, sergeant?
- York, sir.

445
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:06,087
At ease.

446
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:40,152
Launch control. Yes, sir.

447
00:40:40,362 --> 00:40:42,159
Yes, sir.

448
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,291
There's a weather problem.
We gotta hold.

449
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:47,062
Hold?

450
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:49,537
- What's your name, son?
- Goram.

451
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,035
"Goram, sir."

452
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,606
- Goram, sir.
- Goram, you know your code book?

453
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:55,106
Of course, sir.

454
00:40:55,311 --> 00:40:59,475
27-0-6, inclement override.
Fire on my command. Fire.

455
00:40:59,682 --> 00:41:02,276
Yes, sir. Stand by to launch.

456
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,914
Ten... nine...

457
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:20,333
Missed us.

458
00:42:38,647 --> 00:42:40,274
Reach out.

459
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,373
Come on.

460
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:44,651
Down.

461
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:46,519
Reach out.

462
00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:48,986
And stretch.

463
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,453
Down.

464
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:52,223
Up.

465
00:42:52,628 --> 00:42:55,722
- Clark, are you okay?
- I think I better sit this one out.

466
00:42:55,931 --> 00:42:59,867
You sure? This would be great for
your series on the young Metropolis.

467
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:01,968
Let's try it again. Come on.

468
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:04,901
Two, three, four.

469
00:43:05,107 --> 00:43:08,042
One, two, three.

470
00:43:08,277 --> 00:43:11,474
- I don't think so.
- What, are you okay?

471
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:21,153
28.

472
00:43:21,356 --> 00:43:22,414
29.

473
00:43:22,658 --> 00:43:23,955
23.

474
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:27,260
- Done. Great.
- Okay, you try it now.

475
00:43:27,763 --> 00:43:31,790
- Let's set it a little higher for you.
- Okay.

476
00:43:32,134 --> 00:43:33,726
Just push down.

477
00:43:37,673 --> 00:43:41,268
- Are you okay? Just step down.
- Need some help?

478
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:45,040
Your friend doesn't know
his own strength.

479
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,874
Clark, this is Paul.

480
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,947
- He's a trainer here.
- Hi.

481
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:51,381
Hey, I got just the thing for you.

482
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:53,482
Over here, Clarky.

483
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:55,083
Clarky?

484
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,623
It's real nice of him to help me out.

485
00:44:01,997 --> 00:44:04,329
- He's really good.
- Here, try this one.

486
00:44:04,533 --> 00:44:07,764
Clark! Are you okay? Sorry.

487
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,665
No pain, no gain.

488
00:44:11,473 --> 00:44:13,703
Jeez, what a jerk.

489
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:16,504
Never realized it before.

490
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:19,411
I guess a lot of people
I know are jerks.

491
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,016
Maybe you think I'm one too.
That's why you keep avoiding me.

492
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:26,752
Oh, no, I don't think that at all.
Just been really busy, that's all.

493
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:28,879
But wait.

494
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:33,687
You know Lois is doing that interview
with Superman about his peace mission.

495
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:38,127
Well, I was thinking the four of us
can get together and have high tea.

496
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:39,834
It's very chic.

497
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:42,970
- Can you hand me those weights, Clark?
- Excuse me.

498
00:44:44,006 --> 00:44:45,030
Wait a minute, Lacy.

499
00:44:45,507 --> 00:44:49,807
Come early. The view is so romantic
from my balcony. See you.

500
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:54,308
- Oh, sure. Here.
- Not those! The other one!

501
00:44:56,118 --> 00:44:57,312
No pain, no gain?

502
00:45:07,563 --> 00:45:08,291
What was that?

503
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,195
Uncle Lex...
You're spooking me out.

504
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:18,665
There.

505
00:45:20,909 --> 00:45:23,901
Madam, thank you very much.

506
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,500
I'm incredible.

507
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:53,506
Uncle Lex, he's like...

508
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,444
He's beautiful. He's perfect.

509
00:45:59,181 --> 00:46:01,115
Welcome home, Nuclear Man.

510
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:03,881
Your father's happy to see you.

511
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:23,029
The power of the sun has given him
internally generated heat.

512
00:46:26,274 --> 00:46:27,571
I'm a...

513
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:29,609
You are...

514
00:46:30,712 --> 00:46:34,239
I'm... What? I'm a genius?

515
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:36,440
I'm incredible. I'm...

516
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:38,987
You are nothing.

517
00:46:39,554 --> 00:46:41,215
I am the father now.

518
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,457
You have my voice.

519
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:45,722
No, you have my voice.

520
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,286
Just remember, I made you.

521
00:46:48,664 --> 00:46:51,565
Yeah, you're just an experiment,
freako.

522
00:46:54,036 --> 00:46:55,230
What is that?

523
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:59,831
- Oh, no.
- I'm an experiment. I'm a freako.

524
00:47:00,676 --> 00:47:03,144
I was just kidding about
that freako line!

525
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:06,405
If anybody's a freako around here,
it's gotta be me!

526
00:47:09,084 --> 00:47:11,314
Oh, wow, I'm break dancing, hey!

527
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,385
This rocks. Hey!

528
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:17,951
I made you. I can destroy you.

529
00:47:18,326 --> 00:47:19,850
Destroy.

530
00:47:20,362 --> 00:47:22,421
Destroy Superman now.

531
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:26,130
You sweet thing.
But not quite yet, no.

532
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:30,835
Come here. We'll discuss
when the proper time is.

533
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:38,808
Uncle Lex.

534
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,785
Oh, no!

535
00:47:47,055 --> 00:47:49,990
He's, like... He's, like, cold.

536
00:47:50,192 --> 00:47:51,682
Of course he is.

537
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,461
That's his vulnerability. That's
the only way he can be stopped.

538
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,791
What?

539
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:03,371
Lenny, my loud-mouthed nephew,
he gets his energy from the sun.

540
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,936
Without it, he's like you at night:

541
00:48:06,575 --> 00:48:07,405
Useless.

542
00:48:21,957 --> 00:48:23,185
Well, nobody's perfect.

543
00:48:29,731 --> 00:48:33,690
I never had a double date before.
This is fun. How do I look?

544
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:39,235
Illegal. Like the last six dresses
you tried on.

545
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:43,673
Listen, Lacy? I don't want to
burst your bubble or anything but...

546
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,211
...Clark's not gonna notice
what you're wearing.

547
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:48,177
Yes, he will. There's Clark.

548
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,113
Okay, fix that. There you go.
You look great.

549
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:54,345
- Maybe it's just Superman.
- No.

550
00:48:54,923 --> 00:48:59,019
No, Superman makes a different
kind of entrance.

551
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:11,900
- Hi, Lacy.
- Hi, Clark.

552
00:49:12,107 --> 00:49:14,701
Can you break a 20?
Driver didn't have any change.

553
00:49:15,177 --> 00:49:17,475
Yeah, sure. Let me get my purse.

554
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:19,613
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

555
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:20,745
- Clark.
- What?

556
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:23,543
You are not gonna believe
this list of questions...

557
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,312
...Mr. Warfield gave me
to ask Superman. Look.

558
00:49:27,022 --> 00:49:30,549
"Aren't you part of a plot
to weaken our national defense?"

559
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,250
- Oh, my goodness.
- I think his gray matter is...

560
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:36,897
- How will I ask him these questions?
- Well, politely I guess.

561
00:49:37,098 --> 00:49:40,727
Let's see, I have 18 dollars and...

562
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:44,835
Clark, she really likes you,
so notice the dress.

563
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,900
...my American Express card.

564
00:49:47,108 --> 00:49:49,508
- Dress.
- Oh, hey, neat dress.

565
00:49:50,045 --> 00:49:51,740
Well, thanks. Be right back.

566
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,915
What's that?

567
00:49:59,187 --> 00:50:01,678
Now, there's a different
kind of entrance.

568
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:06,959
- Hi, Lois.
- Hello, Superman.

569
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:08,424
How are you?

570
00:50:08,897 --> 00:50:10,194
I'm fine.

571
00:50:11,366 --> 00:50:15,530
Oh, Superman, this is Lacy Warfield.
She's the boss' daughter.

572
00:50:15,737 --> 00:50:18,103
How do you do?
That's a very attractive outfit.

573
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,764
- I think we better start our interview.
- Excuse me.

574
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,467
Two's company.

575
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:26,946
Oh, right, yeah.
Yeah, I'll go get Clark.

576
00:50:28,516 --> 00:50:33,317
He's probably helping the driver
change a tire, or some other good deed.

577
00:50:33,521 --> 00:50:34,351
That guy.

578
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:38,519
- Something smells wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

579
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:41,321
I'm cooking some scallops
and some duck...

580
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:45,021
...in this wonderful mushroom sauce
with champagne.

581
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:47,565
In case we got hungry afterwards.

582
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,630
I mean, later.

583
00:50:50,372 --> 00:50:52,533
You shouldn't have gone
to all that trouble.

584
00:50:59,047 --> 00:51:01,311
Should we get on with the interview?

585
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:04,644
Yes, let's. Let's get on
with the interview.

586
00:51:08,456 --> 00:51:13,393
Have you had any trouble
confiscating the missiles?

587
00:51:13,828 --> 00:51:16,854
There always was the possibility
that warped individuals...

588
00:51:17,065 --> 00:51:19,898
...would take advantage of
the world's goodwill, but...

589
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,237
Is there something wrong?

590
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:29,809
Oh! My dinner! My dinner!

591
00:51:30,011 --> 00:51:31,740
I'll be right back.

592
00:51:32,247 --> 00:51:33,544
Be right back.

593
00:51:46,227 --> 00:51:47,057
Hi.

594
00:51:47,262 --> 00:51:50,231
- I missed you, Clark.
- Oh. Ah, well...

595
00:51:50,432 --> 00:51:54,232
It's so boring with Lois and Superman.
Let's do something wild.

596
00:51:54,436 --> 00:51:57,064
Gee, they're expecting us.
It wouldn't be polite.

597
00:51:57,272 --> 00:51:58,796
Yeah, you're right.

598
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:03,075
How can one man be so square
and so delicious?

599
00:52:04,379 --> 00:52:08,509
All right, let's go chitchat. If I
have to face Superman, so do you.

600
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:10,440
Lacy?

601
00:52:12,454 --> 00:52:14,046
Oh, Clark.

602
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:16,181
Stop!

603
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:40,210
I don't believe it! I never had duck
turn out so perfectly. It's amazing!

604
00:52:40,415 --> 00:52:41,404
I'm out here, Lois.

605
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:42,875
Oh.

606
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,763
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes, it is beautiful.

607
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:02,666
The whole world is beautiful.

608
00:53:03,738 --> 00:53:08,334
I've always felt moments like this
should be shared with someone you...

609
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,779
Someone you care a lot about.

610
00:53:14,215 --> 00:53:15,807
Isn't that the doorbell?

611
00:53:16,684 --> 00:53:17,742
Yes.

612
00:53:34,402 --> 00:53:35,664
Lacy!

613
00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:38,102
Where's Clark?

614
00:53:38,306 --> 00:53:40,467
He started to get in the elevator...

615
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,973
Oh, never mind, it's a long story.

616
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,305
It always is with Clark.

617
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:47,973
Oh, great, that's him.

618
00:53:50,585 --> 00:53:51,847
- Clark?
- Hi.

619
00:53:52,053 --> 00:53:54,487
Those bellboys ought to
look where they're going.

620
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,281
Superman?

621
00:53:56,558 --> 00:53:59,857
- I'm so glad you're back.
- Is dinner ready? Can we eat?

622
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:02,359
- Yeah, let's go sit down.
- Oh, great.

623
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,094
- Sorry!
- My goodness! No, that's okay.

624
00:54:09,304 --> 00:54:12,364
Just leave it there, Clark.
It's stuck on your pants.

625
00:54:12,574 --> 00:54:15,941
Yeah, let me just get a rag.
Excuse me, be right back.

626
00:54:20,315 --> 00:54:21,373
Where's Clark?

627
00:54:23,918 --> 00:54:27,786
<i>Hello, Dolly</i>
<i>Hello, Dolly</i>

628
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:31,982
<i>It's so nice to have me back</i>
<i>Where I belong</i>

629
00:54:33,128 --> 00:54:36,461
<i>Don't be concerned, Blue Boy.</i>
<i>You're the only one who can hear me.</i>

630
00:54:36,664 --> 00:54:39,929
<i>It's my own private frequency.</i>
<i>You might call it "Lex TV."</i>

631
00:54:40,535 --> 00:54:43,299
<i>Look to your left,</i>
<i>tall, dark and handsome.</i>

632
00:54:44,205 --> 00:54:49,006
<i>I'm gonna blow 20 stories off that</i>
<i>building, give or take a floor or two.</i>

633
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:50,302
<i>Peace.</i>

634
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,006
Men.

635
00:54:53,214 --> 00:54:55,239
I hope Clark's okay. I better look.

636
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,644
Okay.

637
00:54:59,787 --> 00:55:04,019
I'm sorry, but an emergency's come up.
My apologies to Miss Warfield.

638
00:55:04,225 --> 00:55:05,419
Oh, but...

639
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:09,459
Superman! Take me with you!
I can cover the story!

640
00:55:11,466 --> 00:55:12,956
You seen Clark?

641
00:55:22,677 --> 00:55:25,908
Guess who. It's your old friend Lex.

642
00:55:27,015 --> 00:55:31,577
I suspect if you'd actually planted
a bomb, you'd be miles away by now.

643
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:34,216
This is my nephew Lenny.

644
00:55:34,422 --> 00:55:35,650
He worships me.

645
00:55:35,857 --> 00:55:40,123
The dude of steel.
Boy, are you gonna get it!

646
00:55:41,596 --> 00:55:45,828
Silly me, thinking that
I could fool a super guy.

647
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:48,468
You're right. No bomb.

648
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:52,162
It's just that you're so involved
in this world peace bit...

649
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:54,773
...you don't have time
for social calls.

650
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:58,008
I confess, I tricked you.

651
00:55:58,413 --> 00:55:59,345
You look great.

652
00:55:59,547 --> 00:56:02,948
Never mind the small talk.
What are you up to?

653
00:56:04,085 --> 00:56:05,814
You know you're a workaholic?

654
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,853
You're playing a good guy
24 hours a day.

655
00:56:09,057 --> 00:56:11,218
Why don't you stop and
smell the roses?

656
00:56:11,426 --> 00:56:14,623
Get yourself a hobby? A pet?
A kitten, a puppy?

657
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:19,198
I know you hate children and animals.
What are you doing back in Metropolis?

658
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,860
I want to be first to introduce
you to the new kid on the block.

659
00:56:37,518 --> 00:56:39,850
Look closely at the cell structure.

660
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,346
You see anything familiar?

661
00:56:43,591 --> 00:56:45,786
You've already broken
all the laws of man.

662
00:56:45,994 --> 00:56:48,690
Now you've broken the laws
of nature too.

663
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:51,228
I can only assume you hid a device...

664
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:53,730
...in a missile I hurled into the sun.

665
00:56:54,068 --> 00:56:57,868
Mr. Muscle, I'm gonna really miss
these little chats we have together.

666
00:56:58,072 --> 00:57:00,302
You're the only one who can
keep up with me.

667
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,903
- Lenny!
- What?

668
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,971
I wanna propose a toast.

669
00:57:06,414 --> 00:57:10,817
To a nice guy, who's about
to finish last.

670
00:57:14,188 --> 00:57:15,780
Destroy Superman!

671
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:17,417
Later.

672
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:21,151
He's a little bit anxious.
Can you blame him?

673
00:57:22,497 --> 00:57:24,556
Not one of your great thinkers.

674
00:57:24,766 --> 00:57:27,894
But I, in all modesty, am.

675
00:57:28,102 --> 00:57:32,436
The touching thing about this plan
is you helped me devise it.

676
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,837
Prison has twisted
your mind into a delusional state.

677
00:57:36,044 --> 00:57:38,137
No, no, no. Listen.

678
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:41,474
When I escaped from prison
I had one thing on my mind:

679
00:57:41,683 --> 00:57:43,480
The end of Superman.

680
00:57:43,951 --> 00:57:46,317
So there I was,
the first time in my life...

681
00:57:46,521 --> 00:57:51,220
...that I didn't have a long-range,
truly devious, criminal scheme.

682
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,485
And then I came up with it.

683
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:55,493
With this guy...

684
00:57:55,797 --> 00:57:57,321
...and you gone...

685
00:57:57,565 --> 00:58:00,056
...I'll make a fortune
rearming the world.

686
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,863
You'd risk global nuclear war for
your own personal financial gain.

687
00:58:04,072 --> 00:58:08,304
Nobody wants war. I just want
to keep the threat alive.

688
00:58:11,245 --> 00:58:12,644
Nifty, huh?

689
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,113
Good night, sweet prince.

690
00:58:21,255 --> 00:58:22,813
Parting is...

691
00:58:23,391 --> 00:58:24,619
...inevitable.

692
00:58:25,693 --> 00:58:27,752
Destroy Superman!

693
00:58:28,062 --> 00:58:30,496
First, I have fun.

694
00:59:34,395 --> 00:59:35,487
Help me!

695
00:59:45,273 --> 00:59:46,467
Thanks, Superman!

696
01:05:22,109 --> 01:05:25,510
I said I'd get you to run
one of our papers yourself...

697
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,647
...and I meant it.

698
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:31,045
Congratulations, Miss Publisher.

699
01:05:31,252 --> 01:05:33,686
Thank you, Daddy, that's very nice.

700
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,412
Step into your office.

701
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,954
- Where'd this come from?
- Somebody brought it in.

702
01:05:41,162 --> 01:05:42,629
We bought it, cheap.

703
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:45,765
Okay...
This time you've gone too far.

704
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:50,170
You can print your stupid rag
without Lois Lane.

705
01:05:53,808 --> 01:05:57,209
And you certainly have
no right to this!

706
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,680
- Lois, I'm sorry!
- Let her go, darling.

707
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:02,610
I mean, she's useless.

708
01:06:02,883 --> 01:06:05,545
And while you're at it,
fire that Clark Kent.

709
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,278
He hasn't been around.
He hasn't even telephoned.

710
01:06:08,489 --> 01:06:10,753
I know, I'm worried about him.

711
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:12,585
Oh, kitten...

712
01:06:12,793 --> 01:06:17,321
...didn't we have a talk about
personal involvement with the help?

713
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:20,295
- Now that you're the publisher...
- Daddy.

714
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:22,560
- Yes, darling.
- Stuff it!

715
01:06:25,306 --> 01:06:28,070
Lois! Lois, I'm sorry.

716
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,971
I promise you I had
nothing to do with that.

717
01:06:37,651 --> 01:06:39,243
Have you heard from Clark?

718
01:06:43,123 --> 01:06:44,351
No.

719
01:07:08,949 --> 01:07:10,314
Just a minute.

720
01:07:10,951 --> 01:07:12,316
Oh, Lois.

721
01:07:13,053 --> 01:07:15,385
- What are you doing here?
- I knew it.

722
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:19,990
I just have a really bad flu.
What do you mean you knew it?

723
01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:21,456
How did you know?

724
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,899
You haven't been to work.
You haven't called the office.

725
01:07:27,101 --> 01:07:30,537
You haven't even called me back.
How could you not call me back?

726
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:37,674
Whatever it is,
I guess you've got your reasons.

727
01:07:39,313 --> 01:07:41,440
But I knew you were here, you know?

728
01:07:42,783 --> 01:07:44,045
Somehow...

729
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,880
...something pulled me here.

730
01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:49,214
I always know when Superman's
in trouble.

731
01:07:49,423 --> 01:07:52,517
Superman?
Something's happened to him?

732
01:07:53,327 --> 01:07:56,023
Everybody's saying that
he's dead but...

733
01:07:56,797 --> 01:08:00,790
...that can't be true, I just know it.
I feel it in my heart.

734
01:08:01,101 --> 01:08:02,659
I think he just needs help.

735
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:06,604
Wherever he is, Lois,
I'm sure he'll manage.

736
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:10,568
Well, if he can't manage...

737
01:08:11,011 --> 01:08:14,640
...and if he really is in trouble...

738
01:08:14,848 --> 01:08:19,114
...then there's a few things
I'd like to tell him.

739
01:08:21,188 --> 01:08:22,655
I'd tell him...

740
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:27,592
...that I will always cherish
the time we spent together.

741
01:08:28,162 --> 01:08:31,654
And that I never expected
anything in return.

742
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:34,330
And no matter...

743
01:08:35,169 --> 01:08:38,536
...how few minutes I saw him for,
it always made me happy.

744
01:08:39,139 --> 01:08:42,404
And I would tell him
that I love him...

745
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:45,278
...and that I'll always love him.

746
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,172
And that...

747
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:48,611
...whatever...

748
01:08:50,017 --> 01:08:52,485
...happens to the world...

749
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,619
...I know that...

750
01:08:55,622 --> 01:08:59,718
...he's doing his best to make sure
it's all right for the rest of us.

751
01:09:00,127 --> 01:09:01,924
Well, wherever he is, Lois...

752
01:09:02,496 --> 01:09:06,364
...I know that he would
want to thank you.

753
01:09:13,574 --> 01:09:16,304
Listen, I'm pretty tired, you know?

754
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:20,378
So I think I'll just rest here
for a while. Okay?

755
01:09:20,748 --> 01:09:22,181
I'll be fine.

756
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:25,480
It's okay. Please?

757
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,857
- I hope you feel better, Clark.
- Thanks.

758
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:46,137
If you do see him, or hear from him...

759
01:09:48,742 --> 01:09:50,437
...he might need this.

760
01:09:58,018 --> 01:09:59,576
Oh, Lex.

761
01:09:59,787 --> 01:10:03,917
We're all very pleased at all
the nuclear missiles and arms...

762
01:10:04,124 --> 01:10:06,024
...you've helped us sell...

763
01:10:06,226 --> 01:10:10,128
...and we've decided
to increase your commission.

764
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:13,356
Oh, guys, really, that's great.

765
01:10:14,134 --> 01:10:16,398
It is the least we could do.

766
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:19,235
Well, I had another idea.
Gentlemen...

767
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:23,240
...I've decided to assume
control of the company.

768
01:10:30,717 --> 01:10:33,049
My first official act,
of course, is to say:

769
01:10:33,253 --> 01:10:34,618
"You're fired!"

770
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,418
You're mad!

771
01:10:37,624 --> 01:10:39,182
Oh, really?

772
01:10:49,103 --> 01:10:51,628
If you want a reference for work...

773
01:10:51,839 --> 01:10:53,363
...forget it!

774
01:10:56,777 --> 01:10:58,335
That's a good bit.

775
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:03,706
You know with my brains, and your...
Frankly, your...

776
01:11:04,017 --> 01:11:07,544
...brawn, the possibilities
are absolutely staggering.

777
01:11:07,754 --> 01:11:10,814
You know, I could be president,
emperor, king.

778
01:11:11,258 --> 01:11:13,123
See how scared those guys were?

779
01:11:13,327 --> 01:11:15,158
And what do you fear?

780
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:20,966
What? Now? With Superman dead,
and you're on my team?

781
01:11:21,435 --> 01:11:25,735
It's like you're the best power
forward ever. What's to fear?

782
01:11:39,386 --> 01:11:43,914
<i>All that remains of</i>
<i>Krypton's energy is yours.</i>

783
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:46,352
<i>After it is gone...</i>

784
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,018
<i>... you will belong solely</i>
<i>to your new home.</i>

785
01:11:51,365 --> 01:11:55,699
<i>If our dying planet can</i>
<i>save your life, my son...</i>

786
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,204
<i>... we have not died in vain.</i>

787
01:13:05,572 --> 01:13:08,405
- Where is the woman?
- You'll never find her.

788
01:13:08,742 --> 01:13:12,508
If you will not tell me,
I will hurt people.

789
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,998
Stop! Don't do it, the people!

790
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:35,891
All right, stop! That's enough!

791
01:14:36,296 --> 01:14:37,729
That's enough!

792
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:39,990
You win. I'll take you to her.

793
01:15:11,898 --> 01:15:14,264
- Where is she?
- Far away from here and safe.

794
01:15:15,168 --> 01:15:16,999
Don't go in, she's not in there!

795
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:19,975
We've gotta tone down
these headlines.

796
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:23,980
Tone down our headlines?
That's all the common man reads!

797
01:19:24,184 --> 01:19:29,121
- We can do with less sensationalism.
- Less sensational papers go broke.

798
01:19:29,422 --> 01:19:33,722
I thought I taught you long ago that
the business of newspapers is business.

799
01:19:33,927 --> 01:19:35,087
No, Daddy...

800
01:19:35,295 --> 01:19:37,354
...our business is journalism.

801
01:19:37,864 --> 01:19:40,059
We can't keep being
so irresponsible...

802
01:19:40,266 --> 01:19:42,461
...or we'll lead everyone
into disaster.

803
01:19:42,669 --> 01:19:44,660
Don't be overdramatic,
young lady.

804
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:48,034
What kind of disaster could
we possibly help bring about?

805
01:19:50,443 --> 01:19:51,467
Lacy!

806
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,036
What's going on? Hey!

807
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:45,347
Are you sure you know what
you're doing, Mr. White?

808
01:21:45,558 --> 01:21:46,786
Well...

809
01:21:48,428 --> 01:21:50,259
Here comes Mr. Warfield.

810
01:21:50,897 --> 01:21:52,888
You better have a good explanation...

811
01:21:53,099 --> 01:21:56,068
...or else you'll be talking
to your lawyers from jail.

812
01:21:56,269 --> 01:21:58,760
You know, I'm not a tycoon.

813
01:21:58,972 --> 01:22:00,735
I'm just an old reporter.

814
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,408
But I've read enough
in my own newspaper...

815
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:06,704
...about hostile takeovers
at big companies.

816
01:22:06,913 --> 01:22:09,677
You, Mr. Warfield, must have
been asleep at the wheel.

817
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,545
Because I've convinced
the bankers of this city...

818
01:22:12,752 --> 01:22:17,018
...that our <i>Daily Planet</i> should be
treated like a natural resource...

819
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,214
...protected from predators.

820
01:22:19,526 --> 01:22:23,587
I convinced them to lend me the money.
I bought the outstanding shares.

821
01:22:23,797 --> 01:22:28,530
And you, Mr. Warfield,
are now a minority shareholder.

822
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:31,067
Everyone, back to work.

823
01:22:31,638 --> 01:22:33,037
Way to tell him, chief!

824
01:22:35,542 --> 01:22:38,238
Well, I'm sorry.
You win some and you lose some.

825
01:22:38,444 --> 01:22:41,242
Now this is what I call a newspaper.

826
01:22:41,447 --> 01:22:43,642
Compliments of <i>The Daily Planet.</i>

827
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:46,746
- Have a nice day. We did it!
- We're back!

828
01:22:51,491 --> 01:22:53,584
- Hi, am I late?
- Hi, how you doing?

829
01:22:53,793 --> 01:22:57,490
It must've been some effort for
you to drag yourself out of bed.

830
01:22:57,697 --> 01:23:01,189
I'm feeling a lot better.
I had a visit from a good nurse.

831
01:23:01,401 --> 01:23:04,734
It must've been good medicine because
she said you were really ill.

832
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:08,704
Sometimes all you need is loving
attention from the right person.

833
01:23:08,908 --> 01:23:10,603
Glad you're back, Clark.

834
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:13,870
And remember I am covering
Superman's press conference.

835
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,777
- Just tape reactions from the crowd.
- Reactions, okay.

836
01:23:18,351 --> 01:23:19,340
Oh, dear.

837
01:23:19,552 --> 01:23:21,349
Guess I need a tape recorder, huh?

838
01:23:21,554 --> 01:23:22,578
- Be right back.
- Clark.

839
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:25,656
Same old Mr. Kent.
He'll never change.

840
01:23:25,859 --> 01:23:27,520
I hope not.

841
01:23:36,269 --> 01:23:39,466
- How you doing, Superman?
- Lois, good to see you again.

842
01:23:39,672 --> 01:23:41,333
Good to see you too.

843
01:23:41,541 --> 01:23:42,838
Morning, gentlemen.

844
01:23:43,276 --> 01:23:44,436
Excuse me.

845
01:23:45,011 --> 01:23:45,841
Thank you.

846
01:23:46,512 --> 01:23:50,209
Once more, we survived the threat
of war and found a fragile peace.

847
01:23:51,117 --> 01:23:54,052
I thought I could give you
freedom from war but...

848
01:23:54,254 --> 01:23:57,121
...I was wrong.
It's not mine to give.

849
01:23:58,658 --> 01:24:00,489
We're still a young planet.

850
01:24:01,027 --> 01:24:03,860
There are galaxies out there...

851
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:07,657
...other civilizations for us
to meet, to learn from.

852
01:24:08,268 --> 01:24:10,463
What a brilliant future we could have.

853
01:24:10,737 --> 01:24:13,831
And there will be peace when
the people of the world...

854
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,530
...want it so badly...

855
01:24:15,742 --> 01:24:18,905
...their governments will
have to give it to them.

856
01:24:21,314 --> 01:24:24,181
I wish you could see the Earth
the way that I see it...

857
01:24:24,384 --> 01:24:28,047
...because when you really look
at it, it's just one world.

858
01:24:32,258 --> 01:24:33,885
Do you think he'll find us?

859
01:24:34,093 --> 01:24:37,460
Never. We'll lay low for a while...

860
01:24:37,664 --> 01:24:40,895
...a couple of years.
I'll come up with a new plan.

861
01:24:41,634 --> 01:24:44,068
Good thing I bought my drums.

862
01:24:57,784 --> 01:25:00,378
Uncle Lex,
you're not gonna believe this...

863
01:25:00,586 --> 01:25:02,554
...but it's Superman!
- Superman!

864
01:25:07,593 --> 01:25:11,256
- Hey, this rocks!
- Morning, Father.

865
01:25:11,464 --> 01:25:14,160
This kid's been under a bad
influence. Can you help?

866
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:17,029
- Every boy can be helped.
- I think you're right.

867
01:25:17,236 --> 01:25:19,227
- Good luck, son.
- Come with me, friend.

868
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:21,566
You wouldn't happen
to have a drum set?

869
01:25:21,774 --> 01:25:24,607
Hey, Mozart's back!

870
01:25:29,549 --> 01:25:32,484
- Duane, Mozart's back!
- I see him, Bubba!

871
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:36,119
Shut up!

872
01:25:37,123 --> 01:25:40,320
- All right, take him away.
- Thank you. Come on, Luthor.

873
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,652
- Just one thing, how did you beat him?
- High school physics.

874
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,922
I had time to figure out...

875
01:25:47,133 --> 01:25:50,830
...that if it was born from the sun,
that had to be its energy.

876
01:25:51,037 --> 01:25:54,006
- Is the world gonna be vaporized?
- No, Luthor.

877
01:25:54,207 --> 01:25:57,438
It's as it always was, on the brink,
with good fighting evil.

878
01:25:57,643 --> 01:25:58,905
See you in 20.
