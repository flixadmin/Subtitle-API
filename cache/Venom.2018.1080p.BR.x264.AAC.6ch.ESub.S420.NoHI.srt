I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

18
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:47,058
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

19

- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,650
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

21
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:52,452
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

22
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:54,821
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

23
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:58,458
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

24
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,461
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

25
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:02,663
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

26
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,465
No. We have
three of them.

27
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:06,433
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

28
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:09,505
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

29
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:24,552
What is she saying?

30
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:26,690
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:02,856

- Here you go.

38
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,792

- Thank...

you're wearing a suit. Yes!

- Thank you.

in the Life Foundation case.

44

- Oh. Mmm!

00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:30,718
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

48
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,620
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

49
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,454
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

50
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:37,391
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

'cause I plan on wearing it

- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

- What'd I tell you?

What's the deal?

90

- Yeah? Who?

91
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,642

- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

93
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:33,881
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

94
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:36,584
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

Uh...

96
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:39,954

97
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,655
I'm gonna level with you.

98
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:44,058
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

99
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,495
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

100
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:50,498
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

101
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,902
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

102
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:57,838
He's a crook.

103

Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

104

Now, you know we love

There isn't a better investigative

but no one
is above the network.

107
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,986
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

108
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:12,688
All right, all right.

109
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,059
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

110
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:18,727
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

111
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:20,529
It's not...
It's not what I do.

112
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,064
Well, my mother
always told me

113
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:25,033
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

114
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:26,236
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

115
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,671
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

116
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:30,106
- Oh.
- That's you...

117
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,775
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

118
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,977
- Nah.
- Yeah.

119
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,178
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

120
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,180
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

121
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,649
That's what my mom told me.

122
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,683
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

123
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:43,921
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

124
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,990
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

125
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,858
The guy you work for
is a complete...

126
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,927
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

127
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,562
and my firm works for him.

128
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,031
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

129
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,135
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

130
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,903
- A repeat?
- Of the <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Daily Globe</i></font> incident.

131
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,639
Ow! Really?

132
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,441
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

133
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,742
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

134
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,144
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

135
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,680
No, I still have
currency in New York.

136
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,982
I was going places.

137
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,083
I wasn't running.

138
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,852
I was going places.

139
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,687
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

140
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,556
- Me?
- You are my home.

141
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,294
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

142
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,967
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

143
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:28,235
Let's just get the check.

144
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,966
I'm gonna get a drink.

145
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,648
Shh.

146
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:02,232
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

147
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:04,801
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

148
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:08,071
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

149
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:10,773
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

150
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:12,909
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

151
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,179
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

152
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,382
to go out there
and create things that others

153
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,784
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

154
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:22,854
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

155
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,789
Come here. What's your name?

156
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,825
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

157
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,467
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

158
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,096
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

159
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:33,166
But you know what?
In the end,

160
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:36,101
we're the ones
who change the world.

161
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:39,038
Take good care
of that, Allie.

162
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,805
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

163
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:42,174
- Say hi.
- Hi.

164
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:43,376
Hello, kids.

165
00:11:43,378 --> 00:11:45,411
Um, sorry to interrupt,

166
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,779
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

167
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:49,982
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

168
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:52,285
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

169
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:55,755
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

170
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,636
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

171
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,461
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i></font>

172
00:11:59,694 --> 00:12:01,428
we just start
at the beginning?

173
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,465
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

174
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:06,999
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

175
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:09,802
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

176
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,305
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

177
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:13,373
it tripled their
life expectancy.

178
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,043
But it's okay.

179
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:18,079
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

180
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:20,080
All right, you create

181
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:21,783
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

182
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:23,452
- And then...
- Rockets.

183
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:25,456
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

184
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,458
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

185
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:29,991
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

186
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:31,826
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

187
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:33,429
is crucial
in our quest to cure

188
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,364
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

189
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,931
But if you think about
everything we've found...

190
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,366
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

191
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:40,302
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

192
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:42,805
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

193
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:44,305
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

194
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:46,141
from your pharmaceutical
companies

195
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:47,942
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

196
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:49,143
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

197
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,480
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

198
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:52,781
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

199
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:54,383
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

200
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,385
How does it...
How does it, um...

201
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,320
I don't know,
how does it go about,

202
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:01,390
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

203
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:03,226
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

204
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:05,227
I'm talking
about the allegations.

205
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:06,830
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

206
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:08,331
your entire empire
has been built

207
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,402
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

208
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,837
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

209
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,039
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

210
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,374
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

211
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,941
end up killing people.

212
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:19,444
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

213
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,811
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

214
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:22,246
Right. What about
the legal cases?

215
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:23,813
Sorry?

216
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,950
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

217
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:27,885
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

218
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:29,220
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

219
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:30,821
And they're just some
of the people who walked

220
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,823
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

221
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:34,493
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

222
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,193
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

223
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,462
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

224
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:39,264
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

225
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:40,132
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

226
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:40,998
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,866
Is that a threat?

228
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:43,504
Have a nice life.

229
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:49,173
I know what
you're going to say, but...

230
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:51,843
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

231
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,878
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

232
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,418
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

233
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:03,856
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

234
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,595
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

235
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:08,562
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

236
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:10,129
We do the work.

237
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:12,602
We substantiate
our accusations.

238
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,902
We provide evidence.

239
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:18,238
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

240
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:26,179
You're fired, Eddie.

241
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:28,182
I can't trust you.

242
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,587
Have a nice life.

243
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:32,701
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

244
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:35,457
Hey.

245
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,459
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

246
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,992
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

247
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:40,027
Your ego requires
constant attention,

248
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,096
and you're stubborn as hell.

249
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,331
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

250
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,503
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

251
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,540
What you did
got me fired.

252
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,377
You used me.

253
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:03,422
Annie? Annie.

254
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:38,057
Oh, my God.

255
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:43,195
You're beautiful.

256
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,251
Test 36.

257
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:43,787
Biological interactions

258
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,122
between two different organisms.

259
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:48,727
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

260
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:50,762
in order to survive
for any amount of time

261
00:17:50,764 --> 00:17:52,597
in an oxygen-rich environment.

262
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,800
Well, why are
all these hosts

263
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,568
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

264
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,537
That's what
we're trying to find out.

265
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:01,776
The bonding process
is starting.

266
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,281
It's equalizing.

267
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:17,355
But why? Why this rabbit?

268
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:19,828
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

269
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,795
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

270
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,363
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

271
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:29,234
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

272
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:33,539
but also we would
be able to survive there.

273
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,240
"We"?

274
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:37,376
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

275
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:39,344
to even begin to think
about something like...

276
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:40,780
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

277
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:43,282
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

278
00:18:43,284 --> 00:18:44,965
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

279
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,821
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

280
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,691
Hey, how are your kids?

281
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,226
Let's begin human trials.

282
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:53,363
Good work.

283
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:16,820
Hey, Jack.

284
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:20,789
Do you ever feel
like your life

285
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,426
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

292
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,607
Some people
are trying to watch that.

293
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,910
Oh, you are, are you?

294
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,514
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

295
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,917
I used to be.

this is for you.

300
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,794
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

301
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,828
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

302
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,830
playing hard to get.

303
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,302
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

304
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,939
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

305
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,943
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

306
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,311
Cost you $5.

307
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,448
$5 for a paper that's free?

308
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,450
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

309
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:21,252
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

310
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,723
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

311
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:24,790
You did that for me?

312
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,392
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

313
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:30,463
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

314
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:32,898
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

315
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,566
I'll throw in the paper.

316
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,302
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

317
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,774
but not to sing,
all right?

318
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:40,540
Deal.

319
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,442
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

320
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:46,278
No. You're welcome.

321
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,582
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

322
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:50,851
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

323
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:52,853
you know, aches and pains.

324
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:54,022
You look like shit.

325
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:56,423
Excuse me?

326
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:57,793
You look like shit.

327
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,996
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

328
00:21:01,998 --> 00:21:04,731
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

329
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,601
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

330
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:08,603
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

331
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:10,737
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

332
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:13,941
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

333
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:16,744
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

334
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:18,479
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

335
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:19,647
That is the problem.

336
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:27,522
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

337
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:29,924
Please.

338
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:31,391
Let's go.

339
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:33,074
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

340
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,935
The full payment is due.
Now.

341
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:41,037
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

342
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,741
I don't like to wait.

343
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:02,028
Life hurts, Eddie.

344
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:04,029
It just does.

345
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:24,380
I gotta go.

346
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:28,454
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

347
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,092
What a dick.

348
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:04,458
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

349
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,992
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

350
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:07,460
I can use a pseudonym.

351
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:08,929
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

352
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,930
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Tootsie?</i></font>

353
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:17,837
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>I'll call you back.</i></font>

354
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,708
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

355
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:31,152
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Realize deeply that the

it's no longer...</i></font>

362
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:09,725
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

363
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:14,164
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

364
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,833
History starts now.

365
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:18,535
This is day one.

366
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:21,806
This is first contact.

367
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:24,175
Let's get to work.

368
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:39,159
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Establishing subject baseline.</i></font>

<font color="#00FF7F"><i>All vital signs are normal.</i></font>

370
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:52,237
Put me through.

371
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,074
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

372
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,876
There's no need.

373
00:24:57,878 --> 00:25:00,912
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

374
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:02,948
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Yes, sir.</i></font>

375
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,083
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i></font>

376
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:07,819
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i></font>

377
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:10,989
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

378
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:13,058
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

379
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,132
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.

381
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:25,005
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i></font>

382
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:29,810
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

383
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:32,713
Look around you.
Look at the world.

384
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:34,181
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i></font>

385
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:36,318
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>a planet on the brink

386
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:39,620
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i></font>

387
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,255
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

388
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:44,291
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i></font>

389
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,829
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i></font>

390
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,833
We will.

391
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:55,906
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i></font>

392
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:59,309
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Yes.</i></font>

393
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:03,213
Open it.

394
00:26:16,195 --> 00:26:18,294
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

395
00:26:18,296 --> 00:26:20,030
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Please let me... No.</i></font>

396
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,199
Oh, please, please, please!

397
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:42,352
His vitals are holding steady.

398
00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:45,056
- Where the hell did it go?
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Incredible.</i></font>

399
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:46,626
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Where did it go?</i></font>

400
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:52,796
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Where is it?</i></font>

401
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:32,107
Bring in the next volunteer.

402
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:03,872
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

403
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:05,273
I was...

404
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:08,009
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

405
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:12,180
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

406
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:17,489
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

407
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:19,287
I mean...

408
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:21,092
You have to know
how to disappear.

409
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:26,162
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

410
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,099
Whoever you are, you suck.

411
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,066
Okay.

412
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:33,135
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

413
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,471
I need your help.

414
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:36,172
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

415
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:37,907
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

416
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:39,909
We're done.

417
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:41,511
No...

418
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:44,847
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

419
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:46,916
Everything that you
accused him of,

420
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:48,251
you were right.
It's all true.

421
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:49,785
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

422
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:51,854
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

423
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,190
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

424
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,026
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

425
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:58,095
and they are dying.

426
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:00,197
They are all dying.

427
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,768
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

428
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:03,937
Come here.

429
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:07,171
Why would I believe you?

430
00:29:07,173 --> 00:29:08,339
Because it's true.

431
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:10,108
I believed in him, and I...

432
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,043
I told myself
that it was worth it

433
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:14,213
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

434
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:15,575
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

435
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:17,081
I can't do that.

436
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,884
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

437
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:20,519
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

438
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:22,187
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

439
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:23,856
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

440
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:26,058
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

441
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,428
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

442
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,195
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

443
00:29:31,197 --> 00:29:33,501
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

444
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:37,036
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

445
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:39,338
genuinely,
and you have proof,

446
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,408
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

447
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,444
I am.

448
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:46,446
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

449
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:47,913
because I am done.

450
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:49,283
I am done
with all of this shit.

451
00:29:50,152 --> 00:29:51,518
What shit?

452
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,487
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

453
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:56,059
All right? Good night.

454
00:30:15,244 --> 00:30:16,245
Eddie?

455
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:18,615
Well, hey. Whoa.

456
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,882
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

457
00:30:21,884 --> 00:30:23,217
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

458
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:24,986
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

459
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:26,590
Eddie...

460
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,424
This is Dan.

461
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,460
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

462
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,194
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

463
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:33,836
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

464
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:34,929
- Really?
- Yeah.

465
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:36,932
I'm a big fan of your work.

466
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,267
- Thank you.
- Really?

467
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:41,473
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

468
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,907
Yeah, I was one of them.

469
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:47,443
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

470
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,165
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

471
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,951
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

472
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,161
He has a key. You know he has a key?

473
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,530
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

474
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:11,001
Yeah. Well, uh...

475
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:13,404
So, uh, what you up to?

476
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:16,608
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

477
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,645
Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

478
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,212
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

479
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,181
No, he's a doctor.

480
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,219
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

481
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:29,219
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

482
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,656
I would say
that he misses you,

483
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:32,424
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

484
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:34,125
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

485
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:35,528
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

486
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,665
You look good, by the way.
You doing good?

487
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:39,097
What are you
doing here, Eddie?

488
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,179
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

489
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:43,167
A lot.

490
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,570
You know, we were gonna
get married.

491
00:31:44,572 --> 00:31:47,138
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

492
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,044
I can't really believe
that we're not...

493
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:53,449
Are we gonna try
and find our way back?

494
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:55,951
No, we can't.

495
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:00,087
You did this, Eddie.

496
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,659
Not Carlton Drake,
not the network.

497
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:05,728
You.

500
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:19,337
Talk to me.

501
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:25,442
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

502
00:33:25,444 --> 00:33:27,044

and shut up, please.

506
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:43,429
These are two things
that Drake cannot control.

507
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:45,397
Yeah, got it, right.

508
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,434
We are literally a generation
away from an uninhabitable Earth.

509
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:51,269
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

510
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:53,371
to scout real estate.

511
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:55,240
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

512
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,376
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

513
00:33:57,378 --> 00:34:00,446
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

514
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:03,282
On the way back,
they found a comet.

515
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:05,586
A comet?

516
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:08,654
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

517
00:34:08,656 --> 00:34:10,591
Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

518
00:34:10,593 --> 00:34:12,391
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

519
00:34:12,393 --> 00:34:13,829
You're talking about aliens?

520
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:16,463
Like, aliens?

521
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:17,831
E.T. phone home.

522
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,566
Aliens, yeah.

523
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:21,870
Yes.

524
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,304
But we don't
call them that.

525
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,173
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

526
00:34:27,175 --> 00:34:29,844
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

527
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:34,314
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

528
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:37,184
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

529
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:41,657
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

530
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,156
So they can live in space?

531
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:44,592
We call them hosts.

532
00:34:44,594 --> 00:34:47,395
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

533
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:49,498
Yes. There's no protocol
for this thing.

534
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,766
He's just feeding them in.

535
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,734

540
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:06,816

time to adjust.

Suzy.
Come on, over here.

607
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,024
May I speak to Annie Weying,
please?

608
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:09,259
Can you tell her
that it's an emergency?

609
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:10,629
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Food.</i></font>

610
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:13,263
Who said that?

611
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:15,666
No, I'm not talking to you.

612
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:17,303
Can you please tell me
where she is?

613
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:20,973
Great. Thank you.

614
00:42:26,012 --> 00:42:27,212
Okay...

615
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:33,717
Yes, Lana for two?

616
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,085
- I'm sorry, sir?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:36,387
- Sir?
- Oh, yes.

618
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,789
Oh, my God, Eddie.
What are you doing here?

619
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:39,023
- Annie...
- No, no, no...

620
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:40,658
No, I have to tell you
something.

621
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,760
- No, no, no. Please.
- No, now. I have to.

622
00:42:42,762 --> 00:42:43,695
Work told me you were here. You're
the only person that I trust.

623
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:44,963
Are you drunk?

624
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:46,577
Yeah. No, I broke into
the Life Foundation.

625
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:48,032
- Eddie, you did what?
- Yeah, but I may...

626
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:49,300
I think I may have been
infected.

627
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:50,869
He's burning up.
You're really hot.

628
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:51,769
Eddie, you look like
you're in a bad way.

629
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:53,206
I am. I am in a bad way.

630
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,130
Eddie, Jesus!

631
00:42:58,979 --> 00:43:00,114
This is dead.

632
00:43:00,782 --> 00:43:02,082
Dead.

633
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:03,716
Eddie, sit down.

634
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:05,685
Okay, all right. Okay.

635
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:07,253
- Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Stop that.

636
00:43:07,255 --> 00:43:08,889
- Sir, sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
- Eddie, quit it.

637
00:43:08,891 --> 00:43:10,023
Put it down. Eddie!

638
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:12,059
Snap out of it!

639
00:43:13,962 --> 00:43:15,095
No.

640
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:16,863
All right. It's no good.

641
00:43:16,865 --> 00:43:18,298
Bobby,
are you all right?

642
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,435
- Hey!
- Whoa!

643
00:43:19,668 --> 00:43:21,334
Hey, hey, hey.

644
00:43:21,336 --> 00:43:22,416
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

645
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:25,972
I'm hot.
Is anyone else hot?

646
00:43:25,974 --> 00:43:27,174
Are you hurt?

647
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:28,409
- Sir, excuse me.
- No! Shh!

648
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:30,110
Wait,
where are you going? Eddie?

649
00:43:30,112 --> 00:43:31,711
This is unacceptable.
I'm gonna call the police.

650
00:43:31,713 --> 00:43:33,147
What are you doing?
No, please don't.

651
00:43:33,149 --> 00:43:34,715
- No.
- Eddie, please.

652
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:35,816
Oh, my God.

653
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:38,085
Ah.

654
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,292
- Now I'm gonna call the police.
- No, no. Please don't call the police.

655
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:46,372
Here, call an ambulance. I'm a doctor.
This man is my, um...

656
00:43:46,396 --> 00:43:48,062
Patient.

657
00:43:48,064 --> 00:43:49,730
Oh, it's much better.

658
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:51,132
You are insane.

659
00:43:51,134 --> 00:43:52,647
- He's killing people.
- Who's killing people?

660
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,068
- Carlton Drake.
- Oh, God, Eddie,

661
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,236
- not this again.
- Yes, he is. He is!

662
00:43:55,238 --> 00:43:57,773
And I have proof!

663
00:43:57,775 --> 00:43:59,007
Ugh.

664
00:44:05,282 --> 00:44:07,919
- Hey, Eddie...
- Hmm?

665
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:14,259
Eddie.

666
00:44:15,461 --> 00:44:16,860
Eddie?

667
00:44:17,996 --> 00:44:19,331
Eddie, can you hear me?

668
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:21,919
This is Dan speaking to you.

669
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:25,835
Hey, Dan.

670
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:27,304
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Welcome back.</i></font>
- Where am I?

671
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:28,772
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Uh, you're in the MRI.</i></font>

672
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:30,340
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Okay, we've given you
a little sedative.</i></font>

673
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:33,110
- Where is Anne?
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Anne is not here right now.</i></font>

674
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:34,514
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>We're gonna run
some tests, okay?</i></font>

675
00:44:34,747 --> 00:44:36,013
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>It's gonna be completely
painless.</i></font>

676
00:44:36,015 --> 00:44:37,848
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>So, you know,
just try to stay still.</i></font>

677
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,519
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Uh, relax, and, um...</i></font>

678
00:44:40,753 --> 00:44:41,819
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Yeah, here we go.</i></font>

679
00:44:48,027 --> 00:44:49,360
Eddie, what's happening
in there?

680
00:44:49,362 --> 00:44:50,961
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Eddie, you okay?</i></font>

681
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:56,968
Shut it down.

682
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,038
Hey, hey, hey.

683
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,239
You're okay. Yeah.

684
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:03,376
Coming out. You all right?

685
00:45:03,378 --> 00:45:04,976
- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.

686
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:06,479
- You okay?
- Yeah.

687
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:06,952
All right.

688
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:08,414
Just take a deep
breath. Okay? You're okay.

689
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:10,416
Yeah.

690
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,217
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Now, listen, you're not the
first person to freak out in there.</i></font>

691
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:14,053
I get claustrophobic, too.

692
00:45:14,055 --> 00:45:15,557
Dr. Lewis?

693
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:17,923
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

694
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:19,493
Oh, I just saw Morris.

695
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:22,564
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

696
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:24,743
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

697
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:26,832
Yeah, my pleasure.

698
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:28,535
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

699
00:45:28,537 --> 00:45:30,136
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

700
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:32,205
Sorry. Gemini.

701
00:45:32,207 --> 00:45:33,839
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

702
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:35,274
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

703
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:36,843
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

704
00:45:36,845 --> 00:45:38,178
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

705
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,820
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

706
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:43,316
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

707
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:44,551
Did you have
the same reactions

708
00:45:44,553 --> 00:45:46,219
regardless
of the temperature...

709
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,827
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

710
00:45:56,032 --> 00:45:58,166
The creature
and the host are one.

711
00:45:58,168 --> 00:45:59,603
Everything was fine.

712
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:02,439
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

713
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:05,441
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

714
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:06,975
But the organism
is unaffected?

715
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:08,344
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

716
00:46:08,346 --> 00:46:10,547
But once again,
it's killing the host.

717
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:11,589
It's consuming his organs.

718
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:14,251
Oh, watch this.

719
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,910
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

720
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:25,160
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

721
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:27,600
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

722
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,899
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

723
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:32,341
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

724
00:46:33,204 --> 00:46:35,137
We're gonna need another host.

725
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:37,173
Such poor design.

726
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:40,008
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

727
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,278
Sorry to interrupt.

728
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,652
Thought you'd like
some good news.

729
00:46:45,884 --> 00:46:47,588
I'm sorry.

730
00:46:58,331 --> 00:46:59,666
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Hungry!</i></font>

731
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,066
Oh, goddamn.

732
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:03,968
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

733
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:06,170
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

734
00:47:06,172 --> 00:47:07,472
Thank you.

735
00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:09,039
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

736
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:11,613
Until the cable car stops.

737
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:18,651
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

738
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:20,654
Excuse me.

739
00:47:25,993 --> 00:47:27,058
Oh, hey, Anne.

740
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,029
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

741
00:47:30,031 --> 00:47:31,699
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

742
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,033
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

743
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:36,671
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

744
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:38,638
but it would
explain the fever.

745
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,239
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>That would make sense.</i></font>

746
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:44,111
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

747
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:46,012
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i></font>

748
00:47:46,014 --> 00:47:47,381
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

749
00:47:47,383 --> 00:47:49,016
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i></font>

750
00:47:49,018 --> 00:47:51,251
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

751
00:47:51,253 --> 00:47:53,153
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

752
00:47:53,155 --> 00:47:55,088
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

753
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,225
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

754
00:47:58,227 --> 00:48:00,260
but super, super fast?

755
00:48:00,262 --> 00:48:02,029
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Yes. We just did.</i></font>

756
00:48:02,031 --> 00:48:03,397
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i></font>

757
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:05,265
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

758
00:48:05,267 --> 00:48:07,435
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

759
00:48:07,437 --> 00:48:10,337
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

760
00:48:10,339 --> 00:48:12,306
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

761
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:13,641
and we are gonna
clear that out.

762
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:15,210
- Yes.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Never gonna happen.</i></font>

763
00:48:15,212 --> 00:48:17,715
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

764
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:19,614
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>I know.</i></font>

765
00:48:19,616 --> 00:48:22,150
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

766
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,619
Who are you talking to?

767
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:25,521
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

768
00:48:25,523 --> 00:48:28,423
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

769
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:45,175
Yeah?

770
00:48:45,177 --> 00:48:46,817
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

771
00:48:46,979 --> 00:48:48,713
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

772
00:48:48,715 --> 00:48:50,213
Whatever.

773
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,151
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

774
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:57,593
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

775
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:02,094
I was troubled by

776
00:49:03,128 --> 00:49:04,730
what we've been doing.

777
00:49:04,732 --> 00:49:06,531
I get it.

778
00:49:06,533 --> 00:49:07,800
I get it.

779
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:10,502
We've all been troubled.

780
00:49:10,504 --> 00:49:13,072
It's the nature
of what we do.

781
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:17,778
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

782
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:20,780
I need that from you.

783
00:49:23,784 --> 00:49:26,317
I can't do that.

784
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,757
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

785
00:49:30,624 --> 00:49:32,059
your friend.

786
00:49:33,394 --> 00:49:35,127
The person who was here.

787
00:49:35,129 --> 00:49:37,129
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

788
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:39,667
You know that, right?

789
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:42,167
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

790
00:49:42,169 --> 00:49:44,440
where you can help
to keep them alive.

791
00:49:47,475 --> 00:49:49,110
Hey. Dora.

792
00:49:50,712 --> 00:49:53,583
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

793
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:58,119
Will you trust me?

794
00:50:05,093 --> 00:50:06,660
Eddie Brock.

795
00:50:06,662 --> 00:50:07,830
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

796
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,175
You were our best.

797
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,509
Open it.

798
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:26,848
No! No!

799
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,853
No! No! No!

800
00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:35,460
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Do not open that door.</i></font>

801
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:38,293
Huh?

802
00:50:50,775 --> 00:50:52,843
Stay put.

803
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:54,711
- Hey, Eddie.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Who the hell is this guy?</i></font>

804
00:50:54,713 --> 00:50:56,915
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

805
00:50:57,181 --> 00:50:58,849
Whoa.

806
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:01,618
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>What are you doing?</i></font>
- I'm, uh...

807
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,319
I'm putting my hands up.

808
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,622
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>You are making us
look bad.</i></font>

809
00:51:05,624 --> 00:51:08,592
I...
No, I am not.

810
00:51:08,594 --> 00:51:09,895
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Yes, you are.</i></font>

811
00:51:10,129 --> 00:51:11,528
- No, I'm not.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Yes, you are!</i></font>

812
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,230
- No, I'm not.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Why would you do that?</i></font>

813
00:51:13,232 --> 00:51:15,231
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

814
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:17,433
- Eddie...
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>I will take care of this myself.</i></font>

815
00:51:17,435 --> 00:51:19,335
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

816
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:22,141
Take him down.

817
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:34,722
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

818
00:51:43,264 --> 00:51:45,933
- What is that?
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Not "what." Who.</i></font>

819
00:51:47,635 --> 00:51:48,769
Oh.

820
00:51:58,279 --> 00:51:59,280
Shit.

821
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,537
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Outstanding.</i></font>

822
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:25,573
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i></font>

823
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:26,674
Why would we do that?

824
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,480
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i></font>

825
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,321
What the shit, man?

826
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,929
No! No, no, no!

827
00:52:52,704 --> 00:52:54,736
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

828
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,007
Apparently, I have a parasite.

829
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,019
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

830
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:09,687
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i></font>

831
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,560
He's achieved symbiosis.

832
00:53:16,562 --> 00:53:17,996
Are you seeing this?

833
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:19,999
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

834
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:23,000
Treece...

835
00:53:23,002 --> 00:53:25,005
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

836
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,714
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Eddie.</i></font>

837
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,758
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

838
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,860
It's not real.
You're in my head.

839
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:50,428
'Cause you're just a parasite.

840
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,465
"Parasite"?

841
00:53:58,673 --> 00:54:00,741
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

842
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:06,712
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

843
00:54:06,714 --> 00:54:08,514
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

844
00:54:08,516 --> 00:54:10,916
We can discuss this
like two men.

845
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,420
What is that? What is that?

846
00:54:20,863 --> 00:54:22,930
What?

847
00:54:22,932 --> 00:54:25,397
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

848
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:27,934
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i></font>

849
00:54:27,936 --> 00:54:29,037
Launch the drones.

850
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,534
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Duck.</i></font>

851
00:55:01,906 --> 00:55:03,538
Whew!

852
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,442
- Thank you.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>You are welcome.</i></font>

853
00:55:11,483 --> 00:55:13,652
Oh!

854
00:55:21,793 --> 00:55:24,273
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

855
00:55:31,003 --> 00:55:32,737
Oh, God, no!

856
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:56,760
Holy shit!

857
00:56:04,004 --> 00:56:06,038
Treece, do not
let him get away.

858
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,509
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

859
00:56:14,614 --> 00:56:16,751
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

860
00:56:18,052 --> 00:56:19,554
Oh, God! Do something!

861
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:28,096
What the...

862
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,072
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

863
00:56:41,242 --> 00:56:42,243
No, no, no! No, no!

864
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:46,734
No! You're out of your mind!

865
00:56:48,684 --> 00:56:51,020
No!

866
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:12,843
- That is a dead-end!
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Not for us.</i></font>

867
00:57:14,545 --> 00:57:16,647
Whoa!

868
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,821
Yeah!

869
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:54,953
Whoa!

870
00:58:01,794 --> 00:58:03,227
I am going to die!

871
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,665
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>You are not
going to die!</i></font>

872
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,046
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

873
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,855
I got him.

874
00:58:29,857 --> 00:58:30,922
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Bring him home.</i></font>
- Copy that.

875
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,860
This is incredible.

876
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:42,068
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

877
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:45,106
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

878
00:58:56,919 --> 00:59:00,888
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

879
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,359
So many snacks,
so little time.

880
00:59:14,004 --> 00:59:15,936
SFPD. Don't move!

881
00:59:15,938 --> 00:59:17,106
Get off the car!

882
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:34,926
My legs.

883
00:59:37,195 --> 00:59:39,060
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

884
00:59:39,062 --> 00:59:41,465
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

885
00:59:56,815 --> 00:59:58,748
What the hell
are you?

886
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,218
I am Venom.

887
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,987
And you are mine.

888
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:06,356
You bit somebody's head off.

889
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:08,426
Fuel in the tank.

890
01:00:08,428 --> 01:00:10,463
Listen carefully, Eddie.

891
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:12,930
You did not find us.

892
01:00:12,932 --> 01:00:15,502
We found you.

893
01:00:15,735 --> 01:00:17,768
Think of yourself
as my ride.

894
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,036
Where are you going?

895
01:00:19,038 --> 01:00:22,139
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

896
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:24,108
You remember him.

897
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,509
How do you even know
about that?

898
01:00:25,511 --> 01:00:28,012
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

899
01:00:28,014 --> 01:00:29,847
- Everything about you.
- How?

900
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:32,283
I am inside your head.

901
01:00:32,285 --> 01:00:34,853
You are a loser, Eddie.

902
01:00:39,425 --> 01:00:42,194
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

903
01:00:42,196 --> 01:00:43,495
Most likely.

904
01:00:43,497 --> 01:00:44,963
Oh, God.

905
01:00:44,965 --> 01:00:47,967
That is why we are here.

906
01:00:47,969 --> 01:00:51,273
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

907
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,543
That is the deal.

- Why? What's happening?

913
01:01:27,842 --> 01:01:29,912
I got Eddie's labs back,

914
01:01:31,314 --> 01:01:33,247
and it's worse than I thought.

915
01:01:33,249 --> 01:01:36,417
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

916
01:01:36,419 --> 01:01:38,152
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i></font>

917
01:01:38,154 --> 01:01:39,954
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

918
01:01:39,956 --> 01:01:41,592
- You need to get him here.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>My God.</i></font>

919
01:01:45,564 --> 01:01:47,397
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i></font>
- Shit.

920
01:01:53,938 --> 01:01:57,273
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

921
01:01:57,275 --> 01:01:59,442
- Where was he?
- I was...

922
01:01:59,444 --> 01:02:03,449
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

923
01:02:04,483 --> 01:02:05,517
The arrogance.

924
01:02:11,255 --> 01:02:15,493
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

925
01:02:15,495 --> 01:02:17,629
not until we find
another suitable host.

926
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:22,264
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

927
01:02:26,972 --> 01:02:29,272
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

928
01:02:29,274 --> 01:02:31,375
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

929
01:02:31,377 --> 01:02:32,442
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

930
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:34,378
Found another one, Bill.

931
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,280
Get off the streets.
Go home.

932
01:02:36,282 --> 01:02:37,982
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

933
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:39,018
Bodies?

934
01:02:40,454 --> 01:02:42,422
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

935
01:02:45,425 --> 01:02:47,392
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i></font>

936
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:49,328
That is none of your
goddamn business.

937
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:51,666
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i></font>

938
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:53,465
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>We have no secrets.</i></font>

939
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:55,100
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

940
01:02:55,102 --> 01:02:56,603
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

941
01:02:56,605 --> 01:03:00,139
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i></font>

942
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:01,940
Shit. Yeah?

943
01:03:01,942 --> 01:03:03,886
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

944
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,645
No, no, you can't see me.

945
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:07,946
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

946
01:03:07,948 --> 01:03:09,516
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

947
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:12,085
You cannot come
near me right now.

948
01:03:12,087 --> 01:03:13,687
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>No!</i></font>

949
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:15,387
- Eddie?
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>No, I gotta go up there.</i></font>

950
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:16,422
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

951
01:03:16,424 --> 01:03:17,692
I got to get up there, man.

952
01:03:17,926 --> 01:03:19,992
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

953
01:03:19,994 --> 01:03:21,361
There's no such thing
as can't.

954
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:22,532
I'm sorry, man.

955
01:03:23,465 --> 01:03:25,965
Okay, okay... Uh...

956
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:28,268
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

957
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:31,204
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

958
01:03:31,206 --> 01:03:33,508
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Let's eat his brains.</i></font>
- No! You do not touch him!

959
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,510
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

960
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:37,579
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

961
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,079
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

962
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,615
- <i>"We"?</i></font>
- Yeah.

963
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,697
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

964
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,222
Yeah.

965
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,531
- Shit.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>You want up?</i></font>

966
01:03:58,302 --> 01:04:00,638
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i></font>

967
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:13,751
Hmm.

968
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:17,185
- It is peaceful up here.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>I'm not very good with heights.</i></font>

969
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:21,390
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

970
01:04:21,392 --> 01:04:23,729
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

971
01:04:23,963 --> 01:04:25,127
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>What does that mean?</i></font>

972
01:04:33,405 --> 01:04:35,104
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

973
01:04:46,018 --> 01:04:47,417
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>I got us.</i></font>

974
01:04:47,419 --> 01:04:48,522
Whoa.

975
01:04:53,995 --> 01:04:57,563
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

976
01:04:57,565 --> 01:04:59,698
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>You die, I die.</i></font>

977
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,100
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

978
01:05:02,102 --> 01:05:04,603
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

979
01:05:04,605 --> 01:05:06,505
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Why would I do that?</i></font>

980
01:05:06,507 --> 01:05:09,508
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i></font>

981
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,677
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i></font>

982
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,146
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>You and I
are not so different.</i></font>

983
01:05:13,748 --> 01:05:14,815
Thank you.

984
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:19,720
Okay.

985
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,189
Here's your evidence.

986
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:28,329
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Jump.</i></font>

987

988
01:05:42,612 --> 01:05:43,746
Hands!

989
01:05:45,682 --> 01:05:47,416
On the ground! Now!

990
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:54,655
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

991
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:56,724
- Mask!
- Copy!

992
01:05:56,726 --> 01:05:59,225
All right,
have it your own way.

993
01:05:59,227 --> 01:06:00,864
- Mask!
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Copy.</i></font>

994
01:06:01,097 --> 01:06:02,631
What the hell
is that thing?

995
01:06:08,237 --> 01:06:09,405
What the hell?

996
01:06:10,641 --> 01:06:12,239
Hold your fire!

997
01:06:12,241 --> 01:06:14,375
Flares!

998
01:06:14,377 --> 01:06:15,477
He's there!
He's there!

999
01:06:15,479 --> 01:06:16,680
Reload!

1000
01:06:17,781 --> 01:06:19,514
Anybody see him?

1001
01:06:30,427 --> 01:06:32,362
Does anyone have eyes on him?

1002
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:36,201
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i></font>

1003
01:06:49,815 --> 01:06:51,548
I don't have
eyes on him.

1004
01:06:53,251 --> 01:06:54,319
Where is it?

1005
01:07:01,327 --> 01:07:02,426
Flash grenade!

1006
01:07:03,697 --> 01:07:04,829
Throw them!

1007
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,362
Flash grenade!

1008
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:18,678
He's in the rafters!

1009
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,745
Above!

1010
01:07:25,186 --> 01:07:26,219
There he is!

1011
01:07:30,858 --> 01:07:32,293
Move, move, move!

1012
01:08:02,257 --> 01:08:03,957
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i></font>

1013
01:08:10,332 --> 01:08:11,833
Annie! Annie, wait!

1014
01:08:11,835 --> 01:08:13,668
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1015
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:16,337
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1016
01:08:16,339 --> 01:08:18,807
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1017
01:08:18,809 --> 01:08:20,408
- "He"?
- Yes.

1018
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:22,845
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1019
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:25,549
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1020
01:08:27,918 --> 01:08:30,621
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1021
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:35,391
Right now.

1022
01:08:38,597 --> 01:08:41,395
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1023
01:08:41,397 --> 01:08:42,466
Get in the car, Eddie.

1024
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:47,639
- In the back.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>I like her. Get in.</i></font>

1025
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:56,815
I'm out of control.

1026
01:08:58,483 --> 01:08:59,984
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1027
01:08:59,986 --> 01:09:01,820
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>No MRI.</i></font>
- No. No. No MRI.

1028
01:09:02,522 --> 01:09:04,022
What? Why?

1029
01:09:04,256 --> 01:09:06,355
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Sound at 4,000

1030
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:11,696
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1031
01:09:11,698 --> 01:09:14,499
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1032
01:09:14,501 --> 01:09:17,070
- Not all sounds.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>And fire.</i></font>

1033
01:09:17,302 --> 01:09:20,339
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1034
01:09:21,942 --> 01:09:23,376
Always.

1035
01:09:24,478 --> 01:09:26,646
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1036
01:09:26,648 --> 01:09:29,346
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1037
01:09:29,348 --> 01:09:31,650
I'm hungry all the time.

1038
01:09:31,652 --> 01:09:34,989
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i></font>

1039
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,989
Get out of my head, man.

1040
01:09:37,991 --> 01:09:40,459
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>You never apologized.</i></font>

1041
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:43,064
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i></font>

1042
01:09:48,937 --> 01:09:50,769
Annie.

1043
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:54,439
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1044
01:09:54,441 --> 01:10:00,445
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1045
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,050
I am truly, truly sorry.

1046
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:05,521
And that I love you.

1047
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:08,722
Oh, Eddie...

1048
01:10:08,724 --> 01:10:11,826
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1049
01:10:11,828 --> 01:10:14,462
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Aw, that's nice.</i></font>

1050
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:22,570
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1051
01:10:22,572 --> 01:10:25,773
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1052
01:10:25,775 --> 01:10:26,843
Thank you.

1053
01:10:45,463 --> 01:10:46,497
Hello?

1054
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:59,044
What are you doing here?

1055
01:11:02,748 --> 01:11:03,750
Are you lost?

1056
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:07,920
I'm not lost.

1057
01:11:15,495 --> 01:11:16,994
Thanks for coming in.

1058
01:11:16,996 --> 01:11:20,498
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1059
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,168
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

01:11:23,403 --> 01:11:25,903
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Do not listen to him.

1061
01:11:25,905 --> 01:11:27,206
I don't want you to fix it.

1062
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:28,773
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>I can heal you.</i></font>

1063
01:11:30,977 --> 01:11:32,678
Can you fix it?

1064
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,612
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1065
01:11:34,614 --> 01:11:36,814
- This parasite, whatever this is...
- <i>"Parasite"?</i></font>

1066
01:11:36,816 --> 01:11:38,115
It's eating you
from the inside.

1067
01:11:38,117 --> 01:11:39,751
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1068
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,853
- You're using him up.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>No. She is wrong.</i></font>

1069
01:11:41,855 --> 01:11:44,889
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1070
01:11:44,891 --> 01:11:47,491
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>No!</i></font>

1071
01:11:47,493 --> 01:11:49,094
You're killing him.

1072
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,562
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i></font>

1073
01:11:50,564 --> 01:11:52,129
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1074
01:11:52,131 --> 01:11:53,691
- Oh, God!
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>We have to get out of here.</i></font>

1075
01:11:55,002 --> 01:11:56,069
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1076
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:57,231
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1077
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:02,777
No! Don't do that!

1078
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,994
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1079
01:12:20,996 --> 01:12:22,264
What is that?

1080
01:12:29,238 --> 01:12:32,206
You were killing me?

1081
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:35,277
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1082
01:12:37,113 --> 01:12:41,784
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1083
01:12:43,019 --> 01:12:44,153
We're done.

1084
01:12:46,522 --> 01:12:48,890
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1085
01:12:48,892 --> 01:12:50,658
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1086
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,741
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1087
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:57,133
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1088
01:12:57,135 --> 01:13:01,037
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1089
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:03,272
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1090
01:13:03,274 --> 01:13:06,243
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1091
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:09,979
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1092
01:13:09,981 --> 01:13:11,714
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1093
01:13:11,716 --> 01:13:13,849
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1094
01:13:13,851 --> 01:13:15,119
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1095
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:19,924
Dan.

1096
01:13:26,764 --> 01:13:27,999
Where is it?

1097
01:13:53,928 --> 01:13:55,930
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1098
01:14:22,056 --> 01:14:25,757
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1099
01:14:25,759 --> 01:14:30,362
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1100
01:14:30,364 --> 01:14:34,402
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1101
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,936
Whoo!

1102
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:42,276
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1103
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:53,922
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1104
01:14:53,924 --> 01:14:56,957
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1105
01:14:56,959 --> 01:15:00,862
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1106
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:02,796
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1107
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:04,266
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1108
01:15:04,268 --> 01:15:06,034
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1109
01:15:06,036 --> 01:15:09,204
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1110
01:15:09,206 --> 01:15:11,773
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1111
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:13,208
It can't go on.

1112
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:15,745
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1113
01:15:15,747 --> 01:15:17,746
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1114
01:15:17,748 --> 01:15:19,417
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1115
01:15:19,651 --> 01:15:23,351
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1116
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:25,154
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1117
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:29,357
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1118
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:31,861
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1119
01:15:31,863 --> 01:15:36,365
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1120
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:38,801
Man and Symbiote combined.

1121
01:15:38,803 --> 01:15:41,371
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1122
01:15:41,373 --> 01:15:44,441
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1123
01:15:44,443 --> 01:15:47,844
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1124
01:15:47,846 --> 01:15:49,146
It's not a lot of fun.

1125
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:51,749
And then I find out,
all along,

1126
01:15:51,751 --> 01:15:53,151
that they're killing you.

1127
01:15:53,153 --> 01:15:54,885
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1128
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:57,422
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1129
01:15:57,424 --> 01:15:59,958
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1130
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,461
Where's Venom?

1131
01:16:01,695 --> 01:16:05,262
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1132
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:15,139
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1133
01:16:15,141 --> 01:16:17,809
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1134
01:16:17,811 --> 01:16:22,046
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1135
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:35,497
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1136
01:16:35,731 --> 01:16:39,132
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1137
01:16:39,134 --> 01:16:41,336
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1138
01:16:43,372 --> 01:16:45,138
Where we lead.

1139
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,873
Yes, "we."

1140
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:50,145
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1141
01:16:51,514 --> 01:16:53,082
I can take care of that.

1142
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,122
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1143
01:17:01,124 --> 01:17:02,125
Shut up.

1144
01:17:05,962 --> 01:17:07,564
Not so tough
without your friend.

1145
01:17:12,469 --> 01:17:14,137
Did your mama not love you?

1146
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:18,507
God damn it!

1147
01:17:20,376 --> 01:17:23,545
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1148
01:17:23,547 --> 01:17:25,548
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1149
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,315
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1150
01:17:27,317 --> 01:17:28,517
in this world than you and me.

1151
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:31,554
Much bigger than me.

1152
01:17:31,556 --> 01:17:36,061
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1153
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:40,263
Karma's a bitch.

1154
01:17:40,265 --> 01:17:41,500
I don't believe in karma.

1155
01:17:43,234 --> 01:17:45,236
Oh! Ooh!

1156
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:51,007
Hi, Eddie.

1157
01:17:51,009 --> 01:17:53,043
Whoa. Whoa...

1158
01:17:53,045 --> 01:17:55,878
Oh...

1159
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,881
Mmm...

1160
01:17:57,917 --> 01:17:59,118
Mmm!

1161
01:18:15,368 --> 01:18:16,536
Oh, no.

1162
01:18:18,137 --> 01:18:20,538
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1163
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:23,041
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1164
01:18:23,043 --> 01:18:25,645
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>The one with Drake is Riot.</i></font>
- Who's Riot?

1165
01:18:25,878 --> 01:18:28,380
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i></font>

1166
01:18:28,382 --> 01:18:30,448
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i></font>

1167
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:32,770
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>He is unstoppable.</i></font>

1168
01:18:32,886 --> 01:18:34,452
- Oh, great.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>We have got to go!</i></font>

1169
01:18:34,454 --> 01:18:36,155
Go where? Where we going?

1170
01:18:36,157 --> 01:18:37,591
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>No!</i></font>

1171
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:39,493
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>It's going to get ugly.</i></font>

1172
01:18:39,495 --> 01:18:41,975
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1173
01:18:43,364 --> 01:18:44,932
Not today.

1174
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:48,002
Oh, that's bullshit!

1175
01:18:50,171 --> 01:18:51,673
This is not a simulation.

1176
01:18:51,907 --> 01:18:54,073
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1177
01:18:54,075 --> 01:18:56,511
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1178
01:18:56,513 --> 01:18:58,244
- You?
- Yes, me.

1179
01:18:58,246 --> 01:18:59,946
How long?

1180
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,648
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1181
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:05,020
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1182
01:19:07,256 --> 01:19:08,357
I'm not alone.

1183
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:15,295
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1184
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:17,264
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>It is not safe for her.</i></font>

1185
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:18,668
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>If we do not stop Riot,</i></font>

1186
01:19:18,902 --> 01:19:22,302
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i></font>

1187
01:19:22,304 --> 01:19:26,676
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1188
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:28,918
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1189
01:19:28,946 --> 01:19:30,646
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1190
01:19:30,648 --> 01:19:32,414
- on a whole planet?
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Yes!</i></font>

1191
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:34,617
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i></font>

1192
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:37,186
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>I have decided to stay.</i></font>
- Wow!

1193
01:19:37,188 --> 01:19:40,221
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i></font>

1194
01:19:40,223 --> 01:19:42,727
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>But here, we could be more.</i></font>
- Excuse me?

1195
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,694
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i></font>

1196
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:47,362
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1197
01:19:47,364 --> 01:19:49,998
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i></font>

1198
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,738
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1199
01:19:54,004 --> 01:19:56,104
- then it's back to "we."
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>It is "we."</i></font>

1200
01:19:56,106 --> 01:19:58,508
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i></font>

1201
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:00,210
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1202
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,692
What really made you
change your mind?

1203
01:20:05,484 --> 01:20:08,453
You. You did, Eddie.

1204
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:13,122
Scrub diagnostics.

1205
01:20:13,124 --> 01:20:15,495
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:38,446
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1219
01:21:38,448 --> 01:21:39,782
Then die.

1220

Venom, no!

1249
01:27:17,904 --> 01:27:21,874
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1250
01:27:21,876 --> 01:27:23,473
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1251
01:27:23,476 --> 01:27:25,212
I feel great. Awesome.

1252
01:27:25,445 --> 01:27:27,213
Wow.

1253
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:29,114
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1254
01:27:29,116 --> 01:27:32,618
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1255
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,620
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1256
01:27:34,622 --> 01:27:36,587
You're a good person, Annie.

1257
01:27:36,589 --> 01:27:38,090
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1258
01:27:38,092 --> 01:27:39,925
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1259
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:41,961
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1260
01:27:41,963 --> 01:27:44,063
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1261
01:27:44,065 --> 01:27:48,502
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1262
01:27:48,504 --> 01:27:50,604
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1263
01:27:50,606 --> 01:27:52,940
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1264
01:27:52,942 --> 01:27:55,576
Oh! Like everyone else.

1265
01:27:55,578 --> 01:27:56,579
Yeah.

1266
01:27:59,015 --> 01:28:01,250
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1267
01:28:02,951 --> 01:28:04,152
Hey, um...

1268
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,656
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1269
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:11,861
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1270
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:17,232
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1271
01:28:17,234 --> 01:28:19,636
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1272
01:28:22,138 --> 01:28:24,508
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1273
01:28:25,141 --> 01:28:26,575
I mean, the...

1274
01:28:26,577 --> 01:28:30,112
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1275
01:28:30,114 --> 01:28:31,680
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1276
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:32,783
Okay.

1277
01:28:34,084 --> 01:28:35,684
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1278
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:37,919
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1279
01:28:37,921 --> 01:28:41,656
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i></font>

1280
01:28:41,658 --> 01:28:44,594
No, I don't think so.

1281
01:28:44,596 --> 01:28:47,063
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1282
01:28:47,065 --> 01:28:48,865
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1283
01:28:48,867 --> 01:28:51,269
- Nope.
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>You belong with us, Annie.</i></font>

1284
01:28:51,504 --> 01:28:53,037
Eddie, are you sure?

1285
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:55,038
Good Lord, look at that.

1286
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,175
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1287
01:28:58,944 --> 01:29:01,111
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1288
01:29:01,113 --> 01:29:03,248
You take care, all right?

1289
01:29:03,517 --> 01:29:05,317
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1290
01:29:09,255 --> 01:29:12,689
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1291
01:29:12,691 --> 01:29:13,859
Either of you.

1292
01:29:14,593 --> 01:29:15,959
We won't.

1293
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:17,661
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Who is that guy?</i></font>
- Okay.

1294
01:29:17,663 --> 01:29:20,230
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i></font>

1295
01:29:20,232 --> 01:29:22,900
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1296
01:29:22,902 --> 01:29:25,836
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1297
01:29:25,838 --> 01:29:29,606
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1298
01:29:29,608 --> 01:29:31,344
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>I cannot?</i></font>
- No, you cannot.

1299
01:29:31,578 --> 01:29:33,277
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1300
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:36,848
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1301
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:39,150
And then there are bad people.

1302
01:29:39,152 --> 01:29:41,020
You have to tell
the difference.

1303
01:29:41,022 --> 01:29:44,890
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1304
01:29:44,892 --> 01:29:48,260
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1305
01:29:48,262 --> 01:29:50,696
eat very, very bad people,

1306
01:29:50,698 --> 01:29:53,367
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1307
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:55,968
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Fine.</i></font>
- Good.

1308
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:57,737
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i></font>

1309
01:29:57,739 --> 01:29:59,839
Well, it's super simple.

1310
01:29:59,841 --> 01:30:02,742
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1311
01:30:02,744 --> 01:30:04,811
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1312
01:30:04,813 --> 01:30:06,246
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Whatever you say.</i></font>

1313
01:30:06,248 --> 01:30:08,315
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i></font>

1314
01:30:08,317 --> 01:30:13,752
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i></font>

1315
01:30:13,754 --> 01:30:16,058
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1316
01:30:17,626 --> 01:30:19,928
Hey, Mrs. C.

1317
01:30:20,996 --> 01:30:22,696
How you doing, Eddie?

1318
01:30:22,698 --> 01:30:24,265
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1319
01:30:24,267 --> 01:30:27,234
No.

1320
01:30:27,236 --> 01:30:30,373
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1321
01:30:30,607 --> 01:30:32,272
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i></font>

1322
01:30:32,274 --> 01:30:33,941
Right. Okay, no problem.

1323
01:30:35,211 --> 01:30:36,779
The payment's due, Chen.

1324
01:30:38,282 --> 01:30:40,281
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1325
01:30:40,283 --> 01:30:41,850
Now.

1326
01:30:41,852 --> 01:30:43,420
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Bad guy, right?</i></font>
- Yep.

1327
01:30:50,961 --> 01:30:53,028
You come in here again...

1328
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:57,699
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1329
01:30:57,701 --> 01:31:01,203
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1330
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:03,205
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1331
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:06,276
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1332
01:31:06,278 --> 01:31:08,178
- Please...
- Yes.

1333
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:12,081
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1334
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:16,853
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1335
01:31:16,855 --> 01:31:19,224
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1336
01:31:21,126 --> 01:31:23,695
We are Venom.

1337
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,299
- On second thought...
- Please.

1338
01:31:34,373 --> 01:31:36,774
Eddie? What was that?

1339
01:31:36,776 --> 01:31:38,175
Oh...

1340
01:31:38,177 --> 01:31:41,982
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1341
01:31:43,317 --> 01:31:44,849
- <i>"Parasite"?</i></font>
- Yeah.

1342
01:31:44,851 --> 01:31:46,851
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1343
01:31:46,853 --> 01:31:48,853
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Apologize!</i></font>
- No.

1344
01:31:48,855 --> 01:31:51,790
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Apologize!</i></font>
- All right, fine.

1345
01:31:51,792 --> 01:31:54,496
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1346
01:31:54,728 --> 01:31:58,863
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i></font>

1347
01:34:26,154 --> 01:34:28,087
I need you
to stay quiet.

1348
01:34:28,089 --> 01:34:31,057
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1349
01:34:31,059 --> 01:34:34,195
- You got that?
- <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Fine, but make it quick.</i></font>

1350
01:34:38,535 --> 01:34:40,100
Open on five.

1351
01:34:40,102 --> 01:34:43,237
Go. Opening up.

1352
01:34:45,306 --> 01:34:48,008
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1353
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:50,545
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1354
01:34:50,547 --> 01:34:52,278
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1355
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,448
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1356
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:57,084
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1357
01:34:57,086 --> 01:35:00,220
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1358
01:35:00,222 --> 01:35:03,660
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1359
01:35:03,894 --> 01:35:07,363
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1360
01:35:10,433 --> 01:35:13,336
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1361
01:35:33,492 --> 01:35:36,125
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1362
01:35:36,127 --> 01:35:40,564
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1363
01:35:40,566 --> 01:35:41,733
Sure, it's good with me.

1364
01:35:41,966 --> 01:35:44,300
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1365
01:35:44,302 --> 01:35:51,173
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1366
01:35:51,175 --> 01:35:53,243
I bet you can.

1367
01:35:53,245 --> 01:35:55,715
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1368
01:35:56,549 --> 01:35:57,584
Come on over.

1369
01:35:58,551 --> 01:36:00,018
All right.

1370
01:36:05,057 --> 01:36:06,356
I'm here.

1371
01:36:06,358 --> 01:36:10,094
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1372
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:13,400
there's gonna be carnage.

1373
01:48:23,934 --> 01:48:26,102
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

1374
01:48:27,804 --> 01:48:29,871
I want to do what you asked.

1375
01:48:29,873 --> 01:48:31,507
I really do.

1376
01:48:31,509 --> 01:48:33,808
But... I'm sorry.

1377
01:48:38,081 --> 01:48:40,482
I can't do this without you.

1378
01:48:41,952 --> 01:48:43,018
Hey, kid...

1379
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:44,319
Whoa.

1380
01:48:44,321 --> 01:48:45,322
What was... Whoa!

1381
01:48:49,192 --> 01:48:50,193
What?

1382
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:53,264
Huh?

1383
01:49:01,873 --> 01:49:02,874
No.

1384
01:49:07,145 --> 01:49:09,079
Who are you?

1385
01:49:09,081 --> 01:49:10,441
What are you
doing over there?

1386
01:49:11,317 --> 01:49:13,249
Freeze! PDNY.

1387
01:49:13,251 --> 01:49:15,251
Kid, freeze!

1388
01:49:18,891 --> 01:49:20,025
You're kidding me right now?

1389
01:49:22,095 --> 01:49:23,496
Hey, kid.
Drop the body.

1390
01:49:32,506 --> 01:49:33,905
Ow!

1391
01:49:33,907 --> 01:49:35,108
Somebody stop that train!

1392
01:49:47,555 --> 01:49:48,623
Aah!

1393
01:49:57,566 --> 01:49:59,064
Sorry.

1394
01:50:08,175 --> 01:50:10,543
<i>...looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man,</i></font>

1395
01:50:10,545 --> 01:50:12,077
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>dragging a homeless corpse</i></font>

1396
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:13,380

1397
01:50:13,382 --> 01:50:14,828
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1398
01:50:14,852 --> 01:50:16,183
Why are you
trying to kill me?

1399
01:50:16,185 --> 01:50:17,585
I'm not.
I'm trying to save you.

1400
01:50:37,206 --> 01:50:40,408
Hey, maybe you guys
can go around?

1401
01:50:40,410 --> 01:50:42,945
All right.
Thanks, New York.
