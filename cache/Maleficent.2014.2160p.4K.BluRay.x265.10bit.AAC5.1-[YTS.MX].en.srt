1
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:34,506
<i>Let us tell an old story anew,</i>

2
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,951
<i>and we will see how well you know it.</i>

3
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:40,154
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

4
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:43,545
<i>there were two kingdoms
that were the worst of neighbors.</i>

5
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:46,547
<i>So vast was the discord between them</i>

6
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:49,229
<i>that it was said only a great hero</i>

7
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:52,631
<i>or a terrible villain
might bring them together.</i>

8
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:55,991
<i>In one kingdom
lived folk like you and me,</i>

9
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:59,465
<i>with a vain and greedy king
to rule over them.</i>

10
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:02,072
<i>They were forever discontent,</i>

11
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:05,272
<i>and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors.</i>

12
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:08,749
<i>For in the other kingdom, the Moors,</i>

13
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:12,993
<i>lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.</i>

14
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:16,263
<i>And they needed
neither king nor queen,</i>

15
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,993
<i>but trusted in one another.</i>

16
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:24,224
<i>In a great tree
on a great cliff in the Moors</i>

17
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:26,704
<i>lived one such spirit.</i>

18
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:29,753
<i>You might take her for a girl,</i>

19
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:33,346
<i>but she was not just any girl.</i>

20
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:36,350
<i>She was a fairy.</i>

21
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:05,708
There you go.

22
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:08,353
<i>And her name</i>

23
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,948
<i>was Maleficent.</i>

24
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:21,787
Good morning, Mr. Chanterelle!

25
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:23,673
I love your cap!

26
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:31,146
No. No, don't do it!

27
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:37,544
You missed me!

28
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:41,191
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

29
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,473
Lovely work, girls!

30
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:08,703
What's all the fuss about?

31
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:09,830
The border guards have discov...

32
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:11,783
Why do you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!

33
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:12,230
I want to!

34
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:15,113
There are rules, Flittle.
I tell this time, you tell next time.

35
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:16,589
No, you told last time,

36
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,783
so I should tell this time,
and Thistlewit next time.

37
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,184
Tell me what?

38
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:21,550
Fine!

39
00:03:21,943 --> 00:03:22,944
Thank you.

40
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:24,903
Maleficent, the border guard...

41
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:28,311
The border guards have found
a human thief at the pool of jewels.

42
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:31,794
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:38,830
She's always in a hurry,
with her big wings.

44
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:42,506
Humans, here.
I hope there's not another war.

45
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,387
I'm not afraid.

46
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:59,831
Besides,
I have never seen a human up close.

47
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,984
Come out!

48
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:05,234
No. They mean to kill me.

49
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,903
And besides, they're hideous to look at.

50
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,953
That's extremely rude.

51
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:14,991
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.
You're classically handsome.

52
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,153
It's not right to steal,

53
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:21,585
but we don't kill people for it.

54
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:22,710
Come out.

55
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:24,594
Come out this instant!

56
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:38,589
Are you fully grown?

57
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:40,504
No.

58
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:43,785
I believe he's just a boy.

59
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:45,947
And you're just a girl.

60
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:48,149
I think.

61
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:49,224
Who are you?

62
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:51,228
I'm called Stefan.

63
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:53,024
Who are you?

64
00:04:53,663 --> 00:04:54,744
I'm Maleficent.

65
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:59,794
Yes, right.

66
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:02,384
You have to give it back.

67
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,429
Give what back?

68
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:29,229
If I knew you would throw it away,
I would have kept it.

69
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:30,589
I didn't throw it away.

70
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:34,067
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.

71
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:40,869
Someday, you know, I'll live there.

72
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:42,872
In the castle.

73
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,948
Where do you live now?

74
00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:50,624
In a barn.

75
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:53,107
So your parents are farmers, then?

76
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,265
My parents are dead.

77
00:05:58,623 --> 00:05:59,749
Mine, too.

78
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:05,873
We'll see each other again.

79
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:08,509
You really shouldn't
come back here, you know.

80
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,153
It's not safe.

81
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,670
And if I made that choice,

82
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:16,752
if I came back, would you be here?

83
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:19,790
Perhaps.

84
00:06:23,823 --> 00:06:25,587
- What's wrong?
- Your ring.

85
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:27,874
Iron burns fairies.

86
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:29,390
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:38,467
I like your wings.

88
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,024
<i>Maleficent thought of how
Stefan cast away his ring,</i>

89
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,670
<i>he who had so little in the world,</i>

90
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,751
<i>so that their hands might touch again,</i>

91
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:52,547
<i>and her heart was moved.</i>

92
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:55,906
<i>Thus did the young thief
who had hoped to steal a jewel...</i>

93
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:56,984
Maleficent!

94
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:59,509
<i>...steal something far more precious.</i>

95
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:01,513
Maleficent?

96
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:05,549
Maleficent!

97
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:11,583
After all these weeks,

98
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:13,473
look who came back.

99
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:17,465
I thought it worth the risk.

100
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:20,390
So, what do you do for fun?

101
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:34,108
<i>Stefan and Maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends.</i>

102
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,349
<i>And for a time it seemed as if,
in them at least,</i>

103
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:42,788
<i>the old hatred between men and fairies
had been forgotten.</i>

104
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:47,873
<i>As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.</i>

105
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:57,304
<i>And on her 16th birthday,</i>

106
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:59,750
<i>Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.</i>

107
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:04,709
<i>He told her it was true love's kiss.</i>

108
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,831
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

109
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:16,704
<i>As the years passed, Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,</i>

110
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:20,583
<i>and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.</i>

111
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:24,187
<i>While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,</i>

112
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:27,233
<i>rose to become
the protector of the Moors.</i>

113
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:17,024
<i>Maleficent often wandered alone</i>

114
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:20,147
<i>and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,</i>

115
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:24,025
<i>for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.</i>

116
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:27,231
<i>But she was to learn.</i>

117
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:32,068
<i>For the human king had heard
of a growing power in the Moors,</i>

118
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:35,067
<i>and he sought to strike it down.</i>

119
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:57,946
Guard, halt!

120
00:09:58,983 --> 00:10:00,633
Guard, halt!

121
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,188
There they are,

122
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:18,108
the mysterious Moors
where no one dares to venture

123
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:21,505
for fear of the magical creatures
that lurk within.

124
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:24,105
Well, I say crush them!

125
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,231
Go no further!

126
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,553
A king

127
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:53,264
does not take orders from a winged elf.

128
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:59,306
You are no king to me.

129
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:08,230
- Bring me her head.
- Battalion!

130
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:13,784
Advance!

131
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,426
Arise and stand with me!

132
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:28,753
Hold the line!

133
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,029
- It's the dark creatures!
- It's the dark creatures!

134
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:07,630
Charge!

135
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:06,184
You!

136
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:11,389
To the king!

137
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:20,233
You will not have the Moors!

138
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:22,346
Not now, nor ever!

139
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:23,864
You...

140
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,989
When I ascended to the throne,

141
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:09,229
I promised the people

142
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,468
one day we would take

143
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:15,903
the Moors and its treasures.

144
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,593
Each of you

145
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:24,264
swore allegiance to me
and to that cause.

146
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:31,864
Your Majesty.

147
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,751
Defeated in battle.

148
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:41,472
Is this to be my legacy?

149
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:45,630
I see you waiting for me to die.

150
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:49,552
It won't be long. But what then?

151
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,992
I will choose a successor

152
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:55,832
to take the throne
and care for my daughter.

153
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:58,589
Who among you

154
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,312
is worthy?

155
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:05,312
Kill the winged creature.

156
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:07,067
Avenge me,

157
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:11,309
and upon my death
you will take the crown.

158
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:40,512
Maleficent.

159
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,551
Maleficent!

160
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:54,193
So, how is life with the humans?

161
00:15:57,143 --> 00:16:00,272
Maleficent, I've come to warn you.

162
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:02,188
They mean to kill you.

163
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,750
King Henry will stop at nothing.

164
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:11,546
Please, you have to trust me.

165
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:17,670
<i>They spoke of many things,</i>

166
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,507
<i>and the years faded</i> away.

167
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:25,312
<i>And she forgave Stefan
his folly and his ambition,</i>

168
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:29,146
<i>and all was as it had been long ago.</i>

169
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:33,349
You thirsty?

170
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:09,634
Maleficent?

171
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:26,544
What is this?

172
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,904
I have avenged you, sire.

173
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:35,745
She is vanquished?

174
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:40,631
You have done well, my son.

175
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,430
You have done
what others feared to do.

176
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,585
You will be rewarded.

177
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:53,313
I shall do my best
to be a worthy successor,

178
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:55,588
Your Majesty.

179
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:09,033
I've got you!

180
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:15,511
- You wicked bird!
- Into a man.

181
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:18,514
It's a...

182
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:30,829
It's a demon!

183
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,154
What have you done
to my beautiful self?

184
00:22:47,223 --> 00:22:49,191
Would you
rather I let them beat you to death?

185
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:52,394
I'm not certain.

186
00:22:52,463 --> 00:22:54,067
Stop complaining.

187
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,273
I saved your life.

188
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:00,708
Forgive me.

189
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:02,749
What do I call you?

190
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:04,753
Diaval.

191
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:08,586
And in return for saving my life,
I am your servant.

192
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,153
Whatever you need.

193
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,709
Wings.

194
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:17,312
I need you to be my wings.

195
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:39,673
I present to you the first of his line,

196
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:43,545
His Royal Highness King Stefan.

197
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:10,747
He did this to me so he would be king.

198
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:32,593
Now what, Mistress?

199
00:25:10,983 --> 00:25:12,747
Her wings!

200
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:01,464
It's a girl!

201
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,907
It's a girl! It's a girl!

202
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:28,350
Well?

203
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:31,226
Well, I saw nothing.

204
00:26:31,343 --> 00:26:33,584
But there's been a...

205
00:26:34,263 --> 00:26:35,264
What?

206
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:38,904
Child.

207
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:43,667
King Stefan and the Queen
have had a child.

208
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:50,665
There will be a christening.

209
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:53,192
They say it's to be a grand celebration.

210
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:59,665
A grand celebration for a baby.

211
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:03,509
How wonderful.

212
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:22,786
<i>All manner of folk
came to the christening,</i>

213
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:27,152
<i>even a trio of fairies who sought
to foster peace and goodwill.</i>

214
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:29,191
Look, there's the baby!

215
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:30,503
I love babies!

216
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,712
Can you just concentrate, please?
I'm not telling you again.

217
00:27:41,263 --> 00:27:43,994
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,634
I am Knotgrass
of the Moorland Fair Folk.

219
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:48,592
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship.

220
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:51,349
And I'm Thistlewit, Your Royalnesses.

221
00:27:52,863 --> 00:27:54,433
They bring gifts for our daughter.

222
00:27:55,703 --> 00:28:00,311
These are not just any old gifts,
for, you see, we're magic!

223
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:02,353
And very good with children.

224
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:07,913
Very well.

225
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,950
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you

226
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:18,028
the gift of beauty.

227
00:28:23,143 --> 00:28:26,784
My wish is that you will never be blue,

228
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:30,789
only happy, all the days of your life.

229
00:28:36,463 --> 00:28:38,067
Sweet baby,

230
00:28:38,863 --> 00:28:41,548
my wish for you is that you find...

231
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:05,304
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!

232
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:18,592
Well, well.

233
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:27,023
What a glittering assemblage,
King Stefan.

234
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:36,827
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and...

235
00:29:39,223 --> 00:29:40,429
How quaint.

236
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,706
Even the rabble.

237
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:53,547
I must say

238
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:58,864
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

239
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:01,113
You're not welcome here.

240
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:11,669
Oh, dear.

241
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:14,544
What an awkward situation.

242
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:16,388
You're not offended?

243
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,144
Why, no.

244
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:26,389
And to show I bear no ill will,

245
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:30,753
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.

246
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:32,593
No! We don't want your gift!

247
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:38,067
Stay away from the princess!

248
00:30:38,143 --> 00:30:40,145
Yes, stay away!

249
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,391
Listen well, all of you.

250
00:30:59,463 --> 00:31:01,943
<i>Listen well, all of you.</i>

251
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:08,266
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

252
00:31:08,863 --> 00:31:11,992
beloved by all who meet her.

253
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,034
That's a lovely gift.

254
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:19,463
Don't do this.

255
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:36,349
But

256
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:43,264
before the sun sets
on her 16th birthday,

257
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:47,624
she will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel

258
00:31:47,943 --> 00:31:50,389
and fall into a sleep like death,

259
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:55,473
a sleep from which
she will never awaken.

260
00:31:56,543 --> 00:31:59,069
Maleficent, please don't do this,
I'm begging you.

261
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,266
I like you begging.

262
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:06,993
Do it again.

263
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:26,469
I beg you.

264
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,148
All right.

265
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:39,270
The princess can be woken
from her death sleep,

266
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,671
but only by

267
00:32:43,703 --> 00:32:45,865
true love's kiss.

268
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,869
This curse will last till the end of time!

269
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:54,034
No power on Earth can change it.

270
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:11,553
<i>King Stefan ordered his men</i>

271
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,354
<i>to seize every spinning wheel
in the kingdom.</i>

272
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:19,305
<i>The wheels were broken and burned,
that they might never be used,</i>

273
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:23,354
<i>and thrown into the deepest dungeon
in the castle.</i>

274
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:27,466
<i>Secretly, he entrusted
the safety of the child</i>

275
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:29,830
<i>to the magic of the pixies,</i>

276
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:35,273
<i>who would take her to a remote
hideaway for 16 years and a day.</i>

277
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:43,184
<i>Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle</i>

278
00:33:43,743 --> 00:33:49,352
<i>while his soldiers rode far and wide
to hunt Maleficent down.</i>

279
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:52,989
<i>But she made walls of her own,</i>

280
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:56,710
<i>that the Moors might
never again suffer the touch</i>

281
00:33:56,783 --> 00:33:58,785
<i>of any human.</i>

282
00:34:00,703 --> 00:34:05,948
<i>And she reveled in the sorrow
that her curse had brought.</i>

283
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:12,630
<i>The fairies began their charge</i>

284
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:16,674
<i>to raise Aurora in a snug little cottage
in the woods.</i>

285
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,954
No! IS this it?

286
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,312
Looks dreadful.

287
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:24,148
Come on.

288
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,994
We need a smaller...

289
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:28,189
Baby-

290
00:34:28,263 --> 00:34:29,992
Or bigger bodies.

291
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:33,624
No, what we need is a proper disguise.

292
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:35,068
What do you mean?

293
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:37,066
Well, we have to blend in, don't we?

294
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,263
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.

295
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:42,952
So, gather around, ladies.

296
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:46,985
Get ready. One, two, three, grow!

297
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,464
That's worked quite well.
That's very nice.

298
00:34:54,823 --> 00:34:56,587
Now, there will be no questions asked.

299
00:34:56,663 --> 00:34:57,664
We are no longer fairies.

300
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,434
We are three peasant women
raising our orphan child in the woods.

301
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:03,473
- Yes.
- So, no more flying.

302
00:35:03,543 --> 00:35:07,389
- No flying?
- No, no, and no magic.

303
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:08,874
- No magic?
- Yes, you heard.

304
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:10,183
It's in the middle of nowhere.

305
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:12,687
At least no one will find us here.

306
00:35:19,503 --> 00:35:23,110
There you are.
Why are you always hiding?

307
00:35:23,183 --> 00:35:25,185
Come on. There you go.

308
00:35:43,863 --> 00:35:47,345
It's so ugly, you could
almost feel sorry for it.

309
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:59,470
I hate you. Beasty.

310
00:36:06,183 --> 00:36:08,754
<i>The fairies were
perhaps unequal to their task.</i>

311
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:12,114
Why is she crying?

312
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:13,548
I think she might be hungry.

313
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:16,234
Then feed her!

314
00:36:26,343 --> 00:36:29,313
There you are.

315
00:36:29,623 --> 00:36:30,863
There you go.

316
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:39,988
It's going to starve
with those three looking after it.

317
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:54,753
It tickles.

318
00:37:23,063 --> 00:37:24,952
- What?
- You're cheating.

319
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:26,503
I saw that!

320
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:28,791
- We're starting again.
- Suit yourself.

321
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:31,913
Greedy, bloated goat!

322
00:37:34,383 --> 00:37:35,953
"Bloated goat."

323
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:41,143
Stop doing that.

324
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:43,588
I'm not doing anything.

325
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:46,989
Well, someone is.

326
00:37:47,383 --> 00:37:48,384
It's not me.

327
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:52,030
You two are having a go at me,
and I will not tolerate...

328
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:54,949
Stop it!

329
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:07,144
Why...

330
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:14,192
No!

331
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:15,983
This is all your fault!

332
00:38:27,383 --> 00:38:29,033
Come on. That's funny.

333
00:38:31,423 --> 00:38:34,632
<i>As the days went on, Stefan darkened,</i>

334
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:37,946
<i>further consumed
by paranoia and vengeance.</i>

335
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:40,749
- Burn it all down!
- Yes, sir!

336
00:38:41,063 --> 00:38:42,428
Flame!

337
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:46,224
Release!

338
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:21,874
Run!

339
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:36,104
You failed me.

340
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:42,107
The wall cannot be burned.
It is indestructible.

341
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:49,504
Nothing is indestructible!

342
00:39:50,463 --> 00:39:54,787
Not the wall! Not Maleficent!
Not even her curse!

343
00:40:13,183 --> 00:40:15,265
Bring me the iron workers.

344
00:40:39,823 --> 00:40:40,904
You!

345
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,709
Look.

346
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:57,625
The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.

347
00:41:23,623 --> 00:41:24,704
What?

348
00:41:43,383 --> 00:41:45,192
Hello.

349
00:41:57,143 --> 00:41:58,190
Go away.

350
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,109
Go.

351
00:42:00,823 --> 00:42:01,824
Go away.

352
00:42:04,263 --> 00:42:06,265
I don't like children.

353
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,627
Up, UP-

354
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:30,865
Go along. Go, go, go.

355
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:45,113
<i>As Maleficent had said,</i>

356
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:49,309
<i>Aurora did grow in grace and beauty.</i>

357
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,954
Pretty bird.

358
00:42:55,463 --> 00:42:59,263
<i>Far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not.</i>

359
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:06,833
<i>And as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew,</i>

360
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,068
<i>so did she.</i>

361
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,144
Hello.

362
00:43:25,143 --> 00:43:26,144
That's it.

363
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:33,354
There you go.

364
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:36,074
<i>She wondered at the world about her,</i>

365
00:43:40,383 --> 00:43:44,672
<i>and at what lay beyond
the fearsome wall of thorns.</i>

366
00:43:54,903 --> 00:43:56,905
Curious little beasty.

367
00:43:57,743 --> 00:44:01,065
<i>But she was not the only one
who wished to get through.</i>

368
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:05,624
Look.

369
00:44:07,663 --> 00:44:12,032
- Is that her? Is that Maleficent?
- I don't know.

370
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:17,148
Bring them to me.

371
00:44:21,503 --> 00:44:23,392
No, it's just a silly peasant girl.

372
00:44:47,943 --> 00:44:49,183
Steady.

373
00:45:16,503 --> 00:45:18,505
- It's her!
- It's her!

374
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:24,943
How could you do that to me?

375
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:27,026
You said anything I need.

376
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:28,304
Yeah, but not a dog.

377
00:46:28,983 --> 00:46:30,508
It was a wolf, not a dog.

378
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:32,309
It's the same thing.

379
00:46:32,903 --> 00:46:36,350
They're dirty, vicious,
and they hunt birds.

380
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:39,746
Fine. Next time I'll turn you
into a mealy worm.

381
00:46:39,823 --> 00:46:43,384
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly.
Anything but a filthy, stinking...

382
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,753
I wonder.

383
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:37,909
I know you're there.

384
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:39,874
Don't be afraid.

385
00:48:43,543 --> 00:48:44,829
I am not afraid.

386
00:48:45,983 --> 00:48:47,667
Then come out.

387
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:50,472
Then you'll be afraid.

388
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:52,503
No, I won't.

389
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:10,789
I know who you are.

390
00:49:12,503 --> 00:49:13,550
Do you?

391
00:49:15,903 --> 00:49:17,871
You're my Fairy Godmother.

392
00:49:20,703 --> 00:49:21,750
What?

393
00:49:22,063 --> 00:49:23,827
Fairy Godmother.

394
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:26,550
You've been watching over me
my whole life.

395
00:49:27,183 --> 00:49:29,185
I've always known you were close by.

396
00:49:30,703 --> 00:49:31,829
How?

397
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,908
Your shadow. It's been following me
ever since I was small.

398
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:39,068
Wherever I went,
your shadow was always with me.

399
00:49:42,343 --> 00:49:43,549
I remember you.

400
00:49:44,463 --> 00:49:45,908
Pretty bird.

401
00:49:47,663 --> 00:49:48,903
This is Diaval.

402
00:49:54,143 --> 00:49:55,144
Hello, Aurora.

403
00:49:57,543 --> 00:49:59,944
I have known you
since you were a little one.

404
00:50:07,023 --> 00:50:09,549
It's everything I imagined it would be.

405
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:13,066
It's just so beautiful!
I've always wanted to come...

406
00:51:00,943 --> 00:51:02,945
Good night, beasty.

407
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,073
You mock me.

408
00:51:18,063 --> 00:51:20,384
I know what you're doing.

409
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:24,272
I know exactly what you're doing.

410
00:51:24,343 --> 00:51:25,344
Sire?

411
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,110
Your presence has been
requested by the Queen.

412
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:29,830
Leave me.

413
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:32,107
Sire, she is not well.

414
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:36,025
The nurses are fearful
that she won't make it through the night.

415
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,031
Can you not see
we're having a conversation?

416
00:51:51,623 --> 00:51:54,593
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.

417
00:51:54,663 --> 00:51:58,224
And on that day, I will be ready.

418
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:14,712
They're so beautiful.

419
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:32,231
I revoke the curse.

420
00:53:33,623 --> 00:53:35,785
Let it be no more.

421
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,552
I revoke the curse.

422
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:42,624
Let it be no more.

423
00:53:44,663 --> 00:53:46,552
I revoke my curse!

424
00:53:46,863 --> 00:53:49,548
Let it be no more!

425
00:53:50,303 --> 00:53:52,032
I revoke my curse!

426
00:53:52,903 --> 00:53:55,907
Let it be no more!

427
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,908
Let it be no more!

428
00:54:08,863 --> 00:54:12,470
<i>This curse will last till the end of time.</i>

429
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:16,149
<i>No power on Earth can change it.</i>

430
00:54:38,063 --> 00:54:40,543
Do all the Fair People have wings?

431
00:54:43,063 --> 00:54:44,633
Most do.

432
00:54:45,063 --> 00:54:46,906
Then why don't you?

433
00:54:47,903 --> 00:54:49,985
All the other fairies fly.

434
00:54:52,103 --> 00:54:54,629
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.

435
00:54:55,023 --> 00:54:56,787
That's all I wish to say about it.

436
00:54:57,663 --> 00:54:59,267
What color were they?

437
00:55:00,183 --> 00:55:01,389
Were they big?

438
00:55:04,863 --> 00:55:08,026
So big
they dragged behind me when I walked.

439
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:11,745
And they were strong.

440
00:55:11,823 --> 00:55:14,827
They could carry me above the clouds
and into the headwinds.

441
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:20,193
And they never faltered, not even once.

442
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:22,143
I could trust them.

443
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:51,913
She's coming. She's coming.

444
00:55:56,943 --> 00:55:57,990
Where are your workers?

445
00:55:59,783 --> 00:56:01,353
In their beds, Majesty.

446
00:56:01,703 --> 00:56:04,024
Get them back to work without delay.

447
00:56:04,423 --> 00:56:05,913
They're exhausted, sire.

448
00:56:05,983 --> 00:56:08,793
But I'll have them
back to work at first light.

449
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:12,785
I need them back to work now.

450
00:56:12,943 --> 00:56:14,593
It's the wee hours.

451
00:56:17,943 --> 00:56:19,069
Aye.

452
00:56:20,703 --> 00:56:21,784
Aye.

453
00:56:23,103 --> 00:56:24,514
It is the wee hours.

454
00:56:27,023 --> 00:56:28,673
So wake them up.

455
00:56:29,063 --> 00:56:30,633
Sire?

456
00:56:31,783 --> 00:56:34,787
So wake them up,
and get them back to work now!

457
00:56:35,023 --> 00:56:38,072
We're running out of time! Go, now!

458
00:57:07,783 --> 00:57:08,864
Aurora?

459
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,474
Come here.

460
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,269
Sit.

461
00:57:26,983 --> 00:57:28,508
There's something I need to tell you.

462
00:57:29,023 --> 00:57:30,468
What is it?

463
00:57:32,503 --> 00:57:35,188
There is an evil in this world,

464
00:57:36,423 --> 00:57:38,505
and I cannot keep you from it.

465
00:57:39,783 --> 00:57:42,229
I'm almost 16, Godmother.

466
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,073
I can take care of myself.

467
00:57:44,623 --> 00:57:46,148
I understand.

468
00:57:48,863 --> 00:57:51,144
- But that's not what I have to tell you.
- I have a plan.

469
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:53,594
When I'm older,

470
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,234
I'm going to live here
in the Moors with you.

471
00:57:56,783 --> 00:57:58,911
Then we can look after each other.

472
00:58:04,783 --> 00:58:07,707
You don't have to wait until you're older.

473
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,149
You could live here now.

474
00:58:10,703 --> 00:58:12,387
Then I will.

475
00:58:13,183 --> 00:58:16,665
I'll sleep in a tree
and eat berries and black nuts

476
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,394
and all the Fair People
will be my friends.

477
00:58:21,743 --> 00:58:23,745
I'll be happy here for the rest of my life.

478
00:58:24,903 --> 00:58:27,270
I'm going to tell my aunties tomorrow.

479
00:58:30,063 --> 00:58:31,667
Until tomorrow.

480
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:33,789
I'm so excited!

481
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:53,264
Aunties, I'm almost 16.

482
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:55,631
I need a life of my own.

483
00:58:55,743 --> 00:58:58,872
No. I love you very much,

484
00:58:59,743 --> 00:59:01,233
but it's time to say goodbye.

485
00:59:01,783 --> 00:59:03,467
You've been very good to me,

486
00:59:03,663 --> 00:59:06,507
except the time
you accidentally fed me spiders.

487
00:59:11,663 --> 00:59:12,664
Hello.

488
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,311
I'm sorry to bother you,

489
00:59:17,383 --> 00:59:18,983
but I'm on my way
to King Stefan's castle

490
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:21,913
and I've become hopelessly lost.

491
00:59:22,303 --> 00:59:23,384
Can you help me?

492
00:59:24,463 --> 00:59:26,909
I'm sorry. That was my fault.
I rushed in too...

493
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:35,028
Forgive me.

494
00:59:38,143 --> 00:59:39,827
It's that way.

495
00:59:43,983 --> 00:59:45,473
The castle.

496
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,663
What's your name?

497
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:54,423
It's Philip.

498
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,549
Hello, Philip.

499
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:00,314
What's yours?

500
01:00:01,543 --> 01:00:02,874
Aurora.

501
01:00:04,463 --> 01:00:06,227
Hello, Aurora.

502
01:00:12,023 --> 01:00:13,223
Well, it was nice meeting you.

503
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:16,933
And once again, my apologies
for being such a clumsy fool.

504
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,029
You're forgiven.

505
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,787
That's good.

506
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:26,194
I'd best be off, then.

507
01:00:27,863 --> 01:00:29,228
Good bye.

508
01:00:40,743 --> 01:00:42,745
Will you be back this way?

509
01:00:44,503 --> 01:00:45,868
Nothing could stop me.

510
01:00:47,863 --> 01:00:49,228
Then I'll see you soon.

511
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,394
Very soon.

512
01:00:52,383 --> 01:00:55,626
- Goodbye, Philip.
- Goodbye, for now.

513
01:01:05,503 --> 01:01:07,346
Stop doing that.

514
01:01:12,863 --> 01:01:14,228
Well?

515
01:01:14,823 --> 01:01:16,234
That boy's the answer.

516
01:01:18,183 --> 01:01:20,072
- No, Diaval.
- Yes!

517
01:01:20,463 --> 01:01:22,909
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.

518
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:25,031
True love's kiss?

519
01:01:25,383 --> 01:01:27,147
Have you not worked it out yet?

520
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,912
I cursed her that way
because there is no such thing.

521
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,391
Well, that might be how you feel,

522
01:01:36,423 --> 01:01:37,584
but what about Aurora?

523
01:01:39,823 --> 01:01:41,746
That boy could be her only chance.

524
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:44,743
It's her fate, anyway.

525
01:01:46,943 --> 01:01:48,104
Go ahead.

526
01:01:48,503 --> 01:01:50,710
Turn me into whatever you want.

527
01:01:50,783 --> 01:01:51,909
A bird, a worm.

528
01:01:52,263 --> 01:01:54,152
I don't care anymore.

529
01:02:00,823 --> 01:02:02,985
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow.

530
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,192
We are not leaving tomorrow.

531
01:02:06,343 --> 01:02:08,391
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.

532
01:02:08,783 --> 01:02:12,469
And Stefan told us to take her back
the day after her birthday.

533
01:02:12,783 --> 01:02:15,787
No. He said on her birthday.

534
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:18,265
No. The day after her birthday.

535
01:02:18,463 --> 01:02:19,953
- On.
- After.

536
01:02:21,063 --> 01:02:22,269
- On.
- After.

537
01:02:22,903 --> 01:02:24,746
- On, on, on!
- After, after, after!

538
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,987
Stop it!

539
01:02:32,943 --> 01:02:33,990
What?

540
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:37,508
How could you?

541
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:43,665
I need to talk to you about something.

542
01:02:43,903 --> 01:02:46,144
Yes, sweetie, what is it?

543
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:54,312
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

544
01:02:55,103 --> 01:02:56,946
but I'll be 16 tomorrow.

545
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,109
Yes.

546
01:03:07,903 --> 01:03:08,950
I'm leaving home.

547
01:03:13,783 --> 01:03:15,023
See here, young lady.

548
01:03:15,383 --> 01:03:19,183
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel

549
01:03:19,263 --> 01:03:20,503
with these two imbeciles...

550
01:03:21,463 --> 01:03:23,784
So that you could ruin it on the last day.

551
01:03:23,863 --> 01:03:26,309
We are taking you back
to your father with...

552
01:03:27,223 --> 01:03:28,554
My father?

553
01:03:30,383 --> 01:03:32,385
You told me my parents were dead.

554
01:03:35,223 --> 01:03:38,193
I think you better come and sit down.

555
01:03:51,543 --> 01:03:53,466
Fairy Godmother!

556
01:03:54,863 --> 01:03:56,194
I'm here.

557
01:03:57,743 --> 01:04:00,428
When were you going to tell me
that I'm cursed?

558
01:04:05,503 --> 01:04:06,743
Is it true?

559
01:04:09,783 --> 01:04:10,989
It is.

560
01:04:13,303 --> 01:04:16,386
My aunts said it was an evil fairy.

561
01:04:16,503 --> 01:04:19,268
I... I can't remember her name.

562
01:04:20,063 --> 01:04:21,508
They said

563
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:23,709
it was...

564
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,588
Maleficent.

565
01:04:37,063 --> 01:04:38,633
Is that you?

566
01:04:42,703 --> 01:04:44,671
Are you Maleficent?

567
01:04:48,023 --> 01:04:49,263
No!

568
01:04:49,863 --> 01:04:51,308
Don't touch me.

569
01:04:52,023 --> 01:04:53,707
You're the evil that's in the world.

570
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:56,434
It's you!

571
01:05:05,463 --> 01:05:06,624
Find the boy!

572
01:05:24,303 --> 01:05:27,432
I need every available man
on the east wing now.

573
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:30,666
There should be no guards at the gate.
I want her to walk right in.

574
01:05:30,743 --> 01:05:32,268
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.

575
01:05:34,703 --> 01:05:36,546
We found this urchin at the gate.

576
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,231
She claims to be the princess.

577
01:05:45,103 --> 01:05:46,229
Father.

578
01:05:46,503 --> 01:05:48,392
It's me, Aurora!

579
01:05:59,303 --> 01:06:01,624
You look just like your mother.

580
01:06:04,303 --> 01:06:06,192
They brought you back a day too soon.

581
01:06:06,503 --> 01:06:08,232
I told those three idiots!

582
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:10,546
Lock her up in her room.

583
01:06:11,023 --> 01:06:12,149
Go.

584
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,469
Prepare the men. Maleficent's coming.

585
01:06:16,383 --> 01:06:19,193
It's so good to be small again!

586
01:06:19,823 --> 01:06:21,313
Look at my feet!

587
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:23,784
I love my tiny little feet!

588
01:06:24,103 --> 01:06:26,788
Pay attention! We have to find Aurora,

589
01:06:27,223 --> 01:06:29,703
or the king will have our heads!

590
01:06:58,663 --> 01:07:00,904
<i>Aurora.</i>

591
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,154
Wait!

592
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:16,788
Princess?

593
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,988
I'm looking for a girl.

594
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:28,233
Of course you are.

595
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:34,467
I need a horse.

596
01:07:51,303 --> 01:07:55,627
<i>...into a sleep like death.</i>

597
01:08:00,663 --> 01:08:02,472
<i>Aurora.</i>

598
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:07,184
Come on, Diaval!

599
01:08:19,903 --> 01:08:21,473
<i>Aurora.</i>

600
01:08:55,663 --> 01:08:57,347
Faster, Diaval, faster!

601
01:09:00,023 --> 01:09:05,029
<i>She will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel</i>

602
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,631
<i>and fall into a sleep like death.</i>

603
01:09:09,943 --> 01:09:12,071
<i>No power on Earth...</i>

604
01:09:13,743 --> 01:09:16,474
<i>A sleep like death.</i>

605
01:09:35,023 --> 01:09:36,263
It's done.

606
01:10:06,663 --> 01:10:09,792
They pulled the guards.
He's waiting for you in there.

607
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,308
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.

608
01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:19,106
Then don't come. It's not your fight.

609
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,312
Thank you very much.

610
01:10:25,823 --> 01:10:29,873
"I need you, Diaval.
I can't do this without you, Diaval."

611
01:10:31,063 --> 01:10:32,588
I can hear you.

612
01:10:40,863 --> 01:10:42,024
Look at her.

613
01:10:43,623 --> 01:10:45,705
Look at what you've done.

614
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,347
She's only sleeping.

615
01:10:52,823 --> 01:10:55,588
She's only sleeping, you say?

616
01:10:59,823 --> 01:11:01,507
She's only sleeping.

617
01:11:02,703 --> 01:11:05,593
She's only sleeping forever!

618
01:11:06,743 --> 01:11:09,713
- What about the kiss?
- Yes! True love's kiss!

619
01:11:12,863 --> 01:11:15,833
True love does not exist.

620
01:11:16,303 --> 01:11:18,704
But it's her only chance, Your Majesty.

621
01:11:32,503 --> 01:11:33,834
Mistress.

622
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,312
What are we going to do?

623
01:12:40,503 --> 01:12:42,790
We can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls.

624
01:12:43,063 --> 01:12:44,952
But we don't even know where to start.

625
01:12:45,143 --> 01:12:47,669
True love doesn't just fall
from trees, you know.

626
01:12:59,783 --> 01:13:01,785
Pardon me.

627
01:13:02,103 --> 01:13:04,310
I'm embarrassed to say
I don't know where I am.

628
01:13:04,663 --> 01:13:06,825
In King Stefan's castle.

629
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:11,793
This is where I'm meant to be.

630
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,546
Odd that I can't recall how I got here.

631
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:15,624
Why have you come?

632
01:13:15,943 --> 01:13:17,547
My father sent me to see the King.

633
01:13:17,623 --> 01:13:18,624
Who is your father?

634
01:13:18,943 --> 01:13:20,183
King John of Ulstead.

635
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,627
A Prince!

636
01:13:33,783 --> 01:13:35,148
Aurora.

637
01:13:36,263 --> 01:13:38,152
He knows her.

638
01:13:39,823 --> 01:13:41,188
Why is she sleeping?

639
01:13:41,663 --> 01:13:43,665
She's trapped in an enchantment.

640
01:13:43,983 --> 01:13:46,145
Isn't she beautiful?

641
01:13:47,343 --> 01:13:49,869
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

642
01:13:51,143 --> 01:13:52,986
Do you want to kiss her?

643
01:13:54,903 --> 01:13:55,904
Very much.

644
01:13:56,383 --> 01:13:57,714
Go on, then.

645
01:13:58,983 --> 01:14:01,111
I wouldn't feel right about it.

646
01:14:01,183 --> 01:14:02,833
I barely know her. We've only met once.

647
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:05,230
Haven't you ever heard
of love at first sight?

648
01:14:05,343 --> 01:14:06,913
Kiss her!

649
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:08,344
Go on.

650
01:14:12,263 --> 01:14:13,503
An enchantment, you say?

651
01:14:15,103 --> 01:14:16,753
Kiss her!

652
01:15:09,143 --> 01:15:10,633
You didn't do it properly!

653
01:15:10,903 --> 01:15:13,429
It's supposed to be true love's kiss!

654
01:15:13,503 --> 01:15:15,028
I was certain he was the one.

655
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:17,674
- What are you doing?
- We have to keep looking.

656
01:15:24,823 --> 01:15:26,109
I told you.

657
01:15:50,943 --> 01:15:53,344
I will not ask your forgiveness

658
01:15:54,423 --> 01:15:57,950
because what I have done to you
is unforgivable.

659
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,033
I was so lost

660
01:16:03,103 --> 01:16:05,424
in hatred and revenge.

661
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,465
Sweet Aurora,

662
01:16:12,463 --> 01:16:15,069
you stole what was left of my heart.

663
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:18,430
And now I have lost you forever.

664
01:16:30,143 --> 01:16:35,513
I swear, no harm will come to you
as long as I live.

665
01:16:36,903 --> 01:16:41,784
And not a day shall pass
that I don't miss your smile.

666
01:17:10,703 --> 01:17:12,865
Hello, Godmother.

667
01:17:18,303 --> 01:17:20,192
Hello, beasty.

668
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:34,553
No truer love.

669
01:17:48,223 --> 01:17:49,713
She's here, sire.

670
01:18:04,063 --> 01:18:05,906
Are we going back to the Moors now?

671
01:18:08,263 --> 01:18:09,992
If that is what you wish.

672
01:18:37,063 --> 01:18:38,110
We've got her!

673
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:45,232
- Stop!
- Get back!

674
01:19:03,463 --> 01:19:04,749
No!

675
01:19:12,543 --> 01:19:13,988
Into a dragon.

676
01:19:40,263 --> 01:19:41,503
To the other side.

677
01:19:50,863 --> 01:19:52,467
Run, Aurora!

678
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:08,507
Get back! Hold it steady!

679
01:20:08,863 --> 01:20:10,547
Pull to the left! Pull!

680
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:15,354
Hold the line!

681
01:20:19,663 --> 01:20:22,109
Look out. Hold your line.

682
01:21:30,423 --> 01:21:33,188
- Close in.
- Bring it down!

683
01:22:00,663 --> 01:22:01,869
Enough!

684
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,627
How does it feel?

685
01:22:11,063 --> 01:22:13,589
To be a fairy creature without wings

686
01:22:16,623 --> 01:22:19,274
in a world where you don't belong?

687
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:09,509
Kill her!

688
01:23:10,143 --> 01:23:11,269
Kill her!

689
01:23:16,263 --> 01:23:17,753
<i>Show.</i>

690
01:23:46,023 --> 01:23:47,229
Shoot her!

691
01:23:47,503 --> 01:23:48,584
Take aim!

692
01:24:51,423 --> 01:24:52,584
It's over.

693
01:26:12,503 --> 01:26:15,347
<i>Maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns</i>

694
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,790
<i>and took off her crown.</i>

695
01:26:19,063 --> 01:26:22,749
<i>And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once,</i>

696
01:26:22,823 --> 01:26:26,430
<i>long ago, when Maleficent
was but a child</i>

697
01:26:26,503 --> 01:26:28,744
<i>and her heart was bright.</i>

698
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:32,114
<i>For now, it was again.</i>

699
01:26:35,343 --> 01:26:37,630
<i>But that was not all.</i>

700
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:51,394
There she is. Hurry up. They're waiting.

701
01:26:51,943 --> 01:26:53,229
Wait for me!

702
01:26:54,103 --> 01:26:56,265
We present this crown
to our little Aurora,

703
01:26:56,783 --> 01:26:59,787
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...

704
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:01,748
Never mind.

705
01:27:06,903 --> 01:27:09,986
Our kingdoms have been unified.

706
01:27:11,823 --> 01:27:13,746
You have your queen.

707
01:27:15,983 --> 01:27:20,068
<i>So you see,
the story is not quite as you were told,</i>

708
01:27:20,623 --> 01:27:22,227
<i>and I should know,</i>

709
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:26,831
<i>for I was the one
they called Sleeping Beauty.</i>

710
01:28:00,183 --> 01:28:05,269
<i>In the end, my kingdom was united
not by a hero or a villain,</i>

711
01:28:05,343 --> 01:28:07,266
<i>as legend had predicted,</i>

712
01:28:07,343 --> 01:28:11,348
<i>but by one who was
both hero and villain.</i>

713
01:28:12,383 --> 01:28:15,944
<i>And her name was Maleficent.</i>
