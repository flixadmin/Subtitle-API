1
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,492
- (People shouting)
- (Swords clanging)

2
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,079
- (Dogs barking)
- (Ravens cawing)

3
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,461
- (Thudding)
- (Gasps)

4
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,383
(Caws)

5
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,532
I've taken your castle.

6
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,578
- Theon?
- It's prince theon now.

7
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,997
Get up. You have to get dressed.

8
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,209
I've taken winterfell.

9
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,586
I took it. I'm occupying it.

10
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,756
I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.

11
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,676
- Why?
- To take the castle.

12
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,346
- You went with robb.
- And he sent me back to pyke.

13
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,226
I'm a greyjoy.
I can't fight for robb and my father both.

14
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,021
- Where's hodor?
- I don't know.

15
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,232
Find the halfwit.

16
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,361
My men are bringing your people
together in the courtyard.

17
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,905
- Why?
- So you and I can go down and tell them

18
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,616
- how you've yielded winterfell to me.
- I won't.

19
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,536
Yes, you will.

20
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,080
I won't. I'll never yield.

21
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,416
We'll fight you and throw you out.

22
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,753
(Clears throat)

23
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,048
The castle is mine.

24
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,259
But these people are still yours.

25
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,511
You'll yield to keep them safe,

26
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,304
to keep them alive.

27
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,224
That's what a good lord would do.

28
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,439
Think carefully about what you want to say.

29
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,776
Theon.

30
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,028
Did you hate us the whole time?

31
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,410
(Thunder rumbles)

32
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,036
(Horse whinnies)

33
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,622
I've yielded winterfell to theon.

34
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,832
Louder

35
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,001
say prince theon.

36
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,087
I've yielded winterfell to prince theon.

37
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,839
You all know me.

38
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,592
Aye, we know you for
a steaming sack of shit.

39
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,343
Farlen, you be silent.

40
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,138
Listen to your little lord, farlen.

41
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,307
He has more sense than you do.

42
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,476
All of you should do as he commands.

43
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,021
My father has donned
the ancient crown of salt and rock

44
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,441
and declared himself
king of the iron islands.

45
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,028
He claims the north as well
by right of conquest.

46
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,614
- You are all his subjects.
- Bugger that.

47
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,532
I serve the starks.

48
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,952
- If you think you can hold the north with it...
- Shut up!

49
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,498
Theon: If you serve me as onally
as you served ned stark,

50
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,083
- I will be as good to you as he ever was.
- Steady.

51
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,294
Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.

52
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,421
(Crowd murmuring)

53
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,466
Maester luwin, send a raven to pyke

54
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,052
informing my father of my victory here.

55
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,721
And one to deepwood motte to my sister.

56
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,059
Inform her that she's to bring
500 men to winterfell.

57
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,729
(Crowd murmuring)

58
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,148
You are a maester of the citadel,

59
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,193
sworn to serve the lord of winterfell,
are you not?

60
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,820
I am.

61
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,281
I am the lord of winterfell
as bran just informed you.

62
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,743
Send the ravens.

63
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,664
My lord.

64
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,584
My lord greyjoy.

65
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,631
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

66
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,675
What do you want?

67
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,844
I was brought here a captive.

68
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,263
You were here the day I was taken.

69
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,932
I'm the one who took you. What of it?

70
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,310
Let me serve you.

71
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,646
Theon: Serve me how?

72
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,274
I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.

73
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,110
It was robb stark who
put me in the kitchens.

74
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,321
Put a spear in my hand again.

75
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,325
So you can Bury it in my neck?
Do you take me for a fool?

76
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,035
Get up.

77
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,996
Step aside.

78
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,252
It's your dream, little lord.

79
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,672
The ocean has come to swallow this place.

80
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,251
I ain't letting it drown me.

81
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,776
Theon: You'll all go about
your tasks as usual.

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,303
- And in a few days' time...
- Rodrik: Greyjoy!

83
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,230
We caught this one on his way back
from torrhen's square.

84
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,025
Took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

85
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,528
Ser rodrik, it grieves
me that we meet as foes.

86
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,198
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

87
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,327
You were raised here under this roof.

88
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,413
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

89
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,624
King robb thought of you as a brother.

90
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,627
My brothers are dead.

91
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,796
They died fighting stark men, men like you.

92
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,091
Aye, they died fighting a war
your father started.

93
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,260
Lord stark raised you among his own sons.

94
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,596
Among them, but not one of them.

95
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,390
I was his hostage, taken from my home.

96
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,725
If he were alive to see this...

97
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,644
He's not. He's dead.

98
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,480
The seven kingdoms are at war.

99
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,231
And winterfell is mine.

100
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,486
I should have put a sword in your belly
instead of in your hand.

101
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,781
You've served this
house faithfully, old man.

102
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,616
- But keep talking and I'll...
- (Spits)

103
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,700
(Grunts)

104
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,162
Take him to the cells. Lock him up...

105
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,580
My prince.

106
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,792
You cannot let that stand. He must pay.

107
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,752
I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.

108
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,797
No, he has to pay the iron price.

109
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,342
They'll never respect you while he lives.

110
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,813
(Thunder rumbles)

111
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,237
Ser rodrik,

112
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,780
I sentence you to death!

113
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,366
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

114
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,576
The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.

115
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,579
I urge you not to make a hasty decision.

116
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,382
Theon: He disrespected me
in front of my men.

117
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,084
That was his decision, not mine.

118
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,461
He is worth more to you alive than dead.

119
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,922
The starks will pay.

120
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,094
Please, theon, think what you do.

121
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,525
You'll address me as prince theon
or you'll be next.

122
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,111
Come.

123
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,615
- No!
- Bran: Theon!

124
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,163
Rodrik!

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,666
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

126
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,835
Bran: (Sobbing) I'm begging you.
Rodrik: Coward.

127
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,379
Stop.

128
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,465
Stop! Stop right now!

129
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,177
You don't give commands
anymore, little lord.

130
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,388
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
- Rodrik: Hush now, child.

131
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,140
I'm off to see your father.

132
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,936
Bran: You said no harm would come!

133
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,440
You said no harm would come. Theon, please.

134
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
Any last words, old man?

135
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,488
Gods help you, theon greyjoy.

136
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,323
Now you are truly lost.

137
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,576
Bran: Theon, please don't. Do something!

138
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,995
I'll do anything, please!

139
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,413
Rickon: No, please stop it!

140
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,915
- (Grunts)
- (Screams)

141
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,469
- (Bran wailing)
- (Thunder rumbling)

142
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,180
(Panting)

143
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,066
(Wind howling)

144
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,197
Jon: Ghost, stay with us.

145
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,366
Ghost!

146
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,076
There goes your pet.

147
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,328
Jon: He's not a pet.

148
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,330
Qhorin: No, you're right, he's not.

149
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,082
You can't tame a wild thing.

150
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,835
You can't trust a wild thing.

151
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,504
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

152
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,632
Wild creatures have their own rules,

153
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,509
their own reasons.

154
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,261
And you'll never know them.

155
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,348
Now the wildlings we're looking for

156
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,308
sleep during the day and hunt at night.

157
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,522
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

158
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,232
I said you can't.

159
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,777
They find a nice cave to hide in
while the sun's up

160
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,487
and do their killing when it's dark.

161
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,197
We could do the same.

162
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,532
No, we couldn't.

163
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,951
This is their country.

164
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,829
They know where to walk, where not to walk.

165
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,708
I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse
they didn't see till they were in it.

166
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,837
My father always said I'm of the north.

167
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,921
(Chuckles)

168
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,258
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

169
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,511
This look like home to you?

170
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,182
You start thinking you know this place,
it will kill you.

171
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,934
You understand me?

172
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,270
No, you don't.

173
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,397
We're at war.

174
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,441
We've always been at war.

175
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,068
It's never going to end
'cause we're not fighting an enemy.

176
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,614
We're fighting the north,
and it's not going anywhere.

177
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,450
The watch has given you a great gift.

178
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,536
You only have one thing to give in return,

179
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,620
your life.

180
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,625
- I'll gladly give my life.
- I don't want you to be glad about it.

181
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,545
I want you to curse and fight
until your heart's done pumping.

182
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,256
And know this, boy.

183
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,760
Your death will be a gift
for them south of the wall.

184
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,179
They'll never know what you've done.

185
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,183
They'll never know how you died.
They won't even know your damn name.

186
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,061
But they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

187
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,647
north of the wall gave his life for theirs.

188
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,484
Now, do you understand me?

189
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,778
I do.

190
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,723
You're even dumber than you look.

191
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,242
It's just words, boy,

192
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,118
to keep us a little warmer in the night.

193
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,288
Make us feel like we've got a purpose.

194
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,456
(Laughs)

195
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,749
Come on.

196
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,419
We've got to find these goat fuckers
before night falls and they find us.

197
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,976
- Tywin: Can you read?
- My lord?

198
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,853
Can you read?

199
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,277
This letter detailing
our infantry movements

200
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,862
was meant for lord Damon
of house marbrand.

201
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,700
It was sent to lord
marlyn of house dormand.

202
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,636
My apologies, my lord. I must have...

203
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,038
Girl, fetch me the history of the
greater and the lesser houses.

204
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,999
It's the one on this...

205
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,083
(Chuckles)

206
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,714
My cupbearer can read better than you.

207
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,268
To whom does house dormand
owe allegiance?

208
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,689
My lord, I...

209
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,483
To the starks of winterfell!

210
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,738
Who have 20,000 men and my son!

211
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,952
Ijudged you might be good for something
more than brutalizing peasants.

212
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,288
I see I overestimated you.

213
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,335
If you ever put my son's
life at risk again, I'll...

214
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,754
Leave us.

215
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,347
Put the book away, girl.

216
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,098
(Door opening)

217
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,018
(Door closing)

218
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,815
Maybe you should devise our
next battle plan while you're about it.

219
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,442
(Knocking on door)

220
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,027
(Door opens)

221
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,406
Lord petyr baelish.

222
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,491
Mmm.

223
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,285
Give us the room.

224
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,378
Clear all this.

225
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,837
(Door opening)

226
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,589
(Door closing)

227
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,675
- Lord tywin.
- Baelish.

228
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,311
- Wine?
- Thank you.

229
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,191
What news from the capital?

230
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,653
I traveled here directly
from renly Baratheon's camp.

231
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,738
Ah, the late king renly.

232
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,366
Rather a short reign.

233
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,284
Murdered by a woman, I hear.

234
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,286
So they say.

235
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,083
There has been talk
of other forces at work.

236
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,502
Dark forces.

237
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,213
Here.

238
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,216
(Scoffs)

239
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,095
Men love to blame demons
when their grand plans unravel.

240
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,185
It is my belief that a moment of chaos
affords opportunities lost soon after.

241
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,689
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

242
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,774
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

243
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,777
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

244
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,614
After the lannisters and the starks,
the tyrells command the largest host.

245
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,843
Their lands are the most fertile
in the seven kingdoms,

246
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,829
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,332
The tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

248
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,962
Loras wants revenge.
He blames Stannis for renly's death.

249
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,214
And margaery...

250
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,175
Wants to be queen.

251
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,302
Yes, she does.

252
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,515
House Tyrell rebelled
against the iron throne.

253
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,977
- Against my grandson.
- They did.

254
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,481
And perhaps that treason should be punished

255
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,191
one day,

256
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,527
after Stannis and robb stark are defeated.

257
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,073
More wine for lord baelish.

258
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,833
If you will allow me to
represent your family's interests,

259
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,336
I believe that an advantageous agreement...

260
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,880
The Tyrell host has returned to highgarden?

261
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,340
They have.

262
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,674
(Gasps)

263
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,510
Pardon, my lord.

264
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,261
It's only wine.

265
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,640
You would ride there yourself?

266
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,475
Tonight, with your leave.

267
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,337
I'll have an answer by nightfall.

268
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,978
That'll be all, girl.

269
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,778
And what else?

270
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,696
On your son Tyrion's directive,

271
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,823
I met with catelyn stark.

272
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:19,163
He had an interesting proposal for her
concerning her daughters.

273
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,289
Hmm.

274
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,318
(Groans)

275
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,362
(Shouting)

276
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,503
(Panting)

277
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,592
- A girl.
- A wildling.

278
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,595
We could question her.

279
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,805
You could.

280
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,140
She won't answer.

281
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,935
I've known a wildling to bite
off his tongue instead of talking.

282
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,939
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

283
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,067
She was reaching for this ax
when you got to her.

284
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,653
Give her half a chance,
she'll Bury it in your face.

285
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,865
I gave you my name.

286
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,826
I'm Jon snow.

287
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,211
You ought to burn them you killed.

288
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,172
Qhorin: We'd need a big fire for that.

289
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,717
Tell me, ygritte.

290
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,511
Why do you want us to build a big fire?

291
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,640
Are there some more friends in the area?

292
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,060
Burn them or maybe
you'll need those swords again.

293
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,812
Our boy here's already killed one dead man.

294
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,273
He can do it again if he has to.

295
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,609
What waits beyond the pass?

296
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,736
- The free folk.
- How many?

297
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,862
(Chuckles)

298
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,740
Hundreds and thousands.

299
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,117
More than you've ever seen, crow.

300
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,995
Why come to the mountains?

301
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,457
What's in the frostfangs
your king could want?

302
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,425
Do you mean to march on the wall?

303
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,642
Do you know who I am, girl?

304
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,228
Qhorin halfhand.

305
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,896
Tell me true.

306
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,566
If your people captured me,

307
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,318
would they take me prisoner?

308
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,447
They'd take your head off your shoulders
if they was feeling kind.

309
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,075
If not, they'd kill you slow.

310
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,077
(Sighs)

311
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,539
We have no food for her.

312
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,874
Can't spare a man to watch her.

313
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,169
Can't let her go. She'll bring
mance rayder's army down on us.

314
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,047
- It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
- Jon: No.

315
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,592
No, I'll do it.

316
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,012
Come, brothers.

317
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,306
We'll leave him to it.

318
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,600
We'll meet you at the top.

319
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,352
Don't take too long.

320
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,716
We're deep in their country now.

321
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,870
You never killed a woman before, did you?

322
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,664
You don't need to do it.

323
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,751
Mance would take you. I know he would.

324
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,211
There's secret ways.

325
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,547
The crows would never catch us.

326
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,925
I'm as much a crow as they are.

327
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,939
Will you burn me?

328
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,192
After?

329
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,235
Can't.

330
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,530
Someone might see the smoke.

331
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,580
Strike hard and true,

332
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,873
Jon snow,

333
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,709
or I'll come back and haunt you.

334
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,548
That's cold.

335
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,470
Go on.

336
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,472
Be quick about it.

337
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,731
Do it.

338
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,361
Bastard, do it!

339
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,906
- (Grunts)
- (Clanging)

340
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,539
(Breathing heavily)

341
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,833
(Grunts)

342
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,054
(Panting)

343
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,516
(Grunts)

344
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,148
You can't do it. We both know it.

345
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,197
The sun's going down, Jon snow.

346
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,283
And your friends are nowhere close.

347
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,160
I'll find them.

348
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,580
Call for them. Go on.

349
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,373
Call loudly.

350
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,092
Septon: May the seven guide the Princess
on herjourney.

351
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,470
May the mother give her health.

352
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,014
May the crone give her wisdom.

353
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,059
May the warrior give her courage.

354
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,143
(Sobbing)

355
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,356
(Septon continues)

356
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,608
One day I pray you love someone.

357
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,527
I pray you love her so much,

358
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,238
when you close your eyes, you see her face.

359
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,034
I want that for you.

360
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,580
I want you to know
what it's like to love someone,

361
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,375
to truly love someone.

362
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,087
Before I take her from you.

363
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,642
(Septon continues)

364
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,020
(Sobbing)

365
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,982
You sound like a little cat
mewling for his mother.

366
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,441
Princes don't cry.

367
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,236
- I saw you cry.
- Did you say something, my lady?

368
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,823
My little brother cried
when I left winterfell.

369
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,909
It seems a normal thing.

370
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,537
Is your little brother a prince?

371
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,082
Not really relevant then, is it?

372
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,629
Come, dog.

373
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,015
Man 1: Hail Joffrey!

374
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,891
Hail to the king.

375
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:18,976
(Man laughs)

376
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,521
Seven blessings on you, your grace.

377
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,398
Man 2: Murderer! Bastard!

378
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,899
All hail the king.

379
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,402
Man 3: He's no king. He's a bastard!

380
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,486
(People laughing)

381
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,655
Please, your grace, we're hungry.

382
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:32,740
(Crowd shouting)

383
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,868
Man 4: Freak.

384
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,619
Get the prince back to the keep now.

385
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,621
Yes, my lord. Come, quickly.

386
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,999
Woman: Please, your grace,
give us some food!

387
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,168
Man 5: Bread, your grace, please!

388
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,588
- (Groans)
- (Crowd gasps)

389
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,798
Who threw that?

390
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,383
I want the man who threw that.

391
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,218
Find who did that and bring him to me!

392
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,429
Guard 1: Hold on!
Guard 2: Hold them back!

393
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,389
Joffrey: Just kill them! Kill them all!

394
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:58,766
(Groans)

395
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,856
- Move. Move!
- Guard 1: Pull back!

396
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,232
Man 6: Tear him to pieces!

397
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,110
What are you doing?
I want these people executed!

398
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,029
And they want the same for you.

399
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,087
(Septon screaming)

400
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,678
(Crowd cheering)

401
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,308
Where's sansa?

402
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,769
(Screaming)

403
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,522
Guard 3: Through the door.
Guard 4: Come on.

404
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,981
Push hard.

405
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,027
(Whimpering)

406
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,946
Protect the king!

407
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,115
- Get back!
- Fall back!

408
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,295
(Crowd shouting)

409
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,882
Keep him safe!

410
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,342
Man 7: Brotherfucker!

411
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,387
- Watch out.
- Hold them back.

412
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,640
(Whimpers)

413
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,521
Hey.

414
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:30,774
Traitors!

415
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,236
- I'll have all their heads.
- You blind, bloody fool.

416
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,321
You can't insult me.

417
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,491
We've had vicious kings
and we've had idiot kings,

418
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,220
but I don't know if we've ever been
cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.

419
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,787
- You can't...
- I can, I am.

420
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,330
They attacked me!

421
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,042
They threw a cow pie at you,
so you decided to kill them all?

422
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,836
They're starving, you fool.

423
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,254
All because of a war you started.

424
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,047
You're talking to a king!

425
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,174
(Shrieks)

426
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,176
And now I've struck a king.

427
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,719
Did my hand fall from my wrist?

428
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,763
Where is the stark girl?

429
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,015
Let them have her.

430
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,560
If she dies, you'll never
get your uncle Jaime back.

431
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,396
You owe him quite a bit, you know.

432
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,608
(Panting)

433
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:15,903
(Groans)

434
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,740
Where are you going?

435
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,952
- You ever been fucked, little girl?
- (Whimpering)

436
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,705
Come here.

437
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,184
Take some men and
go and find the stark girl.

438
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,335
I take my orders from the king.

439
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,337
Guard 5: Where?
Guard 6: This way.

440
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,715
(Sansa sobbing)

441
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,179
Please!

442
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,723
No! No!

443
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,228
(Screaming)

444
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,106
(Choking)

445
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,118
Please!

446
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:07,829
(Breathing heavily)

447
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,500
You're all right now, little bird.
You're all right.

448
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,755
(Crowd shouting)

449
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,683
We'll get you. We'll get you.

450
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,601
This way.

451
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,814
Are you hurt, my lady?

452
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,067
The little bird's bleeding.
Someone take her back to her cage.

453
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,361
-See to that out
-well done, clegane.

454
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,698
I didn't do it for you.

455
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,910
He shouldn't make me wait.

456
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,872
The spice king is
the second wealthiest man in qarth.

457
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,375
He makes everyone wait.

458
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,670
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

459
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,506
if you married the wealthiest man in qarth.

460
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,341
I already have a husband.

461
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,552
Khal drogo is gone, khaleesi.

462
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,139
You are far too young to be a widow forever

463
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,183
and far too beautiful.

464
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:14,229
And you are far too smart
to think that I will succumb to flattery.

465
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,357
I have traveled very far in my life

466
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,151
and met many women,

467
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,902
but none that are immune to flattery.

468
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,739
Man: The mother of dragons!

469
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,532
Here he comes.

470
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,952
Forgive me. I had
terrible dreams last night.

471
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,746
Terrible dreams.

472
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,124
I could not sleep until the sun was shining

473
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,335
and the birds were singing.

474
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,463
Look what a beauty you are

475
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,757
now the red waste has been washed off you.

476
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,594
I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.

477
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,765
The silver hair of a true Targaryen.

478
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,351
Xaro xhoan daxos,

479
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,937
she is far too lovely for
a glorified dockworker like yourself.

480
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,483
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

481
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,693
who sold pepper off the back of a wagon,

482
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,113
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

483
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,407
Every lady alive was lovelier

484
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,701
and higher born than my grandfather.

485
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:10,786
(Laughing)

486
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,374
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

487
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,809
I'll have them flogged in the square.

488
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,211
Thank you, my lord.
You are a gracious host,

489
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,797
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

490
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,383
Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.

491
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,720
So, my little Princess,
what is it you want?

492
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,263
My birthright.

493
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,140
The seven kingdoms of Westeros.

494
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,102
I fear I'm no better
than a servant in this regard.

495
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,187
I cannot give you what I do not have.

496
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,940
I'm not asking you for the kingdoms.

497
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,525
I'm asking you for ships.

498
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,110
I need to cross the narrow sea.

499
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,945
I need my ships as well.

500
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,615
I use them, you see,
to bring spices from one port to another.

501
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,617
Whatever you Grant me now will be repaid

502
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,161
three times over
when I retake the iron throne.

503
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,287
Retake?

504
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,082
Did you once sit on the iron throne?

505
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,835
My father sat there,
before he was murdered.

506
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,254
But if you did not sit on it yourself,

507
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,674
would it not be correct
to say "take the iron throne"?

508
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,926
I didn't come here to argue grammar.

509
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,512
Of course not. You came to take my ships.

510
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,766
So let me explain my
position, little Princess.

511
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,020
Unlike you, I do not
have exalted ancestors.

512
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,772
I make my living by trade.

513
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,733
And ijudge every trade on its merits.

514
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,902
You ask for ships.

515
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,738
You say I shall be repaid triple.

516
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,783
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

517
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,119
But before you repay your debts,

518
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,538
you must seize the seven kingdoms.

519
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,957
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

520
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,584
You do not have an army.

521
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,336
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

522
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,297
There are many there that support my claim.

523
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,423
When were you there last?

524
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,342
I left when I was a baby.

525
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,179
So, in truth, you have no allies.

526
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,683
The people will rise to fight for
their rightful queen when I return.

527
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,312
Forgive me, little Princess,

528
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,899
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

529
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,400
Now if you'll pardon me.

530
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,069
Do you know illyrio mopatis,
magister of pentos?

531
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,906
Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.

532
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,242
For my wedding, he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

533
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:19,164
He believed... the world believed
that the ages had turned them to stone.

534
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,667
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

535
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,504
But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs

536
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,923
into a great fire, they would hatch.

537
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,344
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

538
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,138
But when the fire burned out,

539
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,057
I was unhurt,

540
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,392
the mother of dragons.

541
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,189
Do you understand?

542
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,486
I'm no ordinary woman.

543
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,489
My dreams come true.

544
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,621
I admire your passion.

545
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,459
But in business, I trust
in logic, not passion.

546
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,045
I'm sorry, little Princess.

547
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,838
I am not your little Princess.

548
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,342
I am Daenerys stormborn
of the blood of old valyria,

549
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,219
and I will take what is mine.

550
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,680
With fire and blood, I will take it.

551
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,433
Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.

552
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,454
Who taught you to read?

553
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,665
My father, my lord.

554
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,749
Hmm.

555
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,169
I taught my son Jaime to read.

556
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,509
The maester came to me one day,
told me he wasn't learning.

557
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,304
He couldn't make sense of the letters.

558
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,806
He reversed them in his head.

559
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,977
The maester said he'd heard tell
of this affliction

560
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,229
and that we simply must accept it.

561
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:14,321
After that, I sat Jaime down
for four hours every day until he learned.

562
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,366
He hated me for it, for a time.

563
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,453
For a long time.

564
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,039
But he learned.

565
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,458
Hmm.

566
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,630
Where is your father? Is he alive?

567
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,426
Who was he?

568
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,179
A stonemason.

569
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,514
A stonemason who could read?

570
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,641
Hmm.

571
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,850
He taught himself.

572
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,519
Quite a man.

573
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,397
What killed him?

574
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,151
Loyalty.

575
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,238
You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?

576
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,118
Did...

577
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,873
Forgive me, my lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

578
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,587
But you've already begun.

579
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,633
Did you know your father, my lord?

580
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,427
I did.

581
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,056
I grew up with him.

582
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,435
I watched him grow old.

583
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,357
He loved us.

584
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,609
He was a good man,

585
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,737
but a weak man.

586
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,616
A weak man who nearly destroyed
our house and name.

587
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,537
I'm cold.

588
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,748
I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.

589
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,874
Mmm.

590
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,629
(Horse whinnies)

591
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,774
(Panting)

592
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:15,859
(Grunts)

593
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,195
Where are you going, girl?

594
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,031
The armory, my lord.

595
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,493
- Why?
- Lord tywin sent me.

596
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,664
What might this be?

597
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,500
Lord tywin gave it to me.

598
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,878
What for?

599
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,380
To take to the armory.

600
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,049
Why would he do that?

601
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,304
Let's go and ask him.

602
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,640
Move!

603
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,020
Get out of the way!

604
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,368
(Men chatting)

605
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,465
(Breathing heavily)

606
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,177
Amory lorch.

607
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,971
A girl has named a second name.

608
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,335
A man will do what must be done.

609
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,432
Now!

610
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,561
A girl cannot tell a man
when exactly he must do a thing.

611
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,481
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

612
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,292
But he's going to tell tywin.
He's getting away.

613
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,901
It has to be now.

614
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
(Sighs)

615
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,911
Guard!

616
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,382
- Your grace.
- Your grace.

617
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,847
My honor, your grace.

618
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,390
Your grace.

619
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,398
- Your grace.
- Quent.

620
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,838
Lady talisa.

621
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,632
Your grace.

622
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,760
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

623
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,305
Westerosi customs are
still a bit foreign to me.

624
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,265
It's hard to keep all the rules straight.

625
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,560
But if I remember my lessons,

626
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,438
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady.

627
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,232
Unless she's a queen or a Princess.

628
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,817
I could find someone who knows.

629
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,111
Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

630
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,280
Because it's obvious.

631
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,284
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge,

632
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,828
and my mother, my brother and I
lived with him above our shop?

633
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,415
I'd call you a liar.

634
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,168
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

635
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,564
I always thought I was a brilliant liar.

636
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,385
Better at amputations, I'm afraid.

637
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,185
Quite a pretty spot.

638
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,853
Will we be here long?

639
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,856
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

640
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,068
I'm not a spy.

641
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,320
Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.

642
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,741
You're right. You've found me out.

643
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:55,370
I'm writing a letter to the lannisters.
"The young wolf is on the move."

644
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,207
Perhaps you'd join me.

645
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,711
If you've got time, of course, for, well...

646
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,796
Catelyn: Robb.

647
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,633
Mother.

648
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,892
Mother, this is lady talisa.

649
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,269
She's been helping with the wounded.

650
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,981
She's been very helpful.

651
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,234
- Lady talisa.
- Lady stark.

652
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,695
Lady talisa...

653
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,072
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

654
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,867
Forgive me, I do not know this name.

655
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,787
An uncommon name here.
An old name in volantis.

656
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,332
Excuse me, my lady. Your grace.

657
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,510
I've missed you.

658
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,972
Yes, you look positively forlorn.

659
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,099
You surprised me, that's all.

660
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,561
I didn't think I'd see you today.

661
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,522
I wish that you were
free to follow your heart.

662
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,024
I know.

663
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,735
You have inherited
your father's responsibilities.

664
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,738
I'm afraid they come at a cost.

665
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,949
- You are promised to another.
- I know.

666
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,244
A debt that must be paid.

667
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,249
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your grace. My lady.

668
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,376
News from winterfell.

669
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,878
(Wind howling)

670
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,891
Your brothers desert you?

671
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,810
I can tell you which way to go.

672
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,064
We'll stop here.

673
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,982
Too dark to go any farther today.

674
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,610
Here? There's no shelter here.

675
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,070
There's no shelter anywhere.

676
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,739
There is...
If you know where to look.

677
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,203
The cold could kill us both.

678
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,497
- If you light a fire...
- No fire.

679
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,707
- But a fire is...
- No fire.

680
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,420
Have it your way.

681
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,514
We'll stay warmer if we stay close.

682
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,227
Bet you freeze to death before I do.

683
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,979
Bet your life.

684
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,882
Think they're out looking for you?

685
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,427
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

686
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,347
Yes.

687
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,560
You're brave.

688
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,396
Stupid,

689
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,356
but brave.

690
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,821
We start again at first
light. Get some sleep.

691
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,505
Stop moving.

692
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,424
I'm just trying to get comfortable.

693
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,427
Stop it!

694
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,192
- You're still moving.
- Was I?

695
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,111
I didn't notice that time.

696
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,541
This cannot be true.

697
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,710
We've had ravens from white harbor,

698
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,754
barrowton and the dreadfort.

699
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,130
I'm afraid it is true.

700
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,050
Why? Why would theon...

701
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,510
Because the greyjoys are treasonous whores.

702
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,056
- My brothers?
- We've heard nothing of them.

703
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,140
(Sighs)

704
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,976
But rodrik cassel is dead.

705
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,980
I told you, never trust a greyjoy!

706
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,236
I must go north at once.

707
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,029
There's still a war to win, your grace.

708
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,199
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

709
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,118
- How can I ask men to follow me if I can't...
- You are a king.

710
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,038
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

711
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,873
Let me go and talk to theon.

712
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,917
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

713
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,213
Theon holds the castle
with a skeleton crew.

714
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,882
Let me send word to
my bastard at the dreadfort.

715
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,928
He can raise a few hundred men and retake
winterfell before the new moon.

716
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,639
We have the lannisters on the run.

717
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,935
If you march all the way back north now,
you'll lose what you gained.

718
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,231
My boy would be honored
to bring you prince theon's head.

719
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,819
Tell your son bran and
rickon's safety is Paramount.

720
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,655
And theon, I want him brought to me alive.

721
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,201
I want to look him in
the eye and ask him why.

722
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,453
And then I'll take his head myself.

723
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,457
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

724
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,001
I'm no liar.

725
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,673
All wildlings are liars and savages
with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

726
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,717
I done what I had to do to stay alive.

727
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:46,262
I hate the starks as well as you do.

728
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,930
Let me serve you, my lord.

729
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,600
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

730
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,228
There are other ways to serve, my lord.

731
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:59,734
- I'm a prince now, and you'd do well...
- There are other ways to serve, my prince.

732
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:02,278
(Chuckles)

733
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,573
Like what?

734
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,953
We know things, the free people.

735
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,789
You know things?

736
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,083
Like what?

737
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,752
How to eat dirt? (Laughs)

738
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,462
(Scoffs)

739
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,172
Other things.

740
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,675
Savage things.

741
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,471
Wait outside.

742
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,782
I always wondered what you had under there.

743
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,993
It comes at a price.

744
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,120
I'm not killing you. That's your price.

745
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,663
I already had that.

746
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,167
What do you want then,

747
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,835
other than your miserable life?

748
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,463
What all free people want.

749
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,340
My freedom.

750
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,639
Well, you shall have it, then.

751
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,185
But only if you serve me well.

752
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,151
_owi -shh.

753
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,196
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

754
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,407
They thought so, too.

755
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,575
He hated me, the man who hit me.

756
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,994
I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.

757
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,624
He never met me before,
but he wanted to hurt me.

758
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,086
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger...

759
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,380
You are everything he will never have.

760
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,757
Your horse eats better than his children.

761
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,677
It doesn't matter now. He's dead.

762
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,513
I would have given them bread if I had it.

763
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,224
I hate the king more than any of them.

764
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,393
Don't say these things.

765
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,620
If the wrong people hear you...

766
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,646
But you're not the wrong people.

767
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,404
Don't trust anybody.

768
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,489
Life is safer that way.

769
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,394
(Murmurs)

770
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,699
And where are you going?

771
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,662
I have something for you from prince theon.

772
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,706
-What?

773
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,295
He says I'm to make the rounds.

774
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,720
And keep you warm.

775
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,602
(Groans)

776
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,857
(Whistles)

777
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,918
The spice king refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

778
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,380
The silk king won't support me because
of his business with the lannisters.

779
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,465
Why offend his best customer?

780
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,010
And the copper king offers me a single ship

781
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,721
on the condition that I
lie with him for a night.

782
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,683
Does he think I will
whore myself for a boat?

783
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,478
When I came to this city, I had nothing.

784
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,814
Truly nothing.

785
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,400
I slept by the docks.

786
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,403
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

787
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,530
If not, I dreamed of food.

788
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,783
Today, I am the richest man in qarth.

789
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:23,038
Do you think the path from poverty to
wealth is always pure and honorable?

790
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:28,377
I have done many things, khaleesi,
that a righteous man would condemn.

791
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,756
And here I am, with no regrets.

792
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,856
Bar the gates. Ring the bells.

793
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,275
Slowly, khaleesi.

794
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,901
- (Bells tolling)
- (People shouting)

795
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,037
Daenerys: Where are they?

796
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,254
Where are my dragons?

797
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,054
(Dragons screeching)
