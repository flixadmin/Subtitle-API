1
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,644
Okay. Let's see

2
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,644
where we are.

3
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:22,815
Uh, we could move this,

4
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:22,815
get rid of that,

5
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:22,815
kill that.

6
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:27,361
That kind of freaks me out.

7
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:27,361
Don't need her. Uh, we can get

8
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:27,361
rid of that.

9
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,822
That's done. Okay,

10
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,822
we could start with this.

11
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,867
I know it's a hard-hitting

12
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,867
piece, but come on, you guys,

13
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,867
it's the Internet.

14
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,118
We need traffic, traffic,

15
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,118
traffic. What do you got?

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,872
How about this?

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,872
Perfect.

18
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,415
Now, doesn't she look

19
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,415
smart and knowledgeable

20
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,415
about immigration reform?

21
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,417
ALL: Yeah.

22
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,417
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,417
She does, right?

24
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,879
I'm fucking with

25
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,879
you people. This

26
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,879
isn't a porn site.

27
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,130
What are we, nerds

28
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,130
trying to look at boobies?

29
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,966
Come on, keep looking.

30
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,966
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

31
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,050
Shit! Hello?

32
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,554
Hey! Baby, where are you?

33
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,554
Are you still at work?

34
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,930
No! Not even close.

35
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,473
Just so you know,

36
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,473
the movie starts

37
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,473
in 10 minutes.

38
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,350
I know!

39
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,350
Give me your pants.

40
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,350
What?

41
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,101
I'll buy you lunch

42
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,101
tomorrow. Come on.

43
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,101
No.

44
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,354
I'm your boss.

45
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,354
Give me your pants.

46
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,523
Please try not to be

47
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,523
late. I really hate

48
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,523
missing the beginning.

49
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,649
I know. I know.

50
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,069
Give me your pants.

51
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,069
I'm coming, baby.

52
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,655
I'm almost there!

53
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,615
How far away?

54
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,615
I think I see you!

55
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,912
Where are you?

56
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,912
I'm here.

57
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,912
So am I.

58
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,371
So many people.

59
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,371
What are you wearing?

60
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,165
I'm wearing the

61
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,165
only clothes outside

62
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,165
the theater,

63
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,084
because I'm

64
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,084
the only person

65
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,084
outside the theater!

66
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,004
I love that outfit.

67
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,004
You look so sexy in that.

68
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,756
You know that

69
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,756
I love this movie.

70
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,259
If a prostitute and

71
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,259
a ruthless businessman

72
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,259
can fall in love,

73
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,803
then anyone can.

74
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,764
I know this means a lot

75
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,764
to you, which means it

76
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,764
means a lot to me.

77
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,223
Well, apparently

78
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,223
it doesn't.

79
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm looking at you

80
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,600
right now. I can see you!

81
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,893
MAN: Jamie!

82
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,561
Hey!

83
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:44,980
Hey.

84
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:44,980
Oh, you made it.

85
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,106
Yeah. Hey.

86
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,106
Hi.

87
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,568
Sorry I'm late.

88
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,568
It's okay. I got

89
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,568
us sandwiches.

90
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,071
I got you turkey,

91
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,071
no cheese,

92
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,071
gluten-free bread.

93
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,448
You sure this was

94
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,448
prepared in a

95
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,448
nut-free facility?

96
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,408
Yes, I'm fully aware

97
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,408
of your allergies.

98
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,454
Hey, I'm here!

99
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,454
I'm here.

100
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,454
I'm really sorry.

101
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,289
We missed  Your Body

102
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,289
Is a Wonderland.

103
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,374
Okay. Only one song.

104
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,374
That's not so bad, right?

105
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,918
It was fucking

106
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,918
Your Body Is a

107
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,918
Wonderland!

108
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,964
Well, the good

109
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,964
news is, he has so

110
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,964
many good ones.

111
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,801
Here's an idea. Next time,

112
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,801
instead of being late,

113
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,801
just shit on my face.

114
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,261
'Cause that's kind of

115
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,261
the same thing as missing

116
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,261
Your Body Is a Wonderland.

117
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,554
Okay, come on.

118
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,554
We really gotta go in.

119
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,681
really tall boots.

120
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,681
Julia Roberts is

121
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,681
about to put on her

122
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,975
Um...

123
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,768
We need to talk.

124
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,523
I think we should

125
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,523
take a break.

126
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,734
we should chill for

127
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,734
a while, you know?

128
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,734
I just feel like

129
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,486
You're doing this?

130
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,486
You're breaking

131
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,486
up with me?

132
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,904
You said I was

133
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,904
your soul mate.

134
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,530
I did? When?

135
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,992
When we were at that

136
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,992
bed and breakfast

137
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,992
having sex.

138
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,451
But, you know,

139
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,451
that doesn't...

140
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,451
That doesn't what?

141
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,744
Count.

142
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,788
I was tied up at

143
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,788
work. I'm sorry.

144
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,373
Maybe you should

145
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,373
care a little bit

146
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,373
less about work

147
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,668
and a little more

148
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,668
about the girl

149
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,668
that you're dating.

150
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,005
'Cause last time

151
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,005
I checked, work

152
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,005
doesn't reassure you

153
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,507
up your ass doesn't

154
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,507
make you gay.

155
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,507
that liking a finger

156
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,635
I never said

157
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,635
"Go up." Okay?

158
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,014
I just said lightly

159
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,014
around... It's like

160
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,014
a little button.

161
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,016
You know what?

162
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,016
Not your issue

163
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,016
anymore.

164
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,391
Is this why

165
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,391
you were late?

166
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,810
You were worried

167
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,810
about how to break

168
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,810
up with me?

169
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,395
Oh, no, no.

170
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,395
I was trying to

171
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,395
decide what to wear.

172
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,690
So, you went with

173
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,690
sneakers and a hoodie.

174
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,690
Yeah.

175
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,525
What, are you gonna

176
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,525
take the SATs after this?

177
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,401
Don't lash

178
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,401
out, okay?

179
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,236
You're better

180
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,236
than that.

181
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,236
I'm really not.

182
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,072
I just think we're

183
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,072
heading in different

184
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,072
directions.

185
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,658
Yeah, you to the

186
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,658
John Mayer concert

187
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,658
and me not.

188
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,077
Thank you for doing

189
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,077
this before the concert,

190
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,077
by the way.

191
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,203
Best breakup

192
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,203
(MOUTHING) ever.

193
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,289
He is the Sheryl Crow

194
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,289
of our generation!

195
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,791
Let me just ask

196
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,791
you a quick question.

197
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,920
And just know that

198
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,920
I am not at all crushed

199
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,920
by this breakup.

200
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,881
So, be honest. Why?

201
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,132
Wait, is this a trick?

202
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,132
No.

203
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,258
Just pure

204
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,258
anthropological

205
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,258
research.

206
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,427
Okay. You want

207
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,427
someone to sweep

208
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,427
you off your feet,

209
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,139
but you're more

210
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,139
interested in getting

211
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,139
swept off your feet

212
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,682
than the someone

213
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,682
who's doing the

214
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,682
sweeping.

215
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,767
You seem like you've

216
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,767
got it totally together,

217
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,936
but you're actually

218
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,936
really emotionally damaged.

219
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,065
Also, you have, like, really

220
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,065
big eyes, and that freaks me

221
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,065
out sometimes...

222
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,316
Thank you.

223
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,316
That's enough.

224
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,069
It is not you

225
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,069
at all.

226
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,405
Of course it's me!

227
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,405
You can't say that.

228
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,405
You're breaking up with me!

229
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,241
It's not. It's me.

230
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,241
I don't like you

231
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,241
anymore.

232
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,618
This is my fault.

233
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,618
You deserve better

234
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,618
than me.

235
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,995
You're a

236
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,995
great guy.

237
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,207
A little too emotionally

238
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,207
unavailable, if you ask me.

239
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,332
I didn't.

240
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,834
I really want to

241
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,834
stay friends.

242
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,419
Let's stay friends.

243
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,419
Sure.

244
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,294
Totally.

245
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,464
(MOUTHING)

246
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,464
John Mayer.

247
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,884
John fucking Mayer!

248
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,802
Come here, you.

249
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,388
You're gonna

250
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,388
get through this.

251
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:31,188
Why do relationships always

252
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:31,188
start off so fun and then

253
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:31,188
turn into suck-a-bag-o-dicks?

254
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,067
I really have to stop

255
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,067
buying into this bullshit

256
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,067
Hollywood cliche of true love.

257
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,238
Shut up, Katherine

258
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,238
Heigl! You stupid liar!

259
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,449
I'm just gonna work

260
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,449
and fuck. Like

261
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,449
George Clooney.

262
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,077
I'm just gonna

263
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,077
shut myself down

264
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,077
emotionally.

265
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,288
Like George Clooney.

266
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,424
Hello.

267
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,425
Seat up,

268
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,425
please, sir.

269
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,011
Is that the

270
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,011
Hudson River?

271
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,764
No. It's the

272
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,764
East River.

273
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,935
So we won't be

274
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,935
landing on it, then,

275
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,935
like that flight,

276
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,562
you know, with

277
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,562
that captain they

278
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,562
keep giving medals to?

279
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,315
That pilot

280
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,315
was a hero.

281
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:18,860
Asshole.

282
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,698
Plane actually did

283
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,698
a lot of the work.

284
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,785
JAMIE: I think I found

285
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,785
the perfect guy to fill

286
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,785
that job at  GQ.

287
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,163
No, he's landing early.

288
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,163
I'm scrambling.

289
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,207
No, he's not sold on

290
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,207
the job yet, but I'll

291
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,207
get him there. I always do.

292
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,668
I'm even picking him

293
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,668
up in a hybrid.

294
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,545
He's from LA. I figured

295
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,545
he's into all that bullshit.

296
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,338
Hey, sir, what's that

297
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,338
tall building over there?

298
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,382
Empire State Building.

299
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,135
No, no, no, no.

300
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,135
No. The other one.

301
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,972
The really, really tall

302
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,972
one with the antenna on

303
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,972
top of it, the windows.

304
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,347
That is Empire

305
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,347
State Building.

306
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,018
Oh, yeah. You're

307
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,018
right.  King Kong.

308
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,186
Hey...

309
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,609
Oh, hey! Are you

310
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,609
done with this?

311
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,609
All met up?

312
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,112
Great. Welcome

313
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,112
to New York,

314
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,112
Ms. Penderghast.

315
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,571
Yeah.

316
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,627
Oh, no. Oh.

317
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,627
Excuse me. Sorry.

318
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,712
Okay.

319
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,344
Can you hand

320
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,344
me my bag?

321
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,344
Sure. Which one?

322
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,553
The one with

323
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,553
the straps.

324
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,553
Okay.

325
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,428
MAN: There.

326
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,388
Okay.

327
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,391
Thank you.

328
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,391
Welcome to

329
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,391
New York, sir.

330
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,438
Excuse me.

331
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,438
Yeah.

332
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,109
That's me.

333
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,109
Which one, the

334
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,109
blue or the yellow?

335
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,737
No. The makeshift

336
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,737
sign made out of

337
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,737
lipstick, that's me.

338
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,740
You're Dylan Harper.

339
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,740
I am.

340
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,116
I'm Jamie Rellis.

341
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,451
You're picking me

342
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,451
up from the airport.

343
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,451
Hi. Yes, I am.

344
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,247
You always pick

345
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,247
people up like this?

346
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,332
Uh, yeah, you know,

347
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,332
I like to keep

348
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,332
things interesting.

349
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,918
Welcome to

350
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,918
New York.

351
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,918
Thank you.

352
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,628
You're not exactly what

353
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,628
comes to mind when you

354
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,628
think headhunter.

355
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,840
Yeah, I prefer "executive

356
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,840
recruiter." Headhunter

357
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,840

00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,858
Alcohol. Now

535
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,858
we're talking.

536
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,281
You know,

537
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,281
I like you.

538
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,491
I'll give you your

539
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,491
choice of closes.

540
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,035
How I close you

541
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,035
on this job.

542
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,035
What?

543
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,746
Okay.

544
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,746
So we got the

545
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,746
flattery close.

546
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,459
Dylan, you are

547
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,459
so good at what

548
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,459
you do.

549
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,252
The take-it-or-

550
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,252
leave-it close.

551
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,879
if you take it.

552
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,879
I get paid regardless.

553
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,879
Man, I don't care

554
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,590
The sympathy close.

555
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,590
(LAUGHS)

556
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,258
You see, my

557
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,258
kidneys are failing...

558
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,385
Why do women think

559
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,385
the only way to get

560
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,385
a man to do what they want

561
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,970
is to manipulate him?

562
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,682
History. Personal

563
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,682
experience.

564
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,682
Romantic comedies.

565
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,269
Come on, you're here for

566
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,269
a reason, whether you

567
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,269
want to admit it or not.

568
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,564
want to know their options?

569
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,564
Yeah, to explore an

570
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,564
option. Who wouldn't

571
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,107
Someone who's in

572
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,107
the perfect situation.

573
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,192
Are you in the

574
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,192
perfect situation?

575
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,653
Job? Absolutely.

576
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,695
Everything else?

577
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,695
None of your business.

578
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,696
(CHUCKLES)

579
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,202
Shaun!

580
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,662
Jamie!

581
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,662
Hey!

582
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,288
up, baby?

583
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,288
What are you doing here?

584
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,288
Hey, what's

585
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,623
You look great.

586
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,623
(MOUTHING)

587
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,623
Shaun White?

588
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,625
You been, uh, working out?

589
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,625
Nope. Just been

590
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,625
eating a lot.

591
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,001
Ah, okay.

592
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,001
Yeah.

593
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,294
Do you want a drink?

594
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,294
Yeah!

595
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,420
Let me get you

596
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,420
a drink. Yeah?

597
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,420
Okay.

598
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,964
Careful! Careful.

599
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,964
Sorry.

600
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,009
Hey, bro, that

601
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,009
was like a double

602
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,009
McTwist 1260.

603
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,553
(BOTH LAUGHING)

604
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,971
Yeah, like the trick.

605
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,971
Yeah, yeah,

606
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,971
yeah. Dylan.

607
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,598
Jamie, you want

608
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,598
to get this guy

609
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,598
out of my face

610
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,891
before I break his

611
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,891
fucking skull?

612
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,353
Sorry, bro.

613
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,353
No disrespect.

614
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,353
I'm a huge fan.

615
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,023
You don't fucking know

616
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,023
me, man! Don't talk to

617
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,023
me like you know me!

618
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,817
What, you think I'm

619
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,817
all chill 'cause

620
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,817
I snowboard and shit?

621
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,070
One more word,

622
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,070
I'll fuck you up

623
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,070
like dynamite!

624
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,489
Dynamite?

625
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,865
Aw, I'm just

626
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,865
playing, bro.

627
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,244
Any friend of Jamie's

628
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,244
is cool with me.

629
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,787
It's all

630
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,787
good, man.

631
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,787
All good.

632
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,123
I'm whispering in

633
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,123
the ear of a dead man.

634
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,084
I'll see

635
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,084
you later.

636
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,587
Good to see you.

637
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,587
Bye, honey.

638
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:38,049
Shaun White

639
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:38,049
seems really great.

640
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:38,049
Nice dude.

641
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,719
know him again?

642
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,719
I took his virginity.

643
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,719
How do you

644
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,845
Oh, so you guys have

645
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,845
known each other

646
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,845
for a while?

647
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,347
No, it was like

648
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,347
eight months ago.

649
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,141
Wow.

650
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,102
So does the carpet

651
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,102
match the drapes?

652
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,479
floors, if you

653
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,479
know what I mean.

654
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,479
Uh, it's hardwood

655
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,065
My God!

656
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,065
Terrible visual.

657
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,317
Totally kidding,

658
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,317
by the way. Just

659
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,317
an old friend of mine.

660
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,071
conditioner.

661
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,071
You guys use the

662
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,071
same leave-in

663
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,989
His hair had

664
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,989
nice body.

665
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,782
Can I get two

666
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,782
gyro number sixes,

667
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,782
extra sauce?

668
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,704
looking for?

669
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,704
The cops.

670
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,704
What are you

671
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,080
Come on.

672
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,080
The cops?

673
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,373
Yep.

674
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,333
Come on!

675
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,130
Where are you

676
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,130
taking me?

677
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,130
You'll see.

678
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,313
Well, here's

679
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,313
your open space.

680
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,774
Run, gazelle. Run!

681
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,526
(CHUCKLES)

682
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,572
Wow. This is

683
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,572
unbelievable.

684
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,572
I know.

685
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,995
Okay, this was

686
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,995
not on  Seinfeld.

687
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,164
Come on, what's your

688
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,164
dad think about all this?

689
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,042
About what?

690
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,294
Well, he must

691
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,294
have an opinion.

692
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,129
He used to write

693
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,129
for the  LA Times

694
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,129
for 23 years.

695
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,048
Somebody did

696
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,048
their homework.

697
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,010
I have this thing

698
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,010
at work. It's

699
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,010
called, uh,

700
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,470
Google.

701
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,263
Come on, what's he

702
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,263
think about the job?

703
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,141
Actually, I

704
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,141
didn't ask him.

705
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,643
Well, then you must

706
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,643
know what he'd say.

707
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,025
Uh, he'd tell me

708
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,025
to go with my gut

709
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,860
and that he'd be proud of me

710
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,860
no matter what I did.

711
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,197
Sounds like a

712
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,197
really great man.

713
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,034
Yeah, he is.

714
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,704
Hey, do you want to

715
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,704
see something really cool?

716
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,872
I always want to see

717
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,872
something really cool.

718
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,872
What...

719
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,290
Come on.

720
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,876
Okay.

721
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,631
Only place in the

722
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,631
city you can actually

723
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,631
see the stars.

724
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,342
Wow.

725
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,342
Yeah.

726
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,010
It's pretty

727
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,010
awesome.

728
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,010
I know.

729
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,847
I like to come

730
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,847
up here to think.

731
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,266
Just when it gets a

732
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,266
little too much for me

733
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,266
down there, it's like...

734
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,893
It's like my

735
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,893
New York version

736
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,893
of a mountaintop.

737
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,689
Best part,

738
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,689
no cell reception.

739
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,815
(LAUGHING)

740
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,109
You take all

741
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,109
your recruits

742
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,109
up here?

743
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,698
Actually, never

744
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,698
really taken

745
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,698
anyone up here.

746
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,242
Really?

747
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,242
Yeah.

748
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,744
Thanks.

749
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,912
If you tell anyone

750
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,912
about this, I will

751
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,912
rip your ears off

752
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,622
and staple them

753
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,622
to your neck.

754
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,585
city seems really

755
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,585
violent.

756
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,585
Everyone in this

757
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,836
(CHUCKLES)

758
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,630
Ooh, come on, let's go.

759
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,630
One last stop.

760
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,091
We're just

761
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,091
getting comfortable.

762
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,091
I know you are. Come on.

763
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,761
It's New York.

764
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,761
Now hustle.

765
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,761
Come on.

766
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,471
Come on, come on.

767
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,471
Oh, you're showing me

768
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,471
Times Square.

769
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,932
This is not

770
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,932
touristy at all!

771
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,932
Oh, would you shush? Come on.

772
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,101
to power-walk

773
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,101
everywhere we go?

774
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,101
Do we have

775
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,728
Yes.

776
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,523
So everybody just

777
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,523
kind of walks wherever

778
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,523
they want, then.

779
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,817
How 'bout right here?

780
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,943
What do you mean?

781
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,943
We're here.

782
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,868
Oh, my God,

783
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,868
it's 1988.

784
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,953
All right, smartass,

785
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,953
give it five seconds.

786
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:57,957
(BOTH LAUGHING)

787
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,767
(LAUGHING)

788
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,689
What is this?

789
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,689
It's a flash mob.

790
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,400
Like on  Oprah!

791
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,400
Exactly.

792
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,610
Should we get

793
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,610
out of the way?

794
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,612
No, no. Enjoy it.

795
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,612
Take it all in.

796
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,617
It's pretty

797
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,617
damn cool.

798
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,617
Right?

799
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,496
(CHUCKLING)

800
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,789
It's kind of rad.

801
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,835
Do these people

802
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,835
get paid for this?

803
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,629
No. No. They kind of

804
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,629
just do it for fun.

805
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,715
It's nice to feel

806
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,715
like you're a part

807
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,715
of something.

808
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,217
New York can be

809
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,217
a little bit

810
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,217
lonely at times.

811
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,845
And you're trying

812
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,845
to sell me on it.

813
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,806
Every place can

814
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,806
be a bit lonely

815
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,806
sometimes.

816
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,020
Oh, be careful!

817
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,020
Oh, my God.

818
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,981
Come down.

819
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,981
Okay.

820
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,782
Shit. Get

821
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,782
back down.

822
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,782
Okay.

823
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,127
I'm in.

824
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,127
What?

825
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,881
You sold me.

826
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,881
Really?

827
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,799
I'll take the job.

828
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,799
Oh, my God!

829
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:34,053
What, are you surprised?

830
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:34,053
No! No. Oh, you

831
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:34,053
are gonna crush it!

832
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,348
Amazing.

833
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,727
You can all go home

834
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,727
now! Thank you!

835
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,727
Very funny.

836
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,020
Come on.

837
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,689
ALL: Congratulations,

838
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,689
sell-out!

839
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,649
Thank you,

840
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,649
thank you.

841
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,943
All I'm saying is,

842
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,943
it wasn't so much

843
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,943
the pilot's skill

844
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,905
that landed that plane

845
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,905
on the river as much as

846
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,905
the mechanics of the aircraft.

847
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,281
Are you saying

848
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,281
that Captain Sully

849
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,281
wasn't a hero?

850
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,200
No, no.

851
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,618
Uh, there were just

852
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,618
other factors.

853
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,203
Are you not

854
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,203
an American?

855
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,010
Hey, fuckface, you want

856
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,010
to get your shit out

857
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,010
of my car or what?

858
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,177
I... Yeah.

859
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,432
Welcome to New York.

860
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,432
Go and fuck a dick.

Fuck.

863
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,169
So, all I ask is that you

864
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,169
give me a little bit of

865
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,169
time to gain your trust.

866
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:53,841
I know that I'm new at this,

867
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:53,841
but what I lack in experience

868
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:53,841
I make up for in cliches.

869
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,134
So, my door is always open.

870
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,053
(CROWD LAUGHING)

871
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,723
But seriously,

872
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,723
my door is

873
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,723
always open.

00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,530
Why can't it not

1240
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,530
be like that?

1241
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:59,368
It's a physical act.

1242
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:59,368
Like playing tennis.

1243
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,787
they're playing tennis.

1244
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,787
Two people should be

1245
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,787
able to have sex like

1246
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,414
Yeah, I mean,

1247
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,414
no one wants to go

1248
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,414
away for the weekend

1249
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,541
after they

1250
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,541
play tennis.

1251
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,335
You shake hands,

1252
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,335
get on with your shit.

1253
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,335
It's just a game.

1254
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,627
Yeah.

1255
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,131
Mmm.

1256
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,049
Do you want

1257
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,049
more beer?

1258
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,049
Mmm-hmm.

1259
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,384
Okay.

1260
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,851
Jamie!

1261
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,851
Yeah?

1262
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,728
Let's play tennis.

1263
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,728
What?

1264
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,188
Let's have sex like

1265
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,188
we're playing tennis.

1266
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,107
Get the hell

1267
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,107
out of here.

1268
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,401
Don't laugh. This

1269
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,401
could be great.

1270
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,986
This could take

1271
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,986
all the weirdness

1272
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,986
out of it.

1273
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,654
Well, we talked

1274
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,654
about this. I don't

1275
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,654
like you like that.

1276
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,158
I don't like you like

1277
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,158
that either. That's

1278
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,158
why it's perfect.

1279
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,994
(CHUCKLES) I don't even

1280
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,994
know if I find

1281
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,994
you attractive.

1282
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,370
That's cute.

1283
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,956
Well, I do have

1284
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,956
a thing for jerks.

1285
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,625
Okay, well, do you

1286
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,625
even find me attractive?

1287
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,168
That's cute.

1288
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,168
No, no, no.

1289
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,795
Before you got

1290
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,795
to know my

1291
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,795
awesome personality.

1292
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,670
Strictly physical.

1293
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,965
First time

1294
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,965
you saw me.

1295
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,136
people talking?

1296
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,136
Yeah.

1297
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,136
This is just two

1298
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,055
Two girls over drinks

1299
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,055
at Bennigan's. Go.

1300
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,684
I liked your eyes. I didn't

1301
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,684
think I'd ever seen such

1302
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,684
big, beautiful eyes.

1303
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,774
Your lips. Yeah.

1304
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,774
I thought you might

1305
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,774
be a good kisser.

1306
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,943
I am.

1307
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,403
Your breasts.

1308
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,403
What about them?

1309
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,779
They intrigued me.

1310
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,779
Really?

1311
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,616
Yeah.

1312
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,616
Oh, I think

1313
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,616
they're so tiny.

1314
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,075
They're still

1315
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,075
breasts.

1316
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,075
Thanks.

1317
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,120
I liked your hands.

1318
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,120
Mouth.

1319
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,246
Butt.

Chest.

1322

Eyes.

1323
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,915
You said that.

1324
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,915
I meant it.

1325
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,297
You swear you don't

1326
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,297
want anything more

1327
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,297
from me other than sex?

1328
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,841
You swear you

1329
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,841
don't want anything

1330
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,841
more from me?

1331
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,802
I know how you

1332
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,802
girls get. Tick-tock,

1333
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,802
tick-tock.

1334
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,929
Stop it.

1335
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,226
What are you doing?

1336
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,226
I'm pulling up

1337
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,226
my Bible app.

1338
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,020
You have a

1339
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,020
Bible app?

1340
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,020
Yes. I am a good girl.

1341
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,522
Hand on the iPad.

1342
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,522
Okay.

(HEAVENLY MUSIC PLAYING)

1344
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,981
Wait, no.

1345
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,441
Why can't they

1346
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,441
figure this out?

1347
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,777
No... This thing

1348
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,777
thinks I'm you

1349
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,777
and you're me.

1350
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,279
Keep your hand still.

1351
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,279
I'll move the iPad.

1352
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,573
It's actually

1353
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,573
making me dizzy.

1354
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,573
Hold on.

No relationship.

1358

No emotions.

Just sex.

1360

Whatever happens,

1361
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,212
we stay friends.

Okay.

1365
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,768
So I guess we

1366
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,768
should just start.

1367
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,104
Okay.

1368

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

1369

That's really...

1371
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,942
That's enough

Let's go to

the bedroom.

1375
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,195
the couch? It's

00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,195
less emotional.

What's wrong with

1378
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,030
The bedroom

1379
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,030
has better light.

1380
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,575
And since we're just

1381
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,575
friends, I don't have to be

1382

insecure about my body.

Come on, okay?

You're beautiful.

No, you see,

1388
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,832
that is way too

1389
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,832
emotionally supportive

1390
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,710
and you need to

1391
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,710
just lock that down.

1392
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,381

My nipples are

like dirty talk,

and had I known this was gonna

happen, I would have shaved

my legs this morning.

00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,973
My chin is ticklish,

and if I'd have known

1405
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,642
this was gonna happen,

1406

stands, none of which

1589
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,430
we're proud of, but...

1590
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,475
Really?

1591
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,811
Look, to think

1592
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,811
that you and I

1593
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,811
could just have sex

1594
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,980
compromising anything

1595
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,980
was just so...

1596
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,980
and without it

1597
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,649
Misguided.

1598
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,649
Exactly.

1599
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,150
I was gonna call

1600
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,150
you this morning.

1601
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,360
But you didn't.

1602
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,778
But I didn't.

1603
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,739
already coming between

1604
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,739
us and I really...

1605
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,739
And you see, it's

1606
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,240
I just don't

1607
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,240
want it to.

1608
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,825
It's not going to.

1609
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,619
Look, I know that I act

1610
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,619
all tough and I talk all

1611
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,619
tough, but really...

1612
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:43,206
It's just a front to

1613
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:43,206
protect yourself from

1614
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:43,206
your own vulnerability.

1615
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,000
What are you,

1616
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,000
my fucking

1617
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,000
therapist now?

1618
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:49,838
No, I'm a friend. Who

1619
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:49,838
knows that every time

1620
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:49,838
you curse, you blink.

1621
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,216
rejecting the word.

1622
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,216
It does not.

1623
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,216
Like your body's

1624
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,342
Fuck you.

1625
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,342
Blinked.

1626
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,177
No, I didn't

1627
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,177
fucking blink.

1628
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,177
Blinked again.

1629
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,513
Shit.

1630
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,513
Ah, didn't blink.

1631
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,473
okay with.

1632
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,473
(LAUGHS)

1633
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,473
"Shit" you're

1634
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,850
It was stupid.

1635
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,850
Yes.

1636
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,142
We're friends,

1637
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,142
let's stay friends.

1638
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,603
Yes. Yes, this,

1639
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,603
I don't wanna lose this.

1640
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,021
Me neither.

1641
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,230
Great.

1642
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,230
Fantastic.

1644
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,024
lovely couple?

What the hell

1647
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,117
are we doing?

1648
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,117
I don't know.

1649
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,705
Rub my hair.

1650
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,705
Kiss my neck.

(GIGGLING)

1652
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:27,876
Watch my nipple.

1653
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:27,876
All right, all right.

1654
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,880
I didn't know you

1655
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,880
had a tattoo.

1656
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,880
Yeah.

1657
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,090
Why didn't I

1658
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,090
notice that before?

1659
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,800
Because we

1660
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,800
were drunk.

1661
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,760
Was it your dog?

1662
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,760
No. Never had one.

1663
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,177
But everyone

1664
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,177
else did.

1665
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,846
And I thought having

1666
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,846
a dog meant you had

1667
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,846
a normal family,

1668
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,556
I desperately

1669
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,556
wanted.

1670
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,556
which at 17

1671
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,725
So as a sign of

1672
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,725
rebellion you

1673
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,725
got a tattoo

1674
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,143
of the most

1675
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,143
conventional thing

1676
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,143
you could think of.

1677
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,937
It was super

1678
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,937
awesome back then.

1679
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,271
Check it.

1680
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,271
Okay.

1681
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,689
A lightning bolt?

Eighteen.

1683
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,774
Wanted superpowers.

1684
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,774
Yeah.

1685
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,819
I was a little into

1686
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,819
Harry Potter back then.

1687
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,529
Were you also gay back then?

1688
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,529
Harry Potter doesn't

1689
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,529
make you gay!

1690
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,364
Okay.

1691
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,364
Are you sure

1692
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,364
about this?

1693
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,491
Are you?

1694
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,491
No.

1695
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,492
Me neither.

1696
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,041
How was your day?

1697
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,041
It was okay.

1698
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,793
I had a turkey

1699
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,793
sandwich for lunch.

1700
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,793
How was that?

1701
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,670
It wasn't that good.

1702
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,670
How was your day?

1703
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,922
Still trying to figure

1704
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,922
out that subway system.

out of here!

No, I mean my butt,

1714
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,356
it's cramping. Can

1715
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,356
you grab a pillow?

1716
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,398
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1717
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,527
So, no butt?

No.

Yeah, it's all right.

I gotta be honest,

1725
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,796
I feel a little

1726
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,796
emasculated.

feel emasculated?

Little bit.

1731

No, actually.

1766
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,017
It's like two lanes

of traffic merging into

Hmm.

Are you pooping?

No.

Why are you

00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,652
sitting down?

1774
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,652
It's easier to control.

No. No, no. Sorry.

Did you wash

your hands?

Well, then you think

1820
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,257
you could use that time

just my buddy,

1829

the market.

1925
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,529
you go to the market

1926

But what the hell.

1927
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:52,658
is to buy the

produce, which

are you, Puerto Rican?

1944
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:12,220
That is terrible, Mother.

1945
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:12,220
Just joking. Your dad

1946
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:12,220
was Puerto Rican.

1947
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,805
What? You said

1948
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,805
that he was Greek.

Get your shoes.

Okay. All right.

Well, not...

Yeah.

Okay.

1959
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,521
It was nice to

1960
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,521
have met you...

Back, back!

00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,244
That's what I'm

1968
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,244
talking about!

I don't say that

1972
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,207
pejoratively,

1973
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,207
I say it hopefully.

1974
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,042
Hold it.

1975

Not even you?

Come on, man.

Come talk to me after.

1979
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,879
Give me five minutes

of your time.

1981
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,506
I might be able to let

1982
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,506
you see some reason.

Come on, baby!

I'm supposed

to meet up

1990
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,226
with Jamie.

1991

Uh-huh.

What, you guys

going out now?

No, no, no, we're just

That never works, bro.

2006
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,910
Jamie's different.

2007
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,497
Does she have a

2008
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,497
penis where most

2009

2010
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,457
No penis.

2011
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,457
Then she's

2012
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,457
no different.

down more tail than

2018
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,627
you'll ever have.

2019

keep rolling in,

in every way.

2033
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,189
And if I had a choice,

2034
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,189
I would be with women

2035
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,189
to my dying day.

2036

But me likes cock

2037
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,192
so I'm strict-aly

2038
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,192
dick-aly.

2039
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,904
So it's always just

2040
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,904
about sex, then?

2041
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,449
No. I've been in

2042
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,449

Yeah, but then it's

It's okay, you

2057
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,879
don't get it.

2058

Uh, whatever, Mom.

00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:33,379
It's just surprising.

2110
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,634
There, done. It's...

2111
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,634
There we go.

2112
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,634
Okay.

2113
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:42,180
Oh, you look great!

2114
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:42,180
You look great.

2115
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:42,180
You look like a princess.

2116
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,182
Yeah!

2117
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,182
Really?

2118
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,017
Yeah.

2119
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,017
Okay.

2120
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,937
Hey, my friend gave

2121
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,937
me his house in Montauk

2122
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,937
for July 4th.

2123
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,898
Let's you and me

2124
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,898
go away together.

2125
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,898
No men, no bullshit.

2126
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,402
Just mother-daughter.

2127
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,402
Like a Nora Ephron movie.

2128
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,402
(SCOFFS)

2129
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,155
When was the last time

2130
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,155
we spent a full weekend

2131
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,155
together?

2132
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,158
in Vermont. We got snowed in

2133
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,158
with the ski instructor.

2134
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,158
When I was eight, that time

2135
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,451
Demitri.

2136
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,451
Bill.

2137
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,203
He reminded me a lot

2138
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,203
of your father.

2139
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,623
Dark curls, olive skin,

2140
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,623
Cold War accent.

2141
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,625
My father was Russian?

2142
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,625
I don't remember.

2143
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,961
But what I do remember

2144
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,961
is we drank a lot of vodka

2145
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,961
and shot a lot of guns.

2146
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:17,423
Mom, this "who's your daddy"

2147
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:17,423
game is getting really old.

2148
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,842
I know I haven't been

2149
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,842
the best mother

2150
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,842
in the world...

2151
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,681
I'm sorry,

2152
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,681
were you waiting

2153
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,681
for me to jump in?

2154
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,724
Come on!

2155
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,724
Go away with me.

2156
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,936
Come on. Come on.

2157
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,936
(LAUGHING)

2158
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,730
Okay, we'll do it.

2159
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,730
It'll be fun, yeah?

2160
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,317
(SIGHS)

2161
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,488
(GASPS)

2162
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,615
Mom...

2163
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,615
I was trying to bond!

2164
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,741
or sniff glue.

2165
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,741
(LAUGHS)

2166
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,741
It was either this

2167
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,917
Sorry about my mom.

2168
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,917
I thought she was funny.

2169
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,878
Yeah, she's really funny

2170
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,878
when she's asking for money,

2171
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,089
and she's hilarious

2172
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,089
when she needs

2173
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,089
a place to stay.

2174
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,681
Dylan, I think I wanna

2175
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,681
start dating again.

2176
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,518
Listen, I think

2177
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,518
we should stop this.

2178
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,771
Hmm.

2179
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,771
Yeah?

2180
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:16,691
I kind of think

2181
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:16,691
you're right.

2182
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,526
Right?

2183
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:23,780
♪ Every new beginning

2184
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:23,780
comes from some other

2185
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:23,780
beginning's end ♪

2186
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,575
That actually makes sense

2187
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,575
right here.

2188
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,368
Who would've thought

2189
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,368
Third Eye Blind

2190
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,368
could be so prophetic?

2191
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,745
Not Third Eye Blind.

2192
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,663
I'm pretty sure

2193
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,663
that's Third Eye Blind.

2194
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:31,748
Do you wanna go

2195
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:31,748
grab some lunch?

2196
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,124
Yes.

2197
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,124
Okay.

2198
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,709
You're buying.

2199
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,709
What?

2200
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:37,878
Okay.

2201
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,256
Oh.

2202
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,216
Pants.

2203
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,216
Shirt.

2204
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,468
So this is

2205
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,468
the end of this?

2206
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,553
I guess so.

2207
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,553
But it's good.

2208
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,553
Yeah.

2209
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:46,929
And we did it.

2210
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:46,929
With no bullshit.

2211
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:47,804
Shirt.

2212
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:47,804
Sweater.

2213
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,142
We managed to actually

2214
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,142
stay friends.

2215
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,101
Yup.

2216
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,101
Yeah.

2217
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,524
Okay. So, what is

2218
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,524
your type, anyway?

2219
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,901
No, I don't have

2220
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,901
a type.

2221
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,112
It's more about

2222
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,112
what's inside.

2223
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,112
Oh, please!

2224
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,448
Okay, what about her?

2225
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,492
DYLAN: Uh, yeah. I could get

2226
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,492
to know her inside.

2227
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,576
And she's reading a book.

2228
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:11,245
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

2229
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,456
I'm gonna go

2230
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,456
talk to her.

2231
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,456
What?

2232
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,458
What do you mean, "What?"

2233
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,458
We said we wanted

2234
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,458
to date again.

2235
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,251
I'm gonna go

2236
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,251
talk to her.

2237
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,251
Now?

2238
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,044
Here, in front of

2239
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,044
all of these people?

2240
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,838
I didn't say I was gonna

2241
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,838
rape her. I said I was

2242
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,838
gonna go talk to her.

2243
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,347
Excuse me. I'm Dylan.

2244
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,347
Nice to meet you.

2245
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,348
Oh,  The Notebook.

2246
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,433
(INAUDIBLE)

2247
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:37,854
DYLAN:

2248
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:37,854
Nice meeting you.

2249
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,153
Well?

2250
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,153
We talked.

2251
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,153
We laughed.

2252
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,780
Yeah.

2253
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,240
She's Belgian.

2254
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,240
Explains the reading.

2255
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,701
I showed her

2256
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,701
where the balcony was,

2257
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,453
because that's where

2258
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,453
she is meeting up

2259
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,453
with her husband.

2260
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,413
Oh!

2261
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,413
(LAUGHING)

2262
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,872
DYLAN: Anniversary trip

2263
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,872
to New York.

2264
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,793
Three kids.

2265
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,793
Christof, Karlina

2266
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,793
and Pepijn.

2267
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,129
Shut up.

2268
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,132
Why are you still laughing?

2269
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,132
At least I gave it a shot.

2270
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,052
Fine. I'll go next.

2271
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,388
See if I still have game.

2272
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,388
Okay.

2273
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,972
Okay.

2274
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,972
Oh, okay.

2275
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,890
Yes.

2276
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,890
Right here.

2277
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,890
Eleven o'clock.

2278
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:17,019
Iced coffee.

2279
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:17,019
Handsome,

2280
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:17,019
but doesn't know it.

2281
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,938
Staring at a tree,

2282
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,938
which means he's actually

2283
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,938
in the park for nature

2284
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,733
and not to watch

2285
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,733
women sunbathe.

2286
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,275
Or he's retarded.

2287
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,275
Don't care.

2288
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,402
I'm going in.

Excuse me.

00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,785
Yes?

2292
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:34,245
Hi.

2293
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:34,245
Hello.

2294
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:35,996
I'm Jamie.

2295
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,915
Yeah. Yeah,

2296
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,915
that works.

2297
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:41,918
Oh, hi.

2298
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,882
Okay.

2299
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,007
Nice to meet you.

Okay. His name is Parker.

He's a children's oncologist.

2309

Thank you.

2310

Why'd you wave to me?

2311
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:08,070
I told him you were

2312
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:08,070
my gay best friend,

2313
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,822
so he wants to set you up

2314
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,822

2317
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,788
and I haven't slept since.

2318
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,039
JAMIE: I can't believe

2319
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,039
you actually cure cancer.

2320
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,957
Well, me and God.

2321
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,795
What?

2322
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,795
I'm kidding.

2323
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:26,255
Can you imagine someone

2324
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:26,255

Yeah, I could.

I've been out with

2328
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,549

No, assholes.

Yeah.

Well, hopefully you're

2334
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,472
all done with that.

2335

Although, I gotta warn you,

Really?

00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,143
Yeah.

00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,816
a little bit of that.

Thank you.

2347
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,573
When can I see you again?

2348
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,202
Right now.

Ah.

2350
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,289
I'm just kidding.

00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,289
Okay.

2352
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,750
Can you imagine someone

2353
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,750
who would actually say that?

2354
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,376
JAMIE: I played the tuba

2355
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,376
in high school.

2356
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,963
World's stupidest instrument.

2357
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,840
Especially when you move

2358
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,840
eight times.

2359
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:12,551
Why'd you move?

2360
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:12,551
My mom really likes

2361
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:12,551
to break up with guys,

2362
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,219
and she was really good at it.

2363
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,764
Was your dad one of them?

2364
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,764
No, no, he was

2365
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,764
long before that.

2366
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,390
I actually never knew my dad.

2367
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,642
I'm sorry. That sucks.

2368
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,105
All right, look,

2369
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,105
I think I should probably

2370
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,105
tell you something.

2371
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,858
Please don't tell me

2372
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,858
you're a dude.

2373
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:29,025
Because that'll be like

2374
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:29,025
the third time

2375
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:29,025
since I moved here,

2376
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,903
and I don't think

2377
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,903
I can handle that.

2378
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,989
I have a five-date rule.

2379
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:35,867
You know, like,

2380
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:35,867
five dates before we...

2381
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:35,867
Yeah.

2382
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,243
I saw it in a movie.

2383
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,243
I thought I'd give it a try.

2384
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,663
You're worth waiting for.

to me in the park

2400
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,558
and compliment me

2401

for looking at the trees

2402

and not the sunbathers.

2403

I meant it.

2404
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,184
It was impressive.

2405
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,060

00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,118
a five-date challenge,

2628
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,495
he got you and cut out.

2629
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,495
Forget the douche.

2630
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,831
He's a dick.

2631
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,831
He's a dick-douche.

2632
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,210
Go have fun with your mom.

2633
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:04,255
Okay.

2634
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:04,255
Oh. Almost forgot.

2635
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:04,255
I got you something.

2636
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,806
It's Lieutenant Kali,

2637
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,806
the street artist

2638
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,806
we talked about.

2639
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,976
I got him to do something

2640
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,976
for you. "F-tale." Fairy tale.

2641
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,021
I know you're into

2642
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,021
that girly shit, so...

2643
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,021
This is so cool.

2644
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:24,400
Dylan,

2645
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:24,400
that's actually really sweet.

2646
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,235
It's cool, right?

2647
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,235
Yeah. Thank you.

2648
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:31,115
Hey, I'm gonna need

2649
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:31,115
to borrow cab fare.

2650
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,075
I'm not taking that thing

2651
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,075
on the subway.

2652
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,075
I don't wanna get rolled.

2653
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,785
No problem.

2654
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,412
As long as you get

2655
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,412
your feet off my bed.

2656
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,412
They're disgusting.

2657
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:39,998
What are you doing?

2658
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,792
Why are you doing that?

2659
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,460
You're an animal.

2660
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,460
Stop doing that.

2661
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,460
An animal. Stop.

2662
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:49,174
Hey, Ma.

2663
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,886
Ma. Come on,

2664
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,886
we gotta get on the road.

2665
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:54,721
Come on.

2666
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,307
Ma?

2667
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,075
Ouch.

2668
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,035
Why did I think that

2669
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,035
this time would be

2670
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,035
any different?

2671
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,954
Come with me to LA.

2672
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,954
What?

2673
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:21,623
It's 4th of July,

2674
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:21,623
everybody's left the city.

2675
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:21,623
What else are you gonna do?

2676
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,500
You're very sweet for asking,

2677
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,500
but it's fine.

2678
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,169
You know what,

2679
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,169
I'll just stay here.

2680
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,169
I'll be fine alone.

2681
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,339
You're not a baby

2682
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,339
in a hot car.

2683
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,339
I know you'll be fine alone.

2684
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,632
you to come

2685
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,632
because it would help me.

2686
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,632
I'm actually asking

2687
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,384
You'd be a great distraction

2688
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,384
for my family.

2689
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,552
They'd forget all about

2690
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,552
drilling me for being single.

2691
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,971
Won't they think

2692
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,971
that we're together?

2693
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,265
Not if I tell them we're not.

2694
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,265
And they'll believe you?

2695
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,600
Yeah, we're one of these

2696
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,600
crazy families that doesn't

2697
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,600
lie to each other.

2698
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,227
PBS is doing

2699
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,227
a documentary on us.

2700
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,728
Come on, they'll love you.

2701
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,897
home a carny.

2702
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,897
All fast-talking and brusque,

2703
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,897
like I'm bringing

2704
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,984
You're really nice to ask,

2705
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,984
but I'm just gonna stay here.

2706
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,694
Go to the gym.

2707
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,530
I just got you a ticket

2708
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,530
with my miles, it's done.

2709
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,530
Meet me at JFK.

2710
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,032
But...

2711
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,032
No buts.

2712
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,742
Like you were

2713
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,742
gonna go to the gym.

2714
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,742
I wasn't.

2715
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,008
LA's so nice.

2716
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,511
And everyone's so genuine

2717
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,511
and level-headed.

2718
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,511
Hmm.

2719
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,137
(LAUGHING)

2720
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:20,307
Thanks for this.

2721
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:20,307
You're good peeps.

2722
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:22,100
You're the good peeps,

2723
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:22,100
dude.

2724
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,520
You haven't met my family.

2725
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,520
You don't know

2726
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,520
what you're in for.

2727
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,023
Okay.

2728
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,691
(SIGHING)

2729
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,691
You know these planes

2730
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,691
pretty much land themselves?

2731
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,569
Nobody cares.

2732
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,569
You sound like an asshole.

2733
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,447
She's from New York.

2734
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:36,740
I'm sorry.

2735
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,878
Wow. This looks normal.

2736
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,088
It is.

2737
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,090
Thank you.

2738
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,888
Wow, you grew up here?

2739
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,015
It was my grandfather's.

2740
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,892
He bought it

2741
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,892
when there was

2742
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,892
nothing else here.

2743
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,228
My dad and my sister

2744
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,228
and her son live here now.

2745
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,773
What... (LAUGHS)

2746
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,773
Why would you

2747
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,773
move to New York?

2748
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:12,234
by some headhunter.

2749
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:12,234
(LAUGHS)

2750
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:12,234
I was conned

2751
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,944
You're here.

2752
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,944
Sammy!

2753
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,070
Hey, Uncle Dylan.

2754
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,238
What's up, buddy?

2755
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,238
(GRUNTS)

2756
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,532
How are you?

2757
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:21,493
Jamie, this is my nephew,

2758
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:21,493
Sam the Magnificent.

2759
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:24,204
Hello.

2760
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:24,204
May I offer you a light

2761
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:24,204
for your cigarette?

2762
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,914
I'm sorry,

2763
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,914
I don't smoke.

2764
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,916
Just pretend.

2765
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,916
He's a magician.

2766
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,627
Of course I'll have

2767
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,627
a cigarette.

2768
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,627
Smoking is great for you.

2769
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,880
(GASPS)

2770
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:38,260
Wow. Thank you, good sir.

2771
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:38,260
My pleasure, my lady.

2772
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,887
Oh, my God.

2773
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,887
I got it, I got it.

2774
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,931
Sammy. I got it, I got it.

2775
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,931
Just stay still.

2776
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,931
I got it, I got it.

2777
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,849
Sammy! Are you okay?

2778
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:45,976
(ANNIE EXHALING DEEPLY)

2779
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:45,976
All part of the illusion.

2780
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,644
Jet Skis later?

2781
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,644
Definitely.

2782
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,188
DYLAN:

2783
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,188
Still into magic, huh?

2784
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,024
Yep. But I'll take

2785
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,024
that over him sexting

2786
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,024
his friends any day.

2787
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,236
Dilbert!

2788
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,236
Banannie.

2789
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,446
(GRUNTING)

2790
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,446
(LAUGHING)

2791
01:00:57,488 --> 01:01:00,115
Jamie,

2792
01:00:57,488 --> 01:01:00,115
this is my sister, Annie.

2793
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,866
Hi.

2794
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,866
Thank you for having me.

2795
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,660
Oh, please.

2796
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,660
It's nice to have

2797
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,660
Dylan bring a girl home.

2798
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:05,496
We're just friends.

Oh, no, I know.

2800
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,664
If you were his girlfriend,

2801
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,664
he never would've

2802
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,664
brought you here.

2803
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,334
This one has intimacy issues.

2804
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,334
I know.

2805
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,585

2806
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,585
Dad.

2807
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:13,462
Dylan. Oh, man.

2808
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:13,462
Hey.

2809
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,755
How you doing, buddy?

2810
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,755
I'm good.

I miss you guys,

but I'm good.

That's okay.

2818
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,726
No, for a minute you reminded

2819
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,726
me of a girl I used to know.

2820
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,188
No, that's okay.

2821
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,188
It happens.

2822
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,188
Nice to meet you.

2823
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,148
Pleasure meeting you.

2824
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,148
You have a beautiful house.

2825
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,983
Thank you.

2826
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,694
Pool's a little cold,

2827
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,694
but it's very expensive

2828
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,694
to heat, so...

2829
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:41,156
I think I'm gonna go in

2830
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:41,156
and check the tide tables

2831
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,699
'cause I'm gonna take

2832
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,699
the boat out early

2833
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,699
in the morning.

2834
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,201
You should come.

2835
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,201
Oh, I would love to.

2836
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,036
We sold the boat.

The doctor doesn't want you

2838

It's good to see you, buddy.

2843

Nice to meet you.

2844
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,881
It was nice meeting you, too.

2845
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,633
Jamie. See?

2846
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,633
Yes.

2847
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,683
What's with the pants?

2848
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,683
He doesn't like

2849
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,683
them anymore.

2850
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,934
He's getting worse.

It's so good

2852
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,645
to have you here.

2853
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:13,730
Go show her the beach.

2854
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,693
Let me show you

2855
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,693
the beach. Come on.

2856
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,693
Okay.

2857
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,320
Go, get sandy.

2858
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,320

Okay.

2861
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,129
me about your dad.

2862
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,592
Yeah, it's been tough on him.

2863
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,592
They were real close.

2864
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,301

He'll be his regular old self

2869
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,556
and everything seems fine,

2870
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,891
and then just in a flash,

2871
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,891
he's gone.

2872

That's Dylan when he was nine.

Are those braids?

2874
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,691

He had a stutter.

God, it's nice.

3143
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:17,356
I do miss the mornings out

3144
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:17,356
here. Right before it burns

3145
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:17,356
off, it really is beautiful.

3146
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:18,482
I like Jamie.

3147
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:23,446
And she's pretty, too.

3148
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:26,449
Hey, easy, dude.

3149
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:26,449
Don't you go casting

3150
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:26,449
a spell on her.

3151
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:30,661
I'm a magician, not a wizard.

3152
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:30,661
You and your gay Harry Potter.

3153
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,914
You can't deny that going

3154
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,914
to Hogwarts wouldn't be

3155
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,914
life-changing.

3156
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,543
I miss you.

3157
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,543
I miss you, too, bud.

3158
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:40,296
Mom misses you.

3159
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:40,296
And so does Grandpa.

3160
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,050
Does he say anything?

3161
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,636
No. But sometimes

3162
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,636
he calls me Dylan.

3163
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,474
He said that he didn't

3164
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,474
want the job.

3165
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,310
That he was just coming

3166
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,310
to New York to explore

3167
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,310
his options.

3168
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,562
What a crock of gas.

3169
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,773
You fly across the country

3170
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,773
to explore your options?

3171
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,399
Please. I don't think so.

3172
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:04,028
Exactly! Please, I knew

3173
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:04,028
I had him the second

3174
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:04,028
he got off that plane.

3175
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,738
Oh, did you, now?

3176
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,738
Yeah.

3177
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,116
you leapt onto the baggage

3178
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,116
carousel barefoot

3179
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,116
Was that the same second

3180
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,034
and acted out a scene

3181
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,034
from  Will and Grace?

3182
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,034
(EMBARRASSED LAUGH)

3183
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,995
She did?

3184
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,995
Oh, yeah,

3185
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,995
you should have seen her.

3186
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,370
"Ah, look at me,

3187
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,370
I'm goofy but cute."

3188
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,872
You know what?

3189
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,872
It was all part of my plan.

3190
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,415
Quite a plan.

3191
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:17,959
Did you major in Planning

3192
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:17,959
at Headhunting College?

3193
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,503
So clever.

3194
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,503
It's not a real college,

3195
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,503
by the way, buddy.

3196
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:23,714
You guys bicker like

3197
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:23,714
you're an old married couple.

3198
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:24,882
Here, pick a card,

3199
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:24,882
my lady.

3200
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,342
Okay.

3201
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:28,303
Oh, no, not that one.

3202
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:28,303
The one on top.

3203
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,638
This is a good one.

3204
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,638
So...

3205
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,140
Yeah?

3206
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,140
Shuffle.

3207
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:34,558
Did you get her

3208
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:34,558
an engagement gift?

3209
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,145
We're not engaged, Dad.

3210
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,145
We're not together.

3211
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,145
We're just friends.

3212
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:41,107
All right, you don't wanna

3213
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:41,107
label it. I understand.

3214
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:41,107
But get her some jewelry.

3215
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:43,985
The only thing your mom

3216
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:43,985
loves is jewelry.

3217
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:47,530
I don't care how upset she is,

3218
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:47,530
I get her jewelry,

3219
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:47,530
she lights right up.

3220
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:50,158
Where is she, anyway?

3221
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,203
She's not here, Dad.

3222
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,203
I know, that's why I asked.

3223
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,203
Where is she?

3224
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:58,457
She's not coming.

3225
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:58,457
Why not?

3226
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,794
She doesn't live with you

3227
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,794
anymore, Pop.

3228
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,794
You're not married.

3229
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:04,463
MR. HARPER: What?

3230
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:04,463
She left about 10 years ago.

3231
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:05,965
I don't understand.

3232
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:07,800
She divorced you, Dad.

3233
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:12,429
I have to call her.

3234
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:12,429
Dad, you can't.

3235
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,931
Stop telling me what to do.

3236
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,393
Get your...

01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,734
I'm fine, I'm fine.

Here, let me help you up.

3244
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,195
No, don't. Don't!

Here we are.

3247
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,607
This is beautiful.

3248
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:07,360
Yeah, this is where I used

3249
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:07,360
to come to think. My rooftop.

3250
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:08,986
Okay, how high

3251
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:08,986
do you think

3252
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:08,986
that fence is?

3253
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,738
I'm a little over 6 foot.

3254
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,699
Looks like it's

3255
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,699
about three of me.

3256
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,699
So six times three...

3257
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,161
Ninety-two feet.

3258
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:21,665
Ninety-two feet.

3259
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:21,665
That's really tall, right?

3260
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:21,665
Yeah.

3261
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:25,086
But they don't want you

3262
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:25,086
to get up there, so I guess

3263
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:25,086
that makes sense.

3264
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:28,589
Wait. Six times three...

3265
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:28,589
Oh, God, you poor kid.

Jamie, no, no, no, no, no,

3271
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:37,014
wait. They take this shit

3272
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:37,014
seriously, okay?

3273
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,724
Look at all the cameras.

3274
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:41,727

the Scientology Center.

3277

And if any of these cameras

3278
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:44,688
are hooked up to the actual

and I apologize.

JAMIE: You really never been

3289
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:04,250
up here before?

3290
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:04,250
DYLAN: No.

3291
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,710
I've also never transferred

3292
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,710
heroin in my rectum,

3293
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,921
'cause it's against the law.

3294
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:12,842
You know, sometimes a simple

3295
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:12,842
yes or no answer is adequate.

3296
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:15,052
Hey, why didn't you tell me

3297
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:15,052
about your mom?

3298
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,846
She's not worth

3299
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,846
talking about.

3300
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,056

your husband and kids.

3303
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,894
Yeah, you never told me

3304
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,894
about him either.

3305
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,729
You know,

3306
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,729
there's a lot of stuff

3307
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,729
you didn't tell me.

3308
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,190
I don't want your pity.

3309
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:32,487
I can handle anything

3310
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:32,487
except that look

3311
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:32,487
in people's eyes.

3312
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,493

01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,493
Who cares

3314
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,493
what anybody thinks?

3315
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,785
He's the smartest man

3316
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,785
I've ever known.

3317
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,871
He's the only person

3318
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,871
I'd ever go to for advice.

3319
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:43,373
He's my dad.

3320
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,665
Dylan,

3321
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,665
he's still the same man.

3322
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,292
When I see the way

3323
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,292
people look at him now...

3324
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:49,545
It doesn't matter

3325
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:49,545
how people look at him.

3326
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:51,214
All that matters

3327
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:51,214
is how you look at him.

3328
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:53,757
Yeah, but he's walking around

3329
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:53,757
without his pants.

3330
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:53,757
Everyone's staring.

3331
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,592
So what?

3332
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,592
It's embarrassing.

3333
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,303
He needs to know

3334
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,303
that nothing has changed.

3335
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:59,305
That he's still that

3336
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:59,305
same man to you.

3337
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:01,140
Can we stop talking

3338
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:01,140
about this?

3339
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,062
Yeah, that's really smart.

3340
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,062
Let's just not talk

3341
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,062
about our feelings.

3342
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,146
I'm trying not to.

3343
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:12,609
Come on. Is something going

3344
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:12,609
on here? You've been acting

3345
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:12,609
really weird.

3346
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,029
No, I haven't.

3347
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,029
Yeah, you have.

3348
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,531
Is this about what happened

3349
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,531
the other night?

3350
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,449
What, sex?

3351
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,449
That doesn't mean anything.

3352
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,449
You know that.

3353
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:22,870
Right.

3354
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,914
And I haven't been

3355
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,914
acting weird.

3356
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,914
Okay.

3357
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,377
Oh, my God!

3358
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,377
Oh, shit!

3359
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,128
I told you!

3360
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,128
Well, I'm sorry!

3361
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,214

You are trespassing.

01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:35,508
Get down from the sign.

3365
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:36,592
We gotta jump.

3366
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,138
JAMIE: Dylan, jump!

3367
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,138
(STUTTERING) I'm frozen.

3368
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,473
Come on, get down!

3369
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:43,682
Sir, this is

3370
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:43,682
your last warning.

3371
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:46,185
Use the ladder!

3372
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:46,185
I have a fear of heights!

(STUTTERING)

3374
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:50,814
And also helicopters!

3375
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:50,814
They don't make sense to me!

3376
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,568
What do you mean

3377
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,568
you have a fear of heights?

3378
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,236
Why would you come up here?

3379
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:57,613

NEWS ANCHOR:  A bizarre

3382
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:02,618
situation this afternoon

3383
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:02,618
in the Southland.

3384
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:06,372
The LAPD rescued a local man

3385
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:06,372
from the Hollywood sign,

3386
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:08,291
the city's only real landmark.

3387
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,626
They actually wrapped you

3388
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,626
in a foil blanket!

3389
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,253
Did you run a marathon

3390
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,253
before this?

3391
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,130
Okay. Give me...

3392
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,130
No!

3393
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,340
No, no. I wanna save it.

3394
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,340
I gotta save it.

3395
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,340
No. That's enough!

3396
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,551
Give me the remote! Shut up!

3397
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,551
No, I wanna watch it

3398
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,551
over and over.

3399
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:20,344
Ow, ow, ow!

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3403
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,181
It's okay,

3404
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,181
it'll be up on YouTube.

(ANNIE SIGHS)

to take Dad that week

3408
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,437
I have to go to DC

for Sam's class trip, right?

3410

Yeah, he's gonna stay

with me in New York.

3412
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:32,773
Oh, good.

3413
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:35,610
So, when are we gonna

3414
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:35,610
see Jamie again?

3415
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:37,278
I don't know.

3416
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,863
Did you have a fight

3417
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,863
with your girlfriend?

3418
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,863
What's your problem?

3419
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,865
She's not my girlfriend.

3420
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,865
Why don't you believe me?

3421
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,243
I would believe you

3422
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,243
if you didn't lie to me.

3423
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,496
I saw you creeping out

3424
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,496
of her room the other night.

3425
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,789
Like you had just had sex,

3426
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,789
if you know what I mean.

3427
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,666
Yes, I know what you mean,

3428
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,666
you just said it.

3429
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:53,043
And how do you know

3430
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:53,043
what I look like

3431
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:53,043

3432
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,631
I'm not talking to you

I'm not talking about it.

3438

Dylan.

3439
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:03,346
Forgot my saw.

01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:03,346

What are you, in college?

01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,939
It doesn't matter,

3447
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,939
it's over.

3448
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,939
Why?

3449
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:15,983
Because we don't like

3450
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:15,983
each other like that.

3451
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:19,069
Okay, you know what?

3452
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:19,069
Can we just talk about this?

3453
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:19,069
Sit down.

3454
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,655
What more are you

3455
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,655
looking for?

3456
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,615
Who says I'm looking

3457
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,615
for anything?

3458
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,615
Dylan.

3459
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:24,450
I don't know,

3460
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:24,450
but it's not Jamie.

3461
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,243
Why, because you're

3462
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,243
great together?

3463
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,953
Because you're actually

3464
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,953
friends with each other?

3465
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:30,456
Because this is the happiest

3466
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:30,456
I have ever seen you?

3467
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:31,790
I don't know what

3468
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:31,790
to tell you.

3469
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,501
She's not for me.

3470
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,501
I don't like her

3471
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,501
like that.

3472
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:34,960
You liked her enough

3473
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:34,960
to have sex with her.

3474
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,086
It's just physical.

3475
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,047
Like playing tennis.

3476
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,174
I don't even know

3477
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,174
what that means, Dylan.

3478
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,759
I haven't seen you

3479
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,759
this dumb since you

3480
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,759
got that candy corn tattoo.

3481
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,137
It's a lightning bolt!

3482
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,137
With extra powers!

3483

3828
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:28,428
Throw some girls in there.

3829
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,680
Come on, ladies. Hop to.

3830
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:36,186
Okay, look.

3831
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:36,186
Just blend in.

3832
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:36,186
Girls, girls.

3833
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:38,396
Okay, let's go

3834
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:38,396
boy, girl, boy...

3835
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:41,275
Dylan.

3836
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:41,275
...boy, boy, boy, boys.

3837
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,068
What are you doing here?

3838
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,068
You met for another job!

3839
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,486
What, are you

3840
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,486
gonna leave now?

3841
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:45,904
I don't know. Yeah,

3842
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:45,904
I took one meeting.

3843
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,072
I can't believe you.

3844
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:49,574
Come here.

3845
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:49,574
(SIGHS)

3846
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,701
Is this your way of

3847
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,701
getting back at me?

3848
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,701
What?

3849
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,328
You know that if you leave

3850
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,328
before a year is up,

3851
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,328
I get screwed.

3852
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:55,413
Oh, right.

3853
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:56,915
If I did leave,

3854
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:59,751
which I don't know yet

3855
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:59,751
because all I did

3856
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:59,751
was take one meeting,

3857
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:01,336
I'd write you a check

3858
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:01,336
for your bonus.

3859
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:05,507
Whatever it is,

3860
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:05,507
I'll pay for it.

3861
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:05,507
Happy now? We good?

3862
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:06,633
Why didn't you tell

3863
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:06,633
me you were looking?

3864
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:07,801
That's personal.

3865
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,178
And we're not

3866
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,178
friends anymore.

3867
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:10,345
You made that pretty clear.

3868
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,976
See, all I wanted to do

3869
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,976
was have sex with you.

3870
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,976
Remember?

3871
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:17,727
Pretend you were

3872
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:17,727
the best friend

3873
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:17,727
I'd ever had.

3874
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,855
Open up to you

3875
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,855
like I've never

3876
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,855
done with anyone ever.

3877
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,231
And then when

3878
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,231
the sex stopped,

3879
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,483
invite you to LA

3880
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,483
for the weekend to,

3881
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:24,818
(SCATTING DRAMATICALLY)

3882
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,195
introduce you to my family.

3883
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:28,947
I'll send you a check

3884
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:28,947
if I take the job.

3885
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,157
Don't bother.

3886
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,747
TOMMY: Why don't you

3887
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,747
pick him up?

3888
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,583
Yeah. Just pick him on up.

3889
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,502
Oh, you little

3890
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,502
Christ figure, you!

3891
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:06,151
(PHONE RINGING)

3892
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,278
Hey, Dyl.

3893
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,321
Dad's coming into

3894
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,321
Newark Airport, right?

3895
01:30:09,363 --> 01:30:11,405
Yeah, he leaves

3896
01:30:09,363 --> 01:30:11,405
at 9:00 our time.

3897
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:13,992
9:00.

3898
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:13,992
So it's a five-hour flight,

3899
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:13,992
three-hour time difference,

3900
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:15,618
so he gets in at

3901
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,162
32:00?

3902
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:19,998
5:00.

3903
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:19,998
Be there at 5:00, Dylan.

3904
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,042
Right. How is Dad?

3905
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:23,835
Ah.

3906
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:26,588
He's lost more

3907
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:26,588
often than not now.

3908
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:29,383
But then he has

3909
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:29,383
these moments of real clarity.

3910
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:29,383
It's hit or miss.

3911
01:30:29,423 --> 01:30:30,466
Okay.

3912
01:30:29,423 --> 01:30:30,466
How's Jamie?

3913
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,930
That's over.

3914
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,930
Oh, Dylan!

3915
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,098
Okay, we're done.

3916
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,933
Don't be an idiot, please.

3917
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,394
tomorrow at the airport.

3918
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,394
Thank you, Annie.

3919
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,394
I'll pick up Dad

3920
01:30:40,434 --> 01:30:42,187
32:00 sharp.

3921
01:30:40,434 --> 01:30:42,187
I love you.

3922
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:47,609
JAMIE: I don't know

3923
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:47,609
what it is.

3924
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:50,028
to start looking for

3925
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:50,028
a replacement for him,

3926
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:50,028
I just can't get myself

3927
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,321
assuming that he leaves.

3928
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:52,906
Do you want some

3929
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:52,906
motherly love advice?

3930
01:30:53,447 --> 01:30:54,574
Not really.

3931
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:56,492
Oh, good, 'cause

3932
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:56,492
I don't know how to do that.

3933
01:30:56,534 --> 01:31:00,080
What I do know is that

3934
01:30:56,534 --> 01:31:00,080
it's no great goddamn secret

3935
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:02,832
you live in fear of

3936
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:02,832
repeating my mistakes.

3937
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:05,252
And you're not wrong,

3938
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:05,252
so learn from me.

3939
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:08,213
Do you know how many men

3940
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:08,213
in my life I thought

3941
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:08,213
were really perfect?

3942
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:09,589
Eighty.

3943
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:09,589
One.

3944
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,465
Eighty-one?

3945
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,465
One.

3946
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:14,094
Oh.

3947
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:14,094
It was your dad.

3948
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:14,094
Greatest man I ever met.

3949
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:15,762
Obviously. Look at you.

3950
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:19,266
How smart you are, how great,

3951
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:19,266
how funny, how driven.

3952
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:20,516
Your vaguely

3953
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:20,516
Middle Eastern beauty.

3954
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,852
Sure as hell

3955
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,852
didn't all come from me.

3956
01:31:23,686 --> 01:31:25,855
Okay, but, seriously, Mom,

3957
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,400
do you really not remember

3958
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,400
where my dad's from?

3959
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:29,985
Or is it like

3960
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:29,985
a coping mechanism?

3961
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:31,069
A little of both.

3962
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:32,362
(LAUGHING)

3963
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:32,362
Okay.

3964
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:34,072
But I'm pretty

3965
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:34,072
sure he's Eurasian.

3966
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:35,657
(LAUGHING)

3967
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,491
I mean, we all have

3968
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,491
our Prince Charming,

3969
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:39,661
you just gotta know

3970
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:39,661
him when you see him.

3971
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:42,164
Mom, it's Prince Charming.

3972
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:42,164
You should just know.

3973
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,832
Well, your Prince

3974
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,832
Charming isn't coming

3975
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:45,292
to rescue you in

3976
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:45,292
a horse and carriage.

3977
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:47,210
That's not who you want.

3978
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:50,964
I mean, you're looking

3979
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:50,964
for a man to be your partner.

3980
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:53,842
To take on the world with.

3981
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:56,136
You gotta update

3982
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:56,136
your fairy tale, baby.

3983
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:58,930
My Prince Charming?

3984
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,099
You.

3985
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:02,309
Mom.

3986
01:32:24,373 --> 01:32:25,539
Hey.

3987
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,167
A wheelchair.

3988
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,167
Like I'm an invalid.

3989
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,086
How was the flight?

3990
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,086
I'm hungry.

3991
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:31,796
You know they

3992
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:31,796
don't serve food

3993
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:31,796
in coach anymore?

3994
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,048
You'd think with

3995
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,048
these new planes,

3996
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:34,508
they practically

3997
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:34,508
fly themselves,

3998
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:36,801
they could get rid

3999
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:36,801
of a pilot and use his

4000
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:36,801
salary for a hot lunch.

4001
01:32:36,843 --> 01:32:37,969
I know, right?

4002
01:32:36,843 --> 01:32:37,969
Let's get you some food.

4003
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:39,846
God.

4006
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:42,140
is so advanced.

4007
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:43,475
Completely computerized.

4008
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:45,727
It's like

4009
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:45,727
playing a video game.

4010
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:45,727
Exactly.

4011
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:48,438
God. How long have

4012
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:48,438
we been waiting here?

4013
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:48,438
It's ridiculous.

4014
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,564
I'll be right back, okay?

4015
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:55,695
Excuse me.

4016
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:55,695
We've been waiting a while.

4017
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,447
Harper.

4018
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,447
Yeah, I got you.

4019
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,447
I got you.

4020
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,115
I have to seat people

4021
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,115
in the order they came.

4022
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:01,076
I totally understand that,

4023
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:01,076
but I'm with my dad

4024
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:03,203
and he's not in

4025
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:03,203
the best shape.

4026
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:03,203
Oh, I'm sorry.

4027
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:05,414
Is there no way we could,

4028
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:05,414
like, squeeze a table?

4029
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:07,623
No, I gotta go

4030
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:07,623
by the list. Sorry.

4031
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:12,712
Dad?

4032
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:20,762
Dad?

4033
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,597
Shit. Dad?

4034
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:37,737
You gonna join me?

4035
01:33:47,663 --> 01:33:49,207
Absolutely.

4036
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:55,797
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry,

4037
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:55,797
you cannot do this.

4038
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:58,007
Could I get a steak,

4039
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:58,007
medium, please?

4040
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,968
Sir, this is

4041
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,968
the Daily Grill.

4042
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,968
Make that two.

4043
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:10,644
Dede? Dede!

4044
01:34:19,653 --> 01:34:20,654
Dad.

4045
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,824
Dad.

(SIGHS)

4047
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:28,497
Who is Dede?

4048
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:32,666
Jesus. She's just a girl

4049
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:32,666
that I met in the Navy.

4050
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:35,128
Was...

4051
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:36,254
(CLEARS THROAT)

4052
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:39,132
She was the love of my life.

4053
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:41,675
Okay?

4054
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:44,678
Why didn't you tell

4055
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:44,678
me about her before?

4056
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:47,432
This is not something

4057
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:47,432
you discuss

4058
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:47,432
with your children.

4059
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:50,268
And besides,

4060
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:50,268
I have you and Annie.

4061
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:50,268
I have no regrets.

4062
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:51,353
So tell me now.

4063
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:55,148
She was the love of my life.

4064
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,732
And I was too

4065
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,732
stupid to realize it,

4066
01:34:56,774 --> 01:35:00,487
and I lost her

4067
01:34:56,774 --> 01:35:00,487
because of something

4068
01:34:56,774 --> 01:35:00,487
so dumb I don't even remember.

4069
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:02,364
And I never

4070
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:02,364
really got over her.

4071
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:05,825
one of the reasons

4072
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:05,825
your mom left.

4073
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:05,825
And I think that may be

4074
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:09,162
You know, my friends

4075
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:09,162
used to say

4076
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,997
that when Dede and I

4077
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,997
looked at each other,

4078
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:12,207
it was electric.

4079
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:13,958
And I let her go.

4080
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,544
I just let her go.

4081
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:19,797
Because I was too damn proud

4082
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:19,797
to tell her how

4083
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:19,797
I really felt about her.

4084
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,467
I'll tell you something

4085
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,467
that I wish I knew

4086
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,467
when I was your age.

4087
01:35:22,509 --> 01:35:24,386
And I know you've heard

4088
01:35:22,509 --> 01:35:24,386
a million times,

4089
01:35:22,509 --> 01:35:24,386
"life is short."

4090
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:28,223
But let me tell you something,

4091
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:28,223
what this is teaching me

4092
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:30,933
is that life is goddamn short

4093
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:30,933
and you can't

4094
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:30,933
waste a minute of it.

4095
01:35:33,687 --> 01:35:35,522
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4096
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:43,905
The girl I brought

4097
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:43,905
home to LA, Jamie?

4098
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:45,574
Yeah, what's

4099
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:45,574
going on with her?

4100
01:35:45,615 --> 01:35:47,158
I think I messed it up.

4101
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,035
Fix it.

4102
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,035
She won't talk to me.

4103
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,287
Maybe she'll listen.

4104
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,287
There's always a way.

4105
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:53,623
If you think

4106
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:53,623
there's even a chance

4107
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:55,749
that she could

4108
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:55,749
be it, you fix it.

4109
01:35:58,378 --> 01:35:59,962
Did Annie put you

4110
01:35:58,378 --> 01:35:59,962
up to this?

4111
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:00,880
Who's Annie?

4112
01:36:01,755 --> 01:36:03,007
I'm kidding.

4113
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,092
What, I can't joke

4114
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,092
about this?

4117
01:36:06,802 --> 01:36:07,761
I don't know

4118
01:36:06,802 --> 01:36:07,761
what else to do.

4119
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:11,391
Let's go.

4120
01:36:11,433 --> 01:36:13,560
You don't want to

4121
01:36:11,433 --> 01:36:13,560
finish your steak?

4122
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:14,936
We're eating in

4123
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:14,936
the goddamn airport.

4124
01:36:14,977 --> 01:36:16,812
I can leave the steak.

4125
01:36:14,977 --> 01:36:16,812
Come on.

4126
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,814
Yeah, hey,

4127
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,814
this is Dylan Harper

weeks ago at the...

4131
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:23,570
Right. Hey, can I ask you

4132
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:23,570
a huge favor?

4133
01:36:23,612 --> 01:36:24,904
Oh. I am so sorry, sir.

4134
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:26,197
It's my fault.

4135
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:27,990
You just scared me.

4136
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:27,990
No, no. My fault.

4137
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:27,990
You all right?

4138
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,534
Yeah, I'm good.

4139
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,534
Here, let me

4140
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,534
help you with that.

4141
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:30,744
Thanks, man.

4142
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:30,744
You're really nice.

Oh.

4149
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,332
You gotta be

4150
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,332
fucking kidding me.

4151
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:38,460
All right,

What's your

problem with me?

4156
01:36:39,628 --> 01:36:41,379
I saw you at

01:36:39,628 --> 01:36:41,379
that bar with Jamie.

4158
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:43,923
be with this

4159
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:43,923
How could such

4160
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:43,923
an awesome girl

4161
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:45,675
over this?

4162
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:48,886
I've been trying to

4163
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:48,886
take that little monkey

4164
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:48,886
to pound-town for years.

4165
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:50,930
you say hello.

4166
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:50,930
What?

4167
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:50,930
I'll tell her

4168
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:53,182
You missed a little.

4169
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:53,182
There you go.

4170
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,850
Dylan! I got a cab.

4171
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,850
Come on.

01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:56,478
I ever run into you again,

4173
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,896
I'll crush your earlobes

4174
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,896
and make soup

4175
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,896
stock out of them.

4176
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:00,982
You have

4177
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:00,982
a vivid imagination.

4178
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:00,982
I do!

4179
01:37:01,023 --> 01:37:02,400
I'm gonna get in

4180
01:37:01,023 --> 01:37:02,400
the cab now.

4181
01:37:02,442 --> 01:37:03,610
I'm gonna go make soup!

4182
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:05,236
What's the matter with her?

4183
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:05,236
I don't know.

4184
01:37:09,616 --> 01:37:12,868
God! I thought LA was bad.

4185
01:37:09,616 --> 01:37:12,868
This traffic is terrible.

4186
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,078
Is there another

4187
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,078
way into the city?

4188
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:26,924
DYLAN: I owe you

4189
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:26,924
big time, Tommy.

4190
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:31,887
You'll make it up to me.

4191
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:31,887
Actually, I was

4192
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:31,887
heading into town anyway.

4193
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:36,184
Tonight's the Butterfly Ball.

4194
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:36,184
Great place to pick up dudes.

4195
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:37,352
You okay, Dad?

4196
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:38,645
Are you kidding?

4197
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:41,855
1937 Chris-Craft?

4198
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:41,855
Couldn't get

4199
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:41,855
any better, buddy.

4200
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:42,856
Nice.

4201
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:47,696
Yeah. Hi,

4202
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:47,696
this is Dylan.

4203
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:47,696
We met at...

4204
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:50,532
Right.

4205
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:50,532
Can I ask you

4206
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:50,532
a huge favor?

4207
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:57,747
My number.

4208
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:57,747
Here's the remote.

4209
01:37:57,789 --> 01:37:59,415
My friend Dave

4210
01:37:57,789 --> 01:37:59,415
from across the hall,

4211
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,167
his oven broke, so

4212
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,167
he'll be using the kitchen.

4213
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:03,877
Your friend Dave is

4214
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:03,877
here using the kitchen

4215
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:03,877
or watching me?

4216
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:06,172
Go.

4217
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,965
Holy...

4218
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,965
What?

4219
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:10,051
"How to wear white

4220
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:10,051
pants to a cookout."

4221
01:38:10,092 --> 01:38:12,886
Did you scoop

4222
01:38:10,092 --> 01:38:12,886
the  Times on this?

4223
01:38:10,092 --> 01:38:12,886
I smell Pulitzer.

4224
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:14,930
All right, all right.

4225
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:16,140
Just say hello to

4226
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:16,140
her for me, will you?

4227
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:18,643
See you, Dad.

4228
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:20,562
Thanks, man.

4229
01:38:21,688 --> 01:38:23,189
Hi, Dave

4230
01:38:21,688 --> 01:38:23,189
from across the hall.

4231
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:27,861
(SLOWLY AND LOUDLY)

4232
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:27,861
Hi, Mr. Harper.

4233
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:27,861
How are you?

4234
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:30,446
And now we know

4235
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:30,446
why you're here.

4236
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:34,242
Mom, I'm over by

4237
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:34,242
the Lexington exit.

4238
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:34,242
Where are you?

4239
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:36,327
LORNA:  I'm standing right

4240
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:36,327
by the guy in the tie.

4241
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:38,246
There are

4242
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:38,246
a million guys

4243
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:38,246
in ties.

4244
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,289
So look for the guy

4245
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,289
I'm standing next to.

4246
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:43,125
Ugh. You never do what you

4247
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:43,125
say you're gonna do.

4248
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:43,125
When am I gonna learn?

4249
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,878
Just hang on, baby.

4250
01:38:44,918 --> 01:38:46,880
(JUMP BEGINS PLAYING

4251
01:38:44,918 --> 01:38:46,880
OVER THE PA)

4252
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:50,174
What?

4253
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,804
I don't think

4254
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,804
I'm gonna be able

4255
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,804
to make it after all.

4256
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:57,056
Something came up.

4257
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:57,056
Let's meet tomorrow.

4258
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:59,933
I'll be on the stairs.

4259
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:59,933
Right across from you.

4260
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:06,315
Oh, my God.

4261
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:07,692
Have a great night, baby.

4262
01:39:09,985 --> 01:39:11,945
(CLOSING TIME

4263
01:39:09,985 --> 01:39:11,945
BEGINS TO PLAY)

4264
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:20,288
(MOUTHING THE WORDS)

4265
01:39:27,169 --> 01:39:28,922
What is this?

4266
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:31,965
It's  Closing Time,

4267
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:31,965
by the band Semisonic!

4268
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:34,176
It's not Third Eye Blind.

4269
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:34,176
Can you believe that?

4270
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:37,221
No, no, no.

4271
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:37,221
Not the song. This.

4272
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:40,391
You said you wanted your life

4273
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:40,391
to be like a movie.

4274
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:43,645
Sorry I had to use

4275
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:43,645
the real Grand Central

4276
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:43,645
instead of the fake one.

4277
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:51,694
Listen, Jamie, I'm...

4278
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:53,987
I'm having

4279
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:53,987
trouble hearing you!

4280
01:39:54,029 --> 01:39:56,031
Yeah, I didn't

4281
01:39:54,029 --> 01:39:56,031
really think this through.

4282
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:58,326
I guess in the movies

4283
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:58,326
the guy pours his heart out

4284
01:39:58,367 --> 01:39:59,744
and they put

4285
01:39:58,367 --> 01:39:59,744
the music in later.

4286
01:39:59,786 --> 01:40:00,994
What?

4287
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:05,333
I messed up.

4288
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:09,002
I was scared.

4289
01:40:09,044 --> 01:40:10,630
Look at what happened

4290
01:40:09,044 --> 01:40:10,630
with my mom and my dad.

4291
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:11,673
Of course I was scared.

4292
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:14,007
So I ruined it.

4293
01:40:15,217 --> 01:40:17,261
Everything that

4294
01:40:15,217 --> 01:40:17,261
happens in the day,

4295
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:21,474
all I can think to myself is,

4296
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:21,474
"I can't wait to

4297
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:21,474
tell Jamie about this."

4298
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:25,227
When I see someone

4299
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:25,227
cursing, all I picture

4300
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:25,227
is you blinking.

4301
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:27,563
And when I hear

4302
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:27,563
a kid's been cured

4303
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:27,563
of cancer,

4304
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:30,023
I pray it's not

4305
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:30,023
by that douchebag,

4306
01:40:30,065 --> 01:40:33,068
tree-hugging fucking doctor

4307
01:40:30,065 --> 01:40:33,068
who ran out on you.

4308
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:35,196
I mean, cancer

4309
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:35,196
being cured is awesome,

4310
01:40:35,237 --> 01:40:37,239
but, you know,

4311
01:40:35,237 --> 01:40:37,239
I wish someone else did it.

4312
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:39,450
Come on.

4313
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:46,958
Hey, I miss you.

4314
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,002
Yeah, I miss you, too.

4315
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:51,212
But you're not wrong,

4316
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:51,212
I am damaged.

4317
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:53,756
So am I. Who isn't?

4318
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:55,675
That's what

4319
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:55,675
makes us so awesome.

4320
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:57,218
And our tattoos.

4321
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:57,218
Yeah.

4322
01:40:59,512 --> 01:41:01,014
Oh. No, no, no.

4323
01:41:01,054 --> 01:41:02,682
Oh, shut up.

4324
01:41:01,054 --> 01:41:02,682
It's not what you think.

4325
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:05,018
Jamie, will you be

4326
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:05,018
my best friend again?

4327
01:41:06,059 --> 01:41:07,311
That is so lame.

4328
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:08,187
Oh. I know.

4329
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:11,273
Prince Charming shit,

4330
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:11,273
though, right?

4331
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:11,273
That's some

4332
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:12,316
Get up.

4333
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:12,316
Okay.

4334
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:17,613
Look, I can live without

4335
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:17,613
ever having sex

4336
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:17,613
with you again.

4337
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:18,698
It'd be really hard.

4338
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,949
(LAUGHS)

4339
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:23,036
Hey, I want my

4340
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:23,036
best friend back,

4341
01:41:23,076 --> 01:41:24,871
because I'm

4342
01:41:23,076 --> 01:41:24,871
in love with her.

4343
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:26,998
Under one condition.

4344
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,081
Anything.

4345
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:31,210
Kiss me.

4346
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,422
In public?

4347
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,422
In front of

4348
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,422
all these people?

4349
01:41:34,463 --> 01:41:35,506
I did not ask you to...

4350
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:56,945
You can all go home now.

4351
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,327
Okay. So...

4352
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:09,665
What do we do now?

4353
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:10,499
Have our first date.

4354
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:12,125
Okay.

4355
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:18,173
Oh, my God!

4356
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:18,173
Did you get

4357
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:18,173
a horse and carriage?

4358
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:21,594
Yeah, that's not for you.

4359
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:24,722
Oh, thank God.

4360
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:24,722
Horses actually

4361
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:24,722
scare the shit out of me.

4362
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:26,099
Really?

4363
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:26,099
Yeah.

4364
01:42:26,139 --> 01:42:27,475
DYLAN: So, where are you from?

4365
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:28,643
Outside of Philly, actually.

4366
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:30,185
Interesting.

4367
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:32,271
I'm from LA,

4368
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:32,271
just moved to New York.

4369
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:33,940
Interesting.

4370
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:33,940
Didn't really ask,

4371
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:33,940
but go on.

4372
01:42:33,982 --> 01:42:37,568
What? I'm excited,

4373
01:42:33,982 --> 01:42:37,568
I'm on a first date. So...

4374
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,695
JAMIE: This isn't

4375
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,695
weird at all.

4376
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:40,905
We're okay.

4377
01:42:40,947 --> 01:42:42,031
Yeah. Thank you.

4378
01:42:44,366 --> 01:42:45,910
So...

4379
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:50,163
Yeah, fuck it.

4380
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:05,747
Roll credits,

4381
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:05,747
roll credits, roll credits.

4382
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:05,747
And here come the outtakes.

4383
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:09,084
Because if the actors had

4384
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:09,084
a good time making it,

4385
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:09,084
it must be good.

4386
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:11,544
You bet your ass, Jason.

4387
01:49:11,586 --> 01:49:13,047
Oh, my God,

4388
01:49:11,586 --> 01:49:13,047
I just called him Jason.

4389
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,256
(EVERYONE LAUGHING)

4390
01:49:14,298 --> 01:49:15,632
Look, the crew's laughing.

4391
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:16,758
Oh!

4392
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,511
They made me do it!

4393
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,511
They made me do it.

4394
01:49:18,551 --> 01:49:19,428
(EVERYONE LAUGHING

4395
01:49:18,551 --> 01:49:19,428
AND CHEERING)

4396
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:21,930
It's my favorite part.

4397
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:22,848
(GRUMBLING)
