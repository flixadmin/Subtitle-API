So, Caitlin was right.

296
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:08,499
Yes, all humans contain
small amounts of radiation

297
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,336
due to contact with cell phones,
microwaves, televisions, et cetera.

298
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,463
Our bodies are natural conductors.

299
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,882
I think our meta's been sucking up
all the radiation around him

300
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:18,300
and using it to power himself.

301
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,345
Which is why the X-ray machines at the
hospital failed the day of the rally.

302
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,515
So if we wanna find him, we got to look
for places without radiation.

303
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,559
All right, guys,
I don't want any of you here right now.

00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,366
You can't deny us that. Not anymore.

310
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,911
Got him. There's a three-block dead zone
near a hazardous waste reclamation plant.

311
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:48,247
It should be blooming with rads,
and right now it's at zero.

312
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,333
That's where you'll find
your Atom Smasher.

313
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
Huh.

314
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:59,425
Because he absorbs atomic power and he,
well, smashes.

315
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,051
Come here.

316
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,261
(LAUGHS)

317
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:05,597
-That's a great name. Welcome to the team.
-Thank you.

318
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,100
Great. Guys, thank you.
You can go now, all right?

319
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,605
Barry, you need to let Cisco and Stein
figure out a way to stop this guy.

320
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,441
No, I don't.

(SIGHS)

322
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:28,287
Barry left his comm system behind.
We can't talk to him. He's on his own.

323

324
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,762
Ah!

325
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,149
Well, this is a curveball.

326
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,402
I thought I was going to have to come
looking for you.

327
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,238
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.

328
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,616
-I'm only here to hurt you, buddy.
-Yeah?

329
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,160
Then why did you kill Albert Rothstein?
And why do you look like him?

330
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,289
-You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
-(LAUGHS) Try me.

331
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,417
I'm about to.

332
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,336
Is there really no way of knowing
what's going on in there?

333
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,004
I'm looking for the security cameras.

334
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,007
Booya!

335
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,480
(GRUNTING)

336
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,359
My turn.

(CHOKING)

338
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,989
Dad.

339
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,991
-Maybe I can make it there.
-No, you won't.

340
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,200
And what are you gonna do
when you get there?

341
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,952
-The Boot didn't work on him.
-Alarm.

342
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:53,288
-Believe me, we're all alarmed.
-No, the alarm system.

343
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,499
You've tapped into
the surveillance cameras, correct?

344
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,708
Correct.

345
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,170
Come on, feel the noise.

346
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,547
(GROANING)

347
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,635
He said you were some kind of big hero.

348
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,846
But you don't seem worthy of him
or this city.

349
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,222
(ALARM BLARING)

350
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:18,229
Professor Stein, you are a genius.

351
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,732
I believe
that's already been well established.

352
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,025

00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,586
No, thank you.

355
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,420
Iris says mac and cheese is your favorite.

356
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,339
I'm not hungry.

357
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,259
It's been six months, Barry.
You got to eat, son.

358
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,931
It's a good move,
being angry all the time.

359
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:54,349
I get it.

360
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,935
You miss your mom and dad, and you wanna
show them that you're strong.

361
00:23:57,268 --> 00:23:58,436
Being mad makes it easier.

362
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,108
Tougher thing to do
would be to let yourself feel.

363
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,738
<i>It's okay to be sad.
You can be sad, Barry.</i>

364
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,117
Your parents will understand
if you're not strong all the time.

365
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,621
That is why I'm here.

366
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,753
It's okay, son. I got you.

367
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,723
(BEEPING)

368
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:47,152
You're good, I got you.

369
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,574
Where is everyone?

370
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,161
I figured you wouldn't want an audience
when you came to.

371
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,996
(SCOFFS)

372
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,665
Yeah, thanks.

373
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,417
Iris is right.

374
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,420
We're not gonna do this anymore.

375
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,631
For the last six months,
I've given you your space

376
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,801
to work all this out, come back to us.

377
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,847
But today proved that
you'd rather just get yourself killed.

378
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,098
(LAUGHS)

379
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,475
It's better than
getting my friends killed.

380
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,188
You want me to tell you
that it wasn't your fault?

381
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,025
I can't. It was. Guess what?

382
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,779
You weren't the only person
making decisions that day.

383
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,656
All of the rest of us were there, too.

384
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,366
Eddie and Ronnie...

385
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:40,371
They chose to help you stop Wells,
and stop that...

386
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,541
-Singularity.
-Singularity thing.

387
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,294
It's on all of us, Barry.

388
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,548
So stop with this
hogging all the blame and regret.

389
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,218
We got to live with it.

390
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,220
Move on.

391
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,807
What do I do now?

392
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,394
Well, I know that you've been

393
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,397
rebuilding Central City at night.

394
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,567
That's just bricks and paint.

395
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,238
Maybe you should start trying to rebuild

396
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,199
things that really matter.

397
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,841
What are you doing here?

00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,219
Sorry, I should've called or something.

399
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:39,014
I just... I wanted to see you.

400

It's been a while.

401
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:47,063
Yeah, Cisco said that he saw you
at the Flash Day celebration.

402
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,398
I was surprised.

403
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:54,112
You better than anyone know that
I wasn't the hero that day.

404
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,115
-Of course you were.
-No.

I don't blame you for Ronnie's death.
I blame myself.

he asked me to leave Central City

415
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,441
and go somewhere
that we could have a normal life.

416
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,986
And I said no.

417

I couldn't leave S.T.A.R. Labs,
Dr. Wells, you.

418
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,832
If I had gone with him,
Ronnie would still be alive.

419
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:52,337
Being at S.T.A.R. Labs
just made think of that every single day.

-Here.

Wells had some kind of, um, living will.

-And you haven't watched it yet?
-No.

No, I've been too afraid.

No, it did not.

I clearly can't stop him by myself.
So how are we gonna beat him?

Well, ever since
I was shown a drained radiation tag,

to stop thinking about, thank you, Cisco.
