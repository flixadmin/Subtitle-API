Why would I go with you?

793
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:11,210
Because, unfortunately,

794
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,578
I need you,

795
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:16,684

my entire world needs you.

coming right up!

On your left, baby girl.

And bonus, he's actually
wearing a costume

836
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,906
like he's not embarrassed to be

837
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:47,306
in a superhero movie for once.

838
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,976
I don't understand.

839
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,210
You said my universe is dying

840
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:52,678
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

841
00:32:52,712 --> 00:32:55,348
- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

842
00:32:55,381 --> 00:32:59,786
You actually think you can
replace an Anchor Being

843
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,788
with this?

844
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:04,390
I wouldn't have accepted
any other Wolverine, BT dubs.

845
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:06,424
But you have outdone yourself

846
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,662
and brought me
the worst Wolverine!

847
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,930
What do you mean, the worst one?

848
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:11,431
Mr. Wilson.

849
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:15,434
This Wolverine let down
his entire world.

850
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:17,838
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

851
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,107
And what he did,

00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,506

beyond forgiveness.

Okay.

855
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:29,415
How do I... How do I make
this right? I'll do anything.

856
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:32,417
I gave you
a chance at greatness.

857
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:35,054
Because my superiors
deemed you "special."

858
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:36,556
Clearly not special
in a good way.

859
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:37,624
Apparently you have some

860
00:33:37,658 --> 00:33:39,827
important future purpose
to serve.

861
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,961
With Thor. He holds me.

862
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:42,795
But I did my duty.

863
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,865
I gave you the opportunity
to be somebody.

864
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,867
And instead of
accepting my offering

865
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,368
with humility and gratitude,
you broke my nose.

866

[sighs] It looks great.

867
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:52,405
And you decimated
dozens of my men

868
00:33:52,438 --> 00:33:54,041
with the exhumed corpse
of a hero.

869
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:56,409
Dishonoring not only
his remains but his memory.

870
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:57,777
What are you, the Internet?

871
00:33:57,811 --> 00:34:00,047

The humane thing to do

is to make it quick.

876

of vaporizing my universe

877

making you peckish?

I wanna talk to your boss.

I want you to get him
on the phone

01:10:28,699 --> 01:10:30,634
what, two days ago?

1738
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:32,970
[Deadpool] Ugh. That's so sad.

1739
01:10:33,003 --> 01:10:35,739
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1740
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:36,908
[Wolverine chuckles]

1741
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:39,177
Look, there's...
there's strength in numbers.

1742
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,311
All right? Us...

1743
01:10:40,345 --> 01:10:41,677
plus, you guys.
We can put Cassandra

1744
01:10:41,711 --> 01:10:43,982
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1745
01:10:44,015 --> 01:10:45,682
I know what it means
to feel self-doubt.

1746
01:10:45,716 --> 01:10:47,252
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1747
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,520
[Deadpool] Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1748
01:10:49,552 --> 01:10:51,089
It's like you're holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1749
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:52,456
[Deadpool] You guys
may not have been able

1750
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:54,224
to save your universes.

1751
01:10:54,258 --> 01:10:56,429
But you can avenge them.

1752
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:57,761
It's what Johnny
would have wanted.

1753
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:00,831
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1754
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:02,866
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

1755
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,868
Dickhead here talked him
into a team-up,

1756
01:11:04,902 --> 01:11:07,505
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1757
01:11:07,539 --> 01:11:08,840
[Deadpool] No, no, no.
We don't know that.

1758
01:11:08,873 --> 01:11:11,076
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1759
01:11:11,109 --> 01:11:13,878
If he survived that,
he is prayin' for death.

1760
01:11:13,912 --> 01:11:15,547
[Deadpool] Thank you,
Doctor Wolverine!

1761
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:17,748
- Spill it!
- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1762
01:11:17,781 --> 01:11:18,950
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1763
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,651
[Deadpool] Okay. Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

1764
01:11:21,118 --> 01:11:21,952
Look.

1765
01:11:21,985 --> 01:11:24,421
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1766
01:11:24,455 --> 01:11:26,223
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1767
01:11:26,256 --> 01:11:28,393
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1768
01:11:28,426 --> 01:11:31,362
while the soil greedily drank
his blood. It was horrible.

1769
01:11:31,396 --> 01:11:33,163
He was like a brother to me.

1770
01:11:33,197 --> 01:11:36,333
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1771
01:11:36,366 --> 01:11:37,402
- [laughs]
- Look, maybe you couldn't

1772
01:11:37,435 --> 01:11:38,870
save your worlds, but...

1773
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:41,638
but Jesus Christ,
you can save mine!

1774
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:44,141
I don't give a shit
about your world, but

1775
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:47,113
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1776
01:11:47,145 --> 01:11:49,047
we can get back in
and take her down.

1777
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,050
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, <i>Chere.</i>

1778
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:54,052
[Deadpool] If we can block
her psychic powers,

1779
01:11:54,085 --> 01:11:55,953
we can get a leg up.
I know it.

1780
01:11:55,986 --> 01:11:58,022
Now, I know Magneto's dead.

1781
01:11:58,056 --> 01:12:00,657
But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1782
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,726
- around here somewhere...
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1783
01:12:02,759 --> 01:12:03,927
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1784
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:05,929
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- She don't play.

1785
01:12:05,963 --> 01:12:07,397
She knows that helmet
was the only way

1786
01:12:07,431 --> 01:12:09,066
to protect anyone
from her powers.

1787
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,968
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut's,

1788
01:12:11,002 --> 01:12:12,237
but he works for Cassandra.

1789
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:13,769
[Deadpool] Juggernaut's
helmet. That's it.

1790
01:12:13,803 --> 01:12:15,472
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off

1791
01:12:15,506 --> 01:12:16,907
without that dome
gonna come off wit'it.

1792
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,209
[Deadpool] I'm so sorry,
beautiful.

1793
01:12:18,243 --> 01:12:19,110
I want this to be gentle.

1794
01:12:19,144 --> 01:12:21,411
Who is your dialect coach?
The Minions?

1795
01:12:21,445 --> 01:12:24,714
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1796
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:28,887
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1797
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:31,955
Let's face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

1798
01:12:31,989 --> 01:12:33,789
Or never learned about us.

1799
01:12:33,824 --> 01:12:35,259
The heroes we were.

1800
01:12:35,292 --> 01:12:36,593
Lives we saved.

1801
01:12:36,627 --> 01:12:37,995
Or wanted to save.

1802
01:12:38,028 --> 01:12:40,064
Maybe these two are our chance.

1803
01:12:40,098 --> 01:12:41,398
[gurgling]

1804
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:43,167
To be remembered.

1805
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,268
The way we deserve.

1806
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:46,471
[Deadpool] Yes.

1807
01:12:46,504 --> 01:12:48,305
An ending.

1808
01:12:48,338 --> 01:12:49,541
- Legacy.
- [Deadpool] Yes!

1809
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,041
Yes! Let this man cook.

1810
01:12:51,074 --> 01:12:52,577
This is what I'm talking about.

1811
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:54,578
Big slow-motion fights,
sad music.

1812
01:12:54,611 --> 01:12:55,812
Everybody working together.

1813
01:12:55,846 --> 01:12:57,680
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1814
01:12:57,713 --> 01:12:59,851
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1815
01:12:59,884 --> 01:13:01,152
[Deadpool] Yes!
Gambit?

1816
01:13:01,186 --> 01:13:02,120
I ain't know my daddy,

1817
01:13:02,153 --> 01:13:04,121
but I'm sure I shot out
of his dick ready.

1818
01:13:04,154 --> 01:13:06,056
[Deadpool] Jesus Christ,
that is graphic.

1819
01:13:06,089 --> 01:13:08,025
Yeah. He was layin' them
buttery nuts all up in my mama

1820
01:13:08,058 --> 01:13:10,061
and I shot out there
and I said, "What's up, Doc?"

1821
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,530
[Deadpool laughs]
Johnny must have loved you.

1822
01:13:12,564 --> 01:13:14,831
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1823
01:13:14,865 --> 01:13:16,100
The name's Laura.

1824
01:13:16,134 --> 01:13:18,936
- Let's fucking go.
- [Deadpool] Let's fucking go!

1825
01:13:18,969 --> 01:13:20,205
It's on like chicken and corn.

1826
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:21,737
- [Deadpool] Yeah!
- We're doing this.

1827
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:22,840
You're all fuckin' dead.

1828
01:13:22,874 --> 01:13:25,209
[Deadpool] My God!
Read the room.

1829

[exhales]

1831
01:13:36,053 --> 01:13:39,189
Hey, hey. I'm not lookin'
for company. Get out of here.

1832
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:42,860
You remind me of him.

1833
01:13:42,894 --> 01:13:44,728
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1834
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:46,930
- Sounds like a great guy...
- Wasn't finished.

1835
01:13:48,731 --> 01:13:50,335
Showed up when
it mattered the most.

1836
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:54,238
Couldn't help it.

[sighs]

1838

You might not know it, but...

1839
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,246
you're a good man, Logan.

1840
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:02,280
[chuckles]

1841
01:14:03,281 --> 01:14:04,949
You might not know it,
but apparently,

1842
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:06,383
I'm the worst Logan.

1843
01:14:08,218 --> 01:14:10,121
I got to have a life
because of you.

1844
01:14:13,024 --> 01:14:14,758
I got to grow up because of you.

1845
01:14:16,759 --> 01:14:18,328
A lot of kids did.

1846
01:14:18,362 --> 01:14:20,498
A lot of kids didn't grow up
because of me.

1847
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:24,302
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1848
01:14:25,636 --> 01:14:27,704
That suit says different.

1849
01:14:27,738 --> 01:14:29,873
- Yeah. Do you like it?
- Mm.

1850
01:14:31,743 --> 01:14:33,443
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1851
01:14:35,713 --> 01:14:38,316
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1852
01:14:40,384 --> 01:14:42,420
All of them.

1853
01:14:42,453 --> 01:14:46,190
They wanted me to be part
of the team, but I wouldn't.

1854
01:14:46,224 --> 01:14:49,526
Told 'em they all look
fucking ridiculous. I mean...

1855
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:54,131
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1856
01:14:59,802 --> 01:15:01,839
And then one day,
while I was off on my own,

1857
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,140
the humans came...

1858
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,143
and went mutant hunting.

1859
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:07,577
I can guess the rest.

1860
01:15:07,611 --> 01:15:08,812
No, no, let me...

1861
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:11,248
Let me say it. I...

1862
01:15:13,851 --> 01:15:15,053
I need to say it.

1863
01:15:17,522 --> 01:15:20,190
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar,

1864
01:15:20,223 --> 01:15:21,525
it was too late.

1865
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:27,030
They were dead. Every...

[♪ mournful music playing]

This suit's all I got to
remind me of who they were.

1868
01:15:38,275 --> 01:15:39,309
And what I did.

1869

[sniffles]

1870
01:15:52,289 --> 01:15:54,092
We're headed to Cassandra's
at sunup.

1871
01:15:54,892 --> 01:15:56,928
Have fun. Not my fight.

1872
01:16:00,163 --> 01:16:01,898
We won't pull this off
without you.

1873

Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

1874
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:16,613
You were always the wrong guy.

Alioth didn't get them.
[sniffs]

1879

Cassandra wanted to
play with them herself first.

- Did they find the others?
- No.

Good. All right. Phew.

- Oh, very cute.

Well done, Pyro.

- Relax.

If they come after Nova,
she'll handle it.

1887

Cassandra is
a lunatic wild card.

Why do you think we put her
there in the first place?

Thank God she's never chosen
to leave The Void.
