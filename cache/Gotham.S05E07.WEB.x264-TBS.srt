1
00:00:00,921 --> 00:00:03,629
<i>- Previously on</i> Gotham...
- You're the brother I never had.

2
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:05,861
We will create a legacy in this city.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,525
<i>Gotham falls,</i>

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,819
<i>we rise.</i>

5
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:09,979
Together.

6
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:11,306
<i>Poor Jim.</i>

7
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:12,466
All alone again.

8
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,737
- I told you to leave.
- I heard you.

9
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:17,065
<i>So many things I wish I could change.</i>

10
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:18,233
Things I've done.

11
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:19,592
We're here now.

12
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:22,020
We'll try to put the pieces
back together again.

13
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:25,007
Jim, I'm pregnant.

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,608
- This isn't you.
- We're not the same.

15
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,644
<i>That night that your parents
were murdered,</i>

16
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:32,814
<i>I didn't do anything,
because I didn't care.</i>

17
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:35,216
Everyone, let's dig a little deeper.

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,819
'Cause that's the only way
you're all making it out

19
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:39,120
of this hole.

20
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:42,023
<i>Deep enough?</i>

21
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:43,791
You're leaving Gotham.

22
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,260
<i>There's nothing left
for me here anymore.</i>

23
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:46,712
<i>I've done all I can.</i>

24
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:48,029
I want in.

25
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,234
<i>I love family reunions.</i>

26
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,087
Don't you?

27
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:04,322
Go. Go, go.

28
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,596
- Which way?
- Wait.

29
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:49,023

30
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,986
General,

31
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,065
you were the ones who let Walker operate

32
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:55,807
right under your noses.

33
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,752
Now you're telling me
she evaded capture?

34
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:59,755
<i>I understand your frustration.</i>

35
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,356
Have you at least determined
why she did what she did?

36
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,093
<i>Not yet.</i>

37
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:05,828
Look, bottom line,

38
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:08,050
Walker and Dorrance
are out of the picture.

39
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:10,425
What else is standing in the way
of reunification?

40
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,739
<i>Nothing.</i>

41
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,203
<i>I'm recommending we begin
the process immediately.</i>

42
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:17,470
There have been a lot of
promises from across the river.

43
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:19,945
<i>But unlike Walker, or whoever she is,</i>

44
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,797
<i>I have the authority to take action.</i>

45
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:24,697
<i>Unless something happens
to destabilize Gotham again,</i>

46
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:26,856
<i>this nightmare is about to end.</i>

47
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,285
- Think he's for real?
- I'll believe it when it happens.

48
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,321
I take it your search party
didn't find Alfred.

49
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,022
Neither hide nor hair.

50
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,224
Pennyworth vanished five days ago.

51
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,391
It ain't looking good.

52
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,060
How's Bruce?

53
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:41,763
He's been pulling double shifts
on the search parties.

54
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:44,599
Kid's dead on his feet.

55
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,633
I want to search this area next.

56
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:52,141
There are whole blocks
of abandoned buildings.

57
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,939
- I'll get a squad right on it.
- Just give me five minutes.

58
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:55,309
- I'll be ready.
- No.

59
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,492
You're not going out.

60
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:58,279
- No, Jim...
- You need your rest.

61
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:00,249
I'm not cutting you out,
but I need you sharp,

62
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,862
not a liability.

63
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:08,190
I just don't understand
what could have happened.

64
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,058
Neither do I.

65
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,459
But I know that Alfred Pennyworth

66
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:13,158
can take care of himself.

67
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:16,591
I'll send for you if I hear anything.

68
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:25,940
- Kid's tough.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:28,443
In other good-ish news, Harper radioed.

70
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:29,788
Her squad found something.

71
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:31,382
What?

72
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:34,108
It's weird.

73
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:37,352
Four men.

74
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,954
Looks like they breathed in
some sort of chemical agent.

75
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,356
I'm thinking airborne.

76
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,492
And the Z's on their bodies?

77
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,293
Carved into them before time of death.

78
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,530
Check out the mustache.

79
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:51,762
Fake.

80
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,732
Seems like they escaped from here.

81
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:57,873
A film set?

82
00:03:57,912 --> 00:03:59,380
I said it was weird.

83
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:02,310
Zs on their chests.

84
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:04,303
Think it could be Zsasz?

85
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:07,248
Chemicals aren't really his MO.

86
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:09,984
Plus, I never figured Zsasz
for much of a cinephile.

87
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:12,588
But whoever it is, if they
have more of these chemicals

88
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,843
and the will to use them...

89
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:15,269
It's bye-bye, reunification.

90
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:19,320
Got to stop him before news
reaches the mainland.

91
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,164
The Chessmen.

92
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:24,923
That's a gang that operates
out of the Narrows.

93
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:27,135
What the hell is a Narrows gang
doing way up here?

94
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,915
I think we both know someone we can ask.

95
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:02,345
_

96
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:25,955
Can you check on the fever in Bed 12?

97
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,180
What's up, Doc?

98
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:29,558
Heard you were working here.
Interesting.

99
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,192
It's what I do, help people.

100
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,547
Speaking of which, I've got patients.

101
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:36,130
Oh, you wouldn't kick
Jim's baby mama to the curb,

102
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:38,426
- now, would you?
- Whatever happened between you

103
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,137
and Jim, it's none of my concern.

104
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:41,236
So if you're here to gloat...

105
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,536
I'm here for medical assistance.

106
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:44,746
For my little nugget.

107
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,475
What do you say?

108
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:47,642
Be my O.B.?

109
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,011
You can't be serious.

110
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:50,145
I know we've had our differences.

111
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,581
You tried to kill me, Barbara.

112
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:53,749
Twice.

113
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:56,209
That was years ago.

114
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:57,552
There are other doctors here.

115
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,686
Not as good as you.

116
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,054
Look,

117
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,189
whatever you think of me, my child

118
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,059
is innocent, and I want the best for it.

119
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,161
And in this place, that means you.

120
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,689
Does Jim know you're here?

121
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:12,401
This is none of his business.

122
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:13,440
Lee?

123
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,516
Jim.

124
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,309
- Barbara.
- You're interrupting.

125
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,477
Doctor-patient. Blow.

126
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:25,873
I'm sorry, you're her doctor?

127
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:27,282
No. I don't know.

128
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,684
Maybe. What are you doing here?

129
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,620
Some bodies turned up.

130
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:33,355
They might have a Narrows connection.

131
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:34,689
I wouldn't have come, but...

132
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,725
It's important. Right.

133
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:40,581
You two need to talk. I'll be outside.

134
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,464
- Uh, I'd rather not.
- If you want me to be your doctor,

135
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,600
you will talk to the baby's... father.

136
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:48,545
Your first appointment is next
week. The nurse will give you

137
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,953
all your vitamins when you leave.

138
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:51,270
Deal?

139
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,282
Is she really
the only one you could find?

140
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:03,318
She's the best doctor in
this hellhole of a city.

141
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,852
Not everything is about Jim Gordon.

142
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:06,102
Pretty sure this one is.

143
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,725
Because we slept together. Yeah.

144
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,659
I only told you because I felt
you had a right to know.

145
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,093
But your involvement in this ended

146
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:13,983
the moment you put your pants back on.

147
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,633
What?

148
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:21,602
You don't think I'm fit to be a mother?

149
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:23,371
What do you think?

150
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:26,556
Barbara.

151
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,254
Who are you?

152
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:28,537
Well, look who decided to join us.

153
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,817
Hello, champ.

154
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,577
Master Bruce!

155
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,878
Alfred, how did you...

156
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,445
Look at the state of you.

157
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,785
What have I told you about
rolling around in the muck?

158
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:44,283
Alfred, what's going on?

159
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:45,386
Who are these people?

160
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,761
Whatever do you mean, Bruce?

161
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,144
We're your parents.

162
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,328
Right. Well, let's get you spruced up.

163
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:54,696
After all,

164
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,605
we have a guest.

165
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,311
Welcome home, Bruce.

166
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:11,398
Jeremiah. You're alive.

167
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,859
Well, you didn't think Selina

168
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,962
could kill me so easily, did you?

169
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:21,181
I just had to put you off my scent

170
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:24,048
until I could finalize my... project.

171
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:26,602
Manners, Master Bruce.

172
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:28,205
Let's not be rude to our guest.

173
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:31,075
Especially when I come bearing gifts.

174
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:34,527
Oh, Mr. Jeremiah. A cake.

175
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,024
How exceedingly kind of you.

176
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,485
Is it Italian meringue?

177
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:40,420
Sure.

178
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:41,588
Oh.

179
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:43,284
Now, now, Bruce, you come

180
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,178
any closer and I blow up Wayne Manor,

181
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,745
with all of us inside of it.

182
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,835
I have a dozen more of these, uh,

183
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,185
Italian meringues sprinkled
all throughout the house.

184
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,688
What did you do to Alfred?

185
00:10:56,343 --> 00:10:58,170
And who are these people?

186
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:00,193
Ah, glad you asked. Mm, come.

187
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,394
Come, come.

188
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,137
Mommy and Daddy dearest

189
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,380
were just an innocent couple
I kidnapped based on...

190
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:13,066
bone structure and, um...

191
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,207
build.

192
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:20,418
Just a touch of
plastic surgery, and voilà...

193
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,582
Waynes.

194
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,685
Alfred I nabbed in the Green Zone.

195
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,421
They're hypnotized.

196
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:30,295
Well, I'm afraid there was no room

197
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,909
for improv in our script.

198
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,580
Today is a...

199
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,362
<i>very</i> important day, Bruce.

200
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,033
Just look at the way they're dressed.

201
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:45,238
It's the night my parents were killed.

202
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,313
And I'm giving you the chance

203
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:50,322
to experience it all over again.

204
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:53,579
Why?

205
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,478
Isn't it obvious?

206
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,353
Bruce...

207
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,588
this...

208
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:06,778
this was the most important day
of your life.

209
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:11,138
And I didn't get to be a part of it.

210
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,833
We need to rectify that.

211
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,336
Alfred. It's time for dinner.

212
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:20,805
Chop-chop.
We're on a very tight schedule.

213
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:22,774
Of course, Mr. Jeremiah.

214
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,780
That's zero for three.

215
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:45,814
Yes.

216
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:47,921
It seems the government
was quite thorough

217
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,273
- when they mined the river.
- You didn't have a plan

218
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,934
to get off this rock<i> before</i>
you stole everyone's crap?

219
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,795
I was working on a plan.

220
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,797
The river is mined.

221
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,834
Everything that flies out
gets blown from... the...

222
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,189
- sky.
- What?

223
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:07,665
Jeremiah was digging a
tunnel under the river.

224
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:09,764
A tunnel?

225
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,944
Really?

226
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:14,460
Do you have any better ideas?

227
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:19,852
Didn't think so.

228
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:22,288
It's in the Dark Zone.

229
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:24,423
We should wait until
night to check it out.

230
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:27,072
Well, I was running out
of guinea pigs anyway.

231
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:32,766
Oh, look! He's swimming to shore.

232
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,933
Are you sure you
should be out in the Narrows alone?

233
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,503
When the bridges fell, this
place descended into chaos.

234
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:47,363
Figure our best bet of
getting out in one piece is

235
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:48,466
to keep a low profile.

236
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,252
So all the work I did to make
the Narrows better

237
00:13:50,277 --> 00:13:52,016
was for nothing.

238
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:56,080
It's the Leopards.
Rivals of the Chessmen.

239
00:14:00,678 --> 00:14:02,240
About this Barbara thing...

240
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:03,545
Uh, Jim, just don't.

241
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:06,614
No, it's important to me
that you understand.

242
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:10,786
Okay. So, what are you gonna do?

243
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,692
I don't know, but it's my child, too.

244
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,566
Barbara seems to have a
difference of opinion.

245
00:14:20,763 --> 00:14:22,398
But hey, people change.

246
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:24,439
You don't know her like I do.

247
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,568
You can say that again.

248
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:29,687
Look.

249
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,541
We're clear.

250
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,225
The Chessmen moved around.

251
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,078
They used these as signals
for their members.

252
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:38,947
The rook's a compass needle.

253
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:40,852
North-northeast. Let's go.

254
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,128
Hmm.

255
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:59,744
Alfred told me such great tidbits

256
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,400
about your childhood.

257
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:03,639
How you used to eat here,

258
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:06,609
in the kitchen, when it was
just you and the family.

259
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:08,827
My, how...

260
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,327
homey and intimate.

261
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,271
Grilled cheese and Branston
pickle sandwich, Mr. Jeremiah.

262
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:18,827
Master Bruce's favorite.

263
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,991
My influence,
though Thomas did add a dash

264
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:24,733
of aioli for extra flair.

265
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,730
Oh. Come on, Bruce.

266
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:35,685
That's a weird favorite
food for a 12-year-old.

267
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,106
I'm playing your game.

268
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:41,197
Now let Alfred and these people go.

269
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:42,924
They're innocent.

270
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,113
I'm sorry, Bruce, it's just...

271
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:47,930
it's very important to me that I get

272
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:51,351
every detail exactly right.

273
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:52,813
Speaking of which...

274
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:54,579
the final touch.

275
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:08,557
What was it like...

276
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,166
losing your parents that night?

277
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:17,244
I lost my family, too, Bruce.

278
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,731
The wound still hasn't healed.

279
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:23,496
I... think about it often.

280
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,512
None of this is real.

281
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:30,459
You're trying to manipulate me.

282
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,486
It will never be real.

283
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:40,400
But you are thinking about that night.

284
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:42,839
That's all I need.

285
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:46,231
I just want to be connected to you.

286
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,365
I offered for you to be my best friend!

287
00:16:55,478 --> 00:16:58,044
But I've realized if we...

288
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,497
can't be friends...

289
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,760
then we<i> can</i> be connected in other ways.

290
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,917
How?

291
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,836
You'll see.

292
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:17,205
In time.

293
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:25,847
Hmm.

294
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:30,364
I'm sorry to cut tonight short...

295
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:32,223
but...

296
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,669
your parents and I have
a very important date...

297
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:35,738
Jeremiah.

298
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,274
- ...with destiny.
- Jeremiah!

299
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:41,170
You might want to find your
faithful butler and leave.

300
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,031
Quickly.

301
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,674
Alfred!

302
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:00,683
The signs lead this way.

303
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,584
Look at the smoke.

304
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:05,140
Someone restarted production.

305
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:26,097
My God, Jim...

306
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:28,744
look at all of this.

307
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:30,313
Come on.

308
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:37,604
Who's in charge here?

309
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:39,151
Tick tock, the chemical stock,

310
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:41,289
shall give our Gotham an aftershock.

311
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:43,465
Tick tock, the chemical stock,

312
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,293
shall give our Gotham an aftershock.

313
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,395
Tick tock, the chemical stock...

314
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:49,632
...shall give our Gotham an aftershock.

315
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:50,933
They've been hypnotized.

316
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:52,141
Tetch.

317
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,083
Tick tock, the chemical stock

318
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:58,021
shall give our Gotham an aftershock.

319
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,909
My, my, what a thrill.

320
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,745
Jim Gordon...

321
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:05,187
and the woman he told me to kill.

322
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,882
Brings back memories.

323
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:09,723
That tea party, so long ago.

324
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:13,388
But now, to order these men
to attack my foe!

325
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,990
All for one, and one for all!

326
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:20,257
Ain't this a grand old ball!

327
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,435
Yoo-hoo!

328
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:29,071
Jim!

329
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:30,277
Ain't this...

330
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,826
some... game!

331
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:40,784
Give it to me again?

332
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,190
Penguin has been stealing

333
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,184
everything in the city
that's not nailed down,

334
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,230
and now he needs a way
of getting it off the island.

335
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,889
Hmm. And you're helping him?

336
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,533
Well, that's what he thinks.

337
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:55,490
Barbara, Tabitha was my friend, too.

338
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,985
If anything, I want to gut the twerp...

339
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,900
- and take his loot.
- Except you don't actually have

340
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,343
- a way out of Gotham.
- I'll find one tonight.

341
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,474
I'll still need your help
moving the stuff.

342
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:07,179
We can get out of here together.

343
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,209
Away from Jim Gordon.

344
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,911
Rich as Midas.

345
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:15,013
Penguin dead in a ditch.

346
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:18,116
Well, aren't we just
two single ladies and a baby

347
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,733
about to kill our sworn enemy together.

348
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:23,154
What?

349
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,291
It's just you're pregnant.

350
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,024
Don't even start.

351
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,663
Alfred!

352
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,266
Alfred!

353
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:38,540
Alfred. We need to get out of here.

354
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:40,651
Ah, Master Bruce. I was
just taking a quiet moment

355
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:42,378
- to tidy up.
- We need to go.

356
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:44,450
- The bombs.
- What bombs?

357
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:46,251
These bombs.

358
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:49,355
No need for roughhousing, sir.

359
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:53,421
There has to be a way.

360
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,101
Alfred, you'd do anything
to protect me, right?

361
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:59,138
- Absolutely, sir.
- There's a gas leak. In the kitchen.

362
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:01,045
It's only a matter of time
before this whole place goes up.

363
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,268
A gas leak? Where are your parents?

364
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,069
- Where's our guest?
- I've already warned them.

365
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:07,256
I know a way out. Come on!

366
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:38,351
Alfred!

367
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:41,171
Alfred.

368
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:45,460
Oh, bloody hell.

369
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:47,412
Don't move.

370
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:48,908
Do you, uh...?

371
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:52,057
Oh, yeah, I remember everything.

372
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,285
Clear as day.

373
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:55,463
And let me tell you, if ever I see

374
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:58,144
that Jervis Tetch character
again I'll stick that watch

375
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:01,848
so far up his... his nose.

376
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:04,457
How about you?

377
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,561
You all right?

378
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:09,038
Yeah, I'm all right.

379
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:10,843
But the manor...

380
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:14,148
Don't you worry about that now, son.

381
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:16,441
Come on. Help me up.

382
00:22:18,543 --> 00:22:20,179
Oh, your leg's hurt.

383
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:22,663
Yes, but it's not broken.

384
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,466
I thought I lost you.

385
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:38,267
Me?

386
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:41,707
Never, Master Bruce.

387
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,973
Go on.

388
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:49,275
You know where he's gonna be at.

389
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,662
Go.

390
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,791
If you're here,

391
00:23:05,824 --> 00:23:08,034
Jeremiah must still be alive.

392
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:12,162
And if you're here, I'm guessing
you found our test subjects,

393
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:15,341
all boiled and bubbled.

394
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,037
What's he planning?

395
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,365
Shh. It's a surprise, don't you know?

396
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,845
A real killer.

397
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,364
Shall I hypnotize our friends here,

398
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,118
and have them slit each other's necks?

399
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:29,646
Nix.

400
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:31,695
Better check with the boss.

401
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,487
He might have other ideas.

402
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:40,990
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

403
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:43,096
Don't be. I knew what
I was getting myself into.

404
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,103
I know, but, Lee...

405
00:23:45,128 --> 00:23:47,929
Jim, whatever you want to tell me,

406
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:50,118
save it till we're out of here.

407
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,266
Fair enough.

408
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,681
We need to find out
what Valeska's planning.

409
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:56,505
Hey, Tetch.

410
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,260
You know, it's funny.

411
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:02,969
I never figured you for
Jeremiah's errand boy.

412
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,112
Oh, Captain. No errands do I run.

413
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:09,121
This is simply a way
for me to have some fun.

414
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:11,620
Tell yourself that.

415
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,932
What are you when you would take away

416
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:16,998
your games and your rhymes?

417
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,547
Nothing but a second-rater
with a really silly hat.

418
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:21,617
Shut up.

419
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:25,680
Beautiful.

420
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:27,241
Beautiful.

421
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:31,427
Lee Thompkins, you do intrigue me so.

422
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,450
First, you were a doctor,

423
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,051
then the Narrows queen.

424
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,588
Tell me, please do,

425
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,213
are you running from your past

426
00:24:42,543 --> 00:24:44,306
when you become someone new?

427
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:10,577
When I found Jeremiah,

428
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,745
he had a bunch of crazies
digging this tunnel for him.

429
00:25:13,934 --> 00:25:16,803
Well, that certainly
fills me with confidence.

430
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:19,157
Whoa. You hear that?

431
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:29,609
- Alfred.
- Selina.

432
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:32,193
What are you doing here?

433
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:33,495
And with that?

434
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:36,250
I should ask you the same thing.

435
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:37,639
What's down that tunnel?

436
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:39,834
Well, it was Wayne Manor
till Jeremiah blew it up.

437
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:42,582
He sealed the only way out of Gotham.

438
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:47,542
No. J-Jeremiah is not alive.
I-I saw him die right here.

439
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:48,801
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

440
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,739
We all were.

441
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:53,314
And now he's embarked
on some madcap scheme

442
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:55,517
where he's reenacting the night
Bruce's parents were killed.

443
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,984
Where's Bruce?

444
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:58,319
He's gone after Jeremiah.

445
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:01,326
He could use your help.

446
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:04,893
Wait.

447
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:07,170
Don't you think that because

448
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:10,828
I did not kill Jeremiah does
not mean that I won't kill you.

449
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:15,389
- Selina.
- You killed my friend Tabitha.

450
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,896
You deserve to die.

451
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:19,757
Selina.

452
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,543
Just put the knife down.

453
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:25,669
Bruce needs you.

454
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:43,899
I suppose I should thank you.

455
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:47,568
Or you could help me to the Green Zone.

456
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:50,800
Of course. It's that way.

457
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:09,172
Jeremiah!

458
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:12,394
Show yourself!

459
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,575
<i>Olé!</i>

460
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:43,380
<i>Hola, Bruce.</i>

461
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,192
<i>Well, here we are,</i>

462
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:49,708
<i>the theater where your mommy
and daddy took you to see</i>

463
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:52,355
<i>The Mark of Zorro.</i>

464
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,444
<i>Ha-ha!</i>

465
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:57,362
<i>I had heard you were obsessed
with this man as a child.</i>

466
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,075
<i>I wonder what was it
that intrigued you so?</i>

467
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,077
<i>Was it the fact that he struck fear</i>

468
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:04,261
<i>into the hearts of his enemy?</i>

469
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,808
<i>En garde!</i>

470
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:14,125
<i>Hee-yah! Take that, you villain.</i>

471
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,351
<i>Vagabond.</i>

472
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:20,781
<i>Scoundrel.</i>

473
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,091
<i>Warned you.</i>

474
00:28:28,336 --> 00:28:32,091
<i>Perhaps the movie was a bit
too effective.</i>

475
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,635
<i>Isn't this the part where you
became frightened?</i>

476
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:39,414
<i>When you asked your parents to leave?</i>

477
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,571
<i>I wonder what would have happened</i>

478
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,218
<i>if you hadn't done that.</i>

479
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,154
<i>If you had conquered your fear.</i>

480
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:50,151
<i>Maybe your parents would still be alive.</i>

481
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:58,157
<i>Well, on to the last</i>

482
00:28:58,212 --> 00:29:00,891
<i>and final stop down memory lane.</i>

483
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,314
Stop!

484
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,470
Stop!

485
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:13,290
That's far enough, Bruce.

486
00:29:13,346 --> 00:29:14,681
Jeremiah.

487
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:17,798
- You don't have to do this.
- But I...

488
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:20,521
I do.

489
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,869
You see, I-I came to this realization.

490
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:28,328
I realized that no matter what I did

491
00:29:28,362 --> 00:29:31,708
to bond us, some random gunman
in an alley

492
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:35,277
would be the man who you were
tied to the most.

493
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:38,331
The man you saw
when you closed your eyes.

494
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:42,862
I want to be the star of the show.

495
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:48,296
So if I can't have you as
a brother bonded by love,

496
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,821
then we'll just have
to be bonded by hatred.

497
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,366
And you think killing two people

498
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:57,091
that look like my parents will do that?

499
00:29:57,585 --> 00:29:58,920
It won't.

500
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:00,412
Well, then it's a good
thing I already put

501
00:30:00,437 --> 00:30:03,867
a bullet in both of their
fraudulent skulls.

502
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,768
Oh, you're confused.

503
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,779
You're wondering if I already shot them,

504
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:12,748
then who's this lovely couple?

505
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:16,380
Thomas, Martha...

506
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:19,506
...why don't you turn around?

507
00:30:34,506 --> 00:30:35,942
Jim!

508
00:30:36,408 --> 00:30:38,067
I know.

509
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:41,667
See, o-over the course
of our little adventure,

510
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:45,739
fate brought to me James Gordon
and Leslie Thompkins,

511
00:30:45,764 --> 00:30:48,740
and I thought to myself...

512
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,552
why not...

513
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:54,248
why not kill the man who you think of

514
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:56,521
as your second father figure?

515
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,428
And your dear, dear,

516
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:03,053
dear friend Lee Thompkins.

517
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,492
And when I do,

518
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:08,694
finally, you and I
will be bound together.

519
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,629
Because you see...

520
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:20,107
...re-unification with the
mainland hangs on by a thread.

521
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,860
Those fireworks go off

522
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:24,751
and toxic chemicals rain down
onto the city,

523
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,915
and the government...

524
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,471
...cuts us adrift for good.

525
00:31:34,953 --> 00:31:36,984
Jeremiah.

526
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:38,625
Don't.

527
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,562
Shh.

528
00:31:40,627 --> 00:31:43,396
The pièce de résistance.

529
00:31:43,428 --> 00:31:45,365
One last thing.

530
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:47,848
I had Jervis Tetch hypnotize them

531
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,521
so that they'll wake up the moment

532
00:31:49,546 --> 00:31:52,872
these beautiful pearls hit the ground.

533
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:56,862
I want you to see them realize
what I've done to them

534
00:31:56,887 --> 00:32:00,034
as the life drains from their bodies.

535
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:02,781
Never forget,

536
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:05,881
this is all for you, Bruce.

537
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,357
No!

538
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:16,216
Selina! The pearls!

539
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:30,228
Ecco! Now!

540
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,593
We need to stop the fireworks.

541
00:32:39,618 --> 00:32:40,986
- They're gonna...
- I know.

542
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:43,196
You go after Jeremiah and Ecco.
I'll take the truck!

543
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:49,595
There's no way to stop them all.

544
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,899
Get to Harvey.

545
00:32:51,964 --> 00:32:55,132
Warn the people in
the Green Zone to get to cover.

546
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:58,441
What are you... Jim!

547
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:08,668
Jeremiah!

548
00:33:08,741 --> 00:33:10,684
Face me!

549
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:12,746
Here, Bruce.

550
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:55,192
Jeremiah!

551
00:33:56,505 --> 00:33:58,264
This ends.

552
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,943
- Tonight.
- No.

553
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:04,403
No, Bruce. Now it begins.

554
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,819
Yes.

555
00:34:23,882 --> 00:34:27,256
You feel it. The connection between us.

556
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:31,884
You do. Don't you? Bruce, you feel it.

557
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,025
Tell me you feel it.

558
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:39,053
You mean nothing to me.

559
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:47,077
Why don't you understand?

560
00:34:49,515 --> 00:34:51,227
You need me.

561
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:54,360
I'm the answer to your life's question!

562
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:58,126
Without me, you're just a joke...

563
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:03,157
...without a punch line.

564
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,763
After all this time,

565
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:10,248
you've come to me for help.

566
00:36:10,811 --> 00:36:14,426
After allowing Strange
to put a chip into my brain.

567
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:16,639
Attempting to sell me out to Gordon.

568
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:19,061
And after naming...

569
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:22,251
...a dog after me.

570
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:23,852
First of all,

571
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:27,380
I am very fond of that dog.

572
00:36:27,425 --> 00:36:31,863
Secondly, I had Hugo Strange
save your life.

573
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:34,857
Thirdly, do you really think

574
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:39,001
I didn't have plans
to save you from Jim Gordon?

575
00:36:41,693 --> 00:36:44,140
You always have an answer for
everything, don't you, Oswald?

576
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:48,721
We have been through all of this before.

577
00:36:48,746 --> 00:36:50,387
I've tried to kill you.

578
00:36:50,973 --> 00:36:52,895
You've tried to kill me.

579
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:56,309
But here we are in this room.

580
00:36:56,372 --> 00:36:58,059
Together.

581
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:02,450
It means fate has
different plans for us.

582
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:08,765
What are these plans?

583
00:37:09,957 --> 00:37:12,074
Haven't you realized what Gotham is yet?

584
00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:15,037
It is no longer a city.

585
00:37:15,347 --> 00:37:17,567
It is a prison.

586
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:21,231
And I think it's time we escaped.

587
00:37:36,178 --> 00:37:37,622
You heard the news?

588
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,379
Everybody's talking about it.

589
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,637
Reunification isn't happening.

590
00:37:41,856 --> 00:37:43,981
Word of the chemical spill
reached the mainland.

591
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:47,744
No action until the government
can determine if Gotham is safe.

592
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:50,404
I figure at least a couple of months.

593
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:53,225
You don't sound surprised.

594
00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:55,897
Guess I'm not.

595
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:58,614
Could've been much worse.

596
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:01,177
You stopped that.

597
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:02,896
Every time I think
we're turning things around,

598
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:05,588
I look up...
right back where we started.

599
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,535
What were you about to say to me

600
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,282
when, uh, Tetch had us?

601
00:38:26,448 --> 00:38:28,595
I don't know.

602
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,212
I guess I, uh, would have said...

603
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:36,019
what I said the last time
we saw each other.

604
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:41,012
I wish I could go back.

605
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:44,778
Do things differently.

606
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:46,673
Better.

607
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:54,157
- It feels like a long time ago.
- Nothing's changed.

608
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,545
But it has, Jim.

609
00:38:58,694 --> 00:39:01,147
- That was a mistake.
- A mistake?

610
00:39:01,694 --> 00:39:03,670
Put yourself in my shoes.

611
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:04,856
After everything you said,

612
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:08,139
suddenly you're having a baby
with Barbara, of all people.

613
00:39:11,693 --> 00:39:13,459
But it's not just that.

614
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:15,992
You talk about doing things differently

615
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:17,503
and I keep thinking,

616
00:39:19,178 --> 00:39:21,854
what if we hadn't lost ours?

617
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:31,132
What are you doing here, Lee?

618
00:39:34,092 --> 00:39:35,804
I don't know.

619
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:39,559
I know you've taken on so much, and...

620
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:43,108
and I want to be understanding, but...

621
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:46,584
you let me down, Jim.

622
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,412
I'm sorry.

623
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:58,416
What does that mean?

624
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:00,541
For us?

625
00:40:00,669 --> 00:40:02,111
I don't know.

626
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:04,758
Can't change the past,

627
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:07,776
so I guess we just have to live with it.

628
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:13,107
No, Lee...

629
00:40:34,154 --> 00:40:38,166
I can't believe he's still alive.

630
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,680
They've been doing scans,
and he has no brain activity.

631
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:44,931
He's no longer a threat.

632
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:48,951
To either of us.

633
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,320
Thank you for coming to help me.

634
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:03,228
That night your parents were killed,

635
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:05,242
I should have done something.

636
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:09,379
Selina, you've done enough.

637
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:22,659
It's not much, but it's home.

638
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:24,854
I've been looking through
your treasure trove.

639
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:28,291
- You've been a very naughty boy.
- Barbara?

640
00:41:28,323 --> 00:41:30,265
How did you...

641
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:32,428
Selina?

642
00:41:32,453 --> 00:41:36,535
Hmm. She and I were
gonna go murder-halfsies

643
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,480
to get you back for Tabitha,

644
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:41,177
but it seems I will have to do
the dirty work myself,

645
00:41:41,217 --> 00:41:42,551
as usual.

646
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:43,683
Oh, my God.

647
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:47,308
You're pregnant.

648
00:41:49,378 --> 00:41:52,045
- How could you possibly know that?
- Look at you.

649
00:41:52,078 --> 00:41:53,456
She's glowing.

650
00:41:54,202 --> 00:41:55,827
You're glowing.

651
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,155
How very observant of you.
Adieu, Oswald.

652
00:41:59,254 --> 00:42:01,022
Wait!

653
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:02,492
Come with us.

654
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:05,991
- What?
- Yes.

655
00:42:06,046 --> 00:42:09,052
I killed Tabitha.

656
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:10,671
You're angry.

657
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,554
You want revenge. But do you really want

658
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:18,095
to raise your child
in a toxic waste war zone?

659
00:42:18,142 --> 00:42:20,602
Come with us.

660
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:24,501
Are you telling me
you found a way out of Gotham?

661
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,829
Ed did.

662
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:30,253
It's a submarine.

663
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:31,967
- A submarine?
- It can track

664
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,277
mines in the river using sonar.

665
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:38,738
So, where's this submarine?

666
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:45,908
We have to build it.

667
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:47,879
Yeah, I'm gonna shoot you.

668
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:52,276
God.

669
00:42:52,354 --> 00:42:53,495
What is happening to me?

670
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,965
- Perhaps...
- Shut up!

671
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:58,338
That was a rhetorical question.

672
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:03,826
Fine.

673
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:07,459
I won't shoot you
for the sake of my child.

674
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:11,490
- But I will never forgive you.
- Of course.

675
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,755
I understand.

676
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:19,521
Call me when it's done.

677
00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:22,277
- So, who's the lucky father?
- Shut up!

678
00:43:23,402 --> 00:43:28,402
