1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,130
Why didn't you tell me about Sara?

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,005
Every time I bring her up,
you end up evading it.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,400
You killed Sara.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,849
And I don't want you to tell anyone
about this, especially Laurel.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,929
How could you have done this to me?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,963
- Please do not do this. Not here...
- Stop.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,208
I will work with you to stop Ra's.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,689
But never again will I be your daughter.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,327
Oliver Queen is still alive.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,086
Somehow Ta-er al-Sahfer's killer
still yet breathes.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,568
Yes, I know.

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,882
He has returned to
Starling City, apparently.

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,923
Why did you not tell me?

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,805
I had a right to know
that justice has not been done.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,367
Because Oliver Queen
did not murder Ta-er al-Sahfer.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,809
Do you not believe his own confession
because you doubt his motives?

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,561
Or because you don't approve of my grief?

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,730
- Sara was your beloved.
- And you've never approved.

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,601
I knew Sara would leave us, leave you...

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,004
...one way or the other.

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,245
I didn't approve of the love that I knew
would end only in heartbreak.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,687
Whether Queen killed Sara or not...

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,771
...he challenged you, he defied you.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,722
For that alone, he must die.

25
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,364
Coordinate your attacks.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,002
If you don't fight in unison,
your numbers become my advantage.

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,884
You both have a long way to go.

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,564
Particularly you, Oliver.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,725
You've spent years preparing
to bring a bow and arrow to a swordfight.

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,766
That's almost funny coming from you. You're
the reason the League is targeting us.

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,241
Thea has the club closed for renovations.

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,609
I've reinforced all the entrances
with A.R.G.U.S. tech. We're secure.

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,401
- John.
- My friends call me Dig.

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,610
You shouldn't even speak to me.

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,008
If the club is secure as Dig says,
perhaps you and Thea should relocate here.

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,164
We discussed that.
Thea wants to stay in the loft.

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,767
I have been able to survive
in Starling City...

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,685
...because the League has no idea
where in the city I am.

39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,370
We are not leaving the loft.

40
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,927
You and your sister
have the same stubbornness.

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,130
Clearly it comes from
your mother's side of the family.

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,724
It's pretty amazing how much Malcolm
taught you in such a short time.

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,010
Yeah. He's father of the year.

44
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,641
Your fighting style, it...

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,484
It reminds me a bit of Sara.

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,321
That's probably because the same people
taught Malcolm and her to fight.

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,049
I need to take a shower.

48
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,090
What?

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,767
I was gonna ask for a favor,
but I'm really more concerned...

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,161
...about you at the moment, Oliver.
I'm fine.

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,041
You've been pushing it hard
with Malcolm lately.

52
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,205
- When's the last time you got a decent sleep?
- I will sleep when this is over.

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,642
We recovered the Omega
from Chien Naa Wei.

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,890
We stole the Alpha from the Hong Kong
military and gave it to Amanda Waller.

55
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,204
Look, no matter how many times you make
me say it, it's not gonna be any less true.

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,571
- That's enough. You're relieved.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,451
Sorry. Wailer's a little too thorough
for her own good.

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,086
And by "thorough,"
I think you know I mean paranoid.

59
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,641
Well, I've gotten used to it by now.

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,526
Where is she, anyway?

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,008
Well, the mop-up of the Alpha-Omega
bioweapons problem...

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,288
...has become a United States Army
operation.

63
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,410
Ms. Wailer's participation is concluded.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,961
I'm sure that comes
as a profound disappointment.

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,810
Oh, like you wouldn't believe.

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,762
I apologize for the invasiveness
of your debrief.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,571
And now that it's over, you're free to go.

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,566
The Yamashiros have been released too.
They're returning to Japan.

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,724
You go with them, and from there
you can return to Starling...

70
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,804
...or go wherever else on earth you wish.

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,925
Thank you, General Shrieve.

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,128
After what you did, son...

73
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,651
...that's the least I can do.

74
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,848
This is hardcore.

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,602
When Dig said he was fortifying the club...

76
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,809
...I figured there'd just be
a few extra locks and cameras. Heh.

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,451
- Are you okay?
- No, no.

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,921
- Not really.
- What's wrong?

79
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,249
Ollie told me that I can't tell anyone.

80
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,001
Whatever it is, you have to be able
to talk about it with someone.

81
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,447
Someone who's not your brother.

82
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,487
I killed Sara.

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,807
- It was Malcolm, he...
- I know.

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,802
And none of you told me?

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,404
You know last year when I kind of
went off the rails for a bit?

86
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,404
- Yeah.
- I was also under the influence of something.

87
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,690
And just like you, I killed someone.

88
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,807
A cop.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,162
_R0y__
They didn't tell me either.

90
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,490
- And when I found out...
- You wished that you didn't know.

91
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,689
I'm not gonna lie and tell you
that the feeling ever goes away...

92
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,320
...but I can tell you that
it gets easier, Thea.

93
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,211
You don't have to see that cop's family
almost every single day.

94
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,125
I can't imagine
that it's gonna get any easier.

95
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,041
And I don't think that it should.

96
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,450
So he is alive. There were doubts.

97
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,764
Any idea what happens to the stock of Palmer
Technologies when Palmer goes missing...

98
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,649
...for a week?

99
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,885
Whoa.

100
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,964
It's been a week?

101
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,450
I've been a little distracted.

102
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,800
Can't get the modulator
to interface with the system.

103
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,281
- I've been working the problem but...
- Stop.

104
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,201
I imagined you'd say that. This is the step
toward the suit becoming operational.

105
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,529
- A little facial hair is a small price to pay...
- Stop.

106
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,610
This is a subsonic ionizer. If you try to use
it on quad-band circuitry, it could result...

107
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,322
In a catalytic reaction that could destroy
the entire building. Oops.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,729
You need to get some sleep.

109
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,890
- I will once I've cracked the problem.
- Or blow yourself up.

110
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,122
- Whichever comes first.
- Ray.

111
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,807
When those men killed Anna...

112
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,681
...I promised myself I would never
feel that helpless again.

113
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,171
So can you imagine how I felt when Brick's
men took a portion of the city hostage?

114
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,721
Lousy. We all did.

115
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,851
- But if you're punishing yourself...
- I'm not punishing myself.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,162
I'm focused on the task at hand.

117
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,721
Too focused, clearly.

118
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,886
I'm sorry, but I've got
a lot of work to do.

119
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,245
Hey, Dad, it's me again.

120
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,007
Listen, I know you're upset,
and you have every right to be...

121
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,848
...but it's been over a week,
and now that you know the truth...

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,211
...neither of us should go through
this alone, so please call me back.

123
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,010
I love you.

124
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,881
Hey. What are you doing here?

125
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,520
I need to talk to you.

126
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,202
- Is everything all right?
- No.

127
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,331
It's about Sara.

128
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,569
Okay.

129
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,969
Malcolm drugged me.

130
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
He gave me something...

131
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,403
...that made me susceptible
to suggestion, and l...

132
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,130
Thea...

133
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,211
...what are you talking about?

134
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,483
I killed Sara.

135
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,841
I didn't know what I was doing, okay?

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,126
It wasn't me.

137
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,003
I'm so sorry, Laurel.

138
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,522
If Merlyn drugged you...

139
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,247
...then it wasn't your fault.

140
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,731
But how could you work with him?
How could you stand by his side?

141
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,491
Because of the threat of the League.

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,804
We have to work with him.

143
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,366
I don't have a choice.

144
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,927
Yes, you do.

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,282
What happened wasn't your fault, Thea,
because it wasn't your decision.

146
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,764
If you want to make this right,
what you do from now on...

147
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,170
...that is.

148
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,888
I can't remember Sara's smile.
It's weird, isn't it?

149
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,568
I mean, I know Sara used
to smile and laugh, but...

150
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,405
But when I close my eyes
and I try and picture it...

151
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,407
...all I see is the way that I found her.

152
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,322
Sometimes the only thing
that keeps me going...

153
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,051
...is the thought
of one day finding her killer.

154
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,565
We Will.

155
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,169
I promise.

156
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,087
How do you do that?

157
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,568
- Do what?
- Lie.

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,081
Right to my face.

159
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,570
Thea told me, Oliver.
She told me everything.

160
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,007
How could you keep this from me?

161
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,209
After what you wanted to do
to Lacroix and Merlyn...

162
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,522
...do you really need to ask me
that question?

163
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,208
I am not so consumed with vengeance
that I blame Thea for Sara's death.

164
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,481
- I blame Malcolm Merlyn.
- I need him.

165
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,091
He murdered my sister.

166
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,450
With the League targeting us, he is the
only chance I have of saving mine.

167
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,211
This is how it has to be.

168
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,727
It's really amazing.

169
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,844
The way Merlyn always finds a way
under your protection.

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,604
I'm sorry, Laurel.

171
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,770
You know, it's hard to remember a time...

172
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,531
...when I was actually in love with you.

173
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,044
I told you not to tell anyone.

174
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,283
I guess I'm just not as good
at keeping secrets as you are.

175
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,804
Thea, I'm not gonna pretend that I understand
all the different types of pain that you're in.

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,287
But the threat, it is very real.

177
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,445
And the only way that we are gonna survive
is by acting in unison.

178
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,206
Are you really quoting Malcolm Merlyn
to me right now?

179
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,687
Yes, because he, better than anyone...

180
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,401
...understands the danger
the three of us are facing.

181
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,211
We're not in any danger.

182
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,085
Not anymore.

183
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,083
Not you or me.

184
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,649
But Malcolm?

185
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,322
He's going to face justice.

186
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,449
Thea, what have you done?

187
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,090
You're clearly not League of Assassins.

188
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,042
They wouldn't be this sloppy.

189
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,485
That's right, I forgot. Oliver mentioned
you were having some identity issues.

190
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,371
Though he didn't mention
about your delusions of grandeur.

191
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,205
You killed my sister,
you stupid son of a bitch!

192
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,448
Now you're just embarrassing yourself.

193
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,449
Your sister's teacher was my teacher.

194
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,610
Did you think you could really dispatch me
with a stick?

195
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,444
No.

196
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,443
I suppose we're gonna see
if being a killer runs in the family.

197
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,600
- Step aside, Laurel.
- Nyssa.

198
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,250
This does not concern you.

199
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,884
We've come for Al Sa-her.

200
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,723
You swore to me you didn't kill Sara.
I never believed you.

201
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,922
It is admirable of you to honor
your sister, but you can rest now.

202
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,248
Sara's murder is avenged.

203
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,481
Where is she? Hey!

204
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,284
I told you Merlyn was off-limits.

205
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,171
I know. Then I realized
that I didn't really give a damn.

206
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,004
This is why I keep secrets from you.

207
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,485
Because you let your emotions dictate your
actions, and it is gonna get you killed.

208
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,604
You really think that you had a chance
against Malcolm Merlyn?

209
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,730
- Nyssa and the League kidnapped Merlyn.
- I know.

210
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,803
Thea traded Merlyn for safety.

211
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,362
She was able to contact the League
because they're in town on the hunt.

212
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,605
Merlyn has a video of Thea killing Sara. First
thing he's gonna do is show that to Ra's.

213
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,163
- Then we're right back at square one.
- That was a bluff to make me challenge Ra's.

214
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,122
Merlyn loves Thea.
He would never just serve her up.

215
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,084
We have to get him back.

216
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,210
- What?
- Yeah, I'm with her.

217
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,160
It just sounded like you wanted to rescue
Malcolm Merlyn from the League.

218
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,370
My sister did this because she is angry.
Eventually she will settle down and realize...

219
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,887
...that she basically
just killed her own father.

220
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,969
There's no coming back from that.

221
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,489
The guilt will just eat away at her
until there is nothing left.

222
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,966
Please.

223
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,691
I'll start with the private airfields.

224
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,004
No. Oliver, Merlyn murdered my sister
and corrupted yours...

225
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,650
...and now you wanna save him?

226
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,768
I'm trying to save Thea's soul.

227
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,566
- You're out of your mind.
- You don't need to be here.

228
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,446
I got something.
Unless it's a big fat coincidence...

229
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,366
...that the security cameras
at Starling City Aviation just went dark.

230
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,567
I'll handle it.

231
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,769
I'm going home.

232
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,050
We hope you'll consider
staying with us in Tokyo for a day...

233
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,602
...before you leave for Starling City.
Don't pressure him, Tatsu.

234
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,206
He's been away from home a long time.

235
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,961
You can stay with us forever.
I like playing games with Oliver.

236
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,929
Maybe I can send my family's plane...

237
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,845
...and then you and your parents
can vacation in America.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,604
Your family owns a plane?

239
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,603
It's more of a jet.

240
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,487
I see it, I see it. I see our boat.

241
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,730
I hate boats.

242
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,082
- Oliver.
- What is it?

243
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,967
Hell will be a paradise compared to what
my father has in store for you, Al Sa-her.

244
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,043
Only because of my undertaking.

245
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,126
Your father doesn't care about Sara's
death, just as you know in your heart...

246
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,287
...that your relationship with Sara has cost
you any chance of taking your father's place.

247
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,968
Get him aboard.

248
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,451
I'll deal with this one.

249
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,727
Your sister told us Merlyn killed Sara.

250
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,326
Are you so lost you'd deprive me
of my justice?

251
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,847
This isn't justice, it's vengeance.

252
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,769
Vengeance is justice.

253
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,051
Go!

254
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,366
He's gone.

255
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,966
Malcolm Merlyn will never be seen again.

256
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,927
So, what's the play? Trade her for Malcolm?

257
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,642
Ra's will not make that deal,
even for his own daughter.

258
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,089
What are you doing with her?

259
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,689
She's a source of information and leverage.

260
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,921
I need the room.

261
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,050
You're gonna torture her to find out
where Nanda Parbat is?

262
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,123
I need the room.

263
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,807
Everyone clear out.

264
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,808
Oliver, listen, I know what you're doing,
and I know why you're doing it.

265
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,442
But you can't save Thea's soul
at the cost of your own.

266
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,967
Laurel was right.
I need to know where Nanda Parbat is.

267
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,249
Was she also correct you intend
to torture me for that information?

268
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,643
No. Because we know I won't have to.

269
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,482
You placed Sara's killer
under your protection.

270
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,245
Your every action has been aimed
towards the frustration of justice.

271
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,684
I will gladly tell you
where to find my home...

272
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,170
...because you will die there.

273
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,450
- Impossible in here.
- Yeah, that's the idea.

274
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,206
Make it impossible for the League
to get the drop on us.

275
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,283
I thought Thea got us off their hit list.

276
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,330
Yeah, that was before we put
Ra's al Ghul's daughter in a box.

277
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,528
Taking prisoners?
Isn't that crossing a line?

278
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,566
Actually, Oliver has an entire prison
on Lian Yu.

279
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,444
Maybe I shouldn't have told you that.

280
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,682
Nanda Parbat is hidden
beneath the Hindu Kush.

281
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,161
- That was quick.
- She wanted to tell me.

282
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,330
- Thinks I'm gonna die there.
- She's not the only one.

283
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,525
- I understood facing Ra's for Thea, but...
- I am doing it for Thea.

284
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,321
Look, I may not agree with it,
but I understand what you're trying to say.

285
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,208
You don't want Thea to live with the guilt
of getting her father killed.

286
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,687
But how is her brother dying any better?

287
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,122
I don't plan on dying.

288
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,124
That's what you said the last time
you went to go face Ra's.

289
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,203
And how did that turn out for you?

290
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,650
Oliver, I'm about as angry with you right now
than I've been with anyone in my life...

291
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,811
...but that doesn't mean
I want you going on a suicide mission.

292
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,085
You're unusually quiet.

293
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,807
Yeah.

294
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,048
Guys wanna give us a minute?

295
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,564
So Thea served up Merlyn, you wanna
save her from regretting that decision.

296
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,767
Yeah, I get it.

297
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,568
- But?
- But Oliver, there's something more at play.

298
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,165
It's Thea.

299
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,601
- Plain and simple.
- Are you sure?

300
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,208
Right now it's the only thing
I am sure about.

301
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,684
What the hell?

302
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,722
Did you get locked out
of the Palmer Technologies server?

303
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,487
That's a shame.

304
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,761
You did this?

305
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,127
I just came from a friend of mine who has
his head shoved so far up his colon that...

306
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,521
And I'm pretty sure this is true.

307
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,041
He's literally going
to get himself killed.

308
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,891
Him, I can't do anything about.

309
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,929
- You're a different story.
- Great.

310
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,124
Tell me the story while you
unlock the ATOM subroutine directory.

311
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,203
You have two options, Ray.

312
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,964
You can find a way to break the encryption
I used to lock up your server...

313
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,247
...which by my calculations
will take you roughly 6.25 hours.

314
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,485
Or you can use that time
to eat a proper meal, take a shower...

315
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,842
...and get no less than
five hours of sleep...

316
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,721
...at the completion of which
I will give you the password.

317
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,160
I see.

318
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,730
It's your choice,
but I highly recommend option two...

319
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,169
...because this whole situation
has gone from endearingly eccentric...

320
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,290
...to creepily not okay.

321
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,451
If I had the energy
I think I'd be getting angry right now...

322
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,688
...but instead I'll just take option two.

323
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,691
That's a wise choice.

324
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,361
After your dinner and a shower,
I am taking you straight to bed.

325
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,489
Putting you.

326
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,965
Why do I do that?

327
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,447
Yes, yes, yes.

328
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,521
Oh. Shh, Shh.

329
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,848
I didn't hear you come in.

330
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,846
Why can something so small
change the way you view the entire world?

331
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,481
What did Oliver say?

332
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,161
Did you ask him?

333
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,529
- Oliver has other things on his mind.
- Like what?

334
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,209
He's going to Nanda Parbat.

335
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,567
Cheating death once
wasn't enough for him?

336
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,367
Well, he's convinced
he's doing the right thing.

337
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,290
Is he?

338
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,122
You going with him?

339
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,727
Oliver has to do what's right by his
family. I have to do what's right by mine.

340
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,644
That why you didn't go the last time?

341
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,562
Last time Oliver wouldn't let me.

342
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,603
When you thought he died
you blamed yourself.

343
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,087
I don't wanna see you
put yourself through that.

344
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,244
- I can't stop Oliver from going.
- Then go with him.

345
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,284
You might have hung up the uniform,
Johnny, but you're still a soldier.

346
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,041
Standing down while your friend
goes into battle just isn't in your DNA.

347
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,044
Just get there and back in one piece.

348
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,961
About that...

349
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,521
You think I could borrow
the A.R.G.U.S. jet?

350
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,331
What the hell
do you think that you're doing?

351
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,080
Roy told you?

352
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,526
Roy and Laurel.

353
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,848
They both think
that you are out of your mind.

354
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,287
- Me? I know it for sure.
- I'm doing this for you.

355
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,371
If your father dies
because of something you've done...

356
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,007
...a piece of you will go missing
and you'll never be able to get it back.

357
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,322
That I can live with.

358
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,807
But not you dying because of me.

359
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,086
I'm not gonna die.

360
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,329
And the only reason you think
you can live with Malcolm's death...

361
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,161
...is because you don't really know
what it's like to take a life.

362
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,611
You're a good person, Thea.

363
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,287
Both of our parents are dead because of me.

364
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,166
And that guilt,
that's something that I have to live with.

365
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,531
I don't want that for you.

366
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,528
No, please.

367
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,682
Please just don't go.

368
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,401
I'll be back as soon as I can.

369
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,847
I got a Gulf stream at
Starling City Aviation.

370
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,685
- I can't ask you to come with me.
- You didn't ask me.

371
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,882
Besides, you don't own a jet anymore.

372
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,371
In 1854, I encountered
an illusionist in Vienna...

373
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,647
...and he was dazzling,
magnificent, powerful.

374
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,728
And then, nearly half a century later,
I stumbled upon this man again.

375
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,130
He was withered...

376
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,530
...broken...

377
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,891
...dyifl9-

378
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:26,809
You see, a magician can cheat many things,
except one.

379
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,562
Please. I was your horseman.

380
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,404
Let me hunt for you once more.

381
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,760
Allow me to prove to you my reborn loyalty.

382
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,409
Al Sa-her, face your death with honor.

383
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,002
Or at least dignity.

384
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,407
Please don't do this.

385
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,971
There is a price you must pay
for your crimes...

386
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,403
...that can only be measured
in agony and blood.

387
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,923
But know I will take no pleasure in this.

388
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,846
Take him away.

389
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,610
No.

390
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,200
No. No. No!

391
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,082
Shut. Up.

392
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,971
Is this an actual Van Go...? Oh!

393
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,771
It's a Vermeer, actually.

394
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,328
I rotate the paintings I have here
with my collection at Starling Museum.

395
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,966
Yeah, I'm really into the Dutch masters
this month.

396
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,764
You're very attractive.

397
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,327
I mean, they're.

398
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,244
- You were right.
- Mm?

399
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,724
Food was delicious, the shower was amazing.
Thank you for insisting on it.

400
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,246
Well, a deal's a deal.

401
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,240
Password's inside.

402
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,688
You know, you didn't have to blackmail me.

403
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,961
I trust your judgment.

404
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,769
In fact, I pretty much depend on it.

405
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,008
Well, that would make you the only one.

406
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,891
I can be as obsessive
and stubborn as the next billionaire.

407
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,168
I know the value
of somebody calling me on it.

408
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,005
Telling me when the emperor
has no clothes.

409
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,207
Speaking of...

410
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,569
Right. Uh...

411
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,809
You know what?
Sometimes I forget that we work together.

412
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,321
When I'm with you, it's just you.

413
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,723
I don't think about work
or the mission or...

414
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,127
I'm sorry.

415
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,690
I'm not.

416
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,646
There it is. Nanda Parbat.

417
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,727
Centuries old.

418
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,601
Never taken by force.

419
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,848
Then why are we doing this, Oliver?

420
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,089
I mean, why are we really doing this?

421
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,327
The League will have sentries
patrolling the area.

422
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,086
If they spot us,
we cannot let them get away.

423
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,328
Surprise is our only advantage.

424
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,605
I'd say they spotted us.

425
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,727
What's your count?

426
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,451
Six on the south side, four on the east.

427
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,045
I don't wanna go out
like Butch and Sundance.

428
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,170
- So, what's the plan?
- Shoot straighter than they do.

429
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,930
Cover me.

430
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,241
Go, go, go!

431
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,087
- If he gets to the fortress, we're dead.
- He won't.

432
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,291
One sniper on the roof.

433
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,127
They're A.R.G.U.S. They work for Waller.

434
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,529
Waller? General Shrieve
said she wasn't involved anymore.

435
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,441
Maybe that decision didn't sit
well with her. We can't stay here.

436
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,169
Delivery truck.

437
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,840
- Sniper will take us out before we get there.
- Pass me your gun. I'll cover you.

438
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,407
Thank me later. Give me your gun.

439
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,930
Go!

440
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,401
I am the prisoner,
yet you look the more tortured.

441
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,324
By now Sa-her
is in the presence of my father.

442
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,807
His last hours will be spent in agony.

443
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,680
Begging for death.

444
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,206
- That doesn't please you?
- I thought it would.

445
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,405
Having Merlyn to hate...

446
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,365
...it's like a piece of Sara
that I can still hold onto.

447
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,969
But once he's gone...

448
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,204
...so is another part of her.

449
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,768
She would want to be avenged.

450
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,602
Can you remember the sound
of Sara's laugh?

451
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,602
When Sara was first brought
before my father...

452
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,081
...the moment he weighed
her apprenticeship or her execution...

453
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,329
...she bore witness
to a demonstration of his power...

454
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,569
...one that inspired terror
in all who had come before.

455
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,125
But Sara laughed.

456
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,287
It was so innocent...

457
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,811
...so genuine.

458
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,843
That was the moment
I fell in love with her, I think.

459
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,361
All I knew, all I craved
was to hear her laugh once more.

460
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,210
Thank you.

461
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,245
Agh!

462
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,604
This place is humongous.

463
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,763
How do we find Merlyn in all of this?

464
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,922
The nanites that I tagged him with
four months ago, this can track them.

465
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,080
Down!

466
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,404
Thanks.

467
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,686
Oh, my God.

468
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,444
Malcolm.

469
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,762
Help me get him down.

470
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,810
Trap.

471
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,801
Mr. Queen.

472
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,361
Welcome to Nanda Parbat.

473
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,570
Oliver.

474
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,730
Oliver.

475
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,889
- I tried that. Nothing's happening.
- We need to get out of here now.

476
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,128
Save your strength. We're gonna need it.

477
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,365
- I'm not gonna let you die.
- I don't think that's up to you.

478
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,807
- I shouldn't have let you come.
- Not up to you.

479
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,844
You don't understand.

480
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,724
No, I think I do.

481
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,201
You forget I know you.
Sometimes better than you know yourself.

482
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,483
You could have told me I wasn't
doing this for Thea before we left.

483
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,728
You are doing it for Thea.

484
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,126
But, yeah, you're right.
It's not just about her.

485
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,371
You know, every time I close my eyes...

486
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,605
...all that I can see...

487
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,686
...all that I can hear, feel is...

488
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,849
ls the fall.

489
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,488
I couldn't live like that.

490
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,445
I couldn't live knowing that...

491
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,448
...there was someone out there
who beat me.

492
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,045
Yeah, that makes sense.

493
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,810
No, it's egotistical and insane.

494
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,049
So is putting on a mask
and jumping off rooftops, Oliver.

495
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,481
To do that
you have to be in a certain mindset.

496
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,646
Every soldier has to believe
he's coming home...

497
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,565
...otherwise he's paralyzed.

498
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,970
Ra's got in your head.

499
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,169
What was that favor
you wanted to ask me?

500
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,529
- I don't think now is the right time.
- We're not dead yet.

501
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,411
Now might be the only time.

502
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,606
I always assumed if I ever got married
again that Andy would be by my side.

503
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,127
When I lost my brother...

504
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,766
...I never thought I'd get another one.

505
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,610
So pretending for a moment...

506
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,162
...that we aren't two dead men
chained to the floor...

507
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,651
...how do you feel
about being my best man?

508
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,209
I'd feel pretty good about it.

509
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,247
Oliver.

510
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,841
It's time.

511
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,286
- I count at least three shooters.
- Let's move.

512
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,366
Stay down!

513
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,281
Agh!

514
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,967
- Tatsu, come on!
- Dad!

515
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,090
No!

516
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,642
No! Stop, stop!

517
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,887
Go! Get him out of here!

518
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,806
I'm really starting to wonder
why I decided to come with you.

519
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,604
I told you.

520
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,481
I want to show you how I deal
with the things that you're going through.

521
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,891
That's Michelle Vincent.

522
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,003
And her son, Rory. He's 4.

523
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,130
Roy, why are you stalking
some random family?

524
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,401
They're not random.

525
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,002
That's them.
That's the police officer's family.

526
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,889
I give them cash.

527
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,923
Bring them groceries.

528
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,891
I even got Rory a Boba Fett for Christmas.

529
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,409
- Don't worry, they don't know it's me.
- You're torturing yourself.

530
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,046
No, it helps, actually.
It helps me with the guilt.

531
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,689
Look, I appreciate...

532
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,843
...what you're doing here.

533
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,042
Showing me this.

534
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,449
But the cop...

535
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,604
...and Sara...

536
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,324
...they're just not the same thing.

537
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,609
You weren't any more in control
of yourself than I was.

538
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,848
No, not when I...

539
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,485
...killed Sara.

540
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,042
But when I traded Malcolm to the League...

541
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,960
...when I let him into my life...

542
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,169
...I knew exactly who he was.

543
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,609
What he was.

544
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,808
He taught me how to kill.

545
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,924
Maybe I am a killer.

546
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,208
Maybe that's the real me.

547
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,681
Maybe I deserve to be punished.

548
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,206
I don't believe that.

549
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,847
I just tried to have my father murdered.

550
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,089
Can you please just take me home?

551
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,851
I'm in no mood for conversation.

552
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,441
You'll want to hear this.

553
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,965
There's something that I need to tell you.

554
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,445
I can't live without you knowing.

555
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,249
The guilt is far worse
than anything you could do to me.

556
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,041
I lied to you.

557
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,001
And you believed it.

558
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,006
When I told you that Malcolm killed Sara.

559
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,927
He wanted her dead.

560
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,082
He put certain things in motion...

561
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,728
...but I am the one...

562
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,281
...who fired those arrows into her chest.

563
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,325
And when I made the deal...

564
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,289
...to give up Malcolm...

565
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,528
...I promised you your vengeance.

566
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,727
So take it.

567
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,249
You tasted death.

568
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,129
And you wanted more.

569
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,849
But the truth is...

570
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,644
...everyone...

571
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,808
...and everything must come to an end.

572
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,327
Even for one such as me.

573
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,281
Kill me.

574
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,526
But spare John Diggle's life.

575
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,170
Let him go.

576
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,206
I will beg for it.

577
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,448
You have shown tremendous strength...

578
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,244
...fortitude...

579
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,129
...power.

580
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,690
No, Mr. Queen, I don't want to kill you.

581
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,647
I want you to take my place.

582
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,967
I want you to become the next Ra's al Ghul.
