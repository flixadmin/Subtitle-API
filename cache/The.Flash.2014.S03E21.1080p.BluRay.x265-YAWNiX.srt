00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,240
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,527
If the answers that we need

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,927
to stop Savitar and save you
are in the future,

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,360
<i>then that's where I need to go.</i>

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,005
You're from before she dies, aren't you?

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,328
You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,249
- Just tell me how you did it.
- I had help.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,807
<i>Her name is Tracy Brand.
She made the Speed Force trap for me.</i>

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,490
You're telling me my ideas
about the Speed Force...

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,681
I'm right?

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,087
In the future.
We need you to build this trap now.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,767
<i>Caitlin's after Tracy.</i>

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,240
<i>That means she's working with Savitar.</i>

14
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,090
- So you talked to Cecile?
- Told her everything.

15
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,327
<i>Told her I love her.</i>

16
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,851
I told her that you were the Flash.

17
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,242
<i>Like I told you from the beginning,</i>

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,886
I am the Future Flash.

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,247
It's like looking in a mirror.

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,331
Well, not quite.

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,767
You're not so scary without your armor.

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,606
What can I say?

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,761
I outgrew red.

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,769
I know what you are.

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,601
You're a Time Remnant.

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,565
A temporal duplicate

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,525
created when you run back in time
and meet yourself.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,169
<i>You brought a Remnant to life
last year to defeat Zoom.</i>

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,166
<i>Your duplicate died
saving the multi-verse,</i>

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,761
<i>and you continued your happy little life.</i>

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,247
And it would've stayed that way.

32
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,171
But then you decided to play God.

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,921
You created Flashpoint
and changed everything.

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,890
I went to the future.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,808
My future self told me that
he created Time Remnants to stop you,

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,083
that you slaughtered them all.

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,731
All but one.

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,844
Me. I lived.

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,371
But a funny thing happened when I did.

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,325
You, Joe, Wally, Cisco,

41
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,290
you all shunned me
because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,363
I was an aberration.

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,967
<i>A disposable hero.</i>

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,966
Future you failed to mention that,
didn't he?

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,683
How did you become Savitar?

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,643
I was broken and alone.

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,162
I wanted the pain to end.

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,166
<i>And that's when
I realized the truth, Barry.</i>

49
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,882
God feels no pain.

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
<i>All I had to do was become one.</i>

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,441
And I only need two more things.

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,242
For Iris to die, so that
you are driven so far into the dark

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,409
that I can be born.

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,125
And the other?

55
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,005
It may sound ironic,
given who I'm talking to,

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,602
but I'll keep that one to myself.

57
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,969
What happens if I kill myself?

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,090
If I die, then you'll never be created.

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,889
Cause and effect's a tricky thing.

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,650
Didn't work so well for Eddie, did it?

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,242
Shot himself in the chest.
Thawne's still kicking around.

62
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,245
See, that's the thing
about time travel, Barry.

63
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,723
The more you do it,
the less the rules apply to you.

64
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,969
But us having this conversation now,
we're changing the future.

65
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,600
Are we?

66
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,809
My ascendancy is nearing.

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,725
When I have control of all of time,

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,842
it will be you
who is abandoned and forgotten.

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,690
You're gonna die right here!

70
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,564
I forgot to tell you.

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,441
My suit's cooler than yours.

72
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,880
It's impossible.

73
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,208
I don't understand.
How could Savitar be you?

74
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,966
He's not me. Not really.

75
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,640
He's all the worst parts of you.
It's like in <i>Star Trek</i>

76
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,447
when the transporter
splits Kirk into Good Kirk and Bad Kirk.

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,521
Please tell me you at least
have <i>Star Trek</i> on your Earth?

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,803
- Voyager.
- I hate spinoffs.

79
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,289
That explains
why Caitlin was willing to follow him.

80
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,561
<i>He has a face that she trusts.</i>

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,921
Half of one, anyway.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,886
So, when the Legends found that message
in the Waverider from old you saying,

83
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,687
"Don't trust Barry Allen," he was talking
about Savitar Barry Allen.

84
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,403
It's all coming together
in the worst way.

85
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,530
You said you made Savitar? How?

86
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,761
Peep this.

87
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,524
Four years from now,

88
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,203
Future Flash creates
a Time Remnant to fight Savitar.

89
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,650
But Savitar lets that Remnant live
so that it can later become Savitar.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,889
So, once Savitar is
imprisoned in the Speed Force,

91
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,048
<i>this Remnant starts to go crazy,</i>

92
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,684
and he goes back in time to the past
and becomes Savitar.

93
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,247
Creating the lie
that he was the first speedster,

94
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,489
spreading the myth and recruiting acolytes
throughout the ages.

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,841
That doesn't make any sense.

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,044
Which came first,
Savitar or the Time Remnant?

97
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,961
It's a closed loop. No beginning, no end.
It's just one endless cycle.

98
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,128
Classic chicken-and-the-egg scenario,
I think, gang.

99
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,000
A Time Remnant,
it's like a duplicate of you, right?

100
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,282
So he has your feelings, your memories.

101
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,329
<i>So why would he wanna hurt us?</i>

102
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,085
Why would he wanna kill Iris?

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,485
H.R., how's Tracy coming
with the Speed Force trap?

104
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,409
Good. Yeah, good. Slow.

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,931
Get her to speed up, all right?

106
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,605
I'll do that now. Can do.

107
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,202
If Savitar is a version of Barry
from the future,

108
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,562
and he remembers everything Barry does,

109
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,640
how are we ever gonna
come up with a plan to stop him?

110
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,664
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

111
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,486
What was he like?

112
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,531
Broken.

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,721
<i>You know,</i>

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,961
all this time, I thought
that Savitar is this monster.

115
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,923
It's hard to picture what might happen
and, it being you, that...

116
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,048
I... I know it's not you, I...

117
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,808
Part of him is.

118
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,481
He said it was like looking in a mirror,
and he was right.

119
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,608
But not just the way that he looked.
It was...

120
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,685
It was his eyes,
the pain that was inside them.

121
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,607
I've seen that in myself.

122
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,968
When I think about
how my parents died so violently,

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,091
sometimes, I wanna repay
that violence with more violence.

124
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,325
I wanna make someone else
hurt as much as I do.

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,369
But you don't ever do that.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,923
You're not him. You're a good person.

127
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,606
No, I know, but it's in there, you know?
That's in me.

128
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,286
That power, that pain.

129
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,370
That's where Savitar comes from,
from loss.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,207
From losing you.

131
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,609
You're not going to lose me.

132
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,203
Do you hear me?

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,722
And we are going to stop Savitar.

134
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,722
You are not alone. He is.

135
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,283
And he is not a god.

136
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,565
Jay told me that we're not gods.

137
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,844
He was wrong.

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,170
We could be, any speedster,
and it wouldn't take much.

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,803
When the love that we feel in our hearts
is drowned in anger,

140
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,326
when the bad memories
outweigh the good ones...

141
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,483
What am I gonna
have to become to stop him?

142
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,402
Hey! Oh, bad time?

143
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,921
No, man, what's up?

144
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,401
I just came up with the best idea ever.

145
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,887
Either that,
or it's the worst idea ever, but...

146
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,082
- It's an idea.
- It's an idea!

147
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,890
You wanna give me a perm?

148
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,447
It's not for your hair, <i>Steel Magnolias.</i>

149
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,840
It's for your brain, okay?

150
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,010
I want to stop you
from making new memories.

151
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,605
What are you talking about?

152
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,764
Savitar knows everything we're gonna do
because he remembers doing it.

153
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,921
He's a future Barry.

154
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,410
So what if Barry can't remember
what we're doing now?

155
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,250
You wanna mess with his brain?

156
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,569
Just a little bit.
It's a minimal procedure.

157
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,524
It'll still be the same Barry
you know and love,

158
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,087
except he just won't be able
to retain new information.

159
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,567
There's two types of memory, Allen,
short-term and long-term.

160
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,802
- Long-term is for your...
- Okay! Julian, this is... Stop.

161
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,247
This is my presentation.
I'm the expert here.

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,442
This is the part of your brain
that retains new information

163
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,643
before sending it to the cortex
to be stored forever,

164
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,488
so what if we block that chain
with a magnetic disruption.

165
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,324
So Savitar won't be able to remember

166
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,289
whatever strategy
we come up with to defeat him.

167
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,802
Which means
he can't be two steps ahead of us anymore.

168
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,281
With any luck,
we'll actually put him one step behind.

169
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,926
Beautiful. Cause and effect.

170
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,970
Barry, what do you think?

171
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,165
Let's do it.

172
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,490
Wait. Wasn't Caitlin
the expert on brains around here?

173
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,964
She was. But this is something
we'll have to do without her.

174
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,010
I trust you.

175
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,966
You won't feel a thing.

176
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,322
Okay. Let's get this show on the road.

177
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,526
The disrupter is attached
to your hippocampus, so we're sure.

178
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,250
Okay, ready for zapping.

179
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,845
Can we not call it "zapping"?

180
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,089
Ready to activate in three, two, one.

181
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,442
- Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.
<i>- Way to go, slugger.</i>

182
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,607
<i>Run, Barry! Run!</i>

183
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,962
<i>I have watched you
be in love with Iris.</i>

184
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,844
<i>Maybe,
we were meant to be together.</i>

185
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,886
Okay, that should do it.

186
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,491
All right.

187
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,607
Right.
How do you feel?

188
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,126
I feel fine.

189
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,964
You see? He feels fine.

190
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,566
Barry?

191
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,210
Barry?

192
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,121
<i>Barry?</i>

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,161
Who's Barry?

194
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,201
Not fine.

195
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,050
Who are all of you?

196
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,729
What's going on?
Seriously, who are you guys?

197
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,245
- Okay, Barry, stay calm...
- Who's Barry?

198
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,209
- Cisco!
- Slight miscalculation.

199
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,401
"Slight" wouldn't be a word I'd use.

200
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,405
Where the hell am I?
Is this a dentist office?

201
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,244
No, no, this is S.T.A.R. Labs.

202
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,926
S.T.A.R. Labs? A laboratory?

203
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,481
A laboratory? What do you...
Were you guys experimenting on me?

204
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,008
No one is... Well, yes.
Technically, yes, but it was consensual.

205
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,770
- You were? You...
- Yes.

206
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,081
Why can't I remember anything?

207
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,526
Why can't I remember my name?

208
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,881
Your name is Barry.

209
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,366
My name is not Barry.

210
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,450
I don't know what my name is,
but my name's "Bartholomew Henry Allen."

211
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,081
- That's not a good name.
- Look, Barry...

212
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,203
Are you sure I don't go by "Bart"? Can...

213
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,131
"Bart" feels more natural to me.
Can we go with "Bart"?

214
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,361
- "Bart" is kind of cool.
- Okay.

215
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,925
- <i>Wally!</i>
- Okay.

216
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,246
Hey, let's just get you back in the chair.

217
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,601
No! No, no, no.

218
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,444
- I'm not getting in the chair.
- Let's just get you...

219
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,125
<i>No, how do I know
you didn't kidnap me here</i>

220
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,248
to do some weird brain surgery on me?

221
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,920
Or maybe you're like those criminals
who trick people into hotel rooms

222
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,248
so they can steal their kidneys.
Do I still have my kidneys?

223
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,441
We don't want your kidneys!

224
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,126
Okay, Barry, look at these photographs.

225
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,210
We're your friends, your family.

226
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,404
I just wanna help you, okay?

227
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,410
That's a nice ring.

228
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,291
<i>Who's the lucky guy?</i>

229
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,730
You are, Barry.

230
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,324
Look, I know you're scared, okay?
You can trust us.

231
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,721
- Cisco, a minute?
- Yes, sir.

232
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,321
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

233
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,486
Wally, stay with him, okay?

234
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,166
Me?

235
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,004
So how do we know each other?

236
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,603
Oh, uh, I'm your brother.

237
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,765
There is no sign
of any permanent structural damage.

238
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,122
Then why can't he remember anything?

239
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,521
Juhan?

240
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,843
He appears to be suffering from some sort
of psychogenic retrograde amnesia.

241
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,167
Amnesia.

242
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,284
What if we didn't account
for Barry's increased neural velocity?

243
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,686
Due to his super speed.

244
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,161
Wait. Do we think he knows he's the Flash?

245
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,691
<i>That he has super speed?</i>

246
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,170
Hey Barry, catch.

247
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,850
Sorry.

248
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,210
- Oh, my Lord!
- He's, like, god-awful.

249
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,046
- He's pathetic.
- Can we flip a switch, undo it?

250
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay, we are not flipping any more
switches until we figure this thing out.

251
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,884
It's Cecile. Hey, babe.

252
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,968
An emergency? All right, bye.

253
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,005
Okay, Cecile needs Barry at C.C.P.D.,
like, right now.

254
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,241
She says it's urgent.

255
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,368
He can't possibly
go out in that condition.

256
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,485
Okay, um, my dad and I
will take Barry to Cecile.

257
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,524
You and Cisco figure out a way
to get Barry's memory back,

258
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,404
<i>and fast, yeah?</i>

259
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,403
Okay. Okay.

260
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,771
You don't wanna work?

261
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,930
Well, then I don't need you!

262
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,050
Um, am I to infer, then,
that you've hit a little speed bump

263
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,403
in your quest to build a device
to trap Savitar in the Speed Force? The...

264
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,762
Accelerated matter
micro generator projectile?

265
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,764
No, I know.
It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.

266
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,721
No, it doesn't. How about
we call this fancy device of yours...

267
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,285
- No, you probably shouldn't...
- Call it the...

268
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,441
Speed Force cannon!

269
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,483
Speed Force bazooka!

270
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,801
Speed Force gun!

271
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,926
- Speed Force bazooka's much better. Yeah.
- Speed Force bazooka's better.

272
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,327
But if the Speed Force bazooka
doesn't start working soon,

273
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,722
we're gonna have to start
calling it the Speed Force Epic Fail.

274
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,961
Why, what's the problem?

275
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,851
Okay, the accelerometer, it sucks
a hell of a lot of air watts,

276
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,128
- <i>which is measured</i>...
- All right, stop talking science!

277
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,807
You need to take a step back
from the Speed Force bazooka.

278
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,803
- But there's not time.
- There's always time!

279
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,965
Because sometimes to move forward,

280
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,963
you have to take a step back.

281
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,327
Step back. You see?

282
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,250
Yes, and shake a little those shoulders.

283
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,244
Shake a little those shoulders.
You know, I feel like...

284
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,006
Oh my gosh, the tension in your shoulders!

285
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,170
Think of something that calms you.

286
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,160
- Coffee.
- Oh, yes!

287
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,961
But not just any coffee.

288
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,447
Piping hot Indonesian dark-roast
with raspberry and coriander...

289
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,290
Raspberry and coriander...

290
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,044
I have never met another person who uses
copious amounts of caffeine to chill out.

291
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,601
I've never met another person, either.

292
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,360
I'm relaxed. Are you relaxed?

293
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,641
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

294
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,684
- You, uh... And I'll...
- Yeah.

295
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,008
Okay. I mean... Okay.

296
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,161
Yeah.

297
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,361
<i>Good morning, people.</i>

298
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,847
Hi, I'm Barry Allen. You can call me Bart.

299
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,320
Okay.

300
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,648
So you said there was an emergency.
Where is the fire?

301
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,411
Ah, it's funny you should
put it like that. Lucious Coolidge.

302
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,641
- Who?
- Heat Monger.

303
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,885
The worst arsonist Central City's seen
since Mick Rory went off the grid.

304
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,762
That is, until Flash here stopped him.

305
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,041
- What's Flash?
- So what is the problem?

306
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,083
Judge Hankerson,
he's got an opening in his docket,

307
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,369
so he moved Coolidge's probable-cause
hearing up to this afternoon.

308
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,886
Barry was the CSI on the case,

309
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,448
so I need him to testify
in order to hold Coolidge over for trial.

310
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,604
Uh, yeah, no, Barry can't do that.

311
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,604
Why not?

312
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,761
Uh...

313
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,245
What do you mean he has amnesia?

314
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,726
Barr, what's her name?

315
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,122
Uh... Felicia?

316
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,762
Oh my God.

317
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,930
Is this, like, a Flash thing?

318
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,724
Was he battling a supervillain who used

319
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,928
his evil powers to steal Barry's memory?

320
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,810
No, we sort of accidentally
did this to him ourselves.

321
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,041
Why?

322
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,403
That's doesn't matter. What does matter
is you stalling that judge.

323
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,881
Barry is in no condition
to testify in court.

324
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,448
Joe, if Barry can't testify,
Coolidge walks.

325
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,051
And then God help us all.

326
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,924
Okay, we'll figure out something.

327
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,081
Please do.

328
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,930
It was nice meeting you.

329
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,483
Oh, yeah, you, too, Bart.

330
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,725
I got some friends down at the courthouse.
I'm gonna go down there

331
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,930
and see if we can delay
this whole Coolidge situation, all right?

332
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,281
I'm sorry.

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,286
For what?

334
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,167
I don't know.
It just seems like everybody's upset,

335
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,129
and it feels like it's my fault.

336
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,489
No, no, not at all.

337
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,006
Look, we just want you to get back
to normal. That's it, okay?

338
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,483
Well, I would,
if I could remember what normal is.

339
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,281
I mean, what have you and I
been doing lately?

340
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,369
Are we planning the wedding?

341
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,649
Like, have we sent out wedding invitations

342
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,007
or picked a honeymoon destination or...

343
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,521
Am I a warm-weather guy
or a cold-weather guy?

344
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,691
Actually, we've been
a little busy lately, so...

345
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,170
With what?

346
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,131
Um, nothing that you need
to worry about, okay?

347
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,486
Okay. You know what's weird?

348
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,682
I know we just ate,
but I'm already feeling hungry.

349
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,041
Yeah, let's get some food in you.

350
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,361
- All right.
- Okay.

351
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,490
What's that saying?

352
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,044
"Man plans, and God laughs"?

353
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,687
Well, men are planning,

354
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,008
and what's the God of Speed doing?

355
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,409
Kneeling. Brooding time is over.

356
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,644
You revealed yourself. Now what?

357
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,844
Any idea what to do
with Flash and friends?

358
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,368
Because we are getting
pretty close to your big becoming,

359
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,042
and if we don't take them down,
neither one of us gets what we want.

360
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,085
Hello? Anybody home?

361
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,881
What are you doing?

362
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,366
Who are you?

363
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,205
What's wrong with you?

364
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,162
Who am I?

365
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,370
<i>- Science club-
- Yup.</i>

366
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,050
- Key club. Astronomy club.
- Yep.

367
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,607
- Yearbook?
- Yeah.

368
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,921
And Anime club?

369
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,443
Oh, yeah, you loved, loved Dragon Ball Z.

370
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,284
I don't know what that is.

371
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,121
Yeah, I couldn't explain that show to you
even if I wanted to, so...

372
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,691
- Okay.
- Sorry.

373
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,571
I definitely had quite
the nerd thing going on, huh?

374
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,086
Yeah, little bit.

375
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,248
I thought you said
we were best friends in high school.

376
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,407
Yeah, we were.

377
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,369
Why didn't you give me some advice,
help me out?

378
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,602
Oh, believe me, okay, I tried.

379
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,881
- Really? You did?
- Yes.

380
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,607
Okay, because I have evidence
that you did not.

381
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,930
Um, I don't remember any of this, but
even I can see how wrong that look was.

382
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,244
This is visual terrorism.
I won't look at it anymore.

383
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,051
What?

384
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,168
You just...
You're so different. You're so light.

385
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,449
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

386
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,850
It's like you're not carrying
the weight of the world on your shoulders.

387
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,641
So, what, I was, like,
brooding all the time before?

388
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,161
- Sometimes.
- Yeah?

389
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,640
- Yeah.
- Really?

390
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,690
I don't know. It's just... It's really
nice to see you smiling so much.

391
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,011
Well, I mean...

392
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,286
How could I not,

393
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,008
knowing I'm gonna be with you
for the rest of my life?

394
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,447
Uh-oh.

395
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,802
- What?
- I've got to get to the courthouse.

396
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,007
Oh, yeah, of course.

397
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,326
- Yeah, I've got to...
- Okay, yeah.

398
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,521
Uh, um...

399
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,002
I'll... Yeah, later. Okay.

400
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,531
Okay.

401
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,724
Docket number CC-15204.

402
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,841
<i>Evidentiary hearing
for Central City versus the defendant,</i>

403
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,802
Lucious Coolidge. I see the City

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,128
- <i>wishes to file felony charges.</i>
- Cutting it real close, guys.

405
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,362
- You ready to testify?
- No. No, I'm not.

406
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,722
Yes, he is.
He just needs one minute, please.

407
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,371
Prosecution may proceed.

408
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,686
Too late. He's up.

409
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,370
Here, just take these.

410
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,846
What... I wear glasses?

411
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,088
You will now.
Just put them on. You'll be okay.

412
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,044
- Just don't get them wet.
- What...

413
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,244
Your Honor, I, uh,
I call Barry Allen to the stand.

414
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,529
<i>Raise your
right hand, please.</i>

415
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,047
Do you swear to tell the truth,

416
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,924
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

417
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,281
I do, yes.

418
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,284
Thank you. Ms. Horton?

419
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,045
- Mr. Allen...
- Can I sit?

420
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,241
Please, just...

421
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,045
You are a crime scene investigator

422
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,368
for the Central City
Police Department, correct?

423
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,601
Uh...

424
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,561
Oh, this is so cool.

425
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,731
Well, I'm so glad you enjoy testifying,
but, please, just answer the question.

426
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,285
Of course.

427
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,250
Uh, "Yes, I am a CSI at the C.C.P.D."

428
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,411
"under the expert direction
of Julian Albert." Smiley face.

429
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,765
Wanna cut it out with the emojis?

430
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,731
Mr. Allen, can you tell me,

431
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,762
in your expert's opinion,

432
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,127
what substance do you see
in this photograph?

433
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,760
"Shellac is a resin
secreted by female lac bugs"

434
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,769
"found in large quantities
of the trees in Thailand."

435
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,331
That's too fast. That's...

436
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
Mr. Allen, are you all right?

437
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,528
Yes. I'm sorry. I'm fine. I just, um...

438
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,931
It's getting hot in here.

439
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,281
What else is unique about shellac flakes?

440
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,323
"It's the fire accelerant"

441
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,650
"used in all of the arson cases
associated with Heat Monger."

442
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,207
Such an embarrassing name.

443
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,282
I like it. I think it's great.

444
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,322
And how would you know
when shellac flakes have been used?

445
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,963
"We calculate flame temperature
and burn patterns,

446
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,643
"and a telltale sign is when shellac is
burned into potassium perchlorate

447
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,325
"or ammonium perchlorate,"

448
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,484
"which is considered
a high-temperature accelerant fire."

449
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,569
Hmm. So then

450
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,486
would you say the fires in these photos
would be considered

451
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,570
high-temperature accelerant fires?

452
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,526
Uh...

453
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,485
"Yes, because"...

454
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,250
Uh-oh.

455
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,251
- Um...
- Mr. Allen, can you continue?

456
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,162
Yes, I can... I can continue.

457
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,927
The... Yes, the fires were
high-temperature accelerant fires

458
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,881
<i>because the flames</i>

459
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,564
were very yellow.

460
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,000
JUDGE HANKERSONI "Very yellow"?

461
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,842
And that's your expert opinion
on accelerant fires? Mr. Allen?

462
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,607
Ms. Horton,
if Mr. Allen is unable to elaborate,

463
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,241
I'll have no choice but to dismiss.

464
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,606
- <i>Mr. Allen?</i>
- That's... Um...

465
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,530
<i>Dismissed.</i>

466
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,086
How'd it go?

467
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,442
Marvelous. They let the pyro go.

468
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,449
- What went wrong?
- Everything.

469
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,768
Barry's memory loss
is starting to become a problem.

470
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,971
It sure is. For more than just him.

471
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,246
I don't have my speed.

472
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,881
Not anymore, and I know why.

473
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,807
If you wanna fix this and help Barry,
you are gonna do exactly as I say.

474
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,887
And now this Heat Monger's gonna go free
because of me, and I feel awful.

475
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,411
Barry, it's not your fault.

476
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,961
Well, it's just that
now there's a bad guy on the streets,

477
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,924
and I can't do anything about it.

478
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,966
What?

479
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,764
Is that not something
I would've said before?

480
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,764
That is exactly something
you would've said before.

481
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,005
There is just something about you
that always wants to help.

482
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,250
This is our place?

483
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,527
How do we afford to live here?

484
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,001
Wow!

485
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,601
You have great taste.

486
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,280
Uh, actually, this is all you.

487
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,364
I find that hard to believe.

488
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,641
Is that me?

489
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,921
Yeah.

490
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,450
Who are these people?

491
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,363
They're your parents.

492
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,522
You don't remember anything
about what happened?

493
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,963
Why, did something bad happen?

494
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,200
They died.

495
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,969
It was unexpected,
but they died peacefully.

496
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
<i>That's why you came
to live with Joe and me.</i>

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,001
And that's when we met?

498
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,329
Uh, no, actually,
we were friends before then.

499
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,522
I remember the first time that I saw you.

500
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,690
You were the happiest boy
that I'd ever met.

501
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,881
I have a feeling
that's because you entered my life.

502
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,166
It's okay.

503
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,166
What the...

504
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,445
Barry! Are you okay?

505
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,920
What just happened to me?

506
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,684
These powers are so cool!

507
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,730
I can literally feel electricity
coursing through my body.

508
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,883
I mean, is it always like this?
This is amazing!

509
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,364
We just walked into a buzzkill.

510
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,046
My presence usually dampens the mood.

511
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,043
- Joe, don't!
- You fire, I'll fire.

512
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,248
- What the hell is she doing here?
<i>- She wants to help.</i>

513
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,601
- "Help"?
- With what?

514
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,450
With the fact that I lost my powers.

515
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,925
Barry, why don't you give us a minute?

516
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,963
Sure. Yeah. Are you, like, a supervillain?

517
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,208
Just asking. Okay.

518
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,486
How did this happen?

519
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,331
You got rid of Barry's memories.

520
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,922
What Barry remembers, Savitar remembers.

521
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,764
So Savitar's lost his memories, too?

522
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,485
Savitar loses his memory,

523
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,808
he doesn't go along
with the plan to give Wally powers.

524
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,280
Cause and effect.

525
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,927
But if you let me help you figure out
how to get Barry's memories back,

526
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,610
everything goes back to the way it was.

527
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,571
- Kid Flash runs again.
- And Savitar survives.

528
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,086
And Iris dies.

529
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,049
Life's full Of difficult choices.

530
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,241
Or it isn't.

531
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,841
If Savitar gets his memory back,
what's in it for you?

532
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,004
That's my business.

533
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,681
You think
that Barry can become the Flash?

534
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,128
Yeah, he can learn.

535
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,288
I still know how to do everything.
I can teach him.

536
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,843
Okay.
Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.

537
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,688
<i>But there's still
a lot of villains in this city,</i>

538
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,849
and no Flashes to protect it.

539
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,601
Is that really a chance
you're willing to take?

540
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,489
Hi! I'm still here.

541
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,411
- There you are.
- Because when you left, I stayed.

542
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,411
We've got to talk
about the elephant in the room.

543
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,728
But you know what?
I have a job to do.

544
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,046
We have to build that device!

545
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,441
We have got to focus on the task at hand.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

546
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,647
I totally understand.

547
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,051
From here on out, whenever I look
into your azure eyes flecked with gray

548
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,325
like a summer rainstorm
coming to kiss my lips,

549
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,121
the only thing I'm gonna be thinking about

550
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,406
is how I can best inspire
that beautiful, sexy brain.

551
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,086
Sparks.

552
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,841
Sparks.

553
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,241
You felt them, too?

554
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,521
- No.
- No?

555
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,370
- No, I mean, yes, obviously.
- Okay.

556
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,609
Sparks!
Jumping between two parallel wires.

557
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,763
A modified high-voltage climbing arc.

558
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,085
I guess my work here is done.

559
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,171
You should've never tried this
without Caitlin.

560
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,966
Well, we didn't really have
much of a choice, now did we?

561
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,128
Also, don't refer to yourself
in the third person.

562
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,203
<i>It's Caitlin. It's you.
It's the same person.</i>

563
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,680
It's just confusing.

564
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,609
Hand me the girard processor.

565
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,441
<i>It'll help me prime his neocortical
and medial frontal lobes.</i>

566
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,881
What?

567
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,045
Nothing.

568
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,085
Oh, golly! Look at us,

569
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,291
<i>just three musketeers working away.</i>

570
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,402
Just like old times, huh?

571
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,484
Hey, Julian, Caitlin ever tell you
about our time

572
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,210
working on the particle accelerator
with Ronnie?

573
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,925
<i>No. No, she did not.</i>

574
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,361
There was this one time,
we had this very strict deadline,

575
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,763
and Dr. Wells was super hard on us,
all of us, even Hartley.

576
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,121
Who's Hartley?

577
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,687
Oh, he was this guy we used to work with.
Such a dick.

578
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,486
You actually reminded me a lot of him
when you first came on board.

579
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,968
Anyway, so we were working
on the iridium plating for the, um...

580
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,163
What was it called, again?

581
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,685
The syncotron, that's what it was.

582
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,531
So, anyway, we were struggling,
and we were burning the midnight oil,

583
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,282
and we could not get the dubnium capacitor
to hold a single charge.

584
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,324
And so, all of a sudden,
Ronnie just loses all his chill.

585
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,091
<i>He turns beet red,
and he starts yelling at the thing,</i>

586
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,045
like, "Come on you dumb-nium capacitor"...

587
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,651
"Take charge."

588
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,810
Yes! Yes.

589
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,886
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

590
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,563
I think about
all the memories I cherish most,

591
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,969
and you're in every single one
of them, Caitlin.

592
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,170
Let's figure this out.

593
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,409
I don't wanna be here
any longer than I have to.

594
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,005
Suit yourself.

595
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,010
Okay! Guys, I still can't believe
I have these powers.

596
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,328
They're amazing. I mean...

597
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,880
I think that I could be a superhero.

598
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,764
What... All right, well,
is it cool if I run some more?

599
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,371
- Have at it.
- All right.

600
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,407
Mmm.

601
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,882
I haven't seen him
this happy in a long time.

602
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,967
Try ever.

603
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,004
It's the first time
he hasn't been weighed down

604
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,208
by the tragedies of his past, you know?

605
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,769
First time he's actually
been free of them.

606
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,162
You don't want
his memory restored, do you?

607
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,241
Dad, I...

608
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,287
I can't say
that seeing him happy and light

609
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,050
isn't something that I have wished for him

610
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,005
because, yeah, it is.

611
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,249
Sweetheart, I wish that for him, too,

612
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,487
but you didn't
fall in love with the Flash.

613
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,881
You fell in love with Barry Allen.

614
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,651
Dad, I know this is
a different version of him,

615
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,571
but he's still Barry.

616
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,966
No, he's not, honey.

617
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,729
Look, until yesterday,

618
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,288
Barry had 28 years of experiences
to define him.

619
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,847
And some of those memories were bad,
but some were good, too.

620
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,330
But without those memories,
the Barry Allen we know and love is gone.

621
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,886
I don't know, Dad.

622
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,964
You know, part of me can't help but think
that this is some sort of gift, you know?

623
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,766
That this is the life
that he was supposed to have.

624
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,322
Maybe this city doesn't need the Flash.

625
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,051
Hey, everybody.

626
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,770
Happy Friday.

627
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,641
So I am a superhero.

628
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,002
Yeah. A real good one.

629
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,203
You're the Flash.

630
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,602
You sure "the Streak"
isn't a better name, maybe?

631
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,527
Turn on the TV.

632
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,365
Uh, okay, yeah.

633
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,484
<i>Eyewitnesses say
the man who set fire</i>

634
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,170
<i>to the offices is
none other than Lucious Coolidge,</i>

635
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,487
<i>a.k. a. Heat Monger...</i>

636
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,165
That's the guy
that went free because of me.

637
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,840
At this rate, it won't be long
before the whole thing burns down.

638
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,326
There's hundreds of people
that work in there.

639
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,921
We need to stop it.

640
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,324
How? I mean, you can't right now.

641
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,686
No, but I can.

642
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,530
Barry, you don't know
how to use your powers.

643
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,210
- Barr...
- You just said I'm a superhero,

644
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,727
and a good one, right?
I mean, memories or not,

645
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,322
I can't stand by and watch people die
if I can prevent it.

646
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,125
Um, forgot the suit.

647
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,083
Barry, you okay?

648
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,290
Yeah, I'm good. Oh, stopping's hard.

649
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,283
How do I save everybody inside?

650
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,130
<i>You just run them out of there.</i>

651
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,647
I barely got here myself!

652
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,683
How am I supposed
to run with someone else?

653
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,211
There's got to be something we can do.

654
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,125
There is something we can do.
Jump-start his brain using that thing.

655
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,885
We have not done a test run.

656
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,366
There's no time to test it now.

657
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,561
What is that thing?

658
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,331
This can send electrical charges
through the transmitters in his suit,

659
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,727
and, theoretically,
it should jolt his memories.

660
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,843
You want to electroshock his brain?

661
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,161
Won't that fry it even more?

662
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,124
If we don't do that,
all the people are gonna die.

663
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,046
Life's a game of chance.

664
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,444
Okay, Barry, you're gonna feel something.
It might hurt, might sting, might suck.

665
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,641
Wait. What?

666
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,968
Probably all three. Okay, here we go!

667
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,321
Barry?

668
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,801
Barry?

669
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,089
Uh, yeah, I still don't remember.

670
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,364
Why didn't that work?
That was supposed to work.

671
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,723
We kick-started his temporal lobe.
Now he just needs to access it.

672
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,288
Gas is in the tank.
We just need to turn on the ignition.

673
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,449
We need a visceral memory
to spark his brain.

674
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,041
Okay.

675
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,241
Okay.

676
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,370
Barry, I need you to remember.

677
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,964
- I can't!
- Yes. Yes, you can, okay?

678
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,924
<i>Okay, listen to me.</i>

679
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,130
The night that your morn died,
I didn't wanna tell you how,

680
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,890
but she didn't die peacefully.

681
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,161
- She was murdered.
- What?

682
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,642
And you came to live with us.

683
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,645
<i>My dad brought you inside,
and you were in shock.</i>

684
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,763
<i>You weren't even crying.</i>

685
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:46,085
<i>And later that night, a sound woke me,
and I crawled out of my bed,</i>

686
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,330
and I realized that
the sound was coming from downstairs.

687
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,081
<i>I peered over the banister,
and I found you crying alone.</i>

688
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,843
And I knew I had to go to you.

689
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,809
I sat next to you,
and you put your head in my lap,

690
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,241
<i>and I held you while you cried.</i>

691
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,450
And I didn't know it then,
but now, looking back,

692
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,650
I realize that
that was the night that we fell in love.

693
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,928
<i>That was the night that we realized
how much we needed each other.</i>

694
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,969
And, look, I so wish
that I could take your dark memories away.

695
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,366
I wish that I could make all of that
pain go away, but I can't, okay?

696
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,449
<i>But what I do know, what I know,</i>

697
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,090
is that for every bad memory,

698
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,409
there is a good one
that will get you through it.

699
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,965
<i>Run, Barry! Run!</i>

700
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,767
Barry?

701
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,121
I remember.

702
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,891
I remember.

703
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,645
I remember everything.

704
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,604
I remember everything.

705
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,610
Now, for this fire.

706
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,726
I don't think
I can put this fire out alone!

707
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,965
You don't have to.

708
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,131
Yes!

709
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,246
Looks like you remembered
how to save the day.

710
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,050
Like riding a bike.

711
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,770
<i>- Your mother's maiden name?</i>
<i>- Thompson.</i>

712
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,691
CODIS is an acronym for what?

713
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,687
Combined DNA Index System.

714
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,011
Okay, in the third grade,
you renamed the class hamster to?

715
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,845
Alexander Ham Bell.

716
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,286
I was eight years old.

717
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,891
So you got your memories back.

718
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,244
Now we can all focus our attention
on stopping Savitar.

719
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,010
Good luck with that.

720
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,642
Please tell me we're not gonna
just let her walk out of here.

721
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,681
Now you wanna fight?

722
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,126
We don't wanna fight you.

723
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,089
Can't really avoid that, now can we?

724
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,448
Yeah, we can. You can stay here with us.

725
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,967
<i>We're your friends, your family.</i>

726
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,649
Caitlin, I can fix you.

727
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,601
You already tried.

728
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,001
Well, then I'll try harder.

729
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,488
I don't care what it takes.
I don't care what I have to do.

730
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,883
I swear to you, I will find you a cure.

731
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,890
Caitlin, I love you.

732
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,845
I don't love you, Julian.

733
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,961
I never did.

734
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,562
I never loved any of you.

735
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,686
She's gone?

736
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,401
Yeah.

737
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,369
Maybe too far gone now.

738
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,808
We'll figure out a way to get her back.

739
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,241
Just like we figured out
how to get you back.

740
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,850
You sure this is the me you want?
With all the baggage?

741
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,321
Seeing you without
the weight of everything that's happened,

742
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,763
<i>seeing you happy like you were
before your mother was killed...</i>

743
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,369
Without all of that darkness haunting you,
you were finally free.

744
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,811
It was nice.

745
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,442
I did the same thing months ago.

746
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,606
What do you mean?

747
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,242
That freedom? I had that.

748
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,444
When I was with my mom and dad again
in Flashpoint,

749
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,444
and I could've let it stay like that.

750
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,445
I could've let the memories
of this timeline fade,

751
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,001
but if I'd done that,
I would've lost Joe and Cisco

752
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,527
and Wally and Caitlin and you.

753
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,450
Pain and darkness, it's a part of me.

754
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,324
You know, I need it to fuel me,

755
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,966
to push me to be a better person,
to be a better hero.

756
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,682
Keep me from ever forgetting who I am.

757
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,651
Now that is the Barry Allen
I know and love.

758
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,611
Hey, you guys... Okay!

759
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,524
You guys, you've got to come see this.

760
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,643
You've got to come see this.

761
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,166
What is that?

762
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,967
This is the Speed Force bazooka.
Good, right?

763
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,321
And that's gonna trap Savitar?

764
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,369
There is a tiny little problem.

765
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,688
- What's that?
- It's, uh...

766
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,204
In order to generate enough power
to magnetize Savitar's radial field

767
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,564
and keep him in a state of
perpetual stasis inside the Speed Force,

768
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,041
we need, by my calculations,
3.86 terajoules of energy.

769
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,403
I'm guessing that's more energy
than in a triple-A battery.

770
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,721
<i>Yes!</i>

771
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,365
That's more energy than in the sun.

772
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,526
Guys, where are we gonna find
something like that?

773
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:42,550
