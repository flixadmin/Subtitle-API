what is the fastest way
to exterminate a raccoon?

163
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,602
Hi, Ozzy. Hello! You're glad to see me.

164
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,853
You don't eat garbage, do you?

165
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,022
What's that?

166
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,526
- Is that what I think it is?
- Uh-huh. Open it.

167
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,986
Oh, it's kind of small. Is that bad?

168
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,780
Just open it.

169
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,537
[exhales] "Dear Thomas,

170
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,456
We have reviewed your application
to the San Francisco Police Department,

171
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,209
and pending interdepartmental review
and background check,

172
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,462
we are happy to inform you that you have
been selected to join our team."

173
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,172
- [laughs] Oh, my God!
- Wow.

174
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,174
Oh, my God.

175
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,634
Ta-da!

176
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,137
"San Francisco Sucks."

177
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,430
Oh! [groans]

178
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,515
Wrong one!

179
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,686
Ta-da! [laughs]

180
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,523
- You never had a doubt, huh?
- No! Mm-mmm.

181
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,987
- I can't believe this.
- Oh, I know! You did it.

182
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,115
Hey, what are those?

183
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,743
Apartments for rent I found on Zillow.

184
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,454
I thought Ozzy and I
could fly there tomorrow

185
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,416
and check out some neighborhoods.

186
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,252
I mean, this is all happening so fast.

187
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,005
Oh, man... It's the craziest thing.

188
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,340
You apply for the job, you get the job.

189
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,925
Well, pending a background check.

190
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,093
Oh, man.

191
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,597
Hope they don't find out about that time
you used the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

192
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,640
Correction: I'm still using
the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

193
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,644
[laughs] But, Maddie,
are you sure you're okay with this?

194
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,771
Thomas Michael Wachowski,

195
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,191
what did you do the entire time
I was in veterinary school?

196
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,693
I worked a second job
to pay the rent and...

197
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,111
A third job to pay tuition.

198
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,115
You sacrificed for me.
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

199
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,077
Babe, are you sure you're okay with this?

200
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,748
I mean, there's been
a Wachowski protecting this town

201
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,791
for more than 50 years.

202
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,211
This is a big change.

203
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,588
I'm positive.

204
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,217
It's time for this guy to
get out there and prove himself.

205
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,179
I love Green Hills, but, you know,
I want to help people in real trouble.

206
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,474
I want someone to turn to me
in a life-and-death situation

207
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,934
and I'll be there for 'em.

208
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,144
I get it.

209
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,189
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

210
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,523
Mmm!

211
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,068
And so it is with a heavy heart,
that I tell you all

212
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,363
that I've accepted a position
at the San Francisco Police Department,

213
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,156
effective immediately.

214
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,035
It's gonna be tough to leave my hometown
and all my friendships.

215
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,121
But this is something
I feel like I need to do

216
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,293
to grow... as both an officer and a man.

217
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,215
What do you think, Sergeant Sprinkles?

218
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,968
That wasn't so bad, right?

219
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,012
Now all I got to do is...

220
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,556
tell everyone who isn't a donut.

221
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,684
[kids yelling]

222
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,978
Whoa, the playoffs!

223
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,856
[crowd cheering]

224
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,819
[cheers and applause]

225
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,316
Oh! So cool.

226
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,488
Bottom of the ninth, tie score.

227
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,117
And exactly who you want at the plate
with the game on the line: Sonic!

228
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,994
But staring him down
from the pitcher's mound

229
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,289
is the most fearsome southpaw
in Green Hills:

230
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,749
Also Sonic.

231
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,292
Okay. Focus, Sonic.

232
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,337
If you win this game, you'll be
the most beloved kid in Green Hills.

233
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,050
[armpit fart noise]

234
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,219
Hit it to the guy in left!
He's a real space case.

235
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,391
[groans] I can't with that guy.

236
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:14,604
Hey, batter Sonic. Hey, batter Sonic.
"Suh-wing," batter Sonic.

237
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,153
[sniffing, gasps]

238
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,613
I got it, I got it, I got it!

239
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,907
I don't got it.

240
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,834
Go home! Go home!

241
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,669
Come on!

242
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,214
[yells]

243
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,634
Safe!

244
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,806
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! I did it!

245
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,683
Did you see that? I did it. I did it.

246
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,235
[crickets chirping]

247
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,782
I really am alone.

248
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,035
All alone. Forever.

249
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,086
[electricity crackling]

250
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,888
[panting]

251
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,766
[yells]

252
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,235
[satellite powers down]

253
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,698
I'm sure no one noticed that
giant blue explosion, right?

254
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,200
[lines ringing]

255
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,623
[cell phone rings]

256
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,626
- Hey, Wade.
- Hi, Tom.

257
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,420
Uh, Wade here. [nervous chuckle]

258
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,172
What is going on?

259
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,715
Well, gosh, I think the power's out.

260
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,594
Yeah, no dur! The lights are out.
The whole town is freaking out.

261
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,679
- What should I do?
- [Tom] <i>Okay, relax.</i>

262
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,598
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

263
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,517
see if they can locate
the downed line, then...

264
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,270
call Zim and see if he can
get his generator over to the Super Q

265
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,646
so the food stays... fresh.

266
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,484
[Wade] <i>Call Zim before Gil?</i>

267
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,986
<i>- Call Gil... Hello?</i>
- I'll call you back.

268
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,322
Wait! Hello? Was that
the end of the instructions?

269
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,698
[phones ringing]

270
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,826
Okay, all right. Uh, you can do this.

271
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,747
What was the first thing he said to do?

272
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,501
Right. Relax.

273
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,096
[electricity crackling]

274
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,898
Twenty minutes ago, an energy surge

275
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,484
knocked out power
across the entire Pacific Northwest.

276
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,568
What do we know?

277
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,071
Well, our first instinct
was it was an EMP.

278
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,574
But electromagnetic pulses
don't have that kind of power.

279
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,244
NASA has ruled out
meteor strikes or solar flares.

280
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,746
The Department of Energy says
it's not a power plant malfunction.

281
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,707
Well, sounds like we're really good
at figuring out what it wasn't.

282
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,085
This could be a prelude
to a larger attack.

283
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,254
I'm suggesting we scramble
the Fifth and Sixth Regiment.

284
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,505
No, no, no, no.

285
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,132
This needs a much more sophisticated mind.

286
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,009
Someone who understands technology.

287
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,845
- You want to send in a lab rat?
- Not just any lab rat.

288
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,430
A lab rat with teeth.

289
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,683
You're not suggesting
who I think you're suggesting.

290
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,518
- I know, he's a little weird.
- Weird?

291
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,145
- No. No way.
- He's a psychological tire fire!

292
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,649
But he's also brilliant.
Five PhDs, IQ off the charts.

293
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,402
And his drone tech is revolutionary!

294
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,362
You're sure he can handle this?

295
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,364
He has a perfect operations record.

296
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,366
- Remember the coup in Pakistan?
- No.

297
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,909
Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan?

298
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,078
- That's not even a country.
- Exactly.

299
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,372
And you can thank Robotnik for that.

300
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,584
I can't believe you're
bringing that freak into this.

301
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,003
Neither can I, but...

302
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,046
we have no choice.

303
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,716
[helicopters whirring]

304
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,056
[indistinct shouts]

00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,186
[truck rumbling]

306
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,865
What the...

307
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,659
[air hissing]

308
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,347
Are you in charge here?

309
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,598
- Yes, I am...
- Nope!

310
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,599
- My...
- Wrong!

311
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,017
- Name...
- I'm in charge!

312
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,435
- Is Major...
- Me!

313
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,604
- Ben...
- [whispers] I'm in charge.

314
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,649
You've never seen
anything like this before.

315
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:14,654
It says I'm the top banana
in a world full of hungry little monkeys.

316
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,114
Allow me to clarify.
[makes servo noise]

317
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,867
In a sequentially ranked hierarchy
based on level of critical importance,

318
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,078
the disparity between us
is too vast to quantify.

319
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,455
- Agent Stone?
- The Doctor thinks you're basic.

320
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,624
I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

321
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,293
Ten miles in every direction
should suffice.

[whirring]

323
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,963
- Is he still looking at me funny?
- Yes, he is.

324
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,757
Tell him to stop
or I'll pull up his search history.

325
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,550
If you don't stop looking at the Doctor,

326
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,302
- he'll take a closer look...
- I'm not deaf.

327
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,929
And tell him his men report to me now.

328
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,389
Blah-blah-blah.

329
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:44,141
Excuse me? Listen, pal,
I don't know if you realize...

330
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,060
I'm sorry, Major. What was your name?

331
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,688
- Benning...
- Nobody cares!

332
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,274
Nobody cares. Listen, Major Nobody Cares.

333
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,652
[whispering] You know why
nobody cares who you are?

334
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,113
Because nobody cares about
your feeble accomplishments.

335
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,074
And nobody cares how proud your mommy is

336
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,660
that you're now reading
at a third-grade level.

337
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,954
- Mmm.
- Have you finished <i>Charlotte's Web</i> yet?

338
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,289
Spoiler alert: She dies in the end.

339
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,417
But she leaves a big creepy egg sac.

340

[machinery clicks, whirring]

Ah... my babies.

342
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,091
Whoo! Look what came out of my egg sac.

343
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,260
You know what I love about machines?

344
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,556
They do what they're told.
They follow their programming.

345
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,976
They don't need time off to get drunk
and put the boat in the water.

346
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,562
Now you do what you're told.

347
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,356
Stand over there on the edge
of your personal abyss...

348
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,443
and watch my machines do your job.

349
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,656
- Can you feel it, Stone?
- I can feel it, Doctor.

350
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,951
- It's evolution, Stone.
- [drones whirring]

It's evolution!

- Doctor.

00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,534
Do you see anything useful in this image?

356
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,538
- Nothing at all, Doctor.
- Of course you don't.

357
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,499
Your eyes weren't
expertly trained to spot tracks

358

That's extraordinary.

361
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:50,142
No. What's extraordinary is,
I've determined the exact height, weight

362
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,769
and spinal curvature of this creature,

363

and my computer
can't find a single match for it

anywhere in Earth's animal kingdom.

365
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:02,571
This blackout was not a terrorist attack,
and that's no baby bigfoot.

366
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,158
This guy is something else...

367
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,203
entirely.

368
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,039
Divert all search units
to the site of the footprint.

369
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,501
That's one small step for man,

370
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,878
one giant leap for me.

Okay, okay, everything is fine.

00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,310
You played some baseball,
got a little upset,

lightning shot out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.

All right, all right.
Earth isn't safe anymore.

377
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,527
Time for plan B. Mushroomville.

378
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,405
But I gotta take my stuff.
Okay, essential items only.

379
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,824
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night-light.

380

Funny hat. This half-eaten cantaloupe.

Oh, and my scented candle.

382
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,080
My entire comic book collection.
Bean bag chair.

383
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,748
Can a bean bag chair fit in a backpack?

384
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,667
No, no, no. Of course not. That's stupid.

385
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,546
Okay, what else? The rings!
The rings, yes, of course.

386
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,215
Here we go. Ring time.

Ah, that sounds... half-fun.

Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.

The whole town went dark.

- Wade must have lost his mind.

And he does not have much to lose.

401
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,920
How's your sister?
Did she convince you to leave me yet?

402
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,256
No, but she did tell me
to check your phone for dating apps.

403
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,425
<i>The only apps on my phone
are the ones that came with it.</i>

And they are in for a surprise.

Your surprise better not be

I'm kidding. I'm just gonna
use it to scare 'em.

It didn't work out on Earth,
but that's okay.

You're going to a safe world.

423

A nice, safe world full of mushrooms.

479
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,690
I'm... from the power company,
investigating the blackout.

480
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,110
If you don't mind, I'd like to take
a few readings inside your house?

481
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,820
No kidding? You're from the power company?

482
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,447
- Mmm.
- Oh, you must know my buddy Spencer.

483
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,283
- We play softball together.
- Ah! Spence.

484
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,368
He's a good man.

485
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,914
- Yeah. Come on in!
- Great.

486
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,373
Take all the readings you need.

487
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,209
Except, uh...

488
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,337
doesn't the power company usually take
their readings from outside the house?

489
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,464
That way they can check them
even if you're not home.

490
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,550
Also, my buddy Spencer
works for the gas company,

491
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,219
and he's more of an Ultimate Frisbee guy.

492
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,930
So, you want to tell me
why you think I'm dumb enough

493
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,556
to just let you walk inside my house?

494
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,685
[beeping]

495
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,734
- I'm sorry, Mister...
- Wachowski.

496
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,694
But everyone calls me Tom.

497
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,655
Except my dentist, he calls me Tim.

498
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,366
But it's gone on for so long now
that it would be weird if I corrected him.

499
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,577
Well, Tom, whose dentist calls him Tim,

500
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,373
you may have noticed that this entire town
has been experiencing a power outage.

501
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,500
Yep, no lights. Picked up on that.

502
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,419
Twenty minutes ago, I tracked
an energy pulse with a similar signature

503
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,588
to the one that caused that disruption.

504
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,438
Listen, uh, Mister...

505
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,898
Doctor.

506
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,651
Dr. Robotnik. But my dentist calls me Rob.

507
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,444
Hmm.

508
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,906
Look, uh, Dr. Robotskeez.

509
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,075
Um, I'm sure what you're here for
is very serious,

510
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,535
but it's got nothing to do with me.

511
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,911
You can ask anyone in town.

512
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,955
- Everyone knows me.
- I bet they do.

513
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,292
I'm sure you're hella popular
with the Jebs and Merles and Billy Bobs,

514
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,961
in this glorified gas-station rest stop.

515
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,171

to the days of tippin' cows

And maybe someday you'll achieve your goal

519
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,807
of getting a Costco card
or adopting a Labradoodle.

520
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:14,479
But the reality is, I surpassed
everything you're ever going to do...

521
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,357
before I was a toddler.

522
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,361
I was spitting out formulas
while you were still spitting up formula.

523
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,238
I was breastfed, actually.

524
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,325
Nice. Rub that in my orphan face.

525
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,243
Mr. Wachowski,

526
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:33,040
are you familiar with US Code 904,
Title 10, Article 104?

527
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,500
- Yeah, who isn't...
- "Anyone...

528
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:39,338
who attempts to aid an enemy
of the United States shall suffer death."

529
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,300
And if I'm the one that catches you,

530
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,593
it'll be even worse.

531
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,013
Worse than death?

Oh, I hope they aren't
scanning me with X-rays.

537
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,318
I had kind of an embarrassing lunch.

538
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,828
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

Here's the thing.

I'm never wrong.

Well, first time for everything, I guess.

00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,054
Straight shot, can't miss it.

636
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,263
Fine. That's cool.

637
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,182
I'm totally cool saying goodbye now.

638
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:33,483
So, as I crashed into the cold,
dark water of the Pacific,

639
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,276
I realized a few things.

640
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,321
A, I have no idea where I'm going.

641
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,657
B, saltwater stings.

642
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,036
C, I shouldn't even be on
this planet right now, but I am.

643
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,996
Why? Because you shot me!

644
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,998
- I know.
- You shot me!

645
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:53,253
All right, I heard you the first time.
You don't have to pile it on. Good grief.

646
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,214
I'm wet. I'm cold.

647
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,174
There's a fish on my head!

648
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,469
And clearly, I'm not gonna be able
to do this on my own.

649
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,768
[sighs] All right, get in the truck.

650
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,603
Really? You're gonna help me?

651
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,273
I guess it is a little bit my fault
that all this is happening to you.

652
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,484
Not a little bit. Entirely.
It is entirely your fault.

653
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,278
Okay, it's entirely my fault.
Are you coming?

654
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:19,904
Yes.

655
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,908
Road trip! Whoop-whoop!

656
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,618
[sighs] What am I doing?

657
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,580
[Tom] All right, there's
gonna be rules on this trip.

658
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,499
Number one,
do exactly as I say all the time.

659
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,668
- Got it?
- Got it, Donut Lord.

660

Would you stop with the "Donut Lord"?

661
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,797
I have a name. It's Tom.

662

I'm Sonic.

663

Sonic. Sonic.

664
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,638
So you've been spying on us all for years.

665
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,098
I mean, I wouldn't call it "spying."

666
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,726
We were all just hanging out,
only I wasn't invited

667
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,186
and no one knew I was there.

668
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,772
I can't believe Crazy Carl
was right all this time.

669
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,566
Yeah. You should call him
Super Observant Carl instead.

670
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,986

- We gotta see it!
- No. No.

673
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,285
No, this is not some
fun family road trip, okay?

674
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:11,080
The government wants to dissect you
and arrest me. This is serious.

675
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,250
Eh, you're right, it was lame.

676
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,753
Gift shop was cool, though.
I got you a mouse pad.

677
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,505
When are we gonna get there?

678
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,673
We will get there when we get there.

679
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,654
I'm gonna go check in with Wade,
see if he knows what's going on.

680
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,240
You're gonna see Wade in that glass thing?

What is it, a teleportation box?

682
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,119
It's a pay phone.

683
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,581
It's mostly for drug dealers
and fugitives from the law, which is us.

684
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,291
Stay in the car.
I don't want anybody seeing you.

685

Hello. Green Hills Police Department.

00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,673
- Wade, it's me.
<i>- Hi.</i>

701
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,049
I'm so glad that you called.

702
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,802
Uh, so, some guys came in
asking some questions.

703
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,554
Uh, they're a little creepy.

704
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,307
Kind of reminded me of

Um, questions about terrorism?
[nervous chuckle]

This is really important.

Don't tell them that we talked, okay?

I want you to know
that the only other person

717
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,176
who ever punched me in the face
was the school bully.

718
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,803
He hit me in the cafeteria,
causing a blunt-force contusion

719
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,514
to the soft tissue
surrounding my orbital bone.

720

Humiliated me in front of
the entire school!

721

And do you know what I did in response?

722
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,605
Uh, I'm assuming that you reported him
to the principal's office

723
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,565
'cause that kind of behavior
is really unacceptable.

724
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,944
No. I examined the inefficiency of a world
where brawn trumped brain,

950
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,173
Let's drop this increasingly humiliating
topic of conversation.

951
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,966
Bucket list. Give it to me!

952
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,594
Okay, there is one thing.

953
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,681
In Green Hills, I've always felt,

954
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:07,059
I don't know, more like a babysitter
than a real cop, you know?

955
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,062
So I want a chance to prove myself,
under real pressure.

956
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,399
I'm gonna move to San Francisco,
become a street cop.

957
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,984
And, I don't know,
see if I have what it takes.

958
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,112
What?

959
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,989
Why... Why is your face doing that?

960
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,033
You're leaving Green Hills?

961
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,785
Okay.

962
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,621
B-B-But why?
Why would you leave Green Hills?

963
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,290
This may be hard for you to understand,
but Green Hills is a small town.

964
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,583
It's a very small town.

965
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,503
Uh, it's not small.
There are hundreds of people.

966
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,004
That's a small town, dude!

967
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,924
It's a perfect town,
and the people need you.

968
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,386
Please. I clean out their gutters.
I jump-start their cars in the winter.

969
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,804
They could call anybody to do that.

970
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,473
Sure, they can call anybody,
but they don't.

971
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,933
They call you.

977
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,843
- You're not making any sense.
- Would you calm down?

978
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,554
You come from a great town
with great people and, by my count,

979
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,556
zero bad guys trying to kill you!

980
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,561
Besides, what could possibly
be more important

981
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,396
than protecting the people you care about?

You're not the Donut Lord at all.

I have no idea.

I'll take care of this.

Now your niece is an accessory to treason.

1109
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,253
- No, she's not.
- Would you calm down?

1110
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:57,339
Calm down? I will not calm down!

1111
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,049
- Enough.
- Yes, calm down. Stop talking.

1112
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,301
No. Ozzy, please. Good to see you too.

1113
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,179
Oh, little Lord Baby Jesus.

1114
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,555
What is that, Tom?

1115
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,015
Is that plutonium? Is it e-mails?

1116
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,808
- Yes, it's plutonium.
- [Ozzy growls]

1117
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,644
Can we please go in
the other room and talk...

1118
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,937
Stop it, Ozzy. Quit it!

1119
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,521
This is why I told you he was no good.

1120
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,982
- [Maddie] I'm not engaging.
- No, Ozzy, quit it.

1121
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,943
[both arguing]

1122
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,195
Ozzy, no! Ozzy, no!

1123
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,698
- Oh, catch me, Jojo.
- [thuds]

1124
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,284
[panting] Oh, thank God.

1125
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:29,579
[chuckles] Can I get a glass of water?

1126
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,172

I just thought you might like a latte
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

1137
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,519
Who do I look like, an imbecile?

1138
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,814
Of course I want a latte.
I love the way you make them!

Ready the prototype.

1141
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,825
With this kind of power,

1142
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:34,829
my machines can finally reach
their full potential.

1143
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,004
[Tom] He's gonna be okay, Jojo.

1144
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,092
Oh, thank God. He's gonna be okay, right?

1145
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,677
I'm a vet, Tom. I don't even know
what I'm looking at here.

1146
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,888
He's a hedgehog. Or so he says.

1147
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,640
- It talks?
- Almost constantly.

1148
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,351
Okay. [clears throat]

1149
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,269
- Holy...
- What?

1150
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,813
His pulse is super-fast.

1151
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,731
That actually might be normal for him.

1152
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,441
I don't know. You gotta help him, Maddie.

1153
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:05,276
I don't know his physiology.

1154
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,904
He doesn't seem to have any broken bones.

1155
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,198
He's just really banged up.

1156
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,702
Oh, look at his poor little feet.

1157

[Maddie sighs]

1158
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,542
[Tom] Hang in there, buddy.
You're gonna be all right.

1159
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,339
Jojo? Untie your mother. Jojo!

1160
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,508
[sweetly] Untie Mommy.

1161

Sweetie. Jojo!

1162
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,390
[quietly] I have to go to the bathroom.

1163
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,600
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Uh...

1164
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,602
He'll snap out of this.
He'll wake up soon?

1165
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:41,354
Oh, smelling salts!

1166
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:44,816
Don't you have, like, vet smelling salts,
like, for cats or parakeets or something?

1167
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:48,319
- No. They don't make cat smelling salts.
- They should.

1168
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:52,574
I have human smelling salts
in my human first aid kit.

1169
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,201
Okay.

1170
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,580
- [whispers] Here we go.
- Come on, buddy.

1171
01:05:58,663 --> 01:05:59,914
Gotta go fast!

1172
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,669
Whoa. Where am I? What year is it?

1173
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,087
Is The Rock president?

1174
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:07,505
Whoa, buddy, you're okay. Calm down.

1175
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:08,798
Oh, hi, Pretzel Lady!

1176
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,341
Hi.

1177
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,510
- Tom?
- Yeah.

1178
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:13,761
Can I talk to you, please?

1179
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,267
Space hedgehog, stay there. Try to rest.

1180
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,935
You got it. I am great at resting.

1181
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:22,979
I rest faster than anybody.
[continues, indistinct]

1182
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,063
Still talking.

1183
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,940
Uh, first of all, can we take a moment

1184
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,734
to acknowledge how
under control I've been?

1185
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,527
- Amazing.
- Didn't freak out.

1186
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,946
- No.
- Totally calm.

1187
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,240
- Thank you.
- Ahh.

1188
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,451
Second of all... [strained laugh]

1189
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,370
What the heck is going on?
Is that thing an alien?

1190
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:43,208
Okay, so, remember how Crazy Carl
is always going on about the blue devil?

1191
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,709
The blue devil!

1192
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,920
- That's him? He's real?
- Yeah.

1193
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,963
What is he doing here?
What are you doing here?

1194
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:53,468
I... kinda sorta... shot our
little blue friend with your tranq gun.

1195
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,095
- No, you did not.
- I didn't mean to.

1196
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,139
Okay. This is kinda hard
for me to explain.

1197
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,974
And it's gonna sound a little bit crazy.

1198
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,227
He has to get to
the Transamerica building,

1199
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,686
and I promised I'd take him.

1200
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,022
Uh-uh! Aliens?

1201
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,566
Maddie, your husband's lost his mind.

1202
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,652
Use this as an opportunity to leave him.

1203
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,445
No one would judge you.

1204
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,118
So you won't hurt your feet anymore.

1205
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,704
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1206
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,541
No one's ever given me a gift before.

1207
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,377
I gotta check that off my bucket list.

1208
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,220
[laughs]

1209
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,597
- All right! Looking good!
- [Jojo giggles]

1210
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,476
Okay.

1211
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,062
You said you wanted to help
people in real trouble, right?

1212
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,398
Well, that's what you're doing.

1213
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,985
Blue alien hedgehogs
still count as people. Right?

1214
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,361
- I think so too.
- Yeah.

1215
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,654
- I think.
- Okay.

1216
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,906
I love you. Did I tell you that already?

1217
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,825
I don't deserve you. You know that?

1218
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,201
I know that.

1219
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:07,250
So, you're supposed to be Tom's
best friend that he won't shut up about.

1220
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,002
[panting]

1221
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,545
Well, I don't see the appeal.

1222
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,965
[laughing] Stop!

1223
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,259
That is very gross.

1224
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:18,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

1225
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,181
So, my truck still runs,
but it's pretty much totaled.

1226
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,267
You think your sister would mind
if we borrowed her car?

1227
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,935
You have got to be kidding me!

1228
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,521
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah, let's do that.

1229
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:29,897
Mm-hmm.

1230
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,275
This is my house!

1231
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,485
- [horn honking]
- [Sonic] Coming through!

1232
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,572
Whoa, whoa! Now this is my turn,
and I go around you.

1233
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,742
Sorry! And... perfect park.

1234
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,077
- [man] What are you, crazy?
- Is there anything you didn't hit?

1235
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,871
Why did we let the alien drive?

1236
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,915
Hey, I got us here.
And please, five stars.

1237
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:52,962
- So, this is it?
- That's it. That's your pyramid.

1238
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,131
[Sonic] Wow, look at that thing!

1239
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,382
What happens now?

1240
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,886
- Oh. He's... gone.
- Yep.

1241
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,598
No good. You need a special key
to get to the roof.

1242
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,975
What now?

1243
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:09,395
Time for me to abuse
the power entrusted to me.

1244
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:20,823
We got a jumper on the roof.

1245
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,743
Gotta get up there fast or we're gonna
have a human pancake on our hands.

1246
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,079
You came all the way from Montana.

1247
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,915
Yeah. That's how serious it is.

1248
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:34,796
Okay.

1249
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,007
You just saved a life.

1250
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,477
[Sonic] How much longer?
I can't breathe in here.

1251
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:54,107
Hello? Anybody there?

1252
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,943
- Do you have your child in that bag?
- No.

1253
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,154
I mean, yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.

1254
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,281
It's not your child.

1255
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,867
Relax. I'm a cop, okay?

1256
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,411
Plus, he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?

1257
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:07,995
[Sonic] Why would I like it in here?

1258
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,915
This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.

1259
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,836
- Such a kidder.
- [laughs]

1260
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,338
- [Maddie] Okay.
- No, I'm scared of the dark!

1261
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,298
Is anybody there?

1262
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,144

[groans] What were you
keeping in this bag?

1264
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,023
A jar of pickled farts?

1265
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:37,608
All right. What are we looking for?

1266
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,280
- [ring chimes]
- This.

1267
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:45,074
Okay. What happens now?

1268
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,993
Now all I have to do
is think of where I want

1269
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,203
the other end of the ring
to appear, and I throw it.

1270
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,330
So that's it? We did it?

1271
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,749
Yeah. We did it!

1272
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:57,044
Hey. Sorry we didn't get to do
everything on your bucket list, pal.

1273
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,839
It's okay.
I did the ones I needed the most.

1274
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,301
[chuckles] You two are so cute.

1275
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,636
- Oh, please. What?
- We are not.

1276
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,054
No. We're not cute.

1277
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,807
We are a couple of loose cannons
just living by our own rules.

1278
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:10,892
Exactly.

1279
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,101
- [Maddie] Really?
- [Tom] Yeah.

1280
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,937
And our rules include
expressing heartfelt emotions.

1281
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,439
If you say so.

1282
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,941
- Okay, then.
- All right.

1283
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,069
- Um, you gotta go, right?
- [Sonic] Yeah, I gotta go.

1284
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,404
I gotta go. We gotta go too.

1285
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,072
See... All right, bye-bye.

1286

Just one more thing.

I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1288

I know it's a tough decision
for you to leave Green Hills.

1289
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:51,933
Walking away from something
you care about has to be painful.

You're not sure
you really want to go, huh?

1291
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,689
I don't want to go, but I can't stay.

1292
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,275
As long as I'm here,
I put everyone in danger.

1293
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,402
I can't do that.

1294
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:08,366
I just want you to know that
these last two days have been

1295
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,993
the best two days of my life.

1296
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:15,748
You know, I never thought I'd say this,

1297
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,417
but I'm actually gonna miss you,
you little blue devil.

1298
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,211
I'll miss you too, Donut Lord.

1299
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,255
Thank you.

1300

For what?

1301
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,384
For saving my life.

Are you enjoying the clam chowder?

1308
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,772
It's the government wack job

Unsuccessfully!

Yeah, what are you wearing?

1312
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:33,075
It's a flight suit, designed to modulate
my body temperature and reduce drag.

1313
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,744
Yeah, and yet you still are one.

1314
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,621
Ooh-hoo! Good one.

1315
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:38,664
You are catching fire, Thomas.

1316
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:41,125
Oh, and speaking of heat,
I see you've taken a lover.

1317
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,835
Does she have a name

1318
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,338
or should we just call her
"collateral damage"?

1319
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,547
[Tom] Hey, watch your mouth.

1320
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:49,008
Unless you want a little more
of what I gave you earlier?

1321
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,551
I punched him in the face.

1322
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,887
Oh! He punched him right in the face!
It was awesome!

1323
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,890
The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.

1324
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:59,143
Your flying eggs are pretty
impressive, Mr. Eggman,

1325
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,520
but let's face it, you'll never catch me.

01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,006
That's why I don't have friends.

1423
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,174
Next thing you know,
you're somebody's best man.

1424
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,759
They want to have the wedding out of town.

1425
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,886
Like nobody has anything better to do!

1426
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,764
- Anyway, where were we?
- [groans]

1427
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,392
Oh, yes. You were about to die.

1428
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,561
[gunshot ricochets]

1429
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,354
That's our sheriff you're messing with.

1430
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,066
- And our blue devil...
- [chain saw revs]

1431
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,361
who, as everyone can see,
is a very real creature,

1432
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:26,864
and not at all invented by me.

1433
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:29,408
[chain saw idles]

1434
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,285
- Oh, careful.
- Just... Just put it away.

1435
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,578
Tom?

1436
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,177
I don't mean to be indelicate here,

1437
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,680
but someone should get some ice,
keep the body fresh.

1438
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,935
He's just a silly little alien.

1439
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:58,854
He didn't belong here!

1440
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,358
That little alien

1441
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,737
knew more about being human
than you ever will.

1442
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,530
His name was Sonic.

1443
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:10,866
This was his home.

1444
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,369
And he was my friend.

1445
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,789
[electricity crackling]

1446
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:39,770
He's all yours.

1447
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:42,689
[Tom] Everyone, get back!

1448
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:49,113
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

1449
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:50,906
Whoa.

1450
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:54,910
[powering down]

1451
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,000
This is my power.

1452
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,670
And I'm not using it to run away anymore.

1453
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,215
I'm using it to protect my friends.

1454
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:14,721
[weapons powering up]

- [exclaiming]
- [alarms blaring]

1460
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:07,649
Ooh! Now you've done it!

1461
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,026
Guess what, Eggman?

1462
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:11,653
I'm not leaving Earth. You are.

1463
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:13,572
Donut Lord?

1464
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:49,191
[Robotnik yells]

1465
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,536
[people cheering, clapping]

1466
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,957
- I told you, you got this.
- Hey, <i>we</i> got this.

1467
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,252
[gasps]

1468
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:10,087
[laughing]

1469
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:19,888
- I think these belong to you.
- Thank you very much.

1470
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,058
No more pushing people off of buildings.

1471
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:24,643
You know I can't promise that.

1472
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,233
- You did pretty good, space hog.
- Thanks, Donut Lord.

1473
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,444
You're gonna have to explain
this "Donut Lord" thing.

1474
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:37,364
Nope, sorry.
That's for me and the little guy. Right?

1475
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:39,700
We got our thing,
you got your thing with your... sister.

1476
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:40,784
Oh, my God, my sister.

1477
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:45,581
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1478
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,291
Jojo, put on my Fitbit...

1479
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,043
so I can at least get some steps.

1480
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,461
We can never go back there.

1481
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:54,381
I mean, are we?

1482
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,760
'Cause it kind of feels like
we're home right now.

1483
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:00,637
Really?

1484
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:06,727
I kind of feel like I checked
the "save a life" box off my bucket list.

1485
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:13,150
Now all I want to do is spend my life
with the people I care about.

1486
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:15,819
I want to check that box.

1487
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,864
Okay, I like that.

1488
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:22,034
All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.

1489
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,201
Let's disperse.

1490
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,162
Just another ordinary day in Green Hills.

1491
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:26,705
Carl, I'll take that chain saw.

1492
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,249
[Wade] Come on. Let's go!

1493
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:30,876
You act like you've never seen a fight

1494
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:35,547
between an intergalactic space rodent
and a robot with a doctorate.

1495
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,016
You got enough there?

1496
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,602
- Yes, Mr. Manager.
- Need any more?

1497
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,103
You get that away.

1498
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:54,900
[knock on door]

1499
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,157
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski?

1500
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,368
Yes?

1501
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,747
A token of appreciation
from your government,

1502
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,875
for keeping quiet about recent incidents,
which never occurred.

1503
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:14,294
[both laugh]

1504
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:16,088
[Tom] Wow!

1505
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,799
- Wonder what it is.
- Money to fix the house?

1506
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,134
- Letter from the President?
- You'll see.

1507
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,636
Okay.

1508
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,849
- Olive Garden.
- [Tom] Hmm, yeah.

1509
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,394
[chuckles] The way you said "You'll see"
made me think

1510
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:32,312
it was something better
than the things we said.

1511
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:35,148
Have you tried their
Never Ending Pasta Bowl?

1512
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,692
- It never ends.
- [Maddie chuckles]

1513
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:39,069
- That sounds... fancy.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1514
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,321
Well, thank you.
We appreciate the gesture.

1515
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:45,367
Oh, hey. I guess we can close the file
on that Robotnik guy, huh?

1516
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,451
Just disappeared.

1517
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:51,081
I'm sorry, but no such person exists
or ever has existed.

1518
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,750
I wish that were true.

1519
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:55,335
You haven't by any chance been in contact

1520
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:58,255
with a certain alien creature
since the incident, have you?

1521
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,048
Uncle Sam would love
to have a chat with him.

1522
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,551
Very casual. Brunch, perhaps.

1523
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:05,470
Oh, you mean the little blue guy.

1524
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:06,555
- Mmm.
- No.

1525
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,640
- No, nothing. No.
- Mm-mmm.

1526
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:10,892
- Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.
- Mm-mmm.

1527
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:12,978
Very well.

1528
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:14,980
Okay.

1529
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,606
- Thank you.
- Great.

1530
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:17,774
Mmm.

1531
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:19,735
Yep.

1532
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:23,196
[door creaks]

1533
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,407
To be honest,
I'm pretty pumped about the pasta bowl.

1534
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,491
[chuckles]

1535
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,493
So, do you guys wanna
watch a movie or what?

1536
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:29,870
Sorry, buddy, it's a school night.

1537
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,413
It's time for you to go back to your cave.

1538
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,623
What? It's 3:00 in the afternoon!

1539
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,292
You know how you get
when you're tired. Come on.

1540
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:36,877
Me? I'm not like anything.

1541
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,172
- [groans] You guys are so uncool.
- Yeah, yeah, we know.

1542
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,090
- [groans]
- Hey, buddy, where you going?

1543
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:43,592
You said I have to go back to my cave.

1544
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,552
We did.

1545
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:02,903
Oh, my... Are you kidding me?

1546
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,822
I can't believe it.

1547
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,491
How did you...

1548
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,452
It's... It's all here.

1549
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,957
[Maddie chuckles]

1550
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,215
Look at this! Are you kidding?
And the beanbag?

1551
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,300
No way! [chuckles]
How did you even get this?

1552
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:28,011
And you got it all the way over...
Oh! [laughs]

1553
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,930
I love it, I love it,
I love it, I love it!

1554
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:36,269
[sighs] Well, welcome home.

1555
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,897
Thank you, so much.

1562
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,542
<i>I'm warning you. I've got nunchucks!</i>

1563

My grasp on sanity remains... absolute.

Isn't that right, Agent Stone?

[grunting]

1569
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,450

- [loud grunt]
- [rock thudding]

Do some rock-connaissance. [cackles]

1572
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,542
Rock-connaissance!
Come on! That's hilarious!

1573
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,377
What's the matter with you?

1574
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:45,672
- [beeps]
- Here's the "sitch." Uninhabited planet.
