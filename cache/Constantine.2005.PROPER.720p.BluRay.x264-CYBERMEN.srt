1
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,202
Manuel.

2
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,329
Manuel!

3
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,262
Manuel.

4
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,569
I think...

5
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,949
I think I found you one.

6
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,538
Look, I called you, right?

7
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:14,920
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself,
I called you, John.

8
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,938
It's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

9
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,982
It's okay.

10
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,871
This is Constantine.

11
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,168
John Constantine, asshole.

12
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,677
Sure.

13
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,868
What the hell?

14
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,845
I need a mirror.

15
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,140
Now. At least 3 feet high.

16
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,558
Move! Go, now!

17
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,867
This is Kramer.

18
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,413
Chas Kramer, asshole.

19
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,289
Asshole.

20
00:06:56,457 --> 00:07:01,670
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

21
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,964
- Chas!
- What?

22
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,883
- Move the car.
- Why?

23
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,845
Move the damn car!

24
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,266
"Chas, move the car."

25
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,811
There, car's moved.

26
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,949
Lift it up over the bed.

27
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:37,038
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

28
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:43,712
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

29
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,892
No!

30
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,151
Show yourself.

31
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,282
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

32
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,875
For your boss.

33
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,253
Pull it!

34
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,657
Ma? Ma?

35
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,030
Like I said, I found you something,
didn't I, John? Didn't I?

36
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,865
What happened in there?

37
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,542
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

38
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,836
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

39
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,464
I have to sleep, John.

40
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,676
I need some help, Father.

41
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,970
You do?

42
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,888
From me?

43
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,765
What kind of...?

44
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:07,188
- Hey, listen, l...
- That exorcism wasn't right.

45
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,027
Listen to the ether.

46
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,615
Anything unusual, you let me know.

47
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:22,162
Come on, you don't need its protection.
It'll be like back in the day.

48
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,542
A few days.

49
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,044
Okay.

50
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,631
Okay. For you, John.

51
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,596
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

52
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,349
- I told you to move it.
- You did tell me to move it...

53
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,019
...but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon...

54
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,021
...I would've moved it further, John.

55
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,858
- Take Alvarado.
- Yeah, thank you. I know what to take.

56
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,905
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe I could help out?

57
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,406
- No?
- Nope.

58
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,908
Nope?

59
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,160
Of course it's a nope.

60
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,824
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

61
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,079
It's been...

62
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,291
...two weeks since my last confession.

63
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,839
I killed a man today.

64
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,633
Another one.

65
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:08,059
I didn't even see his face, I just...

66
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,479
...pulled the trigger, and he went away.

67
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,862
Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.

68
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:24,117
Why do I always know
where these guys are?

69
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,620
Where to aim, when to fire.

70
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,208
I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?

71
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,044
Something damned?

72
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:40,550
God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.

73
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:45,138
You mustn't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.

74
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,348
Yeah, I'm trying.

75
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,602
I'm trying real hard.

76
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,521
MALE VOICE:
lsabel.

77
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,741
Isabel.

78
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,675
Things I've beaten.

79
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,554
Things most people never even heard of.

80
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,141
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

81
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,603
Wouldn't be the first, John.

82
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,523
Come on, Les.

83
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,026
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

84
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,070
This is aggressive.

85
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,325
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

86
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,494
Now you don't wanna leave.

87
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,331
Yeah, that's a good idea.

88
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,294
John, you really need to prepare.

89
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,843
- Make arrangements.
- No need.

90
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,180
I already know exactly where I'm going.

91
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,144
- Morning.
- Good morning.

92
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,272
- Good morning.
- Detective.

93
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,274
- No, no, no.
- WEISS: Angela, wait.

94
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,110
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

95
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,780
Give us the room, please.

96
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,063
Isabel.

97
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,072
She fell from the roof?

98
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,074
WEISS:
She jumped.

99
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,828
- No.
- WEISS: Look...

100
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,165
...I know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

101
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,219
- Isabel wouldn't kill herself.
- WEISS: Angie.

102
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,930
- She wouldn't kill herself.
- Detective.

103
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,432
- Period.
- Detective.

104
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,225
Period!

105
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,980
WEISS:
Angie, there were security cameras.

106
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,784
- Hold the door. You going down?
- Not if I can help it.

107
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,087
A new case?

108
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:15,009
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

109
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,221
- Humor me.
- Don't I always?

110
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,813
Oh, yeah, that's...
Much obliged. Thank you.

111
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,525
How you feeling, John?

112
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,360
So, what's new?

113
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,072
Uh...

114
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,409
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope...

115
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,205
...holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan...

116
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:49,293
...and... Oh, you'll love this.
screech beetle from Amityville.

117
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,550
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the
fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

118
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,845
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

119
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,931
I just like them.

120
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,975
Yeah. Who doesn't?

121
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,187
Yeah, easy there, hero.

122
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,941
- That's dragon's breath.
- I thought you couldn't get it anymore.

123
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,609
Yeah, well, l...

124
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,904
...know a guy who knows a guy.

125
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,664
So, what's the action?

126
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,918
I just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

127
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,172
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

128
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,216
Yeah, I know how it sounds.

129
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,677
No, we're finger puppets
to them, John...

130
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,220
...not doorways.

131
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:45,474
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

132
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,269
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

133
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,938
Sure thing, John. Uh...

134
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,107
Anything else?

135
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,319
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a, uh...?

136
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,322
On the house.

137
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,826
All right, question. How much
longer do I have to be your slave, John?

138
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,955
You're not my slave, Chas.

139
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,834
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

140
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,170
Like Tonto or Robin.

141
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,048
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

142
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,093
Right. So then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

143
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,681
John? John.

144
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,602
I love our little talks, John.

145
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,034
May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

146
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,995
No, thanks,
I'm not gonna be staying long.

147
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:52,750
- How about you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

148
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,419
I really need to speak with him.
It's very important.

149
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,297
First come, first served.

150
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,553
Oh. So you're rude
no matter where you are.

151
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,147
- Father.
- Hi.

152
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,734
- You have news.
- Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

153
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,820
Yes.

154
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,119
I know what you want, son.

155
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,831
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

156
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,418
I'm flattered.

157
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,838
Well, I could offer something...

158
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,259
...about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock...

159
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,511
...but it might sound disingenuous.

160
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,431
She has to have a Catholic funeral,
Father. She has to.

161
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:52,810
- Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
- She didn't commit suicide.

162
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,604
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

163
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,857
Oh, rules.

164
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,859
Father.

165
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,610
David.

166
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,197
This is lsabel.

167
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:09,118
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

168
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,746
Please.

169
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,332
I'm sorry.

170
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,671
I've been seeing some
unusual soul traffic lately.

171
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,591
You might consider
giving me an extension.

172
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,344
I could do your side some good
these days.

173
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,763
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

174
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,683
What about the minions
I've sent back?

175
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,021
- That alone should guarantee my entry.
- How many times have I told you?

176
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,190
That's not the way this works.

177
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,068
Why, haven't I served him enough?

178
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,988
- What does he want from me?
- Only the usual.

179
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,241
Self-sacrifice, belief.

180
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,620
- Oh, I believe, for chrissake.
- No, no, you know.

181
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,039
And there's a difference. You've seen.

182
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,877
I never asked to see.
I was born with this curse.

183
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,129
A gift, John.

184
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,799
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

185
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,511
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

186
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,513
Who's that for?

187
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:15,226
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

188
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,645
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

189
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,439
Impossible rules, endless regulations...

190
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,567
...who goes up, who goes down
and why.

191
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,826
You don't even understand us.

192
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,121
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

193
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,844
Why me, Gabriel?

194
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,681
It's personal, isn't it?

195
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:59,562
I didn't go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough...

196
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:04,191
...I was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

197
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,946
You are going to die young...

198
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,033
...because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

199
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,078
And you're going to go to hell...

200
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,290
...because of the life you took.

201
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,172
You're fucked.

202
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,227
At least it's nice out.

203
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,108
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

204
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,326
And his punch lines are killers.

205
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,000
John!

206
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,338
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

207
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,521
Twenty-two women were found
buried in the assailant's back yard.

208
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,399
So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match...

209
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,027
Police report she had been
physically penetrated...

210
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,947
...over 100 times and buried alive.

211
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,867
Found locked in a freezer,
his head severed and his organs...

212
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,827
He stuffed Holly's body into...

213
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,998
- The bodies ravished...
- He used a small handsaw...

214
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,627
Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out.

215
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,462
MALE VOICE:
lsabel.

216
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,530
I'm so sorry, lzzy.

217
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,782
Constantine.

218
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,776
Dodson.

219
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,737
Hello?

220
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,197
Hello.

221
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,455
Hello?

222
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,895
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

223
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,388
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

224
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:11,248
I know where you're going, John.
You're going to Midnite's.

225
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,083
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

226
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:17,045
It's a haven for those who rise and fall.
I remember reading about this, John.

227
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,965
- You read too much, kid. it's a bar.
- It's a bar?

228
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:24,511
It's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for
good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

229
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,306
- John, the man's a legend.
- Yeah.

230
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,975
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

231
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,685
I'm begging you, John, please?

232
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,022
- Sure, you can get in.
- I can get in?

233
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,399
If you can get in.

234
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,862
If I can get...? it's a bear, though,
right? Or two ducks in a cloud?

235
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,618
Two frogs on a bench.

236
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,916
Two frogs on a bench.

237
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,084
No, no, I'm with the guy you just...

238
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,128
John! John!

239
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,297
I'm with him, though.

240
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,383
Rat in a dress.

241
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,929
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

242
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,056
I'm just testing. I'm just testing.

243
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,195
Don't get up.

244
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,866
MIDNITE:
You've been absent some time.

245
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,035
Have you come here with relics to sell?

246
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,622
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

247
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,668
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

248
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,795
Midnite, Jesus...

249
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,382
...I thought the thing was authentic.

250
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,012
I see now.

251
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,515
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

252
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,475
A few months, maybe a year.

253
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,312
I thought I heard thunder last night.

254
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,607
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

255
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,903
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

256
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,405
So I've heard.

257
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,867
Well, I am most certain
you did not come here...

258
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,203
...for a sympathetic shoulder
to cry on.

259
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,293
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

260
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,712
They don't like you, John.

261
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,756
How many have you
deported back to hell?

262
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,469
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

263
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,388
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

264
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,891
And yesterday I saw a soldier demon...

265
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,560
...trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

266
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:23,482
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven...

267
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,193
...the great détente
of the original superpowers.

268
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:31,281
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

269
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,033
Now...

270
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,662
...I need to use the chair.

271
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:44,461
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you...

272
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,338
...you know I am neutral.

273
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,759
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

274
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,554
Before you were a bartender...

275
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:59,101
...you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

276
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,980
- And l...
- You were Constantine.

277
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,525
The John Constantine.

278
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,986
Once.

279
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,740
This isn't the usual game, I can feel it.

280
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,326
Something's coming.

281
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,121
Ooh, spooky.

282
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,123
Balthazar.

283
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,377
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

284
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,504
I'll make your night.

285
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,383
I'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

286
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:37,889
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

287
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,017
Johnny boy.

288
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:46,690
Word is you're on your way down.

289
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,067
Fresh meat.

290
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,698
Finger-licking good.

291
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,867
We have a meeting now, John.

292
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,169
What? I didn't catch that.

293
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,964
Welcome to my life.

294
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,850
Mr. Constantine.

295
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,396
- I saw you...
- I remember.

296
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,025
- And then I saw you at the...
- Regular kismet.

297
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,738
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

298
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,991
I'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

299
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,828
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

300
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,122
Please?

301
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,919
Always a catch.

302
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,478
My sister was murdered yesterday.

303
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,606
- Sorry to hear.
- Thanks.

304
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,862
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

305
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,489
Thought you said she was murdered.

306
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,659
Yeah, well, lsabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

307
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,496
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

308
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,583
That's just crazy.

309
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,465
Look, I've heard your name
around the precinct.

310
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:22,846
I know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

311
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,641
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

312
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:31,521
She started talking about demons,
angels.

313
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,441
Now, I think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

314
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,403
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

315
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:43,033
Some kind of legion or cult.

316
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,161
Sounds like a theory, detective.

317
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,746
Good luck.

318
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,626
I thought with your background,
you could at least...

319
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,461
...point me in the right direction.

320
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,963
Yeah, okay, sure.

321
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,302
It wasn't a suicide.

322
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,638
My sister was a devout Catholic.

323
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,307
Do you understand that?
If she took her own life...

324
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,268
Her soul would go straight to hell...

325
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:15,565
...where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony...

326
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,985
...for all eternity. That it?

327
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,196
That about right?

328
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,288
Goddamn you.

329
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,112
Detective.

330
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,115
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager...

331
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,785
...a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

332
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,454
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

333
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,917
Humor me. No direct contact with
humans. That would be the rule.

334
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:20,463
- Just influence. See who would win.
- Okay, I'm humoring you.

335
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,716
- Why?
- Who knows.

336
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,969
- Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
- Oh, so it's fun.

337
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:31,141
It's fun when a man beats his wife to
death, when a mother drowns her baby.

338
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,061
And you think the devil is responsible?

339
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,981
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

340
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,609
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

341
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:45,530
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

342
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,159
Well, this has been real educational...

343
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,036
...but I don't believe in the devil.

344
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,664
You should. He believes in you.

345
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,020
It's a power outage.

346
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,147
Not likely.

347
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,195
- What?
- We should go. Now.

348
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,327
What is that?

349
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,163
Wings.

350
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,083
Maybe talons.

351
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,127
You're kidding. Of what?

352
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,131
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

353
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,679
That's really not going to help.

354
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,937
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

355
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,438
Suit yourself.

356
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,089
Demons stay in hell, huh?

357
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,259
Tell them that.

358
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:36,516
Don't worry. Happens to everyone
the first time.

359
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,810
It's the sulfur.

360
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,396
Sulfur.

361
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,025
What were those things?

362
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,070
Demons.

363
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:55,285
- Scavengers of the damned.
- No, no. it's impossible.

364
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,247
Yeah. And I don't think
they were after me.

365
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,419
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

366
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,004
Isabel?

367
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,882
Never in a million years.

368
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,342
Well, let's be sure.

369
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,053
Let's see if she's in hell.

370
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,705
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

371
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,333
In front of the chair.

372
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,046
I can't believe I'm doing this.

373
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,840
- These are all lsabel's things?
- Yeah.

374
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,885
- How about the cat?
- Duck?

375
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,679
Yeah, why?

376
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,057
Duck.

377
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,559
Oh, you think that's strange.

378
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,186
Cats are good.

379
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,979
Half in, half out anyway.

380
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,501
If this is some kind of spell
or something...

381
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,837
...don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

382
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,340
Why, do you have any?

383
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,593
- This is crazy.
- Yes.

384
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,474
I need you to leave.

385
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,144
- I'm sorry?
- Angela, please.

386
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,442
The apartment.

387
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,280
Okay.

388
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,621
Be careful with that cat.

389
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,004
God, I hate this part.

390
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,629
- Isabel.
- Constantine.

391
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,593
Angela.

392
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,598
Jesus.

393
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,562
- Constantine, what...?
- Twins.

394
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,647
Jesus. What?

395
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,067
- You were twins.
- What did you say?

396
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,904
- She killed herself.
- What?

397
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,657
And she's damned for it.

398
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,380
How is this possible?

399
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,760
I need to eat.

400
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,995
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

401
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,917
Relax, man.

402
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,336
Slow down!

403
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,487
What the hell kind of place is this?

404
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,872
John.

405
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,198
When I was a kid, I could see things.

406
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,743
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

407
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,205
Things you shouldn't have to see.

408
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:05,102
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

409
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,772
They made it worse.

410
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,027
You think you're crazy long enough...

411
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,820
...you find a way out.

412
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:19,075
- You tried to kill yourself.
- I didn't try anything.

413
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,956
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

414
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,251
But when you cross over...

415
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,755
...time stops.

416
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:37,051
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

417
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,263
When I came back...

418
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,975
...I knew...

419
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,062
...all the things I could see were real.

420
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:54,527
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

421
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:59,698
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

422
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,410
Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

423
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,497
So instead we get
what I call half-breeds.

424
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,875
The influence peddlers.

425
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:15,506
They can only whisper in our ears, but
a single word can give you courage...

426
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:19,718
...or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.

427
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,930
Those with the demon's touch...

428
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:28,144
...like those part angel,
living alongside us.

429
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,813
They call it the balance.

430
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,358
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

431
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,487
So when a half-breed
breaks the rules...

432
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,950
...I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

433
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,203
I don't get them all...

434
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,666
...but I've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my...

435
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,670
- ...retirement.
- I don't understand.

436
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,841
I'm a suicide, Angela.

437
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,553
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

438
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,763
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

439
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,474
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison...

440
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,977
...where half the inmates
were put there by you?

441
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,899
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

442
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,444
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

443
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,654
He's not planning anything.

444
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,032
When we were little...

445
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,619
...lsabel saw things too.

446
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,459
Dodson.

447
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,548
WEISS: Guard spotted him groping
the body, then he ran across the street.

448
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,801
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

449
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:46,222
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

450
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,433
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

451
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,854
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

452
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,648
He's okay.

453
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,744
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

454
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,114
Yes?

455
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,908
What do you mean?

456
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,327
What?

457
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,037
How?

458
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,964
Mm-hm.

459
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,677
Got it. Bye.

460
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,186
I need to see where lsabel died.

461
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:19,523
Séances, Ouija boards, channeling.

462
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,736
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

463
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,447
She certainly did that.

464
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,159
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

465
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:34,038
She'd scare my mother half to death.

466
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,500
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

467
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,919
So you had her committed.

468
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,421
Yeah.

469
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,256
How long?

470
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,342
Two weeks.

471
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,594
This time.

472
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:53,349
She'd get better, and then she'd
get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

473
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,979
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand...

474
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,440
...does it have something to do
with this?

475
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,026
I'm a cop, John, remember?

476
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:09,156
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

477
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:14,203
And I showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

478
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:19,708
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

479
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,045
Something just for you.

480
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:28,759
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

481
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,262
- I'm not like my sister.
- But you were once.

482
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,640
When you were kids.

483
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,726
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

484
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,647
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

485
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,273
That was a long time ago.

486
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,401
That kind of bond doesn't
just disappear.

487
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,653
There is nothing here.

488
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,407
- Hey. Come on.
- She planned her death in this room.

489
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,993
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

490
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:58,414
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw...

491
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,625
...feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

492
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,628
- What did she do, Angela?
- How should I know?

493
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,214
- What did she do, Angela?
- I don't know.

494
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,718
- What would you do?
- I don't know.

495
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:16,640
What did she do, Angela? You know
what she did. What did she do, Angela?

496
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:20,102
You know what she did. What are
you afraid of? What did she do?

497
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,604
- What did she do?
- I don't know!

498
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,499
When we were girls...

499
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,297
...we would leave each other messages.

500
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,843
In light.

501
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,264
In breath.

502
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,145
On the windows.

503
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:10,736
John, there is no 17th act
in Corinthians.

504
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,658
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

505
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,995
They have Bibles in hell.

506
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:23,040
Paints a different view of Revelations.

507
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,334
Says the world will not end
by God's hand...

508
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,504
...but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.

509
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,172
Though if you ask me...

510
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,758
...fire's fire.

511
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:37,179
16:29, 16:30.

512
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:41,391
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

513
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:45,437
"The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son."

514
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:49,566
- Whose son?
- But he can't cross over, B.

515
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:52,361
- Impossible to cross over.
- Whose son? God's son?

516
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,989
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

517
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,866
Here it is.

518
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,077
This is the sign of Mammon...

519
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,205
...the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here...

520
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,376
- Beeman?
- Yeah.

521
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,546
Sorry, I'm...
I'm sorry, no, I'm right here.

522
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:17,302
It says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule...

523
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:22,391
...and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

524
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,732
Yeah. Mammon would be
the last demon...

525
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,777
...we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

526
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:37,573
No, wait, wait, wait. I'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

527
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,075
Always a catch.

528
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:46,790
It says first Mammon would have to
possess a very, very powerful psychic.

529
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,585
- Isabel.
- But that wouldn't be enough.

530
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:54,798
To cross over, Mammon would need
divine assistance.

531
00:59:56,217 --> 01:00:00,387
To cross over, Mammon would need
the help of God.

532
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,349
- The help of God?
- It says...

533
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:14,610
- Beeman?
- John, look...

534
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:19,281
...I know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to...

535
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,201
...but that doesn't mean
that we don't have faith...

536
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,829
...in you.

537
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,627
Beeman? Beeman?

538
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,671
Drive. Fast.

539
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,773
Beeman!

540
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,900
Sulfur.

541
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,986
Beeman!

542
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,867
Beeman!

543
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,148
Wasn't just lsabel.

544
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,984
I used to see things too.

545
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,738
But...

546
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:26,783
- ...you already knew that, didn't you?
- Go home, Angela.

547
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,410
I need to understand.

548
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,079
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

549
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,331
I'm stronger than lsabel.

550
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:37,461
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours. Denial is a better idea.

551
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:42,424
It's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

552
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,551
I don't need another ghost
following me.

553
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,262
John, they killed my sister.

554
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,935
I'd trade places with her if I could.

555
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,775
I used to pretend that I didn't.

556
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,861
That I didn't see things.

557
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:04,821
And...

558
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:10,285
...by the time we were 10,
they started forcing her to take...

559
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,121
...antipsychotics...

560
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,500
...and have treatments.
They would come for her...

561
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:20,420
...and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, "Tell them.

562
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,424
Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?"

563
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:26,927
But I lied.

564
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,805
I said:

565
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,642
"I don't see anything."

566
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,812
Until one day...

567
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,397
...I finally stopped seeing.

568
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:44,319
I abandoned her, John.

569
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,614
I left her all alone.

570
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,165
I need to see what she saw.

571
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,710
Please.

572
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:08,802
You do this, there's no turning back.

573
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,681
You see them...

574
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,517
...they see you.

575
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,395
Understand?

576
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,856
Yeah.

577
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,864
Sure.

578
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:11,907
So do I have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can I leave them on?

579
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,998
John?

580
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,250
I'm thinking.

581
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,881
John?

582
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,550
On is fine.

583
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,733
- So why water?
- It's a universal conduit.

584
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:50,946
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

585
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:55,408
- Now ask me if there's water in hell.
- Is there water in hell?

586
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,662
Sit.

587
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,292
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended...

588
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,922
...but you wanted the crash course.

589
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,800
Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

590
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,052
So, um...

591
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,513
So, what's gonna happen?

592
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,348
Lie down.

593
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:22,477
- What do you mean lie down?
- You have to be fully submerged.

594
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:25,981
For how long?

595
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,441
As long as it takes.

596
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,662
Take a deep one.

597
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,225
Oh, God.

598
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,020
Oh, God, all those people.

599
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,065
Oh, lsabel.

600
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,858
I've always known.

601
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:38,571
I've always known where they are.
I've always known where to find them...

602
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:41,866
...where to aim and where to duck...

603
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,952
...and I've always known
where they were.

604
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,162
I've always known that it wasn't luck.

605
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,957
Always known that it wasn't luck.
I've always known...

606
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,293
I've always known that I could see.

607
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:57,799
I've always known that I could see.

608
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,430
Angela.

609
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,645
Someone was here.

610
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,548
It was his.

611
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,718
Rolling.

612
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,722
Not a ball.

613
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,350
Something smaller.

614
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,771
Shiny.

615
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,848
Balthazar.

616
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,715
Sorry.

617
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,100
Can you just kill him?

618
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,394
What about the balance?

619
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:18,231
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

620
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,858
I'm just adding some counterweight.

621
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,811
John, I really want...

622
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:05,987
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

623
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:15,705
Uh-uh. I'm coming with you.

624
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,500
You're staying in the car.

625
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:46,778
Fire? I was born of this.

626
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:51,491
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

627
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:58,956
That's better. Au naturel.

628
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,299
"Stay in the car."

629
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,843
"Wait here."

630
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:12,887
Men.

631
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,027
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

632
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:31,614
Enjoy it.

633
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:08,860
We'll see you very soon.

634
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,112
Not really, no.

635
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,451
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

636
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,119
True.

637
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,620
But you're not.

638
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,083
- What are you doing?
- I'm reading you your last rites.

639
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,920
Spare me your remedial incantations.

640
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:30,423
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

641
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,134
To be welcomed
into the Kingdom of God.

642
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,720
Demon in heaven.

643
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:39,348
I'd love to be a fly on that wall.

644
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:43,769
You're not a priest. You have no power.

645
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,148
Just tell me how Mammon
is crossing over...

646
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,401
...and you can go back
to your shithole.

647
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:56,616
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

648
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:11,714
"May God have mercy on you
and grant you the pardon of all your sins.

649
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:16,719
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in heaven."

650
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:21,474
- How? How's he doing it?
- No.

651
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:22,975
No, I can't.

652
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:28,189
Grant your child entry
into thy kingdom...

653
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:33,819
...in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

654
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,613
Amen!

655
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:42,161
The blood of God.

656
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:43,663
He found it.

657
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:48,084
Whatever killed the son of God...

658
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:53,798
...will give birth to the son of the devil.

659
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,760
By the way...

660
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:03,683
...you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven...

661
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,851
...asshole.

662
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:13,234
My work here is done.

663
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:19,448
- What are you laughing at?
- She was my only mission...

664
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:23,828
...and you brought her right to us.

665
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:30,126
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

666
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:34,589
Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a
cross. He was killed by a soldier's spear.

667
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,924
The Spear of Destiny.

668
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:40,052
I'm a Catholic, John.
I know the Crucifixion story.

669
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:53,774
I drew out the sister as you asked.

670
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:59,572
She's been made flush and ready.

671
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,492
So much power.

672
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:08,998
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
I shall serve.

673
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:15,129
Wait. But I did as we agreed.

674
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,924
No. Please. No!

675
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,766
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

676
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:31,312
How's the blood of God's only son?

677
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,981
The stains on the spear.

678
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:38,152
- Yeah.
- So he gets the spear.

679
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,488
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

680
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,157
Not really.

681
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:47,578
Twins.

682
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,165
Where's the amulet?

683
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,503
I don't know,
I must have left it in the...

684
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,506
What's wrong?

685
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,758
I don't know, I just feel...

686
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,333
- Bird on a ladder.
- Sorry.

687
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:42,091
- Wait here.
- Yeah.

688
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:48,222
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

689
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:04,697
Have you lost what
little mind you have?

690
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,532
Don't.

691
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,161
I need to use the chair.

692
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:14,373
I offer no aid to one side or the other.

693
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:18,127
- The balance.
- Screw the balance.

694
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:26,719
You dare? In my house?

695
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:32,892
Is this neutral? Bullshit.

696
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,020
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

697
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,940
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

698
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:44,528
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once too, remember?

699
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,324
I need your help!

700
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,995
Consider it a last request.

701
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,627
You play a dangerous game.

702
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,803
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

703
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,723
MIDNITE:
That little shit has been trying...

704
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,476
...to climb out of his father's shadow
for eons.

705
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:20,564
I'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

706
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,028
Forgot how big it was.

707
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:30,825
MIDNITE: Two hundred souls passed
through this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

708
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,660
Yeah.

709
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:38,040
Which way's east?

710
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,519
MIDNITE:
How many years since you've surfed?

711
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:01,730
Like riding a bike.

712
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:03,899
No, not really.

713
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:09,405
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

714
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:14,952
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

715
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:22,751
Cold.

716
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:25,045
Little flavor?

717
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:50,446
- Sure about this?
- No.

718
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,289
Midnite!

719
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:51,131
- Any luck?
- That's a word for it.

720
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:54,885
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

721
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:07,022
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

722
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:12,277
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

723
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:14,113
Half-breeds are most vulnerable...

724
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:18,242
...when their outer skin is breached
by holy water.

725
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:22,037
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of lsteria...

726
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:24,707
...have been used by even
the unordained to bless...

727
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:26,750
...commonly occurring waters...

728
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:28,669
...even rain.

729
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,587
Maybe if...

730
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:38,679
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

731
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,725
You wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet...

732
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:44,977
...maybe we could take with us?

733
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:49,690
Look, John, no offense, I just don't think
that it's a great idea, you know...

734
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,193
...you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

735
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:56,030
I don't know what pops thinks,
but that's...

736
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:00,409
Take him, John. Kill him after.

737
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:09,835
If you get back, see me
about membership. Maybe.

738
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,921
Okay. I will.

739
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:19,970
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

740
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:23,098
Praying. Okay.

741
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:25,684
Come on.

742
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,243
Half-breeds, right?

743
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:31,625
A birth like this, they're definitely
gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

744
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,544
Yeah.

745
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:41,051
We can get through them. I mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

746
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:42,886
Right?

747
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:46,598
It's not always like it is in the books.

748
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:36,732
What is that?

749
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:39,234
Hellspeak.

750
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,947
You know what to do.

751
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,869
I'm okay.

752
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,456
Sure.

753
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,887
One last show.

754
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,422
Hi.

755
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:44,341
My name's John.

756
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:50,097
You are in violation of the balance.

757
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,308
Leave immediately...

758
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:56,270
...or I will deport you.

759
01:27:58,231 --> 01:28:00,065
All of you.

760
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,366
Go to hell.

761
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:16,456
Holy water?

762
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,370
MALE VOICE:
Angela.

763
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,320
Uh, John?

764
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:13,949
John.

765
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:21,248
Shit.

766
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:47,983
Pull!

767
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,233
Angela.

768
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,884
Angela, what is it?

769
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,893
Get it out.

770
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:19,908
Get it out.

771
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,536
Get it...

772
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:07,831
Oh, my God.

773
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:16,673
Not bad, kid.

774
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,678
"Not bad." You hear that?

775
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:26,266
You know why that is? it's because
this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, ass...

776
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,067
Chas.

777
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:46,661
You're right, John.

778
01:33:47,913 --> 01:33:49,623
It's not like the books.

779
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,459
No...

780
01:33:53,377 --> 01:33:55,211
...it isn't.

781
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,943
Into the light, I command thee.

782
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:23,448
Into the light, I command thee.

783
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:28,703
Into the light, I command thee.

784
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,878
Into the light, I command thee.

785
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,967
Your ego is astounding.

786
01:34:43,135 --> 01:34:44,928
Gabriel.

787
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:46,429
Figures.

788
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:51,059
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

789
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:53,645
You judging me now, John?

790
01:34:54,897 --> 01:34:58,900
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

791
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:03,029
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

792
01:35:03,447 --> 01:35:07,117
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

793
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,160
Help me here.

794
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:17,502
You're handed this precious gift, right?

795
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:22,757
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

796
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:26,302
Murderers, rapists and molesters...

797
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:28,805
...all of you, you just have to repent...

798
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:31,808
...and God takes you into his bosom.

799
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,396
In all the worlds in all the universe...

800
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:39,482
...no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

801
01:35:41,944 --> 01:35:43,278
It's not fair.

802
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:51,411
If sweet, sweet God loves you so...

803
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,581
...then I'll make you worthy of his love.

804
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,377
I've been watching you for a long time.

805
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:04,215
It's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

806
01:36:04,383 --> 01:36:08,219
And you can be so noble.

807
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:12,515
So...

808
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,518
...I'll bring you pain.

809
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,563
I'll bring you horror.

810
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:23,359
So that you may rise above it.

811
01:36:26,822 --> 01:36:30,742
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth...

812
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,870
...will be worthy of God's love.

813
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,830
Gabriel...

814
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,541
...you're insane.

815
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:43,671
The road to salvation begins tonight.

816
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:46,174
Right now.

817
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:30,844
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

818
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:35,139
I'm not even welcome in your house.

819
01:37:36,725 --> 01:37:39,561
But I could use a little attention.

820
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:44,566
Please.

821
01:38:30,946 --> 01:38:33,323
GABRIEL:
Come forth.

822
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:54,969
Hurry.

823
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:14,072
GABRIEL:
Mammon...

824
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:16,699
...son of Satan...

825
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:21,329
...I unleash you unto this world.

826
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:16,426
Hello.

827
01:40:16,593 --> 01:40:18,678
What took you so long?

828
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:21,139
Hello, John.

829
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:25,184
John, hello.

830
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:32,984
You're the one soul...

831
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:38,031
...I would come up here
to collect myself. Mm-hm.

832
01:40:40,325 --> 01:40:42,702
So I've heard.

833
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:44,787
You mind?

834
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:48,207
Oh, go... Go right ahead. I've got stock.

835
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:50,626
Coffin nail.

836
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:53,004
Very fitting, John.

837
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:59,427
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons...

838
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:02,388
...finger movement goes
out the window.

839
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:04,640
Let me help you.

840
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:17,612
See?

841
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:20,865
Sonny...

842
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:26,162
...I've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

843
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:28,456
Well, aren't you a peach.

844
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:34,087
I didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

845
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,885
And you didn't...

846
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,387
...did you?

847
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,306
So how's the family?

848
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:51,437
Family's doing just fine.
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

849
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:55,274
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

850
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:58,486
Well, one does what one can.

851
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,279
He's in the other room.

852
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:03,241
Boys will be boys.

853
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:05,785
With Gabriel.

854
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:11,415
No accounting for taste, really.

855
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:14,210
They have the Spear of Destiny.

856
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:20,675
"They have the Spear of Destiny."

857
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:32,186
Or is it another one of your cons?

858
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,566
Go look for yourself.

859
01:42:39,611 --> 01:42:43,239
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu...

860
01:42:43,615 --> 01:42:46,659
...what's another 20 seconds?

861
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:56,604
- Lucifer.
- This world is mine. In time.

862
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,357
You, best of all of us, Gabriel...

863
01:43:59,524 --> 01:44:04,737
...should understand ambition.

864
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:07,406
Son of perdition.

865
01:44:08,283 --> 01:44:09,617
Little horn.

866
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,955
Most unclean.

867
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:16,749
I do miss the old names.

868
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:19,835
Time to go home, son.

869
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:22,463
I will smite thee...

870
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:25,549
...in his honor.

871
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:35,810
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

872
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:55,454
Father?

873
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:20,271
So.

874
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,612
So.

875
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,742
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

876
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:39,498
The sister...

877
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:41,751
...lsabel.

878
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,588
What about her?

879
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:50,009
Let her go home.

880
01:45:52,721 --> 01:45:57,308
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

881
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:10,154
Fine. it's done.

882
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:16,243
Time to go, John.

883
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:18,204
Yeah.

884
01:47:16,054 --> 01:47:18,055
The sacrifice.

885
01:47:29,651 --> 01:47:35,656
No. This one belongs to me.

886
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:51,464
No. You will live, John Constantine.

887
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:55,968
You will live.

888
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:01,015
So you will have...

889
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:05,352
...the chance to prove...

890
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:13,360
...that your soul truly belongs in hell.

891
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:19,492
Oh, you will live.

892
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:27,625
You will live.

893
01:49:41,491 --> 01:49:43,492
Thank you.

894
01:49:45,912 --> 01:49:47,871
No problem.

895
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,681
Human.

896
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:10,144
You don't deserve to be human.

897
01:50:11,646 --> 01:50:16,358
Do you want revenge?
Is that what you're thinking right now?

898
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,404
Do it.

899
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:23,240
Do it.

900
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:26,952
Seek revenge.

901
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,413
End my life.

902
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:31,665
Go on.

903
01:50:33,793 --> 01:50:35,294
Be the hand of God.

904
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:37,838
It's your choice.

905
01:50:38,006 --> 01:50:40,257
It's always been your choice.

906
01:50:45,555 --> 01:50:46,972
Yeah.

907
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:55,022
That's called pain.

908
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:56,565
Get used to it.

909
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:05,157
You could've shot me, John!

910
01:51:07,285 --> 01:51:10,162
You chose a higher path!

911
01:51:11,581 --> 01:51:14,375
Look how well you're doing!

912
01:51:39,901 --> 01:51:41,944
Nice spot.

913
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:47,700
I have something for you.

914
01:51:50,745 --> 01:51:53,497
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

915
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:59,086
Oh, how thoughtful.

916
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:06,218
John...

917
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:09,972
...why are you giving me this?

918
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,598
Rules.

919
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:13,392
Hide it.

920
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,603
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

921
01:52:17,647 --> 01:52:19,314
Not even me.

922
01:52:19,482 --> 01:52:20,816
Ah.

923
01:52:23,486 --> 01:52:25,279
Always a catch.

924
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,323
Yeah.

925
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:43,255
So.

926
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:47,926
I've got some cleaning up to do.

927
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:53,766
I'll...

928
01:52:53,933 --> 01:52:56,226
...see you around.

929
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:00,647
I'd like that.

930
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:33,514
I guess there's a plan for all of us.

931
01:53:33,681 --> 01:53:35,265
I had to die...

932
01:53:35,433 --> 01:53:36,767
...twice...

933
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:39,144
...just to figure that out.

934
01:53:39,312 --> 01:53:44,316
Like the book says, he works his work
in mysterious ways.

935
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,652
Some people like it...

936
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:49,363
...some people don't.

937
01:59:42,758 --> 01:59:44,885
You did good, kid.

938
02:00:41,108 --> 02:00:43,109
