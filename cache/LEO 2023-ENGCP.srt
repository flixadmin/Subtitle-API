00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,792
Let me go!

3
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,583
Let me go!

4
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,000
Let me go!

5
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:12,125
Leave me…

6
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,375
Release me!

7
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,208
Let go of me!

8
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,958
It's confirmed, boss. He's our target.

9
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,792
No…

10
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,417
Don't kill me.

11
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,250
Ask him to text me
after transferring the money.

12
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,250
Where is that guy? What's he doing inside?

13
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,542
He may land us in trouble.

14
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,042
What, boss?

15
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,000
- Boss, my foot!
- Okay, boss.

00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,208
<i>It's a rampage all around.</i>

20
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:47,208
A hyena has been spotted here.

21
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,750
Saffron TV will give you
live updates by the minute.

22
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,458
People from nearby villages
have gathered here.

23
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,500
We have no idea
what the hyena is going to do.

24
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,292
Tell me, Joshy.

25
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,917
Sathya, I tried to call Parthiban.

26
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,917
His phone is not reachable. Where's he?

27
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,292
He must have gone
to drop Siddhu at school.

28
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,167
Try calling Siddhu.
His phone will be in the car.

29
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,833
If he gets in touch,
please ask him to call me.

30
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,250
Handle this properly!

31
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,208
Place a barricade there. Hurry up!

32
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,333
- Kumar.
- Sir?

33
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:34,708
- What's happening?
- Sir, nothing's right here. Everything…

34
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,625
Sir, nothing is right here.

35
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,143
- If it continues, many will be injured.
- Whom have they sent?

36
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,458
Two experts have come
from Wildlife SOS team.

37
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,333
They've handled only cheetahs,
but this is a hyena.

38
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,583
Nobody knows how to handle this, sir.

39
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,083
Parthiban, we have a situation.
It's an emergency.

40
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,667
Can you come here?

41
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,750
All right. First, see the photo
that I've sent you.

42
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,167
Footprints are large.

43
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,875
Maybe it's a spotted hyena.
If so, it will be extremely ferocious.

44
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,458
Okay. How soon can you get here?

45
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:30,333
Promise me, you won't tell your mom
that you were late for school today.

46
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,125
You promise me that you won't tell mom

47
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,875
that I took my phone to school
just for today.

48
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,542
Please, Dad!

49
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,833
The situation
is not under control, Parthiban.

50
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,750
Hyenas are social animals, Joshy.

51
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,458
They live in packs.

52
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,042
If a hyena is alone here,
either it has lost its way

53
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,375
or the rest of its clan is dead.
People will fear it and try to kill it.

54
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,000
But we have to capture it alive.

55
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,833
If you think like your men,
it will feast on us happily.

56
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,292
What to do now? What are you suggesting?

57
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,375
Walkie-talkie.

58
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,458
- Hey, Channel 3. We are on Channel 3.
- Got it.

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,375
Dad, I'll come along. I'll be helpful.

60
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,750
Stay in the car, my dear son.

61
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,917
That will be the biggest help.

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,292
I don't want to get chided by your mom.

63
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,417
Okay?

64
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,750
Put it! Put up the barricades.

65
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,792
Push it here, quickly. Hurry up. Come on.

66
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:39,417
- Why did you place the barricades?
- DFO's orders, sir.

67
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Watch out.

68
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,708
Do it fast!

69
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,042
Sir, why did you place
the barricades here?

70
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,167
The animal will barge into the school.
It's risky. Please remove it.

71
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,000
Ranger, listen to me.

72
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,625
I'll give you my uniform.
Do my job as well.

73
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,708
Scoundrel!
What are you all looking at?

74
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,792
- Make it fast.
- Come in, Parthiban.

75
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,625
- Yeah, Joshy.
- They think it's a joke.

76
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,375
I don't know what to do.
The situation is out of control.

77
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,708
Get a tranquilizer from the sanctuary.

78
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,333
I'll tell you from where to fire.

79
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,458
Yes, okay.

80
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,958
Catch it…

81
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,708
It's scared and is looking
for a place to hide.

82
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,208
They are trying to kill it
without understanding that.

83
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,208
So, the hyena will
soon enter the school.

84
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:25,875
Bring the tranquilizer
to the west end of the school.

85
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,000
Help!

86
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,500
Help…

87
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,458
All the kids should go in!

88
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,458
All the kids should go in!

89
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,667
Kids, get inside!

90
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,667
Students,
go to your classrooms immediately.

91
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,375
It's an emergency! Teachers and staff!

92
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,250
Please take all the children
safely into the classrooms.

93
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,042
There is no time. Hurry up!

94
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:01,792
Get in…

95
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,958
Go. Get in!

96
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:09,042
I got permission for a tranquilizer gun.
I'm taking it, okay?

97
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,208
Okay.

98
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:58,958
Give it to me.

99
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,542
<i>Parthiban.</i>

100
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,375
<i>I'm in position.</i>

101
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,875
Joshy, wait!

102
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,583
Don't aim at its neck
like our usual procedure.

103
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:14,583
Its striking force will be as heavy
as its pitch of laughter.

104
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,042
Aim for the lungs!

105
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,292
Shoot.

106
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,250
Darn.

107
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,417
- Hang on.
- This is the perfect time. Shoot, Joshy.

108
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,667
The gun is jammed, Parthiban.

109
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,542
A gun can't adapt
to the situation and operate.

110
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,167
It's a machine.
You need to service it every month.

111
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,250
- Siddhu?
- Dad.

112
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,458
Get your spear.

113
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,250
- Give your shoe lace to Joshy.
- Okay, Dad.

114
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,625
- Don't go…
- Run away.

115
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:23,958
You heard your dad, right?

116
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,417
Give me your shoe laces.

117
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,375
- Uncle, give the javelin to me.
- What?

118
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,625
Get inside!

119
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,167
Let's go!

120
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:20,500
<i>Parthiban, the spear you asked for
is on its way.</i>

121
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:24,125
- Tell my dad that I'm throwing it.
- Parthiban, here it comes!

122
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,375
Hey, come on, move.

123
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,167
Who is he?

124
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,458
Who is that man?

125
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,958
His name is Parthiban.

126
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,667
He's a Malayali.

127
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:43,750
Animal rescuer.

128
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,083
He runs a coffee shop nearby.

129
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,125
Hey!

130
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,000
- Get inside.
- Please, sir.

131
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,375
Come on, start.

132
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:56,833
Wait a minute.

133
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,875
Ask the questions in an order.
The DFO will answer you.

134
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,750
Look. This issue is not something
out of the ordinary.

135
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,375
It is our daily job.

136
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,083
Animals migrate
in search of food…

137
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,458
We've got exclusive news.
Why don't you cover it?

138
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:13,417
There's nothing to cover here.
These forest officers didn't do anything.

139
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,958
A middle-aged man in a white shirt
that was tucked in.

140
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:19,000
Find him and get
the real information from him.

141
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,458
That is exclusive.

142
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:22,208
- White shirt. Middle-aged man?
- Yes.

143
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,167
Where do I find him in this crowd?

144
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,375

146
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,917
You wanted a shirt urgently.

147
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,792
- What happened?
- Stitch it and bring it.

148
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,208
- What's this? It's blood-stained.
- Stitch it.

<i>I'm just a peace-loving soul</i>

163
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,375
- Hi, chief.
- Hi.

164
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,958
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

165
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,417
<i>My life is in this town…</i>

166
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,750
Hi, Thalapathy!

167
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,083
<i>My life is in this town</i>

168
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:12,083
<i>And I ain't going down…</i>

169
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,042
Why isn't the temperature increasing?

170
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:18,375
Some problem with the thermostat, sir.
I've called the service team.

171
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,667
They will visit today.

172
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,542
- The cakes are ready for delivery.
- Okay.

173
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,125
Can we dispatch them, sir?

174
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,542
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

175
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,333
<i>Just an ordinary person</i>

176
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,750
<i>Yeah</i>

177
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,625
<i>I'm just a peace-loving soul</i>

178
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,708
<i>I'm just an ordinary person</i>

179
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,708
<i>Yeah, I'm just a…</i>

180
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:43,875
Sir, this shirt is ripped badly.
It can't be stitched.

181
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,333
Do you know which shop
my wife bought this from?

182
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,833
- I don't know.
- I'm in trouble.

183
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,500
Hey, what's going on?
How did the police get our photos?

184
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,083
They are checking
at the borders and checkpoints.

185
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,042
<i>Those who told us to kill the collector
double-crossed us.</i>

186
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,917
<i>Not only that, they leaked our photos.</i>

187
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,250
<i>Don't go out for a week. Hide yourself.</i>

188
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,750
<i>Please don't get caught.</i>

189
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,542
<i>Go to the hills.</i>

190
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,292
What do you mean?
Where can we go right away?

191
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,708
The four of us have no clue
what is going to happen.

192
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,958
We trusted you and
you got us into trouble.

193
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,083
Do you think I'm mad?

194
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:20,000
We can't go anywhere.
We don't have money.

195
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,333
We can't hide anywhere.
Help us to come back.

196
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,625
<i>Understand the situation.</i>

197
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,292
<i>All those who were against the collector
are under radar.</i>

198
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,500
<i>It will take a week
to get help from the Center.</i>

199
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,167
<i>Don't call me again. I'll call you.</i>

200
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,542
<i>- Now hang up!</i>
- Hey…

201
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,708
Why are you looking at me?
Eyes on the road!

202
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:38,875
What, boss?

203
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,958
<i>In the early hours of yesterday morning,</i>

204
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,792
<i>some unknown men
broke into the collector's guesthouse</i>

205
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,792
<i>have throat-slit and brutally murdered…</i>

206
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,333
You didn't get ready yet?

207
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,375
Oh, my shirt?

208
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:06,625
I spilt chocolate on it,
so I put it to wash and changed…

209
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,667
I bought you that shirt
for our anniversary.

210
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,292
You've ruined it in every way possible.

211
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,542
I have nothing to say now, let it be.

212
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,083
My mood won't change today
no matter what excuse you give.

213
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,458
Do whatever you want.

214
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,458
There's no change in my plan.

215
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,333
I'm leaving in an angry mood.

216
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,667
<i>Half of my soul is yours</i>

217
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:04,417
<i>You are the light of my eyes</i>

218
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:10,000
<i>Your love is piercing like a weapon</i>

219
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,458
<i>This brave warrior's heart</i>

220
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,833
<i>Your hair is soft like flowers and shiny…</i>

221
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,167
Shall we pick up the kids from school?

222
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,583
<i>You are the love of my life…</i>

223
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:25,833
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

224
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:26,958
- Yes.
- Hi.

225
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,125
Yes, tell me.

226
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,917
Chintu…

227
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,000
M-Mathi's mother is unwell.

228
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,042
Siddharth's father isn't well.

229
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,708
I want to take her home.

230
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,792
- Who are you?
- His mom.

231
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:40,042
Her dad.

232
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:44,000
<i>Like a snowflakes in the wind</i>

233
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,667
<i>I rose up just for you</i>

234
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:52,458
<i>Only love…</i>

235
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,042
- A small peg?
- No, I don't drink.

236
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,917
- It's healthy and good for the weather.
- Really?

237
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,417
- How do you drink this, sir?
- True that!

238
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,542
- Dad.
- Don't be afraid.

239
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,500
We will be adopting this hyena.

240
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,083
What name would you suggest for it?

241
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,792
Elsa.

242
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,833
Ghost.

243
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,458
Hachiko.

244
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:32,542
I'll suggest a name,
but you guys shouldn't laugh.

245
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:36,000
Actually, Subramani sounds good, right?

246
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,792
<i>Everyday, when I wake up…</i>

247
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,208
Look ahead!

248
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:59,583
<i>I want you with me</i>

249
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,667
<i>Your love is piercing like a weapon</i>

250
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,333
<i>This brave warrior's heart</i>

251
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,250
- Chintu, come here.
- No, no.

252
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,208
- Come on, it's okay.
- Okay, go.

253
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:15,625
Slowly.

254
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,292
Come.

255
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,917
<i>You'll hug me, with your chest
as my divine headrest…</i>

256
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,500
Do you like him?

257
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:28,750
<i>Your love is piercing like a weapon</i>

258
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,708
<i>This brave warrior's heart</i>

259
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,125
Open it.

260
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,333
Chintu.

261
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
You're not supposed to help.

262
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,542
Please wait.

263
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,125
Go! Hurry!

264
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,792
Sir, no.

265
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,667
- Is the shop on the left or right?
- Over there, sir.

266
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,250
Give me the bill.

267
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:19,208
Sir, your shop seems empty.
When do you have regular consumers?

268
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,375
They will come after 6:00 p.m.

269
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,833
- Good day, sir.
- Bye.

270
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,250
We don't have any luck here.

271
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,958
Shall we go elsewhere?
What do you say?

272
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:36,583
We will wait.

273
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,708
Six o'clock.

274
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,667
He and his useless thugs
will be the death of me.

275
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,417
I don't know what will happen.

276
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:09,042
Everyone on the road is panic-stricken
and running around.

277
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,292
At that time, the serial killer
stands in the middle of the road

278
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,875
and shoots blindly.

279
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,250
There's already a pile of corpses
on the road.

280
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,875
He is notorious.
He shoots whomever he sees.

281
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,875
At that time, a brave and bold
police officer arrives

282
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,125
and fires at the serial killer.

283
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,833
The serial killer runs and hides.

284
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,375
The police officer reloads the gun

285
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,125
and in that gap, the serial killer fires.

286
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,292
Hey…

287
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:43,042
So the wounded police officer
falls at your feet.

288
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:47,292
He falls behind the car where
you were safely hiding.

289
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:52,000
Now the police officer's gun
is in your hand

290
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,333
and you have a clean shot.

291
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,417
The serial killer doesn't know
that you are there

292
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,083
but you can easily shoot him
from your position.

293
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,500
We got only 300 rupees.

294
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,458
And just this phone.

295
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,417
Get rid of this
and look for a bigger vehicle.

296
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,500
And you have an easy way out.

297
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,417
You can even escape
without being seen by anyone.

298
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,083
What will you do? Picture yourself.

299
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,167
I'll just sleep.

300
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,500
Oh! Will you just sleep?

301
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,792
- Yes.
- Siddhu, it's getting late. Go to bed.

302
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,167
Wait, Mom. Just two minutes.

303
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,125
I'll take the easy way out
and bring in more police officers.

304
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,125
By then, the serial killer
will kill more innocent people.

305
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:42,667
<i>When the moon sails by
In the night blue sky</i>

306
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:47,542
<i>She showers love and makes me yearn…</i>

307
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,458
I'll give the gun to the police officer.

308
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:02,000
And say,
'Look, here's a clear shot, fire.'

309
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:08,792
He's bleeding, dude. How can he shoot?

310
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,667
Picture yourself.

311
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,667
P-Please help…

312
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,250
- What is the number?
- Please!

313
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,583
She's a nuisance…

314
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,708
- Hello? Wait.
- Where are you, dear?

315
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,000
Here.

316
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,042
Ask for ATM PIN. Say that
I'll kill him.

317
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,417
<i>- We can't move due to the police.</i>
- Tell me.

318
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,417
<i>- Please do...</i>
- Don't raise your voice at me!

319
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,042
I would've been better off
marrying a tree instead.

320
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,292
Help me!

321
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,958
- PIN?
- Please don't hurt me.

322
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:43,833
- What's the PIN?
- Don't hurt me.

323
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,792
- What's the PIN?
- Please.

324
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,042
- No.
- What's the PIN?

325
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,542
Please don't.

326
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,250
Then I'll shoot him myself.

327
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:06,542
If you shoot him,
you'll also become a murderer.

328
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:11,417
It is against the law.
Think of something else.

329
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,583
Picture yourself.

330
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,250
Hey! Why did you shoot him?

331
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,708
How did you get this gun?

332
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,500
- PIN?
- What?

333
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:21,833
PIN?

334
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,833
I don't know what else to say, Dad.

335
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:29,625
Whichever way you see it,
my hands will be blood stained.

336
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:33,167
How does it matter if it's the blood
of a saint or a sinner?

337
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,500
Siddhu, go.
Go upstairs and sleep. It's getting late.

338
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,125
Chintu, come.

339
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,458
Dad!

340
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,792
Dad!

341
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,333
The only option is to shoot him.

342
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,917
Shoot whom?

343
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,875
The killer in the picture-yourself story.

344
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,458
Picture yourself?

345
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,708
I already told you.
Then you'll also be a murderer.

346
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,250
You'll end up in jail.
You can't even sleep peacefully.

347
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,333
Is that okay?

348
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:44,708
I won't be sent to jail.
I'll be sent to a juvenile home.

349
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,500
And if I'm lucky,
I'll get a sewing machine.

350
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,958
I Googled it.

351
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,333
Go!

352
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,167
- What were you busy chatting?
- Nothing.

353
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,583
What time is the wedding?

354
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,792
We'll drop them at the school
and reach on time.

355
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,125
He knows everything, right
up to getting a sewing machine!

356
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,125
Both of you, please sign.

357
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,000
Congrats.

358
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,708
Are you guys witnesses?
Please come and sign.

359
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,375
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

360
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,250
I'll see you guys.

361
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,833
- Bye.
- Yeah, see you, sir.

362
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,292
You can touch her only after I say so.

363
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:23,875
Take good care of her.

364
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,083
- Bye.
- Bye.

365
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,458
What about you, madam?

366
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:32,542
I've some work in the record room.
I'll go home by myself after that.

367
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,375
Do you wish to say anything?

368
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:39,542
Stop telling Siddhu
such nonsense picture-yourself stories.

369
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,958
- Why? What happened?
- Show me your phone.

370
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,583
Browser history.

371
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,458
Browser history? Mine or his?

372
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,250
- His, of course.
- Oh!

373
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,917
"How to hunt? How to kill a deer?"

374
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,833
"How to kill a hyena?"

375
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,292
"How to get successful in life..."
Is it a joke?

376
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,000
No, I'm just reading it.

377
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,250
Who taught him all this?
How does he know?

378
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,458
Okay, I'll ensure
this doesn't happen again.

379
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:10,625
- I'll keep an eye too!
- Okay.

380
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,583
Great horned owl, Joshy.

381
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,792
It's already
in the protected species' list.

382
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,250
Where did you get this?

383
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:30,417
Sir, this owl is from Australia.
We caught it. We know about it.

384
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,667
- He's lying, sir.
- I'll slap you!

385
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:36,042
Why are you courting trouble?
How many more owls did you catch?

386
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,583
Just this one, sir.
I hit it with my slingshot.

387
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:40,833
It fell down unconscious.

388
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:44,167
Joshy, inform Blue Cross.
It needs immediate treatment.

389
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,708
Send for our veterinary doctor too.

390
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:48,958
He's no more.

391
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,667
- What?
- Yeah, I forgot to tell you.

392
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,208
He died on the spot
in a car accident last night.

393
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:57,625
I think he lost control
and fell headlong into the valley.

394
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:00,958
Yeah.

395
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,167
What?

396
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,917
Okay, I'll come. Yeah.

397
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,500
It's not a car accident.

398
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:18,292
But a planned murder
of the veterinary doctor.

399
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,917
Murder? How come?

400
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,583
He was shot dead.
I just got the information.

401
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:25,417
Did they use a gun in our town?

402
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:27,875
Last week, when the sub-collector died

403
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,083
I thought it was a hit-and-run case,
but now the veterinary doctor…

404
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,625
Looks like a killing spree.

405
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:35,750
I don't get it, Joshy.

406
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,375
I've been living here
for the past 20 years.

407
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,583
I've never heard of anything like this.

408
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,750
How did anyone get a gun
in this town, Joshy?

409
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,958
Parthiban, why are you anxious?
We'll take care of it.

410
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,167
I'll go now and check.

411
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,583
Shall I come along?

412
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:08,667
<i>Last week, when the sub-collector died,
I thought it was a hit-and-run case.</i>

413
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,292
<i>But now, the veterinary doctor.</i>

414
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,750
<i>Looks like a killing spree.</i>

415
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,625
Dad, it is your turn.

416
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:32,125
Dad!

417
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,750
- Your turn.
- Okay.

418
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:42,083
<i>My sweet honey, dark as ebony</i>

419
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:47,333
<i>Why did you become my fair lady?</i>

420
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,583
<i>I won't touch you, my princess</i>

421
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,917
<i>But if I do, I can't stop my caress</i>

426
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,042
<i>My king is so handsome
With a smile so winsome</i>

427
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,792
<i>Love-goosebumps you give me</i>

428
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:27,208
<i>I won't let you go Scot-free
Without you caressing me</i>

429
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:31,000
<i>Shall we share our desire

430
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:35,000

<i>My sweet honey, dark as ebony…</i>

434
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,417
Sir, I've finished work. May I leave now?

435
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,375
Sir, don't tease me.
I'm going back to the hostel.

436
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,875
Go.

437
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:05,542
My song is much better than yours.

438
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,875
Wait for the next special item.

439
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,125
Shall I play it?

440
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,333
First look there.

441
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,833
The shop is closed, sir.

442
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:26,458
<i>Thirupaachi…</i>

443
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,125
I want chocolate coffee.

444
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,667
It's closed, sir.
Didn't you see the sign outside?

445
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,375
Chocolate coffee.

446
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,958
- The shop is closed, brother.
- Chocolate coffee.

447
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:38,208
Sir!

448
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,708
I've cleared up everything inside, sir.

449
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,667
Can I come an hour late tomorrow?
I'm going to visit the temple.

450
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,875
The shop is closed, sir.

451
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:49,167
Shruthi, leave now. Hurry up.

452
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,208
I'm talking to you.
Can you hear me or not?

453
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:54,583
- The shop is closed...
- Shruthi. Go, I'll talk to him.

454
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,375
Hey! Let go of my hand!

455
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,333
Let me go!

456
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:01,875
Sir, he...

457
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,458
Brother.

458
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:08,000
<i>Shall we share our desire

461
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,708
Hey! The gun is missing.
Check if he has taken it.

462
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:27,042
Let me go!

463
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,208
- Brother.
- Yes?

464
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:31,792
I've brought all the cash I've got here.

465
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,750
Let me know if you want more.
I'll give you.

466
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,708
Let her go, please.

467
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:38,250
This is wrong, brother.

468
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:41,292
Let her go. Please, I'm begging you.

469
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,167
Chocolate coffee.

470
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,542
Let me go.

471
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:53,792
Stay right here.

472
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:56,833
Don't come out till I tell you, okay?

473
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,208
Sir!

474
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,708
<i>- I went crazy…</i>
- Let me go!

475
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:01,542
<i>On a spell so dizzy…</i>

476
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,833
Boss, he is inside.

477
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,417
<i>This is my job daily,

478
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,458
<i>My job is to think of you
Night and day all through…</i>

479
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:14,042
- Hey! Shut the gate!
- <i>Let us think this happened, indeed</i>

480
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,958
<i>Let us transform our thoughts to deed</i>

481
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:19,167
- Sir!
<i>- When…</i>

482
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,250
- Spread a mat and then…
- Sir!

483
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,958
- Sir, do something.
- Hey!

484
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,625
What did I tell you
and what are you doing?

485
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,292
<i>Like the warmth of blazing fire</i>

486
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,875
<i>Soft as cotton…</i>

487
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,292
Sir!

488
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,667
Sir!

489
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,375
Hey, our job is done. Let's go.

490
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:42,875
Hey!

491
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,417
Come with me or just die!

492
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,500
The guy, this girl, the child
and the CCTV here

493
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,458
are all aware of our identities.

494
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:55,583
If we leave like this,
we will be nabbed by tomorrow.

495
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:56,958
What do we do?

496
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,042
Do you want chocolate coffee?

497
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,292
<i>Like the warmth of blazing fire</i>

498
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,708
<i>Shall we share our desire…</i>

499
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,042
- Sir.
- Good boy.

500
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:07,542
Sir!

501
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,792
Hey! Clear the CCTV footage.

502
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,417
Sir...

503
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:29,833
Sir...

504
00:35:56,125 --> 00:36:00,833
<i>The lotus and its water
Never fight with each other</i>

505
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:06,958
<i>No one is around,
Hug me in a tight embrace</i>

506
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:13,542
<i>Like salt in pearl millet adds to treat
My porridge of life turns into a feast</i>

507
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:14,833
Hey!

508
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,375
<i>Your face is embedded in my heart</i>

509
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:24,708
<i>With my tongue, I can touch my nose</i>

510
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:30,417
<i>You touched my soul with your glance</i>

511
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:35,375
You're trying to kill me! Kill him!

512
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:42,250
<i>No one is around, embrace me</i>

513
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:18,042
<i>The way IR8 rice boils well and blends
You bonded well with me</i>

514
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:24,208
<i>You irrigated so well
My drought-ridden heart swell</i>

515
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:30,167
<i>Like a mother cat with her kittens
You swirled at my feet smitten</i>

516
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:35,833
<i>Feeling sorry, I petted you softly
You snarled to bite at me</i>

517
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,667
- Dad!
- <i>I own your soul, heart and body</i>

518
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,042
Dad!

519
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,542
Shruthi! Chintu!

520
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:45,333
<i>Your hands caressing my cheeks gently</i>

521
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,042
Chocolate coffee?

522
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,292
Dad!

523
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,458
Dad!

524
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,500
<i>Will a bud blooming into a flower now
Without feeling shy, express love?</i>

525
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,708
<i>Is it fight or honey-duet
To the flower and bee in pursuit?</i>

526
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:11,042
<i>The lotus and its water
Never fight with each other</i>

527
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:16,792
<i>I want to hug my dearest beloved
Even though he isn't yet my husband</i>

528
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:37,417
<i>Let's go to the riverside with a tree
It is a solitary love-spot</i>

529
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,542
<i>When the tide ebbs aside
Let us return gratified</i>

530
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:49,583
<i>I can teach you to swim happily
Come with me, my one and only</i>

531
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:55,667
<i>Let me tell you right now, hush!
Here and there my hands brush!</i>

532
00:38:55,958 --> 00:39:01,875
<i>Even spots on the Moon can be wiped clear
But you can never be reformed, dear</i>

533
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:07,792
<i>Even if overturned and hit
A turtle's shell won't break a bit</i>

534
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,292
Sir…

535
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,125
Hey! Let him go!

536
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,583
Or I'll stab her!

537
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:19,917
Sir!

538
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,500
Sir!

539
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,417
Sir!

540
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,042
Sir!

541
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,875
Stab him now.

542
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,458
Where are you off to?

543
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,125
Dad!

544
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:12,167
Dad!

545
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,167
Dad!

546
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,417
Chintu!

547
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:12,667
Dad!

548
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,792
Dad!

549
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,125
Parthiban!

550
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,000
Parthiban.

551
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:47,500
Drive to the hospital first.

552
00:41:56,708 --> 00:42:00,417
It doesn't look like a clot.
No physical injuries.

553
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,625
But she is showing signs of PTSD.

554
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:06,958
This child is in shock.
She is bound to feel anxious.

555
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,958
But there's nothing to worry.
I'll give her some medicine.

556
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:12,417
Take good care of her, okay?

557
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,417
Parthiban.

558
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:21,250
Parthiban, stop thinking about it
and getting upset.

559
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,625
Anyone in your place
would've done the same.

560
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,208
We will face the consequences.

561
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:29,750
I'll be there for you.

562
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:34,167
I'll take care of the children
till you get released.

563
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:38,625
- But don't regret...
- Sathya, I don't know what happened.

564
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,083
He went towards Chintu.

565
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,042
I saw him.

566
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,458
I was…

567
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,875
After that…

568
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,958
- Sir, I can't wait any longer.
- May I go in?

569
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,917
Parthiban, the police officers
are waiting outside.

570
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:04,417
I told them not to come in.

571
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,042
- Joshy, without this remand...
- Sathya, are you kidding?

572
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,875
Do you know the seriousness of this?

573
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,875
Five of them have been killed.

574
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:15,875
What do you want me to do?
He's a murderer now.

575
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:19,667
He has to be remanded for 15 days.
We have to follow procedures.

576
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:22,750
Once he is produced at court,
We can handle the rest.

577
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,208
Don't panic, okay?

578
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,750
Parthiban, let's go.

579
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:40,625
Before you proclaim the judgment,
I have one question.

580
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:45,458
According to the ballistic reports,
five bullets fired from the gun

581
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:48,792
penetrated the victims' foreheads
at point-blank range.

582
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,750
Not a single bullet misfired.

583
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,958
A person who has never
handled a gun before

584
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:55,792
was able to fire five bullets
in a split second. How?

585
00:43:55,875 --> 00:44:00,042
Sometimes, even trained police officers
struggle to shoot below the knee.

586
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:02,958
But without being least perturbed

587
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:05,917
how could he shoot five times
at point blank range?

588
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,083
Inspector Bhawar Jetha.

589
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,667
Compare Mr. Parthiban's shooting skill

590
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,708
with that of a few ordinary men.

591
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:16,875
This court orders proper proof
backed with adequate explanation.

592
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:20,042
Nazrat!

593
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,917
Go and stand over there.

594
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,042
- Hey! Stop!
- Shahid.

595
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,458
Note down everything.

596
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,958
Sashikanth.

597
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:35,042
- What are you doing?
- First lower the gun.

598
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,708
Parthiban!

599
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,250
Parthiban!

600
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,583
Step forward.

601
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:24,833
- Kumar.
- Sir?

602
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:26,458
Give him the 9 mm.

603
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,917
The man who killed my husband

604
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:13,083
and my younger brother…

605
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:16,750
Only after I send him
with his family to their graves

606
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:20,958
will I allow the funeral rites
of my husband to be performed.

607
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:23,958
I take this vow! I swear!

608
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:25,625
I swear!

609
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,292
It's okay.

610
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,000
Parthiban, here…

611
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,875
Your action was only a general exception.
Don't worry.

612
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:48,208
Parthiban! The ones you killed
weren't good people.

613
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:51,250
They are all gangsters.
It will come under self-defense.

614
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,250
Okay? Nothing to worry.

615
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,292
We'll take care. Okay?

616
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:59,792
Your Honor, a few days ago,
when a spotted hyena

617
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:04,208
strayed into our town,
everyone wanted to kill it.

618
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:06,583
But my client risked his life

619
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:09,000
and saved the hyena
from the people's cruel assault.

620
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,667
This is my question, Your Honor.

621
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,250
How can a man who loves
even a beast to this extent

622
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,083
kill those five men?

623
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:18,000
He killed those ruthless men
in an act of self-defense

624
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:20,958
with the intention of saving
the woman, child and himself.

625
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:23,750
Your Honor,
the mighty penal code may insulate

626
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,125
this gentleman's act of self-defense.

627
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,167
Bearing in mind the interrogation,

628
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,917
arguments and statements debated here,

629
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,833
having scrutinized this case thoroughly,

630
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,875
Mr. Parthiban, the accused,

631
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:46,417
has been proven innocent,

632
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:48,750
as per IPC Section 103 and 106.

633
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:52,792
The court pronounces its verdict.

634
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:04,667
Parthiban,
walk free with your head held high.

635
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:21,000
Move!

636
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,542
- Move them out of the way.
- Move aside.

637
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,708
Move out of the way.
Ask them to move out of the way.

638
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:30,333
- Is the decision to acquit you right?
- Move.

639
00:48:30,542 --> 00:48:33,375
What's the reason
you had to shoot five people?

640
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,583
Come.

641
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,208
Give me that.

642
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,333
Get in.

643
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,875
Move!

644
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:46,708
Move. Move out of the way.

645
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:48,833
- Sir…
- Sir!

646
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:54,625
You okay?

647
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,333
Dad.

648
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,333
- Yes?
- You were right, Dad.

649
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,958
Even if we're holding a gun,
we shouldn't shoot.

650
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:10,958
That isn't easy.

651
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:12,917
I can picture myself.

652
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,583
I feel sorry for you, Dad.
I can't bear to see you like this.

653
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:32,792
The dead men have many cases against them.
They aren't ordinary criminals.

654
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:36,333
This is a loss to their acquaintances.
Do you think they will keep quiet?

655
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:37,875
<i>Be careful, Sathya.</i>

and go back to normal
at the coffee shop, Sathya.

666
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:42,167
I'm unable to focus.

667
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,375
<i>I'm scared of the voices</i>

668
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,500
<i>Of the click, of the beat</i>

<i>Shit scared of A, Shit scared of B…</i>

697
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,083
I kept it somewhere here.

698
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,417
Where is it?

699
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,458
What are you looking for?
You won't find anything there.

700
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:18,583
You need to buy something
to claim that it's missing.

701
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,708
How much longer will you hide
at home, Parthiban?

702
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,208
The cafe has been closed for ten days.

703
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:28,458
You aren't even sending
your daughter to school.

704
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,292
Just look at their faces.

705
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:33,292
Not only have you confined yourself
to the home

706
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:36,750
you've kept your family locked up
within these four walls.

707
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:41,583
How long will you shut your ears
when you hear a slight noise?

708
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:44,625
Go get some fresh air.

709
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:48,500
I'll take care of the house.
Take your family out first.

710
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,708
Go!

711
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,208
I feel like drinking coffee.

712
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:13,125
I'm stepping out to buy a packet of milk.

713
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,833
Do any of you want anything?

714
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:37,208
- Greetings, sir.
- Hello, sir.

715
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,833
- Hi, sir.
- Greetings.

716
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:42,125
He is a brave man.

717
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:48,583
Parthiban, I need to buy
something from there.

718
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,000
You guys come with me.

719
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:53,667
Buy whatever you wanted. Come, Siddhu.

720
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,042
- Take care.
- Okay, Dad.

721
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,917
Mom, I want bread omelet.

722
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,583
Okay, I'll buy it for you.

723
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,042
- One bread omelet, please.
- Okay, ma'am.

724
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,333
- You give it, I'll be back.
- Okay, Mom.

725
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:12,083
- Hello?
<i>- Sir, Kumar here.</i>

726
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,667
<i>- It's a pitch deck info.</i>
- Yeah.

727
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,042
There's some suspicious activity in town.
Parthiban's family is in danger.

728
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:20,167
We got this information
from an undercover agent two weeks ago.

729
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,625
<i>But the inspector hid it.</i>

730
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:23,875
<i>Tell his family not to go out
without protection.</i>

731
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,542
Yeah, okay. I'll call you back.

732
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:31,042
Parthiban, where are you?

733
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:34,875
- I'm at the market.
<i>- Does anyone seem suspicious around?</i>

734
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,458
<i>Parthiban?</i>

735
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,375
No. Why?

736
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,875
The department got information

737
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,792
that some unwanted elements are here.

738
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:49,500
Drop whatever you're doing
and get back into the car.

739
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:51,125
<i>Right now, please…</i>

740
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,958
Hey! Only after I kill you and your family

741
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:12,083
and take your head with me,
will I bury my brother-in-law.

742
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,542
Behead him!

743
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:10,000
Parthiban!

744
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,292
Hey!

745
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,667
How dare you lay your dirty hands
on my family?

746
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:34,208
Dad!

747
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,375
Parthiban, don't! Listen to me.

748
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:15,792
Parthiban!

749
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,292
Parthiban! Parthiban! Listen to me!

750
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,500
What are you doing?

751
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,083
Parthiban! Parthiban!

752
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:32,333
Move!

753
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,583
Parthiban! What are you doing?
Leave him alone.

754
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:48,375
If I let him go, they will kill us!

755
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:19,708
Parthi, I'm scared to see you
sitting here like this.

756
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,542
We can come
when the inspector calls.

757
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,875
Let's go home now.

758
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:26,542
I'm not going anywhere.

759
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:28,625
- Kumar!
- Sir!

760
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:31,000
Why is it so crowded outside?
Is it a fish market?

761
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:33,417
- Go and check.
- Parthi.

762
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,292
What are our men doing outside?

763
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:38,208
What is it? I'd asked you to file
a complaint and leave, right?

764
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:40,833
Why do you insist on meeting me?

765
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:42,917
Don't we have any other damn work?

766
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:45,625
Go to the writer's table
and he'll write what you say.

767
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:48,125
Sign or stamp your thumbprint
and leave, understand?

768
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:49,250
I'll see to it.

769
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,083
Hey! Send my tea inside.

770
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:57,292
Where are you going?

771
00:59:58,542 --> 01:00:00,833
What will you see? Will you see us die?

772
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:05,333
Do we have to live in fear, wondering
who will attack us every time we step out?

773
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:07,417
Why are you getting worked up?

774
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:13,250
Two days ago, one of the corpses
from the shoot-out

775
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:15,167
went missing from the mortuary.

776
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,375
The department asked you to alert us.

777
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,083
Why didn't you caution us, sir?

778
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:23,167
Who told you all this? The ranger?

779
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:24,458
Look here.

780
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:27,167
Do we have to think of you
24×7 and serve only you?

781
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,375
In all fairness...

782
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,583
- Wait, Sathya.
- Let's go.

783
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,792
In all fairness,
I did what you should've done.

784
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:34,500
I had no choice but shoot
when he tried to kill my daughter.

785
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:35,792
He died! That's all.

786
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,958
Please. No need. Let's go home, please.

787
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:42,042
- Please.
- I want an armed guard

788
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:44,125
posted at my house 24×7.

789
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,125
I won't leave until then.

790
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:48,542
Hey! Get up, man!

791
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:50,208
I'm telling you to get up!

792
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:52,167
Get up! Get up from here!

793
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,125
Please. Let's go.

794
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:55,292
As if you are
an influential political leader!

795
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,667
Get out!

796
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,208
Out!

797
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:02,500
He wants an armed policeman, it seems.

798
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:08,500
You can't just order
and get an armed cop at your disposal.

799
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:11,417
The law and the government
must pass the order.

800
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,375
Let's go.

801
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:16,375
You are neither the law
nor the government.

802
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:19,458
You are a common man
who sells bun and butter, Parthiban.

803
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:22,750
- Let's go, Parthi!
- Come in. We were waiting for you.

804
01:01:24,917 --> 01:01:27,458
- He can't tolerate noise.
- Let's go, Parthi.

805
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:32,292
We should stand outside his house
holding a gun for his safety, it seems.

806
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:34,625
And he'll sit inside the house,
hugging his wife...

807
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,000
Hey! You're a police officer!
Mind your words!

808
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:38,167
What did you say!

809
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,958
- Hey!
- Parthiban!

810
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:43,167
- Let go!
- Parthiban, let him go!

811
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:46,208
Parthiban, don't!
He's a police officer, leave him.

812
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,125
Let go!

813
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:56,125
Parthiban! Listen. Let go of him.

814
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,167
Hold him back, guys. Come on.

815
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,250
Parthiban, you've already
been arrested once.

816
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:03,000
Let him go. Listen to me.

817
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:04,500
He is a policeman.

818
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:06,292
- Please! Let him go!
- Parthiban, stop!

819
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:08,208
- Listen to me!
- Listen to me, Parthiban!

820
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,833
He will die. Let him go!

821
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:23,250
Sir, are you alright? Is your neck okay?

822
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:29,833
Parthiban.

823
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:33,208
Why did you do it, Parthiban?
I told you not to.

824
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:36,417
They won't give you police protection
as and when you ask, Parthiban.

825
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,917
There's no proof of assault against you.
You haven't sustained any injuries.

826
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:44,708
Who said that I'm not injured?

827
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:10,875
Parthiban, are you really sure?

828
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:13,875
Joshy, I may go overboard
if I do it myself.

829
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,292
So, you do it.

830
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,125
You asked for it!

831
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:41,000
SP sir, can you come to my residence?

832
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,917
Now. Yes, it's urgent.

833
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,542
Sir, one small request.

834
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:49,083
Please give me a police officer
from Kerala.

835
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,708
900 KILOS OF DRUGS SEIZED

836
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:03,250
Napoleon reporting to duty, sir!

837
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,458
Where is my position?

838
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:09,208
Hush!

839
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,542
Who is this man?

840
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:40,458
You requested
for a high-ranking Kerala police officer.

841
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,625
He is that high-ranking police officer.

842
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:45,500
You must've heard
of a drug bust in Trichy.

843
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,917
I heard he was responsible
for finishing off 50-60 of those men.

844
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:44,958
- Move this table over there at once.
- Okay, sir.

845
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,125
Fast.

846
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,208
Hey!

847
01:06:51,292 --> 01:06:52,500
Put your phone down.

848
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:55,167
Listen!

849
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:57,583
What do you want?

850
01:06:58,042 --> 01:06:59,042
Wait!

851
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,292
Are you a Malayali? Hey, don't run!

852
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,292
Load the stuff fast!

853
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:17,500
TELANGANA

854
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,708
What is it?

855
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:22,083
What?

856
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:46,167
Are you transferring our own stuff
without our knowledge?

857
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,375
Come here!

858
01:07:57,792 --> 01:07:58,917
Boss!

859
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,667
Move aside!

860
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,833
Boss!

861
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:04,417
Out of my way! Move aside!

862
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,208
Boss?

863
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:25,542
You better pray to God
that it's important news.

864
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:27,292
Or you'll die here.

865
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:28,917
Look at this picture.

866
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,083
<i>Hey!</i>

867
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,083
<i>Hey!</i>

868
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,042
<i>He is a freaking badass, man</i>

869
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:08,208
<i>He's a badass, run for your life quickly</i>

870
01:09:08,292 --> 01:09:13,208
<i>He's a badass, stay in your limits</i>

871
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:15,833
<i>Badass, man</i>

872
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:18,542
<i>Leo Das, man</i>

873
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:23,000
<i>He's a badass, run for your life quickly</i>

874
01:09:23,167 --> 01:09:24,417
Got you, rascal!

875
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:26,583
<i>Hey!</i>

876
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:29,542
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass</i>

877
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,000
<i>Hey!</i>

878
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,625
<i>He is a freaking badass, man</i>

879
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:37,167
<i>A feast at the forest
where the lion is on the prowl</i>

880
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,625
<i>Fearing his hunt, they scatter
Hither and thither</i>

881
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:44,833
<i>Putting an end to gangsters countless,
He'll punish them ruthless</i>

882
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,583
<i>Till now, he was a good soul</i>

883
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:50,125
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass</i>

884
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:53,042
<i>But now on, he will be a demon</i>

885
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,750
<i>He is a burning ember</i>

886
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,667
<i>Don't you come near him</i>

887
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:03,083
<i>He will spill your guts out!</i>

888
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:05,125
<i>Just remember that!</i>

889
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,292
<i>Hey!</i>

890
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,625
<i>He is a badass!</i>

891
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,417
<i>Stay in your limits</i>

892
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,792
<i>Badass, man</i>

893
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,500
<i>Leo Das, man</i>

894
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:25,417
<i>He's a badass. Run for your life.</i>

895
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,667
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass</i>

896
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,000
How many people should we send from here?

897
01:10:40,042 --> 01:10:41,542
If he's really Parthiban,

898
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:43,208
four people will suffice.

899
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,875
But if he is Leo…

900
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,125
- We'll chop him!
- We'll chop him!

901
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:00,833
- We will chop him
- We will chop him into pieces!

902
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:03,875
LEO DAS, BORN: 13-05-1977

903
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:06,208
…our entire town won't do!

904
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:11,917
<i>Don't act too smart, man</i>

905
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,458
<i>He will give you grief and strife
Beat you to a pulp and end your life</i>

906
01:11:20,417 --> 01:11:23,042
<i>He is a burning ember</i>

907
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,542
<i>Don't you go near him</i>

908
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:28,167
<i>He will spill your guts out!</i>

909
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,042
<i>Just remember that!</i>

910
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,917
<i>He is a badass!</i>

911
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,458
<i>Run for your life</i>

912
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:42,875
<i>Badass is he</i>

913
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:45,667
<i>Stay within your limits</i>

914
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,917
<i>Hey!</i>

915
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,083
<i>Hey!</i>

916
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:05,042
Thank you.

917
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:08,708
- Is it sweet?
- Bloody sweet.

918
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:11,083
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass</i>

919
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:13,750
<i>Leo</i>

920
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:16,000
<i>He's a freaking badass, man</i>

921
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:18,708
<i>Leo!</i>

922
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:21,292
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass</i>

923
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:22,792
<i>Leo!</i>

924
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:24,000
LEO

925
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:25,833
<i>Rest in peace!</i>

926
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:30,292
This one is…

927
01:12:31,917 --> 01:12:32,958
Almost the same.

928
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:36,042
- I'll make it better.
- Yes.

929
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:39,625
A girl over there has been
watching you for a long time.

930
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:41,583
Don't turn around immediately.

931
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,542
Could she be from the press?

932
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,250
Did she leave?

933
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:07,792
Also, a man at the back
has been here for a long time.

934
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:10,417
He isn't saying anything.
Go and have a word with him.

935
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,042
- Where? Behind?
- In the backyard.

936
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:14,167
- Okay. Go, I'll handle him.
- Okay.

937
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:28,042
"Pleasure is mine."

938
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:40,250
Hi, sir. What would you like to eat?

939
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,792
- Coffee.
- Sugar?

940
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,333
You know very well

941
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:56,083
whether I take sugar or not.

942
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,333
How would I know
whether you prefer sugar or not?

943
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,375
- With sugar.
- Okay.

944
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,083
Sorry, sir.

945
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:22,583
- One sugar cube or two...
- You know that too.

946
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:27,583
Sir, I don't know that.
You've mistaken me for someone else.

947
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:31,500
I am thrilled to hear you speak Malayalam.
I'm just humoring you.

948
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,583
Your coffee, your sugar.

949
01:14:33,792 --> 01:14:34,958
Leo?

950
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:40,083
Leo!

951
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,083
Parthiban.

952
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,917
I don't know anyone named Leo, sir.
There's already a lot of confusion here.

953
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,958
Please don't add to it.
Please drink your coffee and leave.

954
01:14:51,042 --> 01:14:52,208
Do you mind?

955
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,167
Can you make it a little stronger?

956
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,375
Sure, sir.

957
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,875
Do you know this brand, Leo?

958
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:10,458
No, sir.
I don't have the habit of smoking.

959
01:15:10,542 --> 01:15:13,708
- I can't even stand the smell.
- D Slash.

960
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:17,625
You used to call it Honey Badger,
but it is Black Devil.

961
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,417
Twenty-five puffs.

962
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,833
The flavor that you created.

963
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:26,792
You really like nocturnal animals, right?

964
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:29,958
Once a honey badger
entered our tobacco field.

965
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,333
Do you remember?

966
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,500
It didn't get caught in your trap.

967
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:36,292
It didn't get killed
by Harold's spear either.

968
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:39,917
In the end, it died
by the bullet that I fired.

969
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:42,375
I think you've forgotten it.

970
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:45,750
Do you want anything
other than coffee or shall I get the bill?

971
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:49,125
Have you convinced yourself
that you are dead, Leo?

972
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:50,750
Wait, what?

973
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:55,917
Listen.

974
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,917
I've many problems on my mind.
I've a splitting headache.

975
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,125
I'll tell you in a way
you'll understand, one last time.

976
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:04,750
You've mistaken me for someone else.

977
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:09,875
I have very less patience, dear.

978
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:12,833
So don't waste my time.

979
01:16:13,292 --> 01:16:14,625
Mount View Lodge.

980
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:17,625
Come of your own accord
and admit that you're Leo.

981
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:22,917
Sir, alcohol is not allowed.

982
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:36,167
No alcohol!

983
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,333
No alcohol.

984
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,750
A friend of my friend is in Kadapa.

985
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:35,625
I sent him a photo
of the D Slash cigarette box

986
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,000
and got some details.

987
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:40,708
Going by what he says,
the chap who came here

988
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,542
is Antony Das.

989
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:47,917
Once upon a time in Andhra Pradesh,
he ran a huge tobacco company.

990
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,542
- After a big fire accident...
- Hold on.

991
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,083
Why should I know
the history of the one

992
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:57,417
who barged into my cafe
and blew cigarette smoke in my face?

993
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,667
No, but this is important.

994
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:01,167
- No, I...
- Let him complete.

995
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,667
Go on, Joshy.

996
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:06,583
Antony Das has a son named Leo.

997
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:08,458
Okay.

998
01:18:08,542 --> 01:18:10,000
Leo Das.

999
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:13,375
I couldn't find any details
other than his name.

1000
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:16,250
One group says that he committed
a grave mistake and died.

1001
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:19,708
Another group believes he is still alive.

1002
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:22,125
He can fool this town.

1003
01:18:23,792 --> 01:18:25,875
He can fool the world.

1004
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,833
But he can never fool me.

1005
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,875
In some odd way,
you have a striking resemblance to him.

1006
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,208
I saw his eyes.

1007
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:39,000
I know his eyes.

1008
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:41,583
It is him.

1009
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:44,292
Parthiban, you grew up
in an orphanage, right?

1010
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:48,333
- Do you remember anything from before?
- What is this? This is not fair!

1011
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:49,792
We are the victims here.

1012
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:52,375
You are treating
the victim like an accused.

1013
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:54,083
- Let's leave, Parthi.
- Wait.

1014
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,500
Sathya, one moment.

1015
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:57,542
Joshy.

1016
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:02,083
I get that you are asking this
out of concern.

1017
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,333
But since my childhood

1018
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:07,500
until I was 20, I grew up
in Sathyamangalam Orphanage.

1019
01:19:08,167 --> 01:19:09,875
And I met her there…

1020
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,625
What was that, Sathya?

1021
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:13,708
Munnar trekking.

1022
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:15,125
There's where we met.

1023
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:18,125
I saw her. I got to know her.

1024
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:20,500
Within two days,
I asked her if she'd marry me.

1025
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:21,625
That's all.

1026
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:25,375
After marrying her,
we settled here because of her job.

1027
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:28,542
This has been my town since then.
This is my story.

1028
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,833
They have also come
from the south, Parthiban.

1029
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,333
If they've crossed so many miles
and come by road to our place

1030
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:38,000
in search of you, something is amiss.

1031
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,792
Whatever came to a grinding halt
because of him

1032
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:43,083
needs to be restarted using him.

1033
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:47,625
I know how to bring him back
into our fold.

1034
01:19:48,167 --> 01:19:49,917
My world is very small, Joshy.

1035
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,083
It's like a snow globe
that fits in the palm of my hand.

1036
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:56,042
A small independent house,
surrounded by trees.

1037
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,792
Snowfall, cool breeze...

1038
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,333
Why is this happening to me?

1039
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:02,917
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1040
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,167
I'm sorry.

1041
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,083
It's alright. I understand.

1042
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,958
If they come back
to cause further trouble,

1043
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:12,792
we'll inform the police.

1044
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,500
Keep an eye on his family and friends.

1045
01:20:16,542 --> 01:20:17,792
I'll take care of it.

1046
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:28,208
I feel like someone
is watching our home, Sathya.

1047
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:31,792
I don't know, Sathya. The eerie silence

1048
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:35,667
makes me restless. I feel very disturbed.

1049
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,792
Look here. Understand this.

1050
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:46,542
You should feel this way
only if I suspect you.

1051
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:49,625
Have I ever questioned you?

1052
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:53,583
Stop thinking about these things
and sleep peacefully, come.

1053
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:57,542
Won't you come?

1054
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,667
Okay, shall we stand like this and sleep?

1055
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:07,250
Don't touch the engine,
just fix the heater.

1056
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,208
I want my vehicle.

1057
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:14,792
Get it ready by evening, okay?

1058
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,583
What do you want?

1059
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:47,500
I saw you.

1060
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,583
That's enough for me.

1061
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:54,458
I'm so mad at you, if I slap you now

1062
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:56,333
your mouth will be injured badly

1063
01:21:56,417 --> 01:21:59,167
and it will seem like
a weird smile is plastered.

1064
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,292
I'm sorry.

1065
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,375
- Get out!
- I'll leave!

1066
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:06,333
I'll leave.

1067
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:13,292
- Tell me, Sathya.
- I bought the tablet you wanted.

1068
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:14,792
<i>Do you want anything else?</i>

1069
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,458
I've given the vehicle
for service.

1070
01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:18,667
I told you that we can go later
to the pharmacy?

1071
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:22,208
<i>- Why did you leave the kid alone at home?</i>
- I brought Mathi with me.

1072
01:22:22,292 --> 01:22:23,583
<i>Priya is also with me.</i>

1073
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:25,667
You could've waited.
What was the hurry?

1074
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,417
Some things can't be delayed, right?

1075
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,667
<i>It's not a problem.
I'll take an auto home.</i>

1076
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,917
<i>- You take care.</i>
- Go home and call me.

1077
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:41,208
Do you wanna get something to eat?

1078
01:23:59,292 --> 01:24:01,500
There's nothing to panic about.

1079
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:05,167
It is the same blood.

1080
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,500
Do you know who she is?

1081
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,167
My granddaughter.

1082
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:12,583
My blood.

1083
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:16,250
Yesterday you were the one who…

1084
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:20,167
You better leave
or I may have to call the police.

1085
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:22,667
Police?

1086
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:26,542
I haven't come to trouble you.

1087
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:31,292
For the past 20 years, you've been living
with a guy who you believe is Parthiban.

1088
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,417
When you realise he was a ruthless killer

1089
01:24:34,542 --> 01:24:39,458
who committed many murders,

1090
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,375
come and meet me.

1091
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:46,167
I'll show you the true colors
of your husband.

1092
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,250
- Hello?
- Why don't you pick up, Parthi?

1093
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:56,875
- He was here.
<i>- What happened?</i>

1094
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,083
<i>Who? Who was there?</i>

1095
01:24:58,167 --> 01:25:00,542
The same guy!
You said he visited the cafe yesterday!

1096
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:02,375
<i>He came to medical shop
looking for me.</i>

1097
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:03,833
<i>Where are you now?</i>

1098
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:04,958
At home.

1099
01:25:05,042 --> 01:25:07,458
<i>They followed me in their car.
It is parked outside.</i>

1100
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:10,250
<i>Close the doors.
Give the phone to the police officer.</i>

1101
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:12,333
He is missing. No one is here.

1102
01:25:12,417 --> 01:25:13,667
<i>I'm scared, Parthi.</i>

1103
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,875
<i>Lock yourself in our bedroom safely.</i>

1104
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,458
<i>Siddhu is coming. I'm also on my way!</i>

1105
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,250
Answer the call!

1106
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:34,875
- Dad, what is it?
- Siddharth! Go home immediately.

1107
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:37,000
- Pick your spear and go in.
- What happened?

1108
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:40,250
If anyone tries to enter the house,
throw your spear at him.

1109
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:41,583
Okay.

1110
01:27:04,792 --> 01:27:07,417
Will our lives be like this now, Parthi?

1111
01:27:07,542 --> 01:27:09,625
We have to be on the run.
We have to hide.

1112
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:10,958
We should live in fear

1113
01:27:11,042 --> 01:27:14,333
wondering what might happen
to our kids. Right?

1114
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:17,083
Tell me. Who is he?

1115
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:19,542
He claims that our daughter
is his granddaughter.

1116
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:21,833
I feel terrified when I look at him.

1117
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:25,333
I felt like dying.

1118
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:28,917
I was running for life.

1119
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:30,792
Chintu, come here.

1120
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:33,458
Don't call her! She's already terrified.

1121
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,083
Listen…

1122
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:53,375
I forced the Police Department,
I fought with the law,

1123
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:54,958
and went to great lengths

1124
01:27:55,042 --> 01:27:57,000
to bring you to my doorstep.

1125
01:27:57,292 --> 01:27:59,625
I asked you to protect my family.

1126
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:02,958
Do you possess
any integrity or job ethics?

1127
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:09,125
There's no use
talking about compassion or concern

1128
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,708
to those who work for money.

1129
01:28:10,792 --> 01:28:12,500
Instead of doing your duty like this

1130
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:16,083
by just eating and sleeping uselessly,
pick up your belongings and go away!

1131
01:28:16,167 --> 01:28:18,375
- Don't say that, sir.
- What?

1132
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,625
Don't act on impulse.

1133
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:22,792
Under the pretext of making excuses
don't provoke me to swear at you.

1134
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,375
- I went to recharge...
- Don't talk.

1135
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:25,625
Don't talk!

1136
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,250
Don't talk!

1137
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:29,958
I'm letting you go out of respect
for your age, or…

1138
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:31,583
You've misunderstood me.

1139
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:35,000
- Dear…
- Go. Just go.

1140
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:38,083
Dad.

1141
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,250
I'm sorry, Dad.

1142
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:43,125
- I didn't know that it was you…
- It's okay, Son.

1143
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,500
Good throw.

1144
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:47,542
- You knew it was me and threw it, right?
- No, Dad.

1145
01:28:56,792 --> 01:28:59,292
<i>When you realize
that the man sharing your bed</i>

1146
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:02,708
<i>is a ruthless killer with no mercy,</i>

1147
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:04,750
<i>come and meet me.</i>

1148
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:18,292
Was it a dream?

1149
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:21,458
I wish it was.

1150
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:39,833
<i>I think some major conflict occurred
between the family members.</i>

1151
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:45,458
<i>It seems this is also a reason for
their tobacco industry to get destroyed.</i>

1152
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:47,667
<i>I have sent the certificates
and photos to you.</i>

1153
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,125
Check if they are forged.

1154
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:50,375
- <i>I will check.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

1155
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,208
<i>It's a myth that stands still, Joshy.</i>

1156
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:55,625
<i>But I believe a man who knows
the full story is alive in Shimla prison.</i>

1157
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:58,417
<i>His name is Hridayaraj D'Souza
in the records.</i>

1158
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,250
<i>If the Intel is right,
he must be very close to Leo Das.</i>

1159
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:04,333
<i>So if you want to see him,
you have only two days.</i>

1160
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:06,667
<i>Practically, I don't know
when you can reach.</i>

1161
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,625
<i>- Can I try to connect him in a call?</i>
- No…

1162
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:10,792
I-I'm on my way,
make the arrangements, please.

1163
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:12,042
I'll reach by tonight.

1164
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:13,333
<i>- Sure, Joshy.</i>
- Thank you.

1165
01:30:13,417 --> 01:30:15,375
<i>Who is the villain here?</i>

1166
01:30:20,042 --> 01:30:22,375
It's late. Your mom isn't back yet.

1167
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:25,625
Recently, she has been
returning late everyday.

1168
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:28,583
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

1169
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:31,125
That's her.

1170
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:36,833
- Tell me.
- <i>Parthi, I'm not coming home tonight.</i>

1171
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:39,083
<i>Don't wait for me.
Have your dinner and sleep.</i>

1172
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:43,000
- Why? What happened?
- I've taken many days off, right?

1173
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:44,708
So there's a lot of pending work.

1174
01:30:44,792 --> 01:30:47,250
I thought I'll finish it
and come home in the morning.

1175
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:49,625
I yelled at Siddhu,
so he isn't picking my call.

1176
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:51,250
<i>Is he back home? Where is he?</i>

1177
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:53,667
Poor boy, I was quite harsh.
Check on him, Parthi.

1178
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,125
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your kind attention?</i>

1179
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,833
Okay, where are you now?

1180
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:01,792
- At the head office.
- Is that so?

1181
01:31:06,542 --> 01:31:08,417
- Chintu.
- Yes?

1182
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:12,583
You don't suspect your dad, right?

1183
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:14,542
- No.
- Why?

1184
01:31:14,792 --> 01:31:16,625
Because you are my dearest dad.

1185
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,542
Your dearest dad.

1186
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,333
Hey! It's your dad.

1187
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:32,875
Siddharth, get into the car!

1188
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:39,375
- I'm calling you, get into...
- Let go of my hand!

1189
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:45,542
Sir, leave him alone
if he doesn't want to come.

1190
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:46,667
Don't force him.

1191
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:49,083
What? Will you kill him too?

1192
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:58,167
Okay, don't come.

1193
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:10,208
<i>Who is the villain here?</i>

1194
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:12,500
<i>Who is the good one?</i>

1195
01:32:12,917 --> 01:32:14,917
<i>Who is the villain here?</i>

1196
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,917
<i>Who is the friend and godsend?</i>

1197
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,167
If I see any of you
following my family hereafter…

1198
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:24,083
<i>Who is the villain here?</i>

1199
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:29,333
Sir.

1200
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:31,750
Why are you sitting here
in the cold at this hour?

1201
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:33,208
No intruder will barge in now.

1202
01:32:33,292 --> 01:32:36,042
I don't care anymore who shoots
and who dies, go to sleep.

1203
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:37,625
It's okay. It's okay, sir.

1204
01:32:37,708 --> 01:32:40,958
A courier was delivered in the noon
in your wife's name.

1205
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:44,792
Sir, one moment.
I wanted to tell you something.

1206
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:47,958
I understand all your worries and fears.

1207
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:52,917
I see how well you take care
of the people who depend on you.

1208
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:55,583
You are anxious
that something might happen to them.

1209
01:32:55,667 --> 01:32:57,333
I'll retire in 60 days.

1210
01:32:57,542 --> 01:33:01,917
If anyone troubles your family
in any way during this time,

1211
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,292
I'll take him down with me!

1212
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:08,167
Even if there is any emergency
needing my attention back home

1213
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,083
I won't leave this place.

1214
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:14,667
I swear this Napoleon doesn't work
just to eat like a glutton, sir.

1215
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:18,458
I don't work just to fill my stomach.
Trust me.

1216
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:28,917
Did you really lift such a big gun
at the commissioner's office

1217
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,167
and shoot all of them?

1218
01:33:31,917 --> 01:33:34,667
I just read the manual and instructed
which button to press.

1219
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:36,000
Dilli took care of the rest.

1220
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:38,625
Don't tell anyone.
This is my means of livelihood.

1221
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:39,875
Okay.

1222
01:33:41,042 --> 01:33:42,708
- Chintu.
- Dad.

1223
01:33:42,792 --> 01:33:43,875
What is it, dear?

1224
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:53,625
Why don't you sit?

1225
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,542
- How is he doing?
- He is fine.

1226
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,667
It's been nearly three weeks
since he called me up.

1227
01:33:58,750 --> 01:33:59,958
All okay, right?

1228
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:03,167
Why take the trouble
to visit me at this hour?

1229
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,542
Had you told me, I'd have couriered it.

1230
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:09,833
The government registration is pending
without proper certificates.

1231
01:34:10,042 --> 01:34:11,875
We came here on some other job.

1232
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,708
- So we decided to collect it.
- Oh.

1233
01:34:13,792 --> 01:34:15,875
It's in the attic. Let me get it.

1234
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:20,625
Sir, this is Hridayaraj D'Souza.

1235
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:22,583
You have 20 minutes.

1236
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:25,458
I'll wait over there.
Finish your conversation soon.

1237
01:34:29,542 --> 01:34:32,167
You asked for this brand, right?

1238
01:34:35,833 --> 01:34:37,750
Hridayaraj D'Souza.

1239
01:34:38,458 --> 01:34:41,292
I'll come straight to the point
because of time constraint.

1240
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,500
Das & Co Tobacco Factory.

1241
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:46,917
The duo associated with it,
Antony and Harold.

1242
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,167
We have identity records on both of them,
but we have no details about Leo.

1243
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:54,125
You are the only one alive

1244
01:34:54,667 --> 01:34:58,000
among Leo's associates
who were present at the time of his death.

1245
01:34:58,167 --> 01:35:00,042
I have only one request for you.

1246
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:04,833
If you can tell me
whether this is Leo or not,

1247
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:06,458
four lives will be saved.

1248
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:12,625
I understand.
I can see the fear of death in your eyes.

1249
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:15,250
I heard you are due
for a death sentence in three days.

1250
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:18,917
If you can narrate what actually happened,
I can send a petition now

1251
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,375
and appeal for a review
of your death sentence.

1252
01:35:24,417 --> 01:35:27,458
If you could tell me
the actual sequence of events…

1253
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:38,000
Hridayaraj, don't test my patience.

1254
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:48,583
If you're here for a fair and just cause,

1255
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
why this back door entry
and sitting near the toilet?

1256
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:55,833
I've said what I had to, in the court.

1257
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:59,375
No one can stop my death sentence.

1258
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:00,583
What else?

1259
01:36:00,667 --> 01:36:02,667
What happened at Das & Co Tobacco Factory?

1260
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:05,542
Is Leo alive or dead? Or how did Leo die?

1261
01:36:05,667 --> 01:36:08,583
I'm not saying this for you
or your damn bribe of a booze.

1262
01:36:08,667 --> 01:36:10,708
Anyway I'll die in three days.

1263
01:36:10,792 --> 01:36:14,708
After that, I can't talk about him.
That's why I'll tell you now.

1264
01:36:17,792 --> 01:36:21,208
In the year 1999, Das & Co
was the most flourishing tobacco factory

1265
01:36:21,292 --> 01:36:23,833
in Andhra Pradesh.

1266
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:27,042
The one who built
and ruled that empire was Antony.

1267
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:29,042
Antony Das.

1268
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:35,833
<i>Das & Co Tobacco Factory was just a front</i>

1269
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:39,583
<i>to conduct many illegal businesses.</i>

1270
01:36:39,667 --> 01:36:41,333
<i>He developed the business</i>

1271
01:36:41,417 --> 01:36:45,292
<i>to local, national
and international levels.</i>

1272
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:50,167
<i>Antony was never the kind to forget
or forgive those who opposed him.</i>

1273
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,750
<i>He would kill them mercilessly.</i>

1274
01:36:52,833 --> 01:36:56,542
<i>Gradually that became
a habit in their family.</i>

1275
01:36:59,792 --> 01:37:04,542
<i>Before starting any business,
he'd always sacrifice an animal.</i>

1276
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:07,958
<i>He believed the growth of his empire</i>

1277
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:10,167
<i>was only due to this sacrificial ritual.</i>

1278
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,458
<i>It started with goats and cows</i>

1279
01:37:12,542 --> 01:37:16,458
<i>and he went to the extent
of performing human sacrifices too.</i>

1280
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:22,708
He was very superstitious.

1281
01:37:24,292 --> 01:37:27,083
Harold Das was his younger brother.

1282
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:32,083
<i>Harold was the only man
whom Antony trusted.</i>

1283
01:37:32,208 --> 01:37:33,208
<i>Harold.</i>

1284
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,458
<i>Harold!</i>

1285
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,958
<i>He went to Canada to study</i>

1286
01:37:40,042 --> 01:37:43,667
<i>but got acquainted with
international drug cartels over there.</i>

1287
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:46,333
<i>He expanded their business
on foreign soil.</i>

1288
01:37:46,417 --> 01:37:50,042
<i>His dream was to make Das & Co
the number one drug cartel in the world.</i>

1289
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:53,333
<i>So he created a drug called Datura.</i>

1290
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:59,083
<i>It was a drug unseen,
unheard of and untried in the market.</i>

1291
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:01,583
<i>They grew Datura
amidst their tobacco plants.</i>

1292
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:05,333
<i>They began to manufacture it
in their factory.</i>

1293
01:38:05,417 --> 01:38:08,167
<i>Datura was more lethal than cocaine.</i>

1294
01:38:08,292 --> 01:38:12,167
<i>Gradually its demand increased
in the market.</i>

1295
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:14,708
<i>At the same time, this news was leaked</i>

1296
01:38:14,792 --> 01:38:17,625
<i>to the Narcotics Control Bureau
by some of his men.</i>

1297
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:20,667
<i>He threw Datura on the faces
of those whom he suspected</i>

1298
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,625
<i>without even questioning them.</i>

1299
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:26,250
<i>He killed them in wild fury ruthlessly
and piled them in heaps remorselessly.</i>

1300
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:32,000
Even if Antony and Harold took care
of managing the business at the top level

1301
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:36,792
they still needed someone trustworthy
working at grass-root level, right?

1302
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:39,125
Antony's son…

1303
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:42,458
I raised him from the time
he was a toddler.

1304
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,417
Das. Leo Das.

1305
01:38:49,458 --> 01:38:52,708
All this hassle is because one of your men
leaked the information to NCB.

1306
01:38:52,792 --> 01:38:55,292
Have you faced this issue
before in all these years?

1307
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:57,917
Think about me. What you do
is not at all trivial.

1308
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,042
<i>I can't show a wrong count
for namesake.</i>

1309
01:39:00,125 --> 01:39:02,083
If you want me
to release the seized Datura,

1310
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:04,042
one among the three of you
must surrender.

1311
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:06,958
That's why I want Leo to surrender.
If he is jailed for a week

1312
01:39:07,042 --> 01:39:09,333
<i>I can silence the higher-ups
and release the stash.</i>

1313
01:39:09,417 --> 01:39:12,042
<i>If it gets out of hand,
I can't help you, remember that.</i>

1314
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:15,042
How do we trust
that you'll release him in a week?

1315
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:17,917
<i>If you want your stash,
you've to trust me, Das.</i>

1316
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,208
- Antony?
- Is Leo there?

1317
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:24,333
Leo isn't here.

1318
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,958
<i>He said he'd cross the border
with the drugs.</i>

1319
01:39:27,042 --> 01:39:30,417
<i>He must be at the check-post.
I think he's outwitting them.</i>

1320
01:39:30,583 --> 01:39:32,875
Hey, who is smoking over there?

1321
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,500
Give him a tight slap!

1322
01:39:35,958 --> 01:39:37,042
Tell me, sir.

1323
01:39:37,542 --> 01:39:38,917
Yes, sir. I'm at the spot.

1324
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:44,542
<i>Rest in peace!</i>

1325
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:19,042
- Gabby! Start the vehicle!
- Hey! Go!

1326
01:40:19,958 --> 01:40:21,167
Load it! Hurry up.

1327
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:24,708
<i>L-E-O Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass</i>

1328
01:40:25,542 --> 01:40:29,083
<i>L-E-O Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass</i>

1329
01:40:29,792 --> 01:40:33,375
<i>L-E-O Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass</i>

1330
01:40:38,167 --> 01:40:39,458
<i>Rest in peace!</i>

1331
01:40:39,542 --> 01:40:42,125
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass</i>

1332
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:46,667
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass</i>

1333
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,708
Go fast! Go…

1334
01:40:55,792 --> 01:40:59,000
<i>L-E-O Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass</i>

1335
01:40:59,083 --> 01:41:03,208
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass</i>

1336
01:41:03,292 --> 01:41:07,125
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass</i>

1337
01:41:07,208 --> 01:41:09,333
Hey! I worked for you risking my job.

1338
01:41:09,708 --> 01:41:12,125
But you're outwitting me
and getting me in trouble.

1339
01:41:12,208 --> 01:41:14,542
I'll see how you take the stash out
without my help.

1340
01:41:14,625 --> 01:41:17,333
<i>Leo!</i>

1341
01:41:20,458 --> 01:41:21,542
Hey! Don't!

1342
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:26,708
<i>Leo!</i>

1343
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:31,708
<i>Rest in peace!</i>

1344
01:41:32,083 --> 01:41:34,500
<i>Leo found out</i>

1345
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:38,583
<i>who gave information to the NCB
from within our camp.</i>

1346
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:45,375
- Gabby!
- Tell me.

1347
01:41:45,458 --> 01:41:48,583
I don't care what bloody issue it was.
Why halt and discuss en-route?

1348
01:41:48,667 --> 01:41:52,667
You're gathering allies and mediating
with so many tons of drugs at stake!

1349
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,750
Who is mediating? Go ask Daniel.

1350
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,958
Whenever I instructed him,
he said, "Call Leo.

1351
01:41:57,042 --> 01:42:00,250
This load won't move an inch
till he comes here and settles my share."

1352
01:42:00,333 --> 01:42:01,833
That smart-ass threatened me.

1353
01:42:01,917 --> 01:42:04,042
You say he is smart and your friend.

1354
01:42:04,125 --> 01:42:05,250
Where is he?

1355
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,167
What is your problem?

1356
01:42:12,375 --> 01:42:15,000
What issue do you have to work with him?

1357
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:16,417
He is my problem!

1358
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:24,833
He has taken my place.

1359
01:42:24,917 --> 01:42:26,917
I can't work under this mongrel.

1360
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,583
If he does it again,
I will hold back the drugs.

1361
01:42:29,667 --> 01:42:31,542
I'll show you I'm important too.

1362
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,125
What do you want me to do?

1363
01:42:35,208 --> 01:42:37,083
I don't want him butting in, that's all.

1364
01:42:37,167 --> 01:42:39,458
If he does, we can't dispose the drugs.

1365
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:52,583
He asked for it.

1366
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,583
Right?

1367
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:18,125
I care two hoots for friendship
or whatever crap other than this stash.

1368
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:19,667
I'll do as you say.

1369
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:23,250
Hey!

1370
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:24,958
Hey!

1371
01:43:25,667 --> 01:43:27,250
- Remove the damn knife.
- Hey!

1372
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:29,292
I know who you are going shoot next.

1373
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:31,208
Put the gun down and step back.

1374
01:43:41,917 --> 01:43:43,542
Have you watched the movie, <i>Jeans?</i>

1375
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:45,875
Hero Prashanth plays dual role, right?

1376
01:43:45,958 --> 01:43:47,333
A small change.

1377
01:43:47,542 --> 01:43:51,083
Both are men in that movie.
Here, it's a man and a woman.

1378
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,708
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass</i>

1379
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:58,792
<i>Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass</i>

1380
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:00,583
<i>Rest in peace</i>

1381
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:02,542
Leo.

1382
01:44:02,708 --> 01:44:06,708
It isn't easy to cross all the check-posts
with 2,000 kilos of Datura overnight.

1383
01:44:06,792 --> 01:44:09,083
They are killing our men like mongrels.

1384
01:44:09,167 --> 01:44:12,583
It's too risky to transfer it overnight.
Tell me what to do.

1385
01:44:12,667 --> 01:44:14,875
<i>Even though it was
an almost impossible task</i>

1386
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:17,875
<i>Leo dismissed the risk
of transfer overnight.</i>

1387
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:21,042
<i>Leo took it as a challenge
to transfer 2,000 kilos of Datura</i>

1388
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:24,083
<i>by crossing two inter-state borders.</i>

1389
01:44:24,167 --> 01:44:26,333
Imagine! 2,000 kilos of Datura.

1390
01:44:26,417 --> 01:44:28,750
It was worth millions at that time.

1391
01:44:28,833 --> 01:44:31,708
He kept his word
and finished it without any hitch.

1392
01:44:31,792 --> 01:44:34,542
He took matters in his own hands

1393
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:36,750
for his dad's sake
without a second thought.

1394
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:40,625
Amidst all this, Antony's quest
for human sacrifices didn't stop.

1395
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:44,542
For two years, he was searching
for a unique horoscope.

1396
01:44:44,875 --> 01:44:47,625
He believed that if such a person
was found and sacrificed,

1397
01:44:47,708 --> 01:44:49,792
his tobacco factory

1398
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,208
and business would flourish again.

1399
01:44:55,917 --> 01:44:58,625
We were least bothered about this.

1400
01:44:58,708 --> 01:45:00,875
We were happy
that the drugs reached safely

1401
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:03,083
and celebrated.

1402
01:45:06,292 --> 01:45:08,333
Bro, come here.

1403
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,792
Bro! Come on!

1404
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:14,167
Please. For the sake of these boys.

1405
01:45:14,458 --> 01:45:17,167
Come on!

1406
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:24,875
<i>I'm ready. Shall I make an entry?</i>

1407
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:27,417
<i>I'm your dear bro. Shall I come now?</i>

1408
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:30,375
<i>Don't taunt this lion
With the sting of a scorpion</i>

1409
01:45:30,458 --> 01:45:33,125
<i>No matter who tries to obstruct my route
It won't change</i>

1410
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:35,625
<i>I'm ready. Shall I make an entry?</i>

1411
01:45:35,708 --> 01:45:38,292
<i>Your favorite bro, shall I come solo?</i>

1412
01:45:38,375 --> 01:45:43,125
<i>Let's beat the drum
to the rhythm of happiness</i>

1413
01:45:49,667 --> 01:45:54,083
<i>Pick the best goat and slaughter
So I can appease my hunger</i>

1414
01:46:22,417 --> 01:46:25,542
<i>If God is granting total bliss in one go,</i>

1415
01:46:25,625 --> 01:46:27,417
<i>caution is advisable.</i>

1416
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:31,167
<i>Because no one can predict
what will happen next.</i>

1417
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:35,750
I have good news and bad news for you.

1418
01:46:35,833 --> 01:46:38,625
Only these two horoscopes
will suit our purpose

1419
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:42,167
out of all the horoscopes
I searched for, till date.

1420
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,083
Please take a look and decide.

1421
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:48,833
<i>I'm ready to harvest
And weed out my opponent</i>

1422
01:46:48,917 --> 01:46:51,375
<i>It is our fate at stake
To get rid of this headache.</i>

1423
01:46:51,458 --> 01:46:53,750
<i>If he acts smart,
We will tie him in a sack</i>

1424
01:46:53,833 --> 01:46:56,583
<i>Dump him in a lorry
To get dissected in the factory!</i>

1425
01:46:56,667 --> 01:46:59,625
<i>Hey! We know all the blueprints
Our mission will be a success</i>

1426
01:46:59,708 --> 01:47:02,667
<i>If you interfere,
I will sacrifice you to our family deity</i>

1427
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,167
<i>Don't drink too much
and your threaten my friend</i>

1428
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:07,917
<i>As a team we work and think
Sharing a worldwide link</i>

1429
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,625
<i>Everywhere, it's our rules
Don't flick our tools</i>

1430
01:47:10,708 --> 01:47:13,208
<i>We move and groove in unity
Our sync is our identity</i>

1431
01:47:13,292 --> 01:47:16,125
<i>I am tired of winning
every match I wrestle</i>

1432
01:47:16,208 --> 01:47:19,000
<i>Just one drum beat quick
Sure-shot power kick</i>

1433
01:47:40,708 --> 01:47:43,292
I shouldn't have shown Elisa's
and Leo's horoscopes to you

1434
01:47:43,375 --> 01:47:44,667
but I had no option.

1435
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,792
I'm not sure
if we can find a similar horoscope

1436
01:47:47,958 --> 01:47:50,417
with the same star and date of birth, Das.

1437
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:05,333
Hey! Is there no other way?

1438
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:08,000
Can't you come up with any other option?

1439
01:48:23,167 --> 01:48:24,917
I feel really sad to say this.

1440
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:27,958
If you ask my opinion,

1441
01:48:29,625 --> 01:48:31,042
I'll choose Leo.

1442
01:48:33,542 --> 01:48:34,708
No.

1443
01:48:35,792 --> 01:48:38,125
The decision… the decision is all yours.

1444
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:41,917
<i>Marinated with spice and pepper
let's fry them in the pan</i>

1445
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,917
<i>Those limbs so amazing and super</i>

1446
01:48:44,042 --> 01:48:47,417
<i>Fist fight that strikes like lightning
Flashes into our kitchen and dining</i>

1447
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,208
<i>Inviting and awakening</i>

1448
01:48:49,292 --> 01:48:52,792
<i>Many a knife waiting to stab me</i>

1449
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:54,750
<i>That's their account to tally</i>

1450
01:48:54,875 --> 01:48:58,083
<i>He is like the tip of a knife
I don't want to be targeted</i>

1451
01:48:58,167 --> 01:49:00,583
<i>- Now stop talking.
- Oh! Okay.</i>

1452
01:49:10,875 --> 01:49:13,500
<i>I'm known by another name too</i>

1453
01:49:13,583 --> 01:49:16,333
<i>You'll tremble in fear
Upon hearing it, dude</i>

1454
01:49:16,417 --> 01:49:19,083
<i>Print out the poster
All-ready is your brother</i>

1455
01:49:19,208 --> 01:49:21,417
<i>Celebrate and how! Set it ablaze now</i>

1456
01:49:21,875 --> 01:49:23,208
<i>Here I am…</i>

1457
01:49:23,292 --> 01:49:24,833
<i>Hey! Make way for our bro!</i>

1458
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:33,958
<i>Here I am, your dear bro.</i>

1459
01:49:34,333 --> 01:49:36,750
<i>Don't taunt this lion</i>

1460
01:49:36,833 --> 01:49:39,583
<i>No matter who tries to obstruct my route
It won't change</i>

1461
01:49:39,667 --> 01:49:42,083
<i>I'm ready. Shall I make an entry?</i>

1462
01:49:42,167 --> 01:49:44,625
<i>Your favorite bro, shall I come solo?</i>

1463
01:49:44,708 --> 01:49:50,292
<i>Let's beat the drum
to the rhythm of happiness</i>

1464
01:49:55,792 --> 01:50:00,542
<i>I will bring you the best delicacies
Now celebrate to your heart's content</i>

1465
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:55,333
I had to do this, Leo.

1466
01:50:55,917 --> 01:50:58,083
Even now, between you and your sister

1467
01:50:59,167 --> 01:51:02,750
many chose you,
they opted to sacrifice you.

1468
01:51:02,833 --> 01:51:04,708
My brother also chose you.

1469
01:51:05,833 --> 01:51:08,875
I was the one who saved you!

1470
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:12,208
You need not thank me for that.

1471
01:51:14,583 --> 01:51:16,000
Just pardon me.

1472
01:51:17,625 --> 01:51:19,792
From my childhood till date,

1473
01:51:19,875 --> 01:51:22,917
I've killed countless people
for your sake.

1474
01:51:24,042 --> 01:51:27,417
I took your word as gospel
and killed my friend too.

1475
01:51:29,042 --> 01:51:31,167
That was for our business.

1476
01:51:32,625 --> 01:51:35,958
But this is mere superstition!

1477
01:51:36,125 --> 01:51:38,208
Let go of Elisa!

1478
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:40,125
Leo!

1479
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:42,583
This is also for our business.

1480
01:51:43,875 --> 01:51:46,500
- Understand that!
- Hey!

1481
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:51,792
She isn't just my sister.

1482
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:56,833
She is my twin.
A part of me, my other half!

1483
01:51:57,292 --> 01:51:59,625
If anything untoward happens to her,

1484
01:51:59,792 --> 01:52:01,958
no matter how many births you take

1485
01:52:02,292 --> 01:52:06,833
the day I see you will be your last day!

1486
01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:09,292
The day I meet you

1487
01:52:09,375 --> 01:52:12,667
will be your last day on Earth!

1488
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:14,583
Are you begging him?

1489
01:52:17,625 --> 01:52:19,958
Didn't I tell you the day
our mother passed away?

1490
01:52:20,042 --> 01:52:22,667
That he has something
to do with her death.

1491
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:25,708
If he has decided
to sacrifice his children,

1492
01:52:25,875 --> 01:52:27,792
I don't consider him my dad anymore,

1493
01:52:27,875 --> 01:52:30,083
none of them here are my kith and kin!

1494
01:52:31,208 --> 01:52:32,875
Will you do me a favor, Leo?

1495
01:52:34,583 --> 01:52:37,583
Don't spare any of them alive.

1496
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:00,708
Hey!

1497
01:53:01,917 --> 01:53:03,167
Hey!

1498
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:04,917
Don't you dare!

1499
01:53:05,167 --> 01:53:06,667
Let her go!

1500
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:08,375
Dad!

1501
01:53:08,625 --> 01:53:10,333
Dad!

1502
01:53:11,542 --> 01:53:12,875
Hey!

1503
01:53:12,958 --> 01:53:15,458
Release her! Let her go!

1504
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:35,500
Elisa, try to understand!

1505
01:53:35,667 --> 01:53:37,167
Understand my plight!

1506
01:53:41,792 --> 01:53:43,750
Leo!

1507
01:53:47,917 --> 01:53:49,417
Hey!

1508
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:54,292
Leo, burn down the entire factory.

1509
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:56,125
Harold, don't let them escape.

1510
01:53:57,875 --> 01:54:01,708
Harold! Don't let them escape!

1511
01:54:11,625 --> 01:54:12,708
Leo!

1512
01:54:17,292 --> 01:54:18,875
Come!

1513
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:25,125
- Come on.
- Come!

1514
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,333
- Come on.
- Catch…

1515
01:54:37,708 --> 01:54:39,792
Hey! Don't spare anyone.

1516
01:55:03,667 --> 01:55:06,542
Don't leave anything out!
Burn everything down!

1517
01:55:06,625 --> 01:55:07,792
Everything!

1518
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,417
Hey!

1519
01:55:46,667 --> 01:55:47,750
Hey!

1520
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:52,042
You wanted to sacrifice
your children for this, right?

1521
01:55:53,458 --> 01:55:54,458
Hey, Leo!

1522
01:55:54,542 --> 01:55:56,042
This shouldn't exist anymore!

1523
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,542
Hereafter this…

1524
01:55:58,042 --> 01:55:59,250
Hey!

1525
01:55:59,375 --> 01:56:00,833
…shouldn't exist!

1526
01:56:00,917 --> 01:56:02,583
Leo, stop it!

1527
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,917
Hey! Throw me a knife.

1528
01:56:13,542 --> 01:56:17,042
Elisa!

1529
01:56:30,042 --> 01:56:32,583
Elisa…

1530
01:56:34,458 --> 01:56:36,458
I won't survive, Leo.

1531
01:56:37,875 --> 01:56:39,750
Go somewhere far away.

1532
01:57:40,042 --> 01:57:41,375
Elisa!

1533
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:43,583
Elisa!

1534
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,042
Elisa!

1535
01:58:13,292 --> 01:58:14,750
I raised him.

1536
01:58:14,833 --> 01:58:18,125
He collapsed and died in front of my eyes.

1537
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:28,500
Tell me if it's Leo in this photo.

1538
01:58:30,125 --> 01:58:31,167
No.

1539
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:34,500
If you just identify him,
all the problems will be solved.

1540
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:41,000
Even if he stands amidst 1,000 people,

1541
01:58:41,083 --> 01:58:43,542
I can identify Leo from his eyes.

1542
01:58:43,917 --> 01:58:45,125
This isn't him.

1543
01:58:45,292 --> 01:58:48,167
Don't play unnecessarily
with an innocent man's life.

1544
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:50,833
Warden! Take me away.

1545
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:52,542
I feel sleepy.

1546
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:56,917
<i>If you say the truth
and do good, the world...</i>

1547
01:58:57,375 --> 01:58:58,667
It may spill.

1548
01:58:59,292 --> 01:59:01,708
These are the documents
and photos I have with me.

1549
01:59:01,833 --> 01:59:04,208
- These were taken at the orphanage.
- Show me.

1550
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:09,000
We clicked this during third grade.
This is in fourth grade.

1551
01:59:09,417 --> 01:59:11,000
And this is in fifth grade.

1552
01:59:11,458 --> 01:59:14,083
This is the letter he wrote to me
during his college days.

1553
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,958
IT'S A SCARY EXPERIENCE TO STEP OUT

1554
01:59:16,083 --> 01:59:17,625
OF OUR SHELTERED EXISTENCE

1555
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:22,292
May I ask you something?

1556
01:59:22,375 --> 01:59:24,667
I consider you my brother
and I'm asking you this.

1557
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:28,958
I know what's on your mind.
I won't tell him about your visit.

1558
01:59:29,042 --> 01:59:30,833
Make sure that he doesn't find out.

1559
01:59:30,917 --> 01:59:33,083
If he finds out, he'll be devastated.

1560
01:59:37,583 --> 01:59:39,792
- Hello?
<i>- Sir, is this Parthiban?</i>

1561
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,250
- Yes.
<i>- Sir, come to the coffee shop at once.</i>

1562
01:59:42,333 --> 01:59:43,375
<i>It's an emergency.</i>

1563
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:48,292
He was drinking with us, sir.

1564
01:59:48,708 --> 01:59:51,458
I don't know why he kept saying
that he saw his friend.

1565
01:59:51,542 --> 01:59:53,167
He was happily drinking.

1566
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,208
He even bought booze
for everyone, sir.

1567
01:59:55,292 --> 01:59:57,792
Then he left in an inebriated state.

1568
01:59:57,875 --> 02:00:00,375
He stood on the road
talking to someone over the phone.

1569
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,625
Then some men came in cars
and took him away.

1570
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:04,333
- Was it a black car?
- Yes, sir.

1571
02:00:11,833 --> 02:00:12,833
Hey!

1572
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:18,500
He claimed to be your friend
and came to your cafe.

1573
02:00:18,667 --> 02:00:21,458
He chatted with you.
He has even taken your photo.

1574
02:00:21,542 --> 02:00:24,583
How do you know him? Can't you hear me?

1575
02:00:27,417 --> 02:00:31,542
Sir! If he was a regular customer
at my cafe,

1576
02:00:31,625 --> 02:00:34,375
I should've at least been
slightly upset, right?

1577
02:00:35,667 --> 02:00:37,750
Look into my eyes. Are there tears?

1578
02:00:39,083 --> 02:00:40,875
I don't know him, sir.

1579
02:00:41,250 --> 02:00:44,667
How can I be responsible
for him dying in front of my cafe?

1580
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:48,750
I'll come to the station when you call me.
You can interrogate me there.

1581
02:00:48,833 --> 02:00:52,167
I've left my little girl alone at home.
I'm scared for her. I need to go.

1582
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:54,542
- Okay, go.
- Thank you, sir.

1583
02:01:24,417 --> 02:01:27,333
I don't know whether to feel sorry
or be suspicious of Parthiban.

1584
02:01:27,417 --> 02:01:28,583
Listen.

1585
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:33,125
Every human being
has a limit to lie and pretend.

1586
02:01:33,208 --> 02:01:35,167
He can do it only up to a breaking point.

1587
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:39,417
He can't continue to put on an act
beyond that point.

1588
02:01:40,125 --> 02:01:42,625
Because no one is mentally strong
to that extent.

1589
02:01:42,708 --> 02:01:45,917
I feel Parthiban isn't acting.

1590
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,583
He is Parthiban indeed.

1591
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:50,583
Beyond this, if truth has to be told,

1592
02:01:51,042 --> 02:01:54,542
Leo, who is allegedly dead
has to come in person and say it.

1593
02:01:55,958 --> 02:01:57,208
Parthi, are you back?

1594
02:01:57,292 --> 02:01:59,333
I heard you got a call
and left in a hurry.

1595
02:01:59,458 --> 02:02:00,458
Where were you?

1596
02:02:00,542 --> 02:02:03,292
The work was so hectic
at office in the past two days?

1597
02:02:03,417 --> 02:02:05,333
Why is your dinner untouched?

1598
02:02:05,417 --> 02:02:09,417
Parthi, what happened?
Why are you sitting here quietly?

1599
02:02:25,333 --> 02:02:29,333
Beyond this,
I have nothing left to lose, Sathya.

1600
02:02:30,667 --> 02:02:34,250
I'm a loser.

1601
02:02:37,958 --> 02:02:40,417
From my tip to toe,

1602
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:42,208
you are suspecting every part of me.

1603
02:02:42,292 --> 02:02:44,500
- It's not like that, please...
- Don't touch me!

1604
02:02:44,583 --> 02:02:46,000
Don't touch me.

1605
02:02:49,458 --> 02:02:52,458
This whole world can suspect me.

1606
02:02:52,542 --> 02:02:56,708
But how could you doubt me?
How did you see me as a stranger?

1607
02:02:56,792 --> 02:02:57,917
Sathya?

1608
02:03:03,917 --> 02:03:07,833
Oh, no! No matter what
explanation you give me,

1609
02:03:09,125 --> 02:03:12,125
the fact that you suspected me

1610
02:03:12,208 --> 02:03:14,750
will haunt me forever.

1611
02:03:15,250 --> 02:03:16,583
Is our bond so fragile?

1612
02:03:16,667 --> 02:03:19,833
The life that we led so far
has lost its meaning.

1613
02:03:19,917 --> 02:03:20,917
That's it, right?

1614
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:27,583
I am not him!

1615
02:03:27,917 --> 02:03:30,250
Parthiban isn't that kind of a person.

1616
02:03:30,333 --> 02:03:33,167
Despite repeating that
over and over again,

1617
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:36,458
just because some
random chap resembles me…

1618
02:03:39,292 --> 02:03:41,083
- What happened, Mom?
- Nothing, sweetie.

1619
02:03:41,167 --> 02:03:44,458
I wasn't feeling well. Go to sleep.

1620
02:03:44,625 --> 02:03:47,625
<i>Dance for me. Oh…</i>

1621
02:03:47,708 --> 02:03:51,292
<i>I've never seen anybody do the things
you do before</i>

1622
02:03:51,375 --> 02:03:55,542
<i>Move for me</i>

1623
02:03:55,625 --> 02:03:59,458
<i>And when you're done,
I'll make you do it...</i>

1624
02:04:01,208 --> 02:04:03,333
Hey, you.

1625
02:04:04,542 --> 02:04:06,417
Some random fellow…

1626
02:04:07,583 --> 02:04:11,292
If they torture me claiming
I resemble some random riff-raff,

1627
02:04:11,375 --> 02:04:13,083
what can I do?

1628
02:04:13,417 --> 02:04:16,333
You've forsaken your trust in me.

1629
02:04:16,417 --> 02:04:18,500
My son asked me if I'm a good dad.

1630
02:04:18,583 --> 02:04:22,167
You asked me if I'm a good husband!
Who am I? Tell me.

1631
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:26,667
That's correct.

1632
02:04:27,208 --> 02:04:30,792
I don't know who my parents are
or what my place of birth is.

1633
02:04:30,875 --> 02:04:32,333
I'm an orphan.

1634
02:04:32,833 --> 02:04:35,917
Maybe if they were alive,
they wouldn't have suspected me.

1635
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,167
I'm an orphan, after all.

1636
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:38,667
- Don't say that.
- Just an orphan.

1637
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:42,000
Parthi, you're not an orphan. Look at me.

1638
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:44,458
I'm telling you to look into my eyes.

1639
02:04:44,875 --> 02:04:47,750
I didn't do this
due to lack of trust in you.

1640
02:04:47,875 --> 02:04:51,833
When other people ask me,
I need to tell them with certainty, right?

1641
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:53,708
"He is not that man."

1642
02:04:53,833 --> 02:04:56,708
I should confidently assert
this is my husband, Parthiban.

1643
02:04:56,792 --> 02:04:58,875
Why can't you understand?

1644
02:05:01,083 --> 02:05:02,250
Sathya.

1645
02:05:02,583 --> 02:05:06,042
I need to ask just one question.

1646
02:05:06,292 --> 02:05:09,750
After you suspected
that I was someone else,

1647
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:13,250
how could you touch me?

1648
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:15,333
Didn't you feel disgusted?

1649
02:05:15,417 --> 02:05:17,583
Wasn't it like itching,

1650
02:05:17,708 --> 02:05:20,500
like a hairy caterpillar
crawling on your body..."

1651
02:05:27,333 --> 02:05:28,750
Trust me.

1652
02:05:30,542 --> 02:05:31,833
Sathya.

1653
02:05:35,125 --> 02:05:36,708
Please trust me.

1654
02:05:37,667 --> 02:05:41,083
Trust me, Sathya.
Trust your Parthiban.

1655
02:05:53,542 --> 02:05:56,583
<i>Leo, the time I gave you is over.</i>

1656
02:05:56,708 --> 02:05:59,708
<i>You didn't come. So I am here to see you.</i>

1657
02:05:59,792 --> 02:06:00,875
<i>Look outside.</i>

1658
02:06:05,333 --> 02:06:07,417
Hey! Who the hell are you all?

1659
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:09,292
What are you doing here?

1660
02:06:09,375 --> 02:06:11,000
You better leave!

1661
02:06:11,083 --> 02:06:12,708
I'll shoot you all down!

1662
02:06:12,792 --> 02:06:14,833
You won't leave this place alive!

1663
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,333
Don't you understand?

1664
02:06:18,417 --> 02:06:20,375
<i>This need not have gone so far.</i>

1665
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:25,042
If you had come of your own accord
and admitted to me that you are Leo

1666
02:06:25,292 --> 02:06:27,917
I wouldn't have come here now.

1667
02:06:28,083 --> 02:06:30,375
Sir! Don't come down
for any reason whatsoever.

1668
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:31,792
I'll deal with them!

1669
02:06:32,167 --> 02:06:34,167
I came to meet you

1670
02:06:34,375 --> 02:06:37,417
but a mongrel is barking over here!

1671
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:40,583
Okay.

1672
02:06:40,792 --> 02:06:44,333
Amidst all this, give some thought
to where your son is.

1673
02:06:45,708 --> 02:06:46,875
Sathya?

1674
02:06:46,958 --> 02:06:48,083
Where is Siddharth?

1675
02:06:48,167 --> 02:06:49,917
- What happened?
- Where is Siddhu?

1676
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,292
- Check on Siddhu.
<i>- You won't be able to find him.</i>

1677
02:06:52,375 --> 02:06:54,750
<i>- He would've reached his destination.</i>
- He isn't here!

1678
02:06:54,833 --> 02:06:55,875
Siddharth!

1679
02:06:56,417 --> 02:06:58,542
Bring our daughter.

1680
02:06:58,875 --> 02:07:02,083
But your son is so damn cute.

1681
02:07:02,292 --> 02:07:05,667
<i>He came out to smoke, got trapped
and made it easy for us.</i>

1682
02:07:06,042 --> 02:07:07,542
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1683
02:07:07,958 --> 02:07:10,875
Parthiban, what is happening here?
Where is Siddhu?

1684
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,250
Whom are you talking to?

1685
02:07:13,333 --> 02:07:16,583
If anyone except me enters the house,
you must stab them.

1686
02:07:16,708 --> 02:07:17,708
Why?

1687
02:07:17,833 --> 02:07:19,500
You will do it. Hold it! Come on!

1688
02:07:20,917 --> 02:07:22,750
Go in.

1689
02:07:22,833 --> 02:07:24,833
Lock the door from inside, Sathya.

1690
02:07:25,583 --> 02:07:27,292
<i>You don't have to live as Leo.</i>

1691
02:07:27,375 --> 02:07:30,167
<i>But ask your conscience.</i>

1692
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:32,167
<i>Why should I kidnap your son?</i>

1693
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:36,708
Twenty-two years ago, your sister died

1694
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:39,458
on this very day.

1695
02:07:39,750 --> 02:07:42,333
<i>I'm taking your son today</i>

1696
02:07:42,833 --> 02:07:45,167
and you know the reason behind it.

1697
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,833
Don't you understand?
I don't have a sister or any damn sibling.

1698
02:07:49,958 --> 02:07:52,167
Let go of my son, rascal!

1699
02:07:55,083 --> 02:07:57,458
- Sir?
- You'll come on your own, Leo!

1700
02:07:57,792 --> 02:08:00,125
Go away! Didn't you hear what I said?

1701
02:08:00,375 --> 02:08:02,542
Sir, open the door!

1702
02:08:04,125 --> 02:08:06,167
Go!

1703
02:08:13,417 --> 02:08:16,417
- Sir, they have kidnapped Siddhu.
- I didn't know they took him.

1704
02:08:16,542 --> 02:08:17,583
Siddhu!

1705
02:08:18,167 --> 02:08:19,667
Hey!

1706
02:08:21,542 --> 02:08:23,875
Go!

1707
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:41,667
Load the gun.

1708
02:09:18,083 --> 02:09:19,583
Sir, hold tight!

1709
02:09:20,292 --> 02:09:21,542
Watch out!

1710
02:11:01,792 --> 02:11:03,875
Where is my son?

1711
02:11:03,958 --> 02:11:06,125
Answer me! Where is my son?

1712
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:24,875
Hey!

1713
02:11:31,833 --> 02:11:32,875
Siddhu?

1714
02:11:33,167 --> 02:11:34,208
Siddhu?

1715
02:11:35,875 --> 02:11:37,083
Siddhu!

1716
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,333
Where is my son?

1717
02:12:26,625 --> 02:12:28,542
I failed to kill you, Leo.

1718
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:32,125
But I won't fail to kill your son!

1719
02:12:45,083 --> 02:12:47,333
I'm not the man you're looking for!

1720
02:12:47,417 --> 02:12:50,417
Presuming that I'm your son
you ruined my life!

1721
02:12:53,375 --> 02:12:55,750
Where is my son? Come on, tell me.

1722
02:12:55,875 --> 02:12:59,000
Speak up! Where is my son? Tell me!

1723
02:13:00,875 --> 02:13:03,250
Accept that you're my son.

1724
02:13:05,375 --> 02:13:07,708
And I'll let your son go.

1725
02:13:07,792 --> 02:13:12,000
Oh, God! I'm not your son! No.

1726
02:13:12,083 --> 02:13:13,667
I'm not your son!

1727
02:13:59,333 --> 02:14:00,375
Tell me.

1728
02:14:00,458 --> 02:14:02,000
You're him, right?

1729
02:14:08,458 --> 02:14:12,833
Harold, Antony is no more.

1730
02:14:14,083 --> 02:14:15,958
I'm bringing the boy.

1731
02:14:17,708 --> 02:14:21,000
Napoleon needs bed-rest.

1732
02:14:21,417 --> 02:14:24,917
But I don't think they would stop at this.
They keep coming for you.

1733
02:14:25,042 --> 02:14:26,792
Your son will be safe for now.

1734
02:14:27,083 --> 02:14:29,375
We will send a task force and find him.

1735
02:14:30,167 --> 02:14:32,208
But you shouldn't stay here.

1736
02:14:32,292 --> 02:14:34,333
If you stay here,
your life will be in danger.

1737
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,292
Please listen to me.

1738
02:14:36,833 --> 02:14:39,833
I've arranged a car.
It's parked at your doorstep.

1739
02:14:39,917 --> 02:14:43,000
Collect your essentials and leave. Now!

1740
02:14:47,458 --> 02:14:48,500
Who is this?

1741
02:14:55,250 --> 02:14:58,167
Leo, no matter where you go and hide

1742
02:14:58,333 --> 02:15:00,750
you know very well
that I'll come and get you.

1743
02:15:00,833 --> 02:15:02,375
<i>All I want is your life.</i>

1744
02:15:02,458 --> 02:15:04,667
Don't send your family to doom.

1745
02:15:04,750 --> 02:15:06,667
If you want your son back

1746
02:15:07,667 --> 02:15:09,667
hand over my elder brother to me.

1747
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:13,417
Bring him here and take your son.

1748
02:15:24,583 --> 02:15:27,375
Parthiban, take it.
Go fast.

1749
02:15:50,667 --> 02:15:52,833
Das, I've sent boss' body.

1750
02:15:52,958 --> 02:15:56,500
We have boarded him on the train.
We will reach in an hour.

1751
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:58,042
Sir, as per your request,
I've given your brother's body.

1752
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:01,375
Please give my son back, I'll leave.

1753
02:17:03,958 --> 02:17:07,333
I know, you won't believe me
no matter what I say.

1754
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:09,917
- That's why I...
- Hey!

1755
02:17:13,208 --> 02:17:16,083
Don't be scared.
This is just my son's school bag.

1756
02:17:16,250 --> 02:17:18,958
Sir, these are my birth certificate
and mark sheets.

1757
02:17:19,083 --> 02:17:21,042
Ration card, Aadhaar card,
wedding photos.

1758
02:17:21,167 --> 02:17:22,833
My daughter's ear piercing ceremony.

1759
02:17:22,958 --> 02:17:24,167
My son's first birthday.

1760
02:17:24,375 --> 02:17:25,542
Have a look.

1761
02:17:25,708 --> 02:17:27,583
When I was in 10th grade,
I got first prize

1762
02:17:27,667 --> 02:17:29,583
for my speech
about <i>Kappalottiya Thamizhan</i>.

1763
02:17:29,667 --> 02:17:30,708
This was taken then.

1764
02:17:30,792 --> 02:17:32,917
You can see my name.

1765
02:17:40,875 --> 02:17:44,792
Look here. This is you and your sister
on your 10th birthday.

1766
02:17:44,875 --> 02:17:47,958
A honey badger
had entered our tobacco field.

1767
02:17:48,042 --> 02:17:49,917
This photo was taken after it was killed.

1768
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,375
Look how smart you look
with that blood-stained face.

1769
02:17:52,458 --> 02:17:53,542
I understand, sir.

1770
02:17:54,667 --> 02:17:58,250
I can't blame you
for mistaking me for Leo, sir.

1771
02:17:58,333 --> 02:18:00,583
He bears a striking resemblance to me.

1772
02:18:03,333 --> 02:18:06,000
Hey! Do you think I am
a fool?

1773
02:18:07,625 --> 02:18:10,875
- Sir…
- Do I seem like an imbecile?

1774
02:18:12,708 --> 02:18:14,208
Leo.

1775
02:18:14,458 --> 02:18:17,750
You know what I did to your twin sister.

1776
02:18:17,917 --> 02:18:19,958
I hope you haven't forgotten that.

1777
02:18:20,583 --> 02:18:23,000
You better accept that you are Leo.

1778
02:18:25,917 --> 02:18:29,583
Sir, I don't have a sister.
How do I make you understand?

1779
02:18:29,667 --> 02:18:30,792
Siddhu?

1780
02:18:35,292 --> 02:18:36,542
Tell me.

1781
02:18:39,250 --> 02:18:40,542
Sir.

1782
02:18:43,292 --> 02:18:45,958
In all these years,
he is scrutinizing someone

1783
02:18:46,250 --> 02:18:48,042
for the first time.

1784
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:52,083
Human beings can lie.
Certificates can be fake.

1785
02:18:52,708 --> 02:18:55,125
But he can never lie.

1786
02:18:55,208 --> 02:18:59,125
I've never seen an eagle
at such close quarters in my life, sir.

1787
02:18:59,542 --> 02:19:01,708
Ask it to step back. I'm scared, sir.

1788
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:09,792
Hey.

1789
02:19:09,875 --> 02:19:13,083
This performance
is just to protect your family, right?

1790
02:19:13,167 --> 02:19:15,292
You committed a blunder even there.

1791
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:17,958
You came here to save your son

1792
02:19:18,042 --> 02:19:20,167
but left your wife and your daughter

1793
02:19:20,375 --> 02:19:22,583
all alone at home, my dear boy.

1794
02:19:23,333 --> 02:19:24,625
Shall I ask my men

1795
02:19:24,917 --> 02:19:29,542
to slit their throats?

1796
02:19:30,167 --> 02:19:31,417
Hey!

1797
02:19:32,458 --> 02:19:33,917
Okay, sir.

1798
02:19:43,792 --> 02:19:45,625
Sir, don't harm them.

1799
02:19:45,708 --> 02:19:47,208
Sir, please.

1800
02:19:59,583 --> 02:20:00,875
Hey!

1801
02:20:01,042 --> 02:20:04,125
Instruct your guys not to harm them, sir.
Poor souls, sir.

1802
02:20:08,625 --> 02:20:10,167
I will kill them!

1803
02:20:24,292 --> 02:20:26,708
What's this?
They have planted bombs here!

1804
02:20:27,917 --> 02:20:30,250
- What is it, Mom?
- Nothing, dear. Go back to sleep.

1805
02:20:30,333 --> 02:20:33,000
Sir, tell them not to go in.

1806
02:20:33,083 --> 02:20:35,000
- Hey, what happened...
- Sir.

1807
02:20:52,417 --> 02:20:53,958
Come with me.

1808
02:20:56,292 --> 02:20:58,125
Hey! You climb up.

1809
02:21:00,625 --> 02:21:01,708
Hey!

1810
02:21:01,917 --> 02:21:03,042
- Sir…
- Hey!

1811
02:21:03,125 --> 02:21:05,333
Sir, don't hurt them.

1812
02:21:05,417 --> 02:21:07,250
Tell them not to go inside.
Please, sir.

1813
02:21:07,333 --> 02:21:10,167
Instruct them not to enter
my house. Please, sir.

1814
02:21:11,417 --> 02:21:13,583
Come here. He is here.

1815
02:21:31,417 --> 02:21:33,583
- Who are you.
- I am scared.

1816
02:21:33,708 --> 02:21:34,750
Climb, I say!

1817
02:21:46,208 --> 02:21:47,458
My side is all clear.

1818
02:21:47,542 --> 02:21:50,292
Check those who are entering
through the main door.

1819
02:22:20,625 --> 02:22:22,750
Hey! Stupid guy, come!

1820
02:22:23,875 --> 02:22:25,000
Now it's your turn!

1821
02:23:07,208 --> 02:23:08,333
Sir.

1822
02:23:08,417 --> 02:23:11,917
I killed all those who barged in
except for one guy.

1823
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,042
He climbed in from the side
and went upstairs.

1824
02:23:14,125 --> 02:23:15,750
<i>Yeah. Okay. I will take care of him.</i>

1825
02:23:15,833 --> 02:23:17,042
<i>Do something, sir.</i>

1826
02:23:24,083 --> 02:23:25,250
Hey!

1827
02:23:29,917 --> 02:23:31,042
Hey!

1828
02:23:31,333 --> 02:23:34,875
Are you playing the fool with me?
I'll chop you into pieces!

1829
02:23:37,417 --> 02:23:39,458
- Sir, please…
- Hey!

1830
02:23:39,542 --> 02:23:41,750
- Sir.
- Why are you hanging up on me?

1831
02:23:41,833 --> 02:23:43,500
- Sir.
- What is going on there?

1832
02:23:43,583 --> 02:23:46,625
He's no ordinary fellow, sir.
He has set traps all around the house.

1833
02:23:46,708 --> 02:23:48,208
<i>All our men are dead.</i>

1834
02:23:48,833 --> 02:23:50,667
<i>I know him like the back of my hand.</i>

1835
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:52,042
<i>I confirm, he is Leo.</i>

1836
02:23:52,125 --> 02:23:53,500
Who is in front of you?

1837
02:23:53,583 --> 02:23:56,458
His wife and daughter.
Shall I slit their throats?

1838
02:23:56,542 --> 02:23:58,750
No need. Put the phone on speaker.

1839
02:23:59,042 --> 02:24:00,625
<i>Give the phone to his wife.</i>

1840
02:24:03,792 --> 02:24:04,958
You better obey me.

1841
02:24:05,042 --> 02:24:06,708
- Admit that you are Leo.
- Sir.

1842
02:24:06,792 --> 02:24:08,708
<i>I'll let all of you go.</i>

1843
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:10,792
Parthi!

1844
02:24:14,042 --> 02:24:15,833
Sathya, don't panic.

1845
02:24:19,208 --> 02:24:20,417
Admit it.

1846
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,667
Subramani.

1847
02:24:52,083 --> 02:24:53,250
Hey!

1848
02:24:53,333 --> 02:24:55,333
I'm talking seriously
and you're laughing!

1849
02:24:55,417 --> 02:24:56,583
Me?

1850
02:24:57,042 --> 02:24:58,792
I think it's a dog.

1851
02:25:01,667 --> 02:25:02,792
Go away!

1852
02:25:20,875 --> 02:25:24,042
I told you to instruct your men
to not go in, sir.

1853
02:25:24,125 --> 02:25:25,667
Poor fellows. Right, sir?

1854
02:25:55,125 --> 02:25:57,500
Now the Leo we know will emerge.

1855
02:26:28,292 --> 02:26:31,708
Chittu, make him admit that he's Leo.

1856
02:28:08,167 --> 02:28:09,583
Hey!

1857
02:28:42,667 --> 02:28:44,500
Leave me!

1858
02:29:10,875 --> 02:29:12,500
Hey! Stay with his son.

1859
02:29:34,333 --> 02:29:35,875
Come on.

1860
02:31:15,375 --> 02:31:16,458
Hey!

1861
02:31:16,708 --> 02:31:19,167
I used this to kill your sister…

1862
02:32:01,917 --> 02:32:03,625
Now I realise

1863
02:32:04,625 --> 02:32:06,167
you are not Leo.

1864
02:32:06,458 --> 02:32:08,000
You are Parthiban.

1865
02:32:08,917 --> 02:32:10,542
Now I believe you.

1866
02:32:10,833 --> 02:32:12,625
You are not the one

1867
02:32:14,958 --> 02:32:16,417
whom I was looking for.

1868
02:32:16,833 --> 02:32:18,167
Let's call it quits.

1869
02:32:18,542 --> 02:32:19,625
What do you say?

1870
02:32:20,833 --> 02:32:22,042
Drop your gun.

1871
02:32:22,833 --> 02:32:24,208
Hey!

1872
02:32:24,750 --> 02:32:26,417
Lower your gun.

1873
02:32:26,667 --> 02:32:27,875
Lower it.

1874
02:32:28,292 --> 02:32:30,833
Come on! Shoot, you scoundrel!

1875
02:32:30,958 --> 02:32:32,042
Shoot!

1876
02:32:55,875 --> 02:32:58,792
<i>Leo…</i>

1877
02:32:58,917 --> 02:33:01,083
<i>Leo!</i>

1878
02:33:02,250 --> 02:33:05,583
<i>Leo!</i>

1879
02:33:09,792 --> 02:33:14,250
- If I'm sweet, you're bloody sweet, Uncle.
- Hey!

1880
02:33:16,750 --> 02:33:19,625
I should've killed you
on that fateful day, right?

1881
02:33:20,667 --> 02:33:21,875
The mistake was mine.

1882
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:29,792
<i>Leo…</i>

1883
02:33:30,417 --> 02:33:32,292
Was this necessary for you?

1884
02:33:32,375 --> 02:33:35,125
"I want to see Leo. I want to find Leo."

1885
02:33:36,417 --> 02:33:37,917
Didn't you ask for it?

1886
02:33:38,583 --> 02:33:39,708
See me now.

1887
02:33:39,792 --> 02:33:44,875
<i>Leo…</i>

1888
02:33:46,792 --> 02:33:49,125
Come on, Leo. Come.

1889
02:33:54,917 --> 02:33:57,625
Drop your gun, Leo.

1890
02:34:09,500 --> 02:34:11,875
Check if there are any vehicles outside.

1891
02:34:16,875 --> 02:34:20,458
<i>If a person says about his past frequently</i>

1892
02:34:20,542 --> 02:34:22,458
<i>he must have done something good.</i>

1893
02:34:22,542 --> 02:34:24,583
<i>I have done no good deed.</i>

1894
02:34:25,083 --> 02:34:29,125
<i>In my past, knowingly or unknowingly,
I have committed many crimes.</i>

1895
02:34:29,583 --> 02:34:33,292
<i>My family is the last chance
I got to reform myself.</i>

1896
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,750
<i>I will go to any extent
to protect this family.</i>

1897
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:42,333
<i>The man called Leo is dead.</i>

1898
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:46,500
<i>If I have to convince others
that he is dead</i>

1899
02:34:46,917 --> 02:34:49,958
<i>first I have to believe it myself.</i>

1900
02:34:50,417 --> 02:34:53,750
<i>Leo is dead. I believe it.</i>

1901
02:35:03,542 --> 02:35:05,208
How are you?

1902
02:35:08,542 --> 02:35:13,583
<i>But despite all this, if someone
finds out about my past,</i>

1903
02:35:13,792 --> 02:35:16,875
<i>he must be ready to die soon.</i>

1904
02:35:17,667 --> 02:35:21,458
<i>Or he must be dead already.</i>

1905
02:35:32,625 --> 02:35:34,750
Of course I'm Leo.

1906
02:35:35,458 --> 02:35:37,792
Leo Das!

1907
02:35:38,417 --> 02:35:40,708
<i>My life is in this town</i>

1908
02:35:40,792 --> 02:35:43,208
<i>And I ain't going down</i>

1909
02:35:43,292 --> 02:35:47,917
<i>You think that I'm crazy
But I don't want the crown</i>

1910
02:35:48,083 --> 02:35:50,458
<i>My life is in this town</i>

1911
02:35:50,542 --> 02:35:52,917
<i>And I ain't going down</i>

1912
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:57,417
<i>You think that I'm crazy
But I don't want the crown</i>

1913
02:35:57,500 --> 02:36:00,750
<i>Just an ordinary person</i>

1914
02:36:00,833 --> 02:36:01,917
<i>Yeah</i>

1915
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,042
<i>I'm just a peace-loving soul</i>

1916
02:36:06,125 --> 02:36:11,667
<i>I'm just an ordinary person, yeah!</i>

1917
02:36:11,750 --> 02:36:14,875
<i>I'm just a peace-loving soul</i>

1918
02:36:15,708 --> 02:36:16,792
<i>Peace-loving soul</i>

1919
02:36:16,875 --> 02:36:19,917
<i>My life is in this town</i>

1920
02:36:52,875 --> 02:36:55,958
I came here and said that I'm not Leo.

1921
02:36:56,208 --> 02:36:58,667
No one believed me. They hit me.

1922
02:36:58,917 --> 02:37:03,208
Finally they accepted that I'm not Leo.
Other than this, nothing happened.

1923
02:37:03,292 --> 02:37:05,333
Promise me that
you won't tell your mom.

1924
02:37:05,417 --> 02:37:08,542
You promise me
you won't tell mom that I smoked.

1925
02:37:08,625 --> 02:37:12,125
<i>I'm just an ordinary person!</i>

1926
02:37:12,333 --> 02:37:13,500
<i>Yeah</i>

1927
02:37:13,583 --> 02:37:16,542
<i>I'm just a peace-loving soul</i>

1928
02:37:18,125 --> 02:37:21,500
<i>I'm just an ordinary person!</i>

1929
02:37:22,125 --> 02:37:25,958
<i>Yeah! I'm just a peace-loving soul</i>

1930
02:37:26,750 --> 02:37:28,458
<i>Peace-loving soul</i>

1931
02:37:29,583 --> 02:37:33,042
- Who scratched your face, Dad?
- Chintu, keep quiet.

1932
02:37:33,417 --> 02:37:35,250
Siddhu, switch on the TV.

1933
02:37:44,333 --> 02:37:48,458
<i>I'm a wicked man, so ruthless</i>

1934
02:37:50,417 --> 02:37:54,042
<i>I never lie, I confess</i>

1935
02:37:56,125 --> 02:37:59,458
<i>I'm a wicked man</i>

1936
02:38:00,458 --> 02:38:02,833
I think the main door isn't locked.

1937
02:38:03,375 --> 02:38:05,250
I'll go and lock it.

1938
02:38:05,375 --> 02:38:09,333
<i>I never harbor any grudge in my heart</i>

1939
02:38:25,542 --> 02:38:26,750
<i>Hello?</i>

1940
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:30,250
<i>Just because you destroyed
a single Datura factory</i>

1941
02:38:30,375 --> 02:38:33,792
<i>do you think all the problems
got solved, Parthiban?</i>

1942
02:38:34,083 --> 02:38:36,083
<i>Oh! I'm sorry.</i>

1943
02:38:36,292 --> 02:38:37,708
<i>Leo.</i>

1944
02:38:40,417 --> 02:38:44,583
<i>If you want to make
this society drug-free,</i>

1945
02:38:44,667 --> 02:38:48,500
<i>there are a lot more left throughout India
to be burnt down, Leo.</i>

1946
02:38:49,333 --> 02:38:51,542
<i>Do you recognize my voice?</i>

1947
02:38:53,458 --> 02:38:55,917
<i>He is a badass, deadly!</i>

1948
02:38:56,375 --> 02:39:01,375
