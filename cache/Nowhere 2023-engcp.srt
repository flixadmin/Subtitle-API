1
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:17,458
<i>It has been seven months since Spain
began implementing European measures</i>

2
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:19,917
<i>of dealing with
the scarcity of basic resources.</i>

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,625
<i>The "Not Enough for All" plan
has begun to take effect,</i>

4
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,708
<i>but for now, Spain,
as well as its neighbors,</i>

5
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:29,208
<i>will be unable to sustain
dependent citizens</i>

6
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>without balancing out the resources.</i>

7
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:32,667
<i>We...</i>

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,042
- This way.
- See you at the trucks. Careful, okay?

9
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,083
- You! This way.
- Come on, quickly. Quiet!

10
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:47,000
- Come on. Move it. Go!
- Go. Run.

11
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,167
- Move it!
- Let's go, sweetheart.

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,250
Come on.

13
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:56,667
- Come on, hurry.
- What?

14
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:58,167
Move it!

15
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,833
Move!

16
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,750
This way, come on. Quick.

17
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,708
Let's go.

18
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:14,167
- This way.
- Come on.

19
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,125
This way.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Come on!

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,958
Mia, come on. No time to hang around.

22
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,375
Come on.

23
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:27,708
- You okay?
- No.

24
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,208
Move, dammit!

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,292
Go that way. You first.

26
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,500
- Come on.
- Okay.

27
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:38,625
Don't worry.

28
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,958
- Nico!
- Here. I'm here.

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,917
- I won't fit.
- Yes, you will. You will.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,292
- Push me.
- Come on.

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,375
- Are you okay?
- What?

32
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,125
- Are you okay?
- Hide!

33
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:09,708
Follow me.

34
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,208
Come on.

35
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,208
Come on.

36
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:18,583
Come on, sweetheart.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Stay still.

38
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:24,792
Come on.

39
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,208
This way. Let's go.

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,875
<i>Attention! This is the police…</i>

41
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,875
<i>- Stop right there. You're under arrest…</i>
- Come on.

42
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,750
Let's go.

43
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,083
Wait here.

44
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,458
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

45
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,375
You, here.

46
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,250
Don't worry.

47
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:52,917
What's wrong?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,625
The conditions have changed.
More risk, more money.

49
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,750
No. We don't have any more money.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,208
That's not how it works.

51
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,583
Sweetheart, give me your ring.

52
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,667
- No.
- Yes.

53
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,625
- No.
- Listen to me.

54
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,833
Not the ring. We've given them everything.

55
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,167
- We need to leave the country now.
- Here.

56
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:14,917
Come on.

57
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,333
Come on. We don't have all night.

58
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,208
Follow me.

59
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:20,542
Enjoy your trip.

60
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,750
We're almost there.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,708
There it is. Our cruise ship.

62
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,250
Move, dammit!

63
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Come on.

64
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,792
- Are you okay?
- No.

65
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:00,125
<i>We supported the fight against shortages.</i>

66
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,833
<i>We supported sacrifices
for the common good.</i>

67
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:07,500
<i>We accepted it when they told us
the measures would be temporary.</i>

68
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,833
<i>Now what? Look where they've driven us.</i>

69
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,000
<i>First, they got rid of the elderly
in order to fight the shortages.</i>

70
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,542
<i>Now, they're going after the children
and pregnant women. Don't you see?</i>

71
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,708
<i>Children and pregnant women! This regime…</i>

72
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:22,792
Nothing else on?

73
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,542
- Take it off.
- Okay.

74
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:36,625
Let's see. Wow…

75
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,375
- It's okay.
- Okay?

76
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,458
- Yeah.
- Here.

77
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,542
Your baby had better shut up.

78
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,542
Where did you get this?

79
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,458
Tell me.

80
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:09,833
It's a secret.

81
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,167
Don't eat it now.

82
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,875
We have to save it for when we get there.

83
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,542
- To celebrate, right?
- Yeah.

84
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,125
Do you think the regime will get there?

85
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,292
Ireland has always opposed it.

86
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,833
Whatever.
All governments are falling for it.

87
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,750
- You know something about the Irish?
- What?

88
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,667
You can't defeat them. They drink stout.

89
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,458
- Right.
- Ireland won't give in.

90
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,792
It's okay to be scared, you know?

91
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,708
It'll be fine. You'll see.

92
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,625
- You don't know that.
- The worst is over.

93
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,083
You don't know that either.

94
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,083
I know something for a fact.

95
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,125
What?

96
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,667
I love you more now than yesterday…

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,333
…but less than tomorrow.

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,292
What is it? Have we arrived?

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We're leaving.

100
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:37,458
No more games.

101
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,333
Do you think she's pregnant
and traveling alone?

102
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,875
If she's pregnant, she's not alone.

103
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,542
How's our little Noa doing?

104
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,208
You named her already?

105
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,292
Noa.

106
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,375
- What name would you like?
- I hope it's not a girl.

107
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:14,917
I mean it.

108
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:18,125
It's not a girl. It's a warrior.

109
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,417
She kicks, just like you do.

110
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,583
I can't feel her.

111
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:23,958
What?

112
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,542
It's been two days since I have…

113
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,250
felt her move.

114
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,708
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

115
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,458
What are you doing?

116
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,833
Haven't you noticed she always kicks here?

117
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,750
I think this is a foot.

118
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,167
How do you do it?

119
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,750
Do what?

120
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,958
I don't know, you seem fine, as if…

121
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,792
as if nothing's happened.

122
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,833
You know that's not true.

123
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,958
You know that, right?

124
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,125
You brought my ducky!

125
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,583
What's ducky saying?

126
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,000
- Nico.
- What?

127
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,250
What if she's alive,
and we're leaving her behind?

128
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:40,542
Alone…

129
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,458
She's gone.

130
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,875
They took her away.

131
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:47,875
She's dead.

132
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,083
Open the doors!

133
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,625
Hey!

134
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,708
Nico!

135
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,167
- Mia!
- Please!

136
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,708
Quickly!

137
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,208
- Get up here!
- Come on!

138
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,792
- Stop!
- Nico.

139
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,375
- Mia!
- Stop!

140
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,208
Relax. There are lots of people.

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,250
A truck's coming now.

142
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,417
Half of you, get out, okay?

143
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,042
Mia!

144
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,542
Mia!

145
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,167
- Nico!
- Mia!

146
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,708
Come on!

147
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:58,792
I want you out!

148
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,375
You. Are you deaf?

149
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,458
Come on, get down.

150
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,667
No.

151
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,375
- I was inside with my wife. Inside.
- Get out!

152
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,750
Nico!

153
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:08,833
Come on, out!

154
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,125
No!

155
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,667
No!

156
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,042
You! Go to that truck.

157
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,958
Nico…

158
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,375
No…

159
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,375
Let's go!

160
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,583
Nico.

161
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:40,917
Nico!

162
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,750
Nico!

163
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,833
Nico!

164
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,333
107. Green.

165
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,250
No! Wait!

166
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,333
<i>- Mia!</i>
- Are you okay?

167
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:57,333
<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

168
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,833
- Okay. Nico…
<i>- Yes?</i>

169
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,917
- How will we find each other?
<i>- Relax. I'm in the truck behind.</i>

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,708
I don't wanna be alone.
I really don't wanna be alone.

171
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:09,792
<i>No. Listen to me.
Don't trust anyone. Okay?</i>

172
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,583
<i>Keep your things safe. Your phone,
the food… Be careful, sweetheart.</i>

173
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,083
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

174
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,542
<i>Are you there? Mia! Please answer me.</i>

175
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,458
Listen, are you sure
they're taking us to the same place?

176
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,792
<i>Yes. As soon as they stop, I'll escape.</i>

177
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,000
<i>There's only one boat this week,
and it's ours.</i>

178
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,208
- Nico…
<i>- Yes?</i>

179
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,875
I want to be with you.

180
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,375
<i>Me too, sweetheart.
Everything will be okay. Don't worry.</i>

181
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,042
<i>It'll be okay. We'll talk later.
I'll call you later, okay?</i>

182
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,417
Don't hang up on me.

183
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,208
<i>Sweetheart… We have to save
all the battery we can.</i>

184
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:44,375
- Don't hang up on me.
<i>- We'll be together soon. You'll see.</i>

185
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,583
- Nico…
<i>- Yes?</i>

186
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,917
- <i>What is it, honey?</i>
- Don't be long.

187
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,625
<i>- I won't. I promise.</i>
- Okay.

188
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:27,792
Quiet!

189
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,875
Murderers!

190
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,208
Murderers!

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,500
GIVE US OUR CHILDREN BACK

192
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,625
No…

193
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,542
MURDERERS!
THIS IS NOT THE WAY

194
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,250
What?

195
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,500
- What is it?
- We have to go to the back.

196
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:10,792
Be quiet.

197
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,667
Hello there.

198
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,208
Hello.

199
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,417
- Get out of the truck. Bring your papers.
- Is that necessary? I'm late.

200
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,750
- What are you carrying?
- It's all in the papers.

201
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:41,958
Alright.

202
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:44,333
- Can you come to the back?
- Yeah.

203
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,167
- That's all you're carrying?
- Yeah.

204
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,083
You don't know what it is?

205
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,833
Not really. It's in the papers.

206
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:06,458
I know what's in there, but you don't.
You don't know what you're carrying.

207
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,667
I do a lot of runs…

208
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,208
Stop!

209
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,167
Is there a problem?

210
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:21,750
Here's another truck.

211
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,917
Keep going.

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Go ahead.

213
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,125
Get him to pull over.

214
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,750
Can I go?

215
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,208
Are you in a hurry?

216
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:41,208
If I'm late, I get penalized.

217
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,917
Yeah, but I have to look inside.

218
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:47,917
Is it necessary? I hardly have anything.

219
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,500
Don't worry. I'll write your boss a note.

220
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,667
Travis, stand over there.

221
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,917
Now!

222
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:38,042
Okay.

223
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,708
Come on out.

224
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,750
Don't be afraid. We're not gonna hurt you.

225
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,542
Don't you want out?

226
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,292
I know the measures against shortages
have been brutal

227
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,458
towards children and pregnant women.

228
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:06,625
I know it's hard to trust someone
on this side of the wall.

229
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,542
But who have you trusted until now?

230
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,333
The people who stuffed you in here,

231
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:17,708
condemned you to suffocation,
and took all the money you had left?

232
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:21,333
Those who promised you a better place?

233
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,458
That better place does not exist.

234
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,917
Come out, and you won't regret it.

235
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,208
Otherwise, I have orders to shoot.

236
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:34,833
Don't make me give that order, dammit.
I've done it too many times.

237
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:41,792
Oh well, I tried.

238
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,375
Give me your hand.

239
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:04,917
Hey!

240
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,250
Give me your hand!

241
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,333
Kill them all.

242
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:43,792
Doggy!

243
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,833
Clean up all this shit
and gather their things.

244
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:22,333
All done, boss.

245
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:23,417
Good.

246
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,625
Nico.

247
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,250
Nico, hide.

248
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,833
Hide. They killed them all.

249
00:20:57,292 --> 00:21:00,792
Hide. They killed them all. Hide.

250
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,625
<i>Hi, it's Nico.
I can't talk right now. Try me later.</i>

251
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Nico.

252
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,167
I'm at the port. Where are you?

253
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,833
Where are you? Why won't you pick up?

254
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,208
Pick up.

255
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,125
This way, run!

256
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,083
Watch out! It's coming loose.

257
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,000
Help!

258
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,250
Help!

259
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Tie it down!

260
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,292
Come with me.

261
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,042
Watch out! You're going to fall.

262
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,125
Please.

263
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,083
Hey!

264
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,042
Help!

265
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,208
I'm in here. Please!

266
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:36,292
Tie them down!

267
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,000
Help!

268
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:43,167
This way, come on! Run!

269
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,083
Please help!

270
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,208
It's coming loose.

271
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,125
Please!

272
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,458
Is anyone there?

273
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,917
I'm here! Please!

274
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Hello?

275
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,375
Help.

276
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:38,042

What?

00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,708
No…

279
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,042
No way.

280
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,167
Come on.

281
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,042
Come on!

282
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,583

Fuck…

287

Headphones?

288
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,375
No.

289
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,917
No.

00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:39,917
No…

291
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,042
What?

292
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:04,250
Hey!

293
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,208
Green 107.

294

I'm coming.

Nico!

307
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,708
Pick up the phone. I'm here!

00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,208
<i>Mia, sweetheart.</i>

339
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:14,292
- Nico?
<i>- Yes!</i>

340
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,375
<i>Finally!</i>

341
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,042
<i>- Thank goodness!</i>
- I didn't know if you were still alive.

342
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,250
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Are you okay?

343
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,500
<i>- I couldn't call. The battery died.</i>
- Okay.

344
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:25,917
<i>The driver screwed us.
He abandoned us outside the city.</i>

345
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,750
<i>- It'll take a while for me to catch up.</i>
- Listen to me.

346
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:32,208
<i>- What is it?</i>
- I'm trapped. I can't get out.

347
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:35,500
<i>- I'm coming to get you.</i>
- No, wait, Nico. Listen to me.

348
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,750
- I'm not…
<i>- What is it?</i>

349
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,042
- I'm not on the ship.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

350
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,500
I'm not on the ship.
My container fell off.

351
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,917
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Floating in the sea<i>.</i>

352
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,250
I'm floating. I don't know… I'm okay.

353
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,708
But I don't know how long before
the water rises and the container sinks.

354
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,750
<i>Motherfucker! Can you see outside?</i>

355
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,167
Yes, I can see outside,
and all I see is water.

356
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,333
<i>- Nothing else?</i>
- Nothing. I'm in the middle of the sea.

357
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:04,458
Say something, anything.

358
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:07,792
<i>Don't worry, my love.
I promise I'm coming for you.</i>

359
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,333
<i>- You have to hang in there, sweetheart.</i>
- Nico…

360
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:12,625
<i>- Hang in there.</i>
- I can't do it.

361
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:15,083
<i>- Do it for the baby.</i>
- I don't think I can.

362
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:17,417
<i>- Yes, you can.</i>
- I miss her so much, Nico.

363
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,375
<i>- No.</i>
- I messed up again.

364
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:24,083
<i>Not that. Not now. It wasn't your fault.</i>

365
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:27,292
<i>Do you hear me?
What happened to Uma wasn't your fault.</i>

366
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:28,667
Okay.

367
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,250
<i>You're the strongest person I've ever met.
Don't give up. Promise me?</i>

368
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,875
- Yes.
<i>- Mia…</i>

369
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,375
Yes?

370
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,750
<i>- I love you more than yesterday.</i>
- But less than you will tomorrow.

371
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:42,583
<i>I'll call as soon as I have a plan.
Keep the phone safe.</i>

372
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,583
- Okay, bye.
<i>- I'll find you.</i>

373
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:58,917
Dad's on his way.

374
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:00,417
Hold on.

375
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,750
Not now.

376
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:03,833
Hold on a little longer.

377
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:44,958
What…

378
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:56,708
No.

379
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,667
No.

380
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,958
Hold on a little longer, please.
Please, don't fucking do this.

381
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:05,083
Please, not now.

382
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,958
I asked you to wait!

383
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:17,458
Nico!

384
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,208
Nico!

385
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,792

Please, come on. Come on, breathe.

392
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,167
Breathe.

Hey there, baby girl. Hey.

398
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:19,167
What is it?

399
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:22,167
Want me to change your diaper?

400
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,750
Okay, okay.

401
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:29,417
Okay, sweetie.

402
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,167
You have to eat, sweetie.

403
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:33,667
Come on.

404
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:36,625
Please, come on.

405
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,167
Come on, sweetie. Why won't you eat?

00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:42,917
Come on, please.

407
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:44,583
Come on.

408
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,208
You have to eat, sweetie.

00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:47,792
Okay.

410
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:50,833
Okay.

411
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,250
It's okay, sweetie.

412
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,458
But I need to eat.

413
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,500
For fuck's sake.

414
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:13,292
Shit.

415
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,833
There, there.

Why won't you eat?

419
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:33,875
Okay.

420
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,125
Listen to me. Listen.

421
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:42,167
You have to eat,
and I have to take care of you.

422
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,208
We'll get out of here. I promise.

423
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,625
Please, sweetheart. Come on.

424
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,250
Okay, enough!

425
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,167
Let me do this.
I have to do it to get out.

426
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,333
And to get help. Enough!

427
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:18,000
Please, enough. Be patient.

428
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:25,458
Okay.

429
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,583
I'm coming. Coming, sweetheart.

430
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:33,500
Coming. Okay. Don't cry, sweetheart.

431
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:36,292
Baby girl. It's okay.

432
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,458
You have to eat.

433
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,875
<i>Did anyone ever tell you…</i>

434
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:45,208
Come on.

435
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:47,042
Come on.

436
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:49,417
Stop!

437
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,833
Stop! Please, stop!
You have to eat! You're going to die!

438
00:48:52,917 --> 00:48:55,250
Do you want to die?

439
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:00,542
Sorry.

440
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry.

441
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,458
It's not your fault. I'm sorry.

442
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:09,667
I know. I'm sorry.

443
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:33,958
Sweetheart…

444
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:36,167
Come here, sweetie.

445
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,083
Come here. Come to Mom.

446
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,375
Let's try this.

Let's try this, okay?

448
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,125

My good girl.

452
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,125
My good girl.

453
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:22,583
Good girl.

454
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:25,083
Good girl.

455
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:28,708
Good girl.

00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:18,500
Come on. Almost there.

457
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:24,625
What?

458
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,042
What is it?

459
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:27,625
Please.

00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:38,167
No.

465
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,500

It's okay.

473
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,583
You're hot, right? Yes.

474
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:46,458
That's better.

475
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:49,417
That's better, sweetheart.

476
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:50,958

00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:00,042
I'm right here.

00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,167
It's okay.

00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,250
It's okay.

481
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,333
Hush.

482
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:08,083
It's okay.

483
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Go away!

484
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:21,792
Go away!

I'm here.

488
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,125
It's gone.

489
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,500
It's gone.

Please, come.

493
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:30,708
Come closer. Come. Let me see you.

494
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:39,583
Hello.

495

Let's leave, please.

496
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:46,292
Uma, I've missed you so much.

497
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:49,708
Why did you let them take me?

498
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,750
I'm sorry.

499
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:56,875
I'm sorry.

500
01:00:57,792 --> 01:00:58,917
It was my fault.

501
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,500
I just wanted to play with the airplane.

502
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,792
I'm sorry. I messed up.

503
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:16,625
Uma.

504
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:22,042
Don't go.

505
01:01:24,917 --> 01:01:25,917
I'm sorry.

506
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,292
It was my fault.

507
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:30,792
I messed up.

508
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,083
I'm sorry.

509
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:40,875
It wasn't your fault.

510
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,375
It wasn't your fault, sweetheart.

511
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:01,208
I'll get you out of here, okay?

512
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,250
Okay.

513
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:10,833
Look.

514
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,500
This is the sea.

515
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,250
The sun and the sea.

516
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:18,375
And the sky.

517
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:22,125
And way over there is where we're going.

518
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:42,167
You feel better outside, right?

519
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:46,417
Yes, you're much happier
because you're in the sun and fresh air.

520
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:48,458
Let's see.

521
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:09,333
Come.

522
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:12,167
Come here.

523
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:00,667
Here… Come on.

524
01:08:43,792 --> 01:08:45,292
I'm fine. Don't worry.

525
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,208
I'm…

526
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:09,667
I can't.

527
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,750
I can't.

528
01:09:37,417 --> 01:09:38,542
Don't worry.

529
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,458
Come on.

530
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,125
Come on.

531
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,125
Come on.

532
01:11:18,292 --> 01:11:19,292
Come on.

533
01:11:20,917 --> 01:11:22,958
Come on. Come.

534
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:27,125
Come here, fishy.

535
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Come.

536
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:32,500
Come!

537
01:11:52,292 --> 01:11:55,125
Don't look at me like that.
You were desperate for a feed too.

538
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,458
MAXIMUM

539
01:12:08,542 --> 01:12:13,042
DAY 9

540
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,875
Such a good girl. Good girl.

541
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:55,208
Hi, sweetheart.

542
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:18,958
Where are you?

543
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:20,542
Call me!

544
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,583
Call me!

545
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:50,583
DAY 12

546
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:10,792
Look, that's me.

547
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:12,375
At school.

548
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:15,792
With the kids.
Did I tell you I was a teacher?

549
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,333
This is your dad.

550
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:19,500
His name's Nico.

551
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:21,708
Here he is, in the store.
Look how happy he is.

552
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:26,167
We had to close the store down
because supplies got so scarce.

553
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:29,292
In the end, we had nothing to sell.

554
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:31,625
But people still went in to see him.

555
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:36,542
That's why I know
he'll find a way to get us out of here.

556
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:37,625
Because…

557
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:40,167
he always thinks of something.

558
01:14:45,042 --> 01:14:47,083
This is your grandma, Noa.

559
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:50,083
What do you think of that name? Noa.

560
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:52,125
I think it's nice.

561
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,750
It means "long life." It's also…

562
01:14:56,042 --> 01:14:57,292
the feminine of Noah.

563
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,833
Noah's ark. They got there.

564
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,542
They were saved. They got to shore.

565
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,250
It's an animal story.
I'll tell you all about it.

566
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,250
This is Uma.

567
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,042
You want to hear about her, right?

568
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:23,500
You have the same eyes as her.

569
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:24,625
Exactly the same.

570
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:27,958
The same face when she was little.

571
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:30,500
She wanted to be a pilot.
An airplane pilot.

572
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:32,708
She'd say, "Airplane pilot."

573
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:35,375
You two would have got on well.

574
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:40,542
What happened was…

575
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:47,875
When the regime took over,
she and I had to lock ourselves in.

576
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:51,167
Dad would go out to get food.

577
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,958
The thing is time went by, and…

578
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,458
Uma wanted to go out because…

579
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,875
A little girl
can't be locked up for that long.

580
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,500
At home, there wasn't…

581
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:14,792
There wasn't much space.

582
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,375
So…

583
01:16:19,417 --> 01:16:22,000
She kept asking me, on and on.

584
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:27,333
And one day we went out.

585
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,583
It was only for five minutes,
but they took her away.

586
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:42,125
It was my fault.

587
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,083
I messed up.

588
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:47,833
I messed up.

589
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,000
What is it? Are you okay?

590
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,583
You're frozen.

591
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,500
Okay.

592
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:36,125
You're so cute with my hat.

593
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:38,500
It suits you.

594
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:43,833
You'll be better tomorrow, okay?

595
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:45,875
Wrapped up.

596
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:48,583
All wrapped up.

597
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:57,208
<i>Did anyone ever tell you</i>

598
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:02,625
<i>That no dream</i>

599
01:18:05,042 --> 01:18:08,292
<i>Has time or space?</i>

600
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:14,250
<i>No possessor</i>

601
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:18,250
<i>No one</i>

602
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,708
<i>No one</i>

603
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:07,167
It's okay.

604
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,625
DAY 12

605
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:18,375
No…

606
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:21,042
MAXIMUM

607
01:21:05,167 --> 01:21:06,208
Nico!

608
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:08,833
Come on, please.

609
01:21:08,917 --> 01:21:10,625
Please, please.

610
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:15,583
- Nico!
<i>- Mia!</i>

611
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:18,125
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Yes, finally.</i>

612
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:22,208
Finally, sweetheart.
I couldn't call you. There was no signal.

613
01:21:22,292 --> 01:21:25,417
My phone is broken. The screen is broken…

614
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,250
- Where are you?
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

615
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:28,458
What's wrong, Nico?

616
01:21:29,792 --> 01:21:33,250
<i>I can't come to rescue you.
You have to do it alone.</i>

617
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:37,792
<i>Promise me you'll do it. Promise me.</i>

618
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:39,958
Nico, what is it?

619
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:42,583
Please, don't scare me.

620
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:45,083
Sweetheart, what is it?

621
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:46,875
<i>I'm…</i>

622
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:49,833
Nico…

623
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:51,875
<i>I'm hidden in a container.</i>

624
01:21:52,917 --> 01:21:54,917
<i>I got into a speedboat, but…</i>

625
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:56,917
<i>they found me, and…</i>

626
01:21:57,792 --> 01:21:59,792
<i>I managed to get away, but they shot me.</i>

627
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,458
Are you hurt?

628
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:05,083
<i>I'm losing a lot of blood.</i>

629
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:06,917
What?

630
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
<i>Sweetheart…</i>

631
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,250
What?

632
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,667
<i>I just wanted to say goodbye.</i>

633
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:16,792
<i>I promise you I tried.</i>

634
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:20,542
<i>I tried as hard as I could.</i>

635
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,333
<i>I promise. I'm sorry.</i>

636
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:27,833
<i>You were right. You always are. I was…</i>

637
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:29,958
<i>too optimistic.</i>

638
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:32,708
<i>It wasn't a good idea to go.</i>

639
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:34,667
- No.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

640
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,958
- No, Nico, listen.
<i>- I'm so sorry, sweetheart.</i>

641
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:38,375
Listen to me.

642
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:40,000
You saved us both.

643
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:42,333
- Do you hear me?
<i>- What?</i>

644
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,333
<i>You both?</i>

645
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,167
Yes, sweetheart, she's here.

646
01:22:48,667 --> 01:22:50,792
She was born. She's here with me.

647
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:54,417
She's so beautiful.

648
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,333
<i>- She's beautiful?</i>
- Yes.

649
01:22:56,417 --> 01:22:58,333
<i>A little girl, right? I knew it.</i>

650
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:01,500
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- Yes, we're fine.

651
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:04,042
- We're fine.
<i>- I wish I was there.</i>

652
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:07,333
You are here, Nico.
You're here. You were always here.

653
01:23:07,417 --> 01:23:08,917
You were at the birth.

654
01:23:09,917 --> 01:23:12,500
You were there
when I opened the container.

655
01:23:14,042 --> 01:23:17,917
Nico, I promised you I'd fight,
and I fought. I swear I fought.

656
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:22,125
You're there when I sing to her.
You're always here with me.

657
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:24,250
<i>What? You sing?</i>

658
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,083
Yes.

659
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:30,875
<i>My love… What's she like?</i>

660
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:35,792
She's just like you. She's beautiful.

661
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:40,292
Strong and funny and she makes me laugh.
She looks after me. Just like you.

662
01:23:40,792 --> 01:23:43,458
What am I saying? She's right here.

663
01:23:43,542 --> 01:23:46,292
I'm going to put the phone close
so she can hear you.

664
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:47,875
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Sweetheart…

665
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:52,042
The voice you're going to hear
is your dad's. Talk to him.

666
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:57,667
<i>Hello, Princess. It's Dad.</i>

667
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:04,208
<i>That guy who used to squeeze your foot
when you were in Mom's tummy.</i>

668
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,542
<i>Listen, my love…</i>

669
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:10,625
<i>I have to tell you a secret.</i>

01:24:12,542 --> 01:24:15,042
<i>If things ever get complicated,</i>

671
01:24:16,292 --> 01:24:17,292
<i>close your eyes</i>

672
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:20,167
<i>and snuggle up to your mom.</i>

673
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,250
<i>You'll see it's the best place to be.</i>

<i>Always.</i>

675
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:33,542
Did you hear her? She's so clever.

676
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:36,208
Her name's Noa.

677
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:38,083
<i>Noa?</i>

678
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:40,458
<i>Are you sure?</i>

679
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:44,375
She looks a lot like a Noa.

680
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:47,375
I can't think of a better name.

681
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:51,125
Nico…

682
01:24:51,792 --> 01:24:52,792
<i>What?</i>

683
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:55,750
Nico, I love you more than yesterday.

684
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:58,750
<i>But less than tomorrow.</i>

692
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:15,750
Hush.

693
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:29,083
Noa!

694
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,500
Noa!

695
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,500
A seagull!

696
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,500
Do you know what that means?

697
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,875
MAXIMUM

698
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:07,125
Okay.

01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:15,083
What?

700
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,792
No!

Okay.

702

No.

703
01:29:56,917 --> 01:29:57,917
No fucking way.

704
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:33,167
No!

705
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:50,875
Noa!

706
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,833

Noa!

721
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,750
I'm here, sweetheart.

722
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:48,875
Not long now.

723
01:34:52,167 --> 01:34:54,125
A little longer. We're almost there.

724
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:55,958
I know we're almost there.

725
01:34:56,042 --> 01:34:58,000
We need to hold on a little longer.

726
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,583
Just a little longer.

727
01:35:00,167 --> 01:35:02,000
We have to tell our story.

728
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:06,667
I know they won't believe us.

729
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:09,625
But we know it's true.

730
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:14,250
We know we fought, right?

731
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:19,500
We did all we could, right?

732
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:26,083
You saved me, sweetheart.

733
01:35:28,458 --> 01:35:29,750
You saved my life.

734
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:35,208
Forgive me.

735
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:37,083
I was so scared.

736
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,458
But you made me strong.

737
01:35:44,833 --> 01:35:46,500
I did all I could, right?

738
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:50,625
Right?

739
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:52,750
I did everything I could, right?

740
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,667
I did everything I could.

741
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,542
I did everything I could.

742
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:09,042
Everything I could.

743
01:40:40,542 --> 01:40:42,167
My daughter? My daughter.

744
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:13,750
No, don't take it off.
