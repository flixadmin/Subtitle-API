1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,760
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,040
I hope you know, Oswald,
you can always count on me.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,680
Thank you.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,120
Miss Kringle, dinner, <i>Chei Moi.</i>

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,680
Okay.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,480
That's for Kristen.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,600
Whatever happened with Tetch?

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,680
He broke his sister out of GCPD.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,280
- I'll never go with you!
- I love you!

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,920
- You're insane!
- No!

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,760
No!

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,880
You killed her!

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,320
She died. He escaped.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,320
Because I heard a rumor there's
something strange about her blood.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,680
I'll tell you what you want to know.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,720
You are gonna have
to buy me dinner though.

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,920
He killed you.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,800
Those who hurt you will feel my pain.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,960
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too, baby.

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,440
I'm so proud of you.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
Bye!

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,480
Well, the good part is about
to happen.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,760
I am so...

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
Look at that,
there's no greater symbol of love

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,320
than two people
who've made the choice

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,080
to spend the rest
of their lives together.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,600
Hey, pal, we have
a reception to get to

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,400
- so what you say we get a move on?
- Yes.

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,440
About that I'm afraid
you won't be able to attend.

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
This some kind of a joke?

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
No.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,720
It's quite serious, in fact.

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,640
You're needed elsewhere.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,480
- Hey, open the damn door!
- Sorry, we mustn't be late.

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,640
Please, just don't hurt us.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,520
That's not my decision to make.

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,000
Your fate depends entirely
on James Gordon.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,800
Hey! Hey!

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
- Don't forget to buckle up.
<i>- Hey, open the door!</i>

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
- Help!
- Help! Help!

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,720
{\an5}What a beautiful morning.

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,240
{\an5}Sun is shining, birds are singing.

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,040
{\an5}And they say that fortune favors
the brave.

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
{\an5}Do they have that saying
in your country, Olga?

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,640
{\an5}<i>Ya ne ponimayu.</i>

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,440
{\an5}I don't know what you're saying.

48
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,200
{\an5}<i>Vash zavtrak gotov.</i>

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,120
{\an5}It's not important.

50
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,840
{\an5}What is important
is that I have found someone.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,040
{\an5}What good is love if it's one-sided?

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,560
I have no choice
but to confess my feelings to Ed.

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,720
{\an5}<i>Da.</i>

54
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,160
{\an5}Now that I understand.

55
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,720
{\an5}It means yes.

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,400
{\an5}My mother taught me that.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,320
{\an5}She used to tell me,

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,720
{\an5}"Life only gives you one true love,
Oswald.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,240
{\an5}When you find it, run to it."

60
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,360
So that is what I'm going to do.

61
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,920
{\an5}I'm also going to enroll you
in an ESL program.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,240
{\an5}You really should learn the language
if you're going to work here.

63
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,280
So I hear that Lee Thompkins

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,360
{\an5}is running point on Alice Tetch's
blood at the GCPD.

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,720
{\an5}That would make sense.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,520
{\an5}Can you get me a sit-down with her?

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,720
{\an5}Oh, I see.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,240
{\an5}You're willing to help me,
just not when it comes to your ex.

69
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,440
It's complicated.

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,320
{\an5}Actually, it's really simple.

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,080
{\an5}You just pick up the phone,
you dial her number

72
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,400
{\an5}and you let her know that
Valerie Vale would like a sit-down

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,280
{\an5}to discuss Alice Tetch's blood.

74
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,200
{\an5}See? It's pretty simple.

75
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,240
{\an5}She won't give you anything.

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,440
You leave that part to me.

77
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,120
{\an5}You know, I can get used to this,
you helping me with my stories.

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,960
{\an5}We make a pretty good team.

79
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,120
Does that mean
you'll share your breakfast?

80
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,680
Absolutely not.

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,360
But really, when are you gonna
give up this P.I. act?

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,000
{\an5}So far you've had two cases.

83
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,560
{\an5}One girl died and the other one,
well, you never found her.

84
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,200
In baseball we call that an O-fer.

85
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,280
{\an5}- I'm happy.
- Of course, you are.

86
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,560
{\an5}You get to drink scotch all day
and have sex with me.

87
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,680
{\an5}I got to go to work.

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,440
You know what?

89
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,280
This is nice.

90
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,840
Let me know when you hear
from Thompkins.

91
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
Can I help you?

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,040
James Gordon,
Jervis Tetch has a message for you.

93
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,960
Follow my friend where to go,

94
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,200
to learn the truth
you've hidden below.

95
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,800
Should you choose not to play,
precious people will die today.

96
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,880
- This is Gordon.
- Hello, James.

97
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,880
Jervis, never should've left
that hole you were hiding in.

98
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,160
Oh, I wasn't just hiding.

99
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,360
I put the time to good use.

100
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,920
Made a thorough study of you.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,520
<i>Quite the fascinating history.
Yet, so tragic.</i>

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,160
A father lost.

103
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
<i>Career gone by the wayside.</i>

104
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
<i>Failed relationships.</i>

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,120
And here I didn't think about
you once.

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
Oh, James.

107
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,200
I've been inside that head of yours,
James.

108
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,640
I've seen the web of lies
you tell yourself.

109
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,120
Strung together to keep
that fragile psyche of yours intact.

110
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,600
Well, it's been nice catching up
with you.

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,840
<i>I'm going to force you to confront
who you really are.</i>

112
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,360
And I'm going to drive you mad
doing it.

113
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,520
<i>Now, please direct your eyes
to the overpass.</i>

114
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,280
<i>Meet Dave and Amy Walters.</i>

115
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,920
<i>Married just this morning.</i>

116
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,960
Lovely ceremony.

117
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,320
<i>In 30 seconds, they're going to jump
to their deaths.</i>

118
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,240
<i>Take the stairs,
and you can save them.</i>

119
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,040
However, down the street
there's a little boy.

120
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,160
<i>His name is Shane.</i>

121
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,000
<i>And he's going to be hit by a truck,</i>

122
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,000
<i>driven by my highly
esteemed associate.</i>

123
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,880
<i>Choice is yours, James.</i>

124
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,160
You can't save both.

125
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,520
<i>So who's it going to be?</i>

126
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,240
<i>You can't save both of them.</i>

127
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,680
<i>You can't save both of them.</i>

128
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,880
You son of a bitch.

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,840
<i>Good. Now I have your attention.</i>

130
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,960
They were innocent, Jervis.
You didn't have to kill them.

131
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,680
<i>It was your choice, James.</i>

132
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,040
<i>You practically pushed them off
the ledge.</i>

133
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,320
<i>Stay with me, James.</i>

134
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,920
<i>- James?</i>
- What?

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,320
<i>87, Fulton Street,
Apartment Four-C. Five minutes.</i>

136
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,440
<i>No police, or more people die.</i>

137
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,360
Oh, boy, now it's official.

138
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,040
Why? You looking to back out?

139
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,120
You'd have to put a bullet in me.

140
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
Good thing I don't carry a gun.

141
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,040
My father called.

142
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,360
He wants to throw us
an engagement party.

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,320
- Told him we're not interested.
- Okay.

144
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,760
I know you had reservations about
moving back here.

145
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,160
And, you know my dad.
Half measures aren't his thing.

146
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,080
If we say yes, he's gonna put us
on display for the whole city.

147
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,480
I understand.

148
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,080
But we chose to build a life here.
And I'm glad.

149
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
An engagement party sounds wonderful.

150
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,520
These go directly
to the City Clerk's office.

151
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,320
And this...

152
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,720
leave this outside
Nicky The Nail's place.

153
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,080
Knock twice. Light it and then run.

154
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,040
Okay.

155
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,000
Good morning, Mayor Cobblepot.

156
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,040
Good morning to you,
my Chief of Staff.

157
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
Here are your schedules for the day.

158
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,520
This covers your duties as Mayor,

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,520
and this as Kingpin
of the underworld.

160
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,240
You really are settling into your
role here, aren't you, Ed?

161
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,720
And yet I still have so much
to learn from you.

162
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
I came up empty tracking down Butch.

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,800
Somehow that one-handed ape managed
to disappear.

164
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,200
I suspect he's hiding
with his old crew.

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,040
I'm sorry for letting you down.

166
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,440
You have done nothing of the sort.

167
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,400
I would be lost without you.

168
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,240
In fact, there is something
that I need to tell you.

169
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,680
Something very important.

170
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,480
What is it, Oswald?

171
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,000
You know what? I forget.

172
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
In and out of my head just like that.

173
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,360
Don't you hate that when
that happens?

174
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,680
That never happens to me.

175
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,040
You know what, I believe that.

176
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,080
So, where are we off to first?

177
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,440
P.S. 134. You're touring a school.

178
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,680
Press will be there,
so we better get a move on.

179
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,360
Great. I love children.

180
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,600
Okay, thank you very much. Okay?

181
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,000
Hey, Cap!
I just spoke to that kid over there.

182
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,800
You're not gonna believe this,
he said Jim Gordon saved his life.

183
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,440
Pulled him out of the way of a truck.

184
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,800
Get him on the phone, now.

185
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,400
I already tried him, no answer.

186
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,080
What happened? You forget your cane?

187
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,560
I don't need it anymore.

188
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,240
Put an all-points out on Gordon.
I want him found.

189
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Hey, does that guy look strange
to you?

190
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,640
I mean, more so than
the usual wack job?

191
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,760
Hey, pal, you see what happened here?

192
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,040
A message for you.

193
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,560
James Gordon,
I have a message for you.

194
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,360
James Gordon,
I have a message for you.

195
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
He's hypnotized.

196
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,360
James Gordon,
I have a message for you.

197
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Tetch.

198
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,680
- Jervis.
- <i>Cutting it close, James.</i>

199
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,120
I like what you've done
with the place.

200
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,560
<i>Everyone needs a hobby.</i>

201
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,080
<i>Take a peek through the lens.</i>

202
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,160
<i>Let's chat face to face.</i>

203
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,680
I wonder, what is it that you have
against married couples?

204
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,440
<i>Bad memories, perhaps?
Understandable.</i>

205
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,520
<i>Given the last time you saw a woman
in a wedding dress,</i>

206
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,880
<i>she had a shotgun pointed at you.</i>

207
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,200
- Hey, Jervis.
- <i>Yes, James?</i>

208
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Hello?

209
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,920
Don't you ever do that again!

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

211
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,040
This is about your sister, isn't it?

212
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,360
In your addled brain, you blame me
for what happened to her.

213
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,800
<i>Don't you talk about her!</i>

214
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,080
I got to know her, Jervis.
She was a good person.

215
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,400
That's why she hated you.

216
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,000
Why she died trying
to get away from you.

217
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,280
You want revenge? Kill yourself.

218
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,080
Dismissive. Rude.
I don't like your attitude.

219
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,280
I'll tell you what. I'll come down.
We can talk about it in person.

220
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,800
<i>Hang up again, she dies.</i>

221
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,960
What're you talking about? Who?

222
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,880
<i>Surprising, really.</i>

223
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,080
Given that every relationship
you've been in ended in such misery.

224
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,480
And yet you made the choice
to date again.

225
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
<i>Poor girl...</i>

226
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,400
she had no idea
who she was getting into bed with.

227
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,040
She will soon.

228
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,280
<i>See for yourself.</i>

229
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,560
Great thing about reporters.

230
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,960
<i>Tell them you have a story.</i>

231
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,120
And they'll meet you anywhere.

232
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,400
Let me go!

233
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,680
I've got him in a safe house uptown.

234
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,360
You would not believe the amount
of steak that man eats.

235
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Poor Butchie. Nothing but, Tabitha
and red meat all day.

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,280
You know, sooner or later,

237
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,440
Penguin is gonna figure out
who sprung him.

238
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,560
- You need a plan, sweetie.
- I'm working on it.

239
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,760
And in the meantime?

240
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,840
Has the flame rekindled
between you two?

241
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,240
Or you still holding out?

242
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,000
We'll see.

243
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,280
Speaking of old flames.

244
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,520
Well, you just can't seem
to stay away.

245
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,760
Tetch. Where is he?

246
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,920
How should I know?

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,440
And if you don't mind, Tabitha
and I are just in the middle...

248
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,040
unnecessary.

249
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,880
Jervis Tetch kidnapped Valerie Vale,
this morning.

250
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,920
He knew things that only
you could've told him.

251
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I want to know where he is.

252
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,600
Oh, see that fire?

253
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,320
I mean, where was that
when we were together?

254
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,200
All I got was Captain Vanilla.

255
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,520
Seriously.

256
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,720
We have to open in a few hours.

257
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,960
Then talk.

258
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,400
Firstly, I don't know where Tetch is.

259
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,560
Secondly, he may have come in here
a few days ago, asking about you.

260
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,800
Asking what?

261
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,040
Oh, you know, everything.

262
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,760
Family stuff, GCPD.
The women in your life.

263
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,800
He seemed especially
interested in that.

264
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,160
He knew about Vale already,
but I told him about us.

265
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,360
About how you're still
in love with me.

266
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,080
Cry yourself to sleep at night.

267
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,320
And Lee? Did you tell him about her?

268
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,600
Oh, you mean Miss Rebound from me?
Of course.

269
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,440
We'll send you a bill for the damage!

270
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,600
Lee, listen to me.

271
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
<i>I'm sorry, James. Lee can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
<i>Can I take a message?</i>

273
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,040
No? Good.

274
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,160
Gotham Water and Power. Ten minutes.

275
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,720
I need to know she's okay.
Both Lee and Vale.

276
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,560
<i>What you want means nothing to me.</i>

277
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
<i>Nine minutes.</i>

278
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,840
James sends his regards.

279
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,520
Now where were we?

280
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Oh, yes. Introductions.

281
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,640
Lee Thompkins meet Valerie Vale.

282
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,840
You both have one very important
thing in common.

283
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,280
You're two halves
of Jim Gordon's heart.

284
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,440
James Gordon,
I have a message for you.

285
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Where is Jervis Tetch?

286
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,480
James Gordon,
I have a message for you.

287
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,640
Yeah, I know.

288
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,800
You said that the first hundred times
I asked you.

289
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,080
James Gordon,
I have a message for you.

290
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,760
Where is he? I know you can hear me!

291
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,960
Hey, Cap, a Uni just spotted Gordon
pulling up to Gotham Water and Power.

292
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,200
Tell him to hold his position
till we get there.

293
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
<i>Glad you could make it, James.</i>

294
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,840
Where's Lee and Vale?

295
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,400
<i>Oh, you clearly have no sense
for stagecraft.</i>

296
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,800
<i>We must build to the climax.</i>

297
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,360
<i>This is merely the second act,
where we stoke the tension.</i>

298
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,120
<i>On the right is one of Gotham's
finest paediatricians.</i>

299
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,520
<i>On the left,
Channel Five's favorite anchor.</i>

300
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,080
<i>A doctor and a journalist.</i>

301
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,680
- <i>You get it?</i>
- Yeah, I get it.

302
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,040
<i>The choice is simple, you see.</i>

303
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,760
<i>It's kill one
and the other will go free.</i>

304
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,400
<i>But if your answer to me is no,
a thousand watts into them will go.</i>

305
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Sorry, Jervis,
I'm not killing anyone.

306
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,720
<i>Yes, you will.</i>

307
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,920
<i>Now pick up the pistol and fire!</i>

308
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
You want to show me who I really am?
Then show me.

309
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,280
<i>Oh, I will.</i>

310
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,080
I'm done playing your game.

311
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,400
Jim!

312
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,560
Hold! What the hell is going on here?

313
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,680
<i>Captain Barnes,</i>

314
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,320
<i>you're just in time to see
James kill these two innocent men.</i>

315
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,520
We need to find the main
power shutoff, now.

316
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,640
Go!

317
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,960
<i>Even when you don't choose, James,
there are consequences.</i>

318
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,880
No!

319
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,280
No.

320
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,400
No!

321
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,080
- I'm gonna find you.
- <i>Oh, I'm counting on it.</i>

322
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,760
<i>Just ask an old friend
how to get to the end.</i>

323
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
This is our third grade class.

324
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,440
How many more grades
do we have to visit?

325
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,280
- This is a K through 12 building.
- Twelve?

326
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,160
But we don't have to see
every single class, do we?

327
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,280
Mayor James used to read
to the children.

328
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,280
Aubrey James is illiterate, ma'am.
It's well documented.

329
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,640
Perhaps, we should move on.

330
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,480
What's wrong with that boy there?

331
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,440
That's Luke.

332
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,960
He's new here.

333
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,800
Hello, Luke. I am Mayor Cobblepot.

334
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,920
Why aren't you playing
with the other children?

335
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,760
What if they don't like me?

336
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,760
Well, how would you ever know
if you don't give it a try?

337
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,840
And if they don't like you,

338
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,040
wait for them to turn their backs
and push them down the stairs.

339
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,480
Little guy needed a push, that's all.

340
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,920
I continue to be in awe of you,
Oswald.

341
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,080
Ed...

342
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,600
there is something I would like
to discuss in a more private setting.

343
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,080
Shall we say dinner at the mansion?
Eight o'clock?

344
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,120
I'll pick us up a nice bottle
of wine.

345
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,800
Tetch has Lee Thompkins
and Valerie Vale. You're sure?

346
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,800
I saw him take Vale and
I called Lee's cell and he answered.

347
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,520
So yeah, pretty sure.

348
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,240
Call the ME's office.
Call her fiancé. Find her.

349
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,720
What the hell is going on here?

350
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Tetch blames me for what happened
to his sister.

351
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,400
He wants revenge.

352
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,320
So what?
He kills two innocent civilians?

353
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
How does that track?

354
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,000
He's obsessed with showing me
who I really am.

355
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,520
Driving me insane.

356
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,440
He killed them,
and I just stood there!

357
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,800
What were you supposed to do?
Shoot one of them?

358
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,040
You did what you could.
That's on him.

359
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,960
This is just to prepare me.

360
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,520
He's gonna make me choose.

361
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,640
He's gonna put me in front of Lee
and Vale,

362
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,680
and he's gonna make me choose.
And if I don't...

363
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,160
He'll kill both of them.

364
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,520
We're gonna find her.

365
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,440
I promise you that.

366
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,320
Listen to me, Tetch is a lunatic.

367
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,480
He's gonna get caught.

368
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,960
The most you can hope for is
a lifetime in prison. Don't do this.

369
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,960
Dumpree...
let's see what's in the kitchen.

370
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Nice try.

371
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,480
So why'd they bring us back
to your place?

372
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Like I know?

373
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,960
Well, any chance your boyfriend
might come home?

374
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,240
Not likely.

375
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,960
You do know what this is about,
don't you?

376
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,600
Yes. Tetch blames Jim for his sister,
and we're his means for revenge.

377
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,400
- I've been here before.
- That's too big.

378
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
It's never going to spring
the mechanism.

379
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,440
You know,
it is kind of ironic, though.

380
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,280
I was just asking Jim
to get me a sit-down with you and...

381
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,520
here we are.

382
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,920
See, I'm writing a story
on Alice Tetch's blood.

383
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,440
I know you're running point
for the GCPD.

384
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,840
You're not seriously trying
to interview me right now, are you?

385
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,240
Jim said you wouldn't talk to me.

386
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
And he was right.

387
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,600
I think he was just being
protective of you.

388
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,600
Anyway, about Alice Tetch.

389
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,120
I hear they're running experiments
on her blood at GCPD bio facility.

390
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,320
Care to comment?

391
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
Maybe you're just really scared
and this is your way of coping,

392
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,960
or maybe you're just insanely
committed to your job,

393
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,640
Either way, all I'm interested in
is getting out of here.

394
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,360
Try a cuticle pusher.

395
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,160
My dad was a cop.
Taught me how to pick locks.

396
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,480
I can walk you through it.

397
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,440
Thank you.

398
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,720
And in exchange,
you can talk to me about Alice Tetch.

399
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,360
You and Jim are made for each other.

400
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,080
Thanks.

401
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,640
It's not a compliment.

402
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,320
Thank you, Dr. Calvi.

403
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
I'll call you as soon
as we hear anything.

404
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,960
Mario's been in surgery all morning.

405
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,120
Says that he and Lee left
the house together this morning.

406
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,560
She was headed to the station.
He hasn't heard from her since.

407
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,520
Jervis must have grabbed her
before she got here.

408
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,840
What's his next move?

409
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,720
Tetch wants me to find him.

410
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,120
Well, if that's the case then why
didn't he just tell you where he is?

411
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,000
I don't know.
But the last thing he said

412
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,280
was something about an old friend
leading me to him.

413
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,120
Well, I'm not just gonna sit here
and wait for Tetch

414
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,760
to send you an invitation.

415
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,640
Listen up!

416
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,200
Jervis Tetch thinks that Gotham
is his personal playground.

417
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,160
He's taken innocent lives.

418
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,240
And now he has Lee Thompkins
and Valerie Vale.

419
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,880
And to whoever puts
the collar on Tetch,

420
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,200
my personal gratitude
and best bottle of brown.

421
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,520
Now, go to work.

422
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,560
<i>Follow my friend where to go.</i>

423
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,840
James Gordon,
I have a message for you.

424
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,520
James Gordon,
I have a message for you.

425
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,680
Hey!

426
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,960
James Gordon.

427
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,600
I have a message for you.

428
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,080
How do I get to the end?

429
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,680
<i>"The true test will be revealed.</i>

430
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,800
<i>A final decision you must yield.</i>

431
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,240
<i>Tea party begins once more,</i>

432
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,480
<i>when you walk through
Lee Thompkins' door."</i>

433
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,320
- Jim.
- Not now.

434
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,520
What the hell's going on?
Where's Lee?

435
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,640
Look, you're just gonna have
to trust me.

436
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,440
Trust you?
According to Captain Barnes,

437
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,160
you're the reason
she's in trouble to begin with.

438
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,560
You know something.

439
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,440
You know where she is, don't you?

440
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,280
Keep your voice down.

441
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,000
- Does Barnes know? Where is he?
- No. He does not know.

442
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,600
Because if he showed up with 20 cops,
both Lee and Vale would be dead.

443
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,880
I see.

444
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,640
So you're going to go in all alone
and save them, is that it?

445
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,880
Actually, you might be the only
person who can help me.

446
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,240
Come on.

447
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,160
- Remember you have to feel...
- I got it.

448
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,240
Can I ask you something?

449
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,360
As long as it's not about
Alice Tetch's blood.

450
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,640
Why'd you move back to Gotham?

451
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,320
The way I hear it, you made a pretty
nice life for yourself down South.

452
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,320
- It's really none of your business.
- Maybe not.

453
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,400
But you could've moved to any city.
Gotten any job.

454
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,840
Yet, you chose Gotham and the GCPD.

455
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,120
You realize that we both might
die today, right?

456
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,040
Well?

457
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,720
I didn't come here for James Gordon
if that's what you're worried about.

458
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
Not bad.

459
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,720
- My turn.
- Okay.

460
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,720
- Okay, so what's our plan?
- You're gonna break free.

461
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,320
We're gonna lure in one
of these goons.

462
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,880
Hit him over the head with something.

463
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,560
Not good.

464
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,760
You can still get out of here.

465
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,040
I'm not leaving you here.

466
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,480
There's gotta be something else
we can use.

467
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,680
My... my.

468
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,600
You two have been busy.

469
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,760
Now if you'd kindly join me
in the dining room,

470
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,360
the guest of honor
will be here shortly.

471
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,120
Welcome to our tea party, James.

472
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,040
We've been expecting you.

473
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,200
Please...

474
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,800
have a seat.

475
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,160
I think I'll stand.

476
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,760
You'll do what I say
or things will get messy.

477
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,200
And by messy I mean, my two friends
will pull their triggers.

478
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,680
and then we'll have blood and
brains all over this beautiful table.

479
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,800
So...

480
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,600
place your gun on the platter
and have a seat.

481
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,040
Really?

482
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,160
After all we've been through today,
you have to think about it?

483
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,720
Not everyone here has to die.

484
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,200
It's going to be okay.

485
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,880
Don't lie to them, James.

486
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,520
Lee, would you mind passing
that down to James?

487
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,560
I must apologize
for the hideous China.

488
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,240
Frankly, I expected more
from Don Falcone's son.

489
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,360
Guess I know what I'm getting you
for your wedding.

490
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,720
To good health.

491
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
I think I'll pass.

492
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,040
Me, too.

493
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,920
You know what?

494
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,360
I'll have some.

495
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,920
Bravo, James.

496
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,600
Now I'd like to begin by telling
the story of a brother and a sister,

497
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,360
separated for years,
but whose love never waned.

498
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,360
Fair warning though,

499
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,200
it has a sad ending.

500
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,680
But I couldn't find my sister alone.

501
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,240
So I turned to this man,
James Gordon.

502
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,840
Whom everyone said was a good man,
an honorable man.

503
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,480
And what did this good man do?

504
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,640
Why? He found my sister
and he turned her against me!

505
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,600
Poisoning her mind!
And then he killed her!

506
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,440
Does that sound about right, James?

507
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,600
Sure. Why not?

508
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,720
Now, James, I get the sense
you're not being honest.

509
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,520
Though that's not surprising

510
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,000
considering you've run from your
true self every day of your life.

511
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,120
But you can't run from this choice.

512
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,280
The woman you love is going to die.

513
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,000
I just need to figure
out which one it is.

514
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,120
So, let's review our options,
shall we?

515
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,800
On the one hand,
we have Lee Thompkins.

516
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,760
Intelligent. Kind.

517
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,640
She thought she could save you
from your darkness.

518
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,760
Drag you into the light.

519
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,720
And what did she get for her efforts?

520
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,880
Pain and sadness.

521
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,160
Don't listen to him, Lee.

522
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,200
Look in her eyes...

523
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,840
she still has love for you, James.

524
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,720
And then there's Valerie Vale,

525
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,840
the intrepid reporter
from a blue-collar family.

526
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,360
She still has hope for you.

527
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,800
What will happen when she learns
who you really are?

528
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,800
So, those are the choices...

529
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,320
now it's up to you.

530
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,120
Which lady has your heart?

531
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,760
Who do you love?

532
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,000
You want me to choose?

533
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,800
Tell these idiots
to lower their guns.

534
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
I don't trust them not to shoot me
by accident.

535
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,040
You're right. They are stupid.

536
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,920
Down, boys.

537
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,440
Now you drop your gun.

538
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,120
And why would I do that?

539
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,520
Because I'll shoot you.

540
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,120
Well... well.

541
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,680
You okay?

542
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,240
This was your grand plan, James?

543
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,240
Play along until Dr. Calvi
could sneak in and shoot me dead?

544
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,600
But there's only one small problem.

545
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,480
Before you arrived,
I went down to the basement

546
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,840
and switched the magazine in that gun
with an empty one.

547
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,480
My apologies, Dr. Calvi.

548
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,600
I only set the table for four.

549
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,560
Dumfree, will you please escort
the doctor to the bathroom.

550
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,080
I believe there's still one chain
in working order.

551
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,840
Now, I'm out of patience!

552
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,240
Who do you love?

553
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,280
You want to talk about love? Fine.

554
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,080
Let's talk about who you love.

555
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,800
- Or loved.
- Don't.

556
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,560
Your sister knew you were crazy,
Jervis.

557
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Stop it.

558
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,080
She was terrified of you.
She hated you.

559
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,720
- Enough.
- She told me...

560
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,760
what you did to her
when you were kids.

561
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,880
The thought of you disgusted her.

562
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,200
Lies! Deceit!
The story you tell is incomplete!

563
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
- She loved me!
- She loved you?

564
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,560
She killed herself rather
than be with you.

565
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,880
She didn't! No.

566
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,120
She impaled herself on a spike
and died in agony.

567
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,160
Because even that was better
than having you touch her.

568
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,800
No, no, no, no.

569
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,240
I saw her when she was dying.

570
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,440
Her face when she knew
she was finally safe from you...

571
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,720
she was smiling.

572
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,880
Because despite the pain,
she was happy.

573
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,600
Liar!

574
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,320
She was the only thing I ever loved,

575
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,760
and you... you sent her soul
to heaven above.

576
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,240
Yes. That's right. Me.

577
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,160
I'm the one you want.

578
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,040
So let Lee and Vale go.

579
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,720
Keep me. But let them go.

580
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,720
Oh, James.

581
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,760
You're trying to confuse me.

582
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,840
But I won't let you.

583
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,160
No, I'm determined
that you'll live on,

584
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,280
and suffer without your love
as I have.

585
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,800
Choose.

586
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,160
- No, I won't choose.
- You will!

587
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,560
You will!

588
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,520
You'll certainly spill.

589
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,040
I'll make it easy for you.

590
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,000
On the count of three,
instead of telling me who you love...

591
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,560
tell me who to kill.

592
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,160
Or I shoot both of them,
which would be such a thrill.

593
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,280
One.

594
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,720
Two.

595
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,600
Three.

596
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,760
Kill Lee.

597
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,600
Oh, finally.

598
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,640
The truth is revealed.

599
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,560
You chose Lee because you love Vale.

600
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,960
Very well.

601
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,040
I knew you had it in you, James.

602
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,120
All this time you made everyone
believe you were the hero.

603
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,760
But deep down
you always knew the truth,

604
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,720
you're a villain.

605
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,040
Vale.

606
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,320
This is Doctor Leslie Thompkins.

607
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,720
Please send an ambulance
to 25 Blackstone Drive.

608
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,840
Hurry.

609
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,840
Move.

610
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,960
You're going to be okay, Vale.

611
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,520
You hear me, you're going to be okay.
Hold on.

612
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,360
Victim's name is Valerie Vale.

613
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,200
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

614
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,000
BP's 100 over 60.

615
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,760
Tachy's at 160.

616
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,360
O.R. one's prepped and ready to go.

617
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,920
Clear the way! Clear the way, please.

618
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,960
I got it from here.

619
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Ed...

620
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,240
a man comes to a crossroads
in his life,

621
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,520
and he has to make a choice.

622
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,680
Does he choose safety and cowardice?

623
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,480
Or does he opt for courage
and risk everything?

624
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,440
I choose courage.

625
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,040
What I'm trying to say is...

626
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,160
The thing I've been wanting
to tell you all day long is...

627
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,560
I love you.

628
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,480
Impossible to pick
the perfect bottle, isn't it?

629
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,640
Well, it all depends on region
and vintage.

630
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,800
Of course, you have to consider
the wine pairing.

631
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Miss Kringle?

632
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,960
No. Oh, no, my name's Isabella.

633
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,120
I'm sorry to bother you.
I don't usually talk to people.

634
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,240
There's just something about you.

635
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,920
No, no, please, there's...

636
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,200
there's no need to apologize.

637
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,720
You just...

638
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,840
You remind me of someone
that I used to know...

639
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,480
long time ago.

640
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,200
You struggle to regain me.
When I'm lost...

641
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,560
you struggle to obtain me.

642
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,600
What am I?

643
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,040
Time.

644
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,240
I'm Edward.

645
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,120
Edward Nygma.

646
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,320
Jim, how is she?

647
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,040
Still in surgery.

648
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,320
She seems like a tough cookie.
She'll be all right.

649
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,800
What about Tetch?

650
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,200
We got the whole department
canvassing the city. We'll find him.

651
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,840
Why didn't you come to me?

652
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,720
I couldn't.

653
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,720
And I thought I could save them both.

654
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,600
You did what you thought was right.

655
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,120
Maybe.

656
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,320
In the end,
I did exactly what he wanted.

657
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,080
He won.

658
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,400
We'll see.

659
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,120
Mario's a great doctor.
She'll pull through.

660
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,080
- Lee, about what I said...
- Jim.

661
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,880
Not now.
