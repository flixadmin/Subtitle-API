And you can save them...

00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:08,133
By wiring $10 million
into that account every night.

5

00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,686
Starting with Laurel.

00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,898

How did this happen?

18
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,094
Sometime between transfer
and intake at Iron Heights,

19
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,430
-an inmate caught James unaware.
-[sighs]

By the time the guards intervened,

21
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,308
-it was too late.
-Motive?

22
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,435
The inmate was a headcase off his meds.

23
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,228
For all we know, he thought
he was killing his mother.

24
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,522
Well, the random murder of Cayden James...

25
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,985
-It doesn't feel very random.
-It was bad timing,

26
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,405
and even worse luck, Mr. Mayor.
That's all.

27
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,115
All right.

28
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,409
Cayden James is my responsibility.

29
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,828
If a head has to roll for this,
make it mine.

30

That is not how I run things here.

31
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,124
Just...

32
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,669

Thank you.

37

I understand that you're angry.
I am... I'm angry, too.

38
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,688
But we're not going to solve any
problems by yelling at one another.

39
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,024
Last I heard, Cayden James is dead,

40
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,859
but you still don't have
the money he stole.

41
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,569
You mean the money he was given.

42
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,405
We are still in the process
of recovering the money

43
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,991
that was extorted from the city.

44
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,160
We just need a little more time.

45
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,455
We are on the verge of financial collapse.

46
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:06,835
Without an influx of cash, soon,
we all have to shut down.

47
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:11,589
Schools, sanitation,
emergency services, everything.

48
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:16,803
Fine. We will have those funds
back in 48 hours.

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,266
You have my word. All of you have my word.

50
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,768
Thank you.

51
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,604
Okay, um...

52
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,774
Not that I don't love
your confidence and everything,

53
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,402
but should you really
be making promises like that?

54
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,654
The accountant is on his way back
from Corto Maltese

55
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,574
with the money that was deposited
into Cayden James' bank account,

56
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,741
as we speak.

57
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,202
You could've just told them that,
got those folks off your back.

58
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,329
I'm not telling them anything concrete,

59
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,790
until that money is back
in the city's bank accounts.

60
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,044
My bigger concern right now
is finding Cayden's associates

61
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,839
before Dinah does,
because she is on the warpath.

62
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,216
-[sighs] Yeah.
-Any luck with that?

63

John is working a few leads.
We should know more in a few hours.

64
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,097
Don't worry, they're not gonna
let anything happen to Laurel.

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,307
Oh, right.

Send him in.

All right, I'll take that as my cue.
I've got to head off to Planning.

00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,483
Oh. Okay... [clears throat] Welcome.

What are you doing here?

00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,405
Well, he's carrying evidence.

73
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,366
I'm just making sure
it doesn't get up and walk away.

74
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,452
Good luck with that.

75
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,289
Wasn't planning
on seeing you today, Lieutenant.

76
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,834
Well, I wasn't planning on it either,
but we've got a problem.

77
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,087
Cayden James' Corto Maltese
bank account has been withdrawn.

78
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,673
What do you mean, "it's been withdrawn"?

79
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,551
It's empty. All 70 million.

80
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,179
Somebody took all the funds out
before we got access.

81
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,475
-Do we have any idea who?
-No. But I do have three guesses.

82
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,518
I put in a request for the withdrawal log,

83
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,312
but it's a long shot.

84
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,982
If we don't have those funds in 48 hours,

85
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,277
this city's government services
will shut down.

86
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,238
And I understand.

87
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,615
But banks in third-world countries
like Corto Maltese

88
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,408
aren't exactly known
for their transparency.

89
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,036
I'm very sorry, Mr. Mayor.

90
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,625
Something smells good.

91
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,710
Well, that smell is physics,

92
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,296
mathematics and chemistry hard at work.

93
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,383
Felicity is teaching me about...
"Thermodynamics"?

94
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,509
That's right.

95
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,636
-And we just really wanted cookies.
-Narc.

96
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,055
Don't you normally have tutoring
after school, bud?

97
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,598
We all got sent home.

98
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,392
Miss Joe said
it had to do with the budget.

99
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,728
Is it true they might have to
close the schools?

100
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,855
I'm working very hard
to make sure that doesn't happen.

101
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,693
There's actually something that I
needed to speak with Felicity about.

102
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,528
I'll keep working on the cookies.

103
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,491
Yeah, you definitely have
that "day from hell" look.

104
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,326
What's going on?

105
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,079
[clears throat] The money that Cayden
extorted from the city...

106
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,706
-Hmm.
-Someone emptied the account.

107
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,958
Yeah, well, that somebody is either
Anatoly, Diaz or Laurel.

108
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,751
Or another player
that we haven't seen yet.

109
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,671
We requested the withdrawal logs
from the bank.

110
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,257
It's Corto Maltese, taking too long.
You want me to help expedite it.

111
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,259
I need it to look like it's coming
through official channels.

112
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,886
Yeah, I know. It's not my first rodeo
with Corto Maltese.

113
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,680
Give me about an hour.

114
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,433
Hey, you don't think it's a coincidence?

115
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,603
Someone killing Cayden
right as the money goes missing?

116
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,981
Could be the same person that
framed you for Cayden's son's murder.

117
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,232
Could be.

118
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,276
The only thing
that I know for sure right now

119
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,944
is that if I don't get that money
in 48 hours,

120
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,113
this city is going to have my head.

121
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,575
Any luck finding Anatoly?

122
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,785
Just Bratva dudes who don't know anything.

123
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,454
{\an8}What about you guys?

124
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,165
{\an8}Diaz's trail has gone colder
than my love life.

125
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,333
Same with Laurel.

126
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,752
If it's any consolation,
the other guys are striking out, too.

127
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,171
Ran into Digg chasing the same dead end.

128
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,672
I guess they're not sharing
their intel with us.

129
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,215
Not that we were sharing any with them.

130
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,509
Well, we can't trust them
to keep us looped in.

131
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,179
I mean, that's why I got put on
the Cayden James bank situation.

132
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,849
{\an8}Any clue we get can lead us
to the scum who worked with them.

133
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,601
{\an8}Scum singular or scum plural?

134
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,978
{\an8}And yes, that is me bringing up

135
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,646
{\an8}exactly what's going on
between you and Laurel.

136
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,440
{\an8}Well, we're not
braiding each other's hair, Curtis.

137
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:03,613
{\an8}I mean, but you are out for revenge,
and I don't feel too good about that.

138
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,283
[cell phone chimes]

139
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,538
Gotta go.

140
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,415
Looks like we got a lead
on the missing money.

141
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,003
[sighs]

142
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,255
{\an8}You okay with this?

143
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,966
{\an8}D hunting Laurel?

144
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,221
{\an8}Let's just worry about the money first,
then we'll deal with Dinah.

145
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,306
{\an8}You're not going to believe it.

146
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,934
{\an8}The bank just sent over
the withdrawal log we requested,

147
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,894
{\an8}plus security footage.

148
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,479
That is unbelievable.

149
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,814
What are we seeing?

150
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,607
The account was accessed by this woman.

151
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,070
She's listed in the withdrawal log
as "Siu Jerg Jai."

152
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,739
Took out the entire amount
in bearer bonds.

153
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,951
{\an8}It's excellent work, Jay. Okay.
We'll take it from here. Thank you.

154
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,669
{\an8}I'm guessing Felicity
had something to do with this.

155
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,003
{\an8}Yeah, she did.

156
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,548
{\an8}Thank you for inserting yourself
into this, by the way.

157
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,842
{\an8}Yeah, sure. Well, you never would've
shared the information otherwise.

158
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,135
{\an8}No, I wouldn't have.

159
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,928
{\an8}Because I don't trust you
to do the right thing.

160
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,806
{\an8}And what is that, politely ask Laurel
to give back the money?

161
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,099
{\an8}Not kill her.

162
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,351
{\an8}Dinah...

163
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,522
{\an8}I understand
that you're hurting. I get it.

164
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,400
{\an8}I also understand that
I don't have the most credibility

165
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,278
{\an8}when it comes to telling people
not to commit murder.

166
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,448
{\an8}But the city is on the verge
of economic collapse,

167
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,241
{\an8}and we just found the key to fixing that.

168
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,786
{\an8}Laurel is never giving you that money.

169
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,706
{\an8}-You don't know that.
-Yeah, I actually do.

170
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,417
{\an8}Because I know that when you look at her,

171
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,003
{\an8}you see the Laurel that you lost.

172
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,174
{\an8}And that's why you'll never be able to do
what's necessary to get that money back.

173
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,341
{\an8}And you will?

174
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,386
{\an8}Understand something.

175
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,932
{\an8}I will never let you cross that line.

176
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,809
{\an8}If you're going to threaten me, Oliver,

177
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,854
{\an8}you better be damn sure you can deliver.

178
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,996
{\an8}-[groans]
-Easy, easy, easy, easy.

179
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,624
You'll pop your stitches.

180
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,127
[exhales] How are you feeling?

181
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,962
Like I've been shot in the gut.

182
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,300
{\an8}Where am I?

183
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,970
You're someplace nobody can find you.

184
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,110
Oh, I guess we now know
what happened to $70 million.

185
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,238
Right. If we find her, then we find it.

186
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,408
{\an8}[clears throat] Quentin, I know that
we have been over this,

187
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,954
{\an8}but just for accuracy, you were
the last person that saw her.

188
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,081
{\an8}Yeah. Well, I...
You know, I didn't see her exactly.

189
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,582
{\an8}-Right.
-Like I told you,

190
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,586
{\an8}Dinah got off a shot just as Laurel
knocked us both out with her cry.

191
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,590
{\an8}[sighs] And, uh, yeah, when I came to,
Laurel was gone.

192
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,634
{\an8}So, are we even sure that Dinah hit her?

193
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,136
No. She didn't leave a definitive
blood trail at the scene.

194
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,222
We can go back over it
with chemical analysis,

195
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,599
-see if we missed anything
-Yeah, yeah, we can do that.

196
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,937
Um, listen, actually there is
something I should tell you.

197
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,566
Um, while Cayden James
was holding the city hostage,

198
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,693
Laurel started following me.

199
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,737
All right? It was right after
James kidnapped me.

200
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,782
And so, uh, well, you know,
I caught up with her.

201
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,742
I tried to make a connection.

202
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,621
Well, I mean, after what we just
saw her do to Dinah's boyfriend...

203
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,582
Are we even sure that that worked?

204
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,500
[Oliver] Actually, it might have.

205
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,461
When we went through
her go-bag at the scene, there was...

206
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,341
There was a photo in there of you
and our Laurel.

207
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,926
I gave her that picture.

208
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,640
[scoffs] Anyway... My point being,
if she hasn't skipped town yet,

209
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,560
maybe she'll come try to find me,
make a connection, you know,

210
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,646
-say goodbye or something.
-I mean, it's a long shot, but...

211
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,608
I agree, but I also don't think
that we can afford to be picky, so...

212
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,859
I'll get home.

213
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,236
I'll make it easy for her to,
you know, get me alone.

214
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,114
If she shows up, just make sure
that you stall long enough

215
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,282
for John and I to get there.

216
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,950
Yeah, sure. Bye.

217
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,245
Well, do you need me
to go with you for backup?

218
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,832
No, no. You know, like I said
it's a long shot. Right?

219
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,544
So, your time is probably better
spent here at the office.

220
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,463
But thank you.

221
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,924
Okay, well, call if you need anything.

222
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,388
[Wild Dog] We've already been
over this spot a thousand times.

223
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,516
Yeah, which is exactly why
I brought my new toy.

224
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,726
Presenting...

225
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,604
Mr. Terrific's Supersonic Spectrograph.

226
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,482
It uses Earth-2 sonic frequencies

227
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,693
emitted from Black Siren
and combines them with light imaging

228
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,570
to create a holographic replication

229
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,114
of her position
during that night's events.

230
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,202
-[Wild Dog] Is that...
-Laurel.

231
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,662
Is she crawling?

232
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,625
No. She was dragged.

233
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,757
[Wild Dog] Looks like she wasn't
putting up much of a fight.

234
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,009
-Your bullet must have tagged her, D.
-Good.

235
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,513
Now we just have to find her
before the others do something stupid.

236
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,931
Stupid how?

237
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,308
Oliver is not seeing clearly on this.

238
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,353
He's desperate to get that money.
He'll believe anything Laurel says.

239
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,563
[Wild Dog] Shouldn't we also
be desperate for that money?

240
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,982
-The city's hurting.
-I know.

241
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,943
But there are more effective ways

242
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,444
to find out
where she's keeping that money.

243
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,947
Sounds like you're talking about torture.

244
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,366
And it sounds like
you wanna go soft on her.

245
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,869
Curtis, the only way
to get justice for Vince

246
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,914
and money for the city
is going to be messy.

247
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,125
[Wild Dog] Hey, guys, look at this.

248
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,543
Tire tracks.

249
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,338
If they're from whoever
dragged her off, could be something.

250
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,216
Let's make sure they didn't
leave anything else behind.

251
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,853
I picked this up at a noodle shop
my girls used to love.

252
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,815
I've never been to any noodle shop.

253
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,276
[sighs] Well, hot and sour's
the best thing for healing,

254
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,736
no matter what Earth you're from.
[chuckles]

255
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,989
You know, I think I might have
a picture here of the three of us.

256
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,198
Would you stop?

257
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,908
I've already told you,

258
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,370
there's nothing inside of me
to change or going to change.

259
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,999
[Quentin exhales]

260
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,252
Um...

261
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,421
You know, you, uh...

262
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,548
You let me go.

263
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,218
Instead of killing me, like James wanted.

264
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,265
You hesitated killing Vincent Sobel...

265
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,100
Before doing exactly that.

266
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,437
Yeah.

267
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,772
You've done
some pretty unspeakable things.

268
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,360
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?

269
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,447
[sighs]

270
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,824
[Quentin] Huh?

271
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,287
Basically, you grew up without a father.

272
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,500
My guess,
you spent your whole life looking for one.

273
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,877
Zoom.

274
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,213
Adrian Chase.

275
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,965
Cayden James.

276
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,551
All those men are gone now.

277
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,679
Including Cayden James,
he was killed last night.

278
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,978
Well, it looks like I have an opening
for a new domineering father figure.

279
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,314
Feel free to send in your application.

280
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,025
You don't need anybody else telling
you what to do with your life.

281
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,195
Interesting.

282
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,614
Coming from someone
who has me locked up in a cabin

283
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,990
in the middle of nowhere.

284
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,784
You're welcome to leave anytime.

285
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,332
But my, you know... My guess is that

286
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,043
it's been a long time

287
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,381
since you had a chance to decide
what you want your life to be.

288
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,468
So, I figured I'd give you
a little time and space

289
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,971
to do just that.

290
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,473
I've got my hopes for sure.

291
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,185
But you're the one
that has to want to change.

292
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,648
It's weird.

293
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,027
I actually really like hot and sour soup.

294
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,237
[laughs]

295
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,949
Maybe we have more things
in common than I thought.

296
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,036
Would you tell me more about your Laurel?

297
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,548
Well, the luminol's certainly
doing its work on this blood trail.

298
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,301
[John]<i>Yeah, so much blood, we shouldn't
need the luminol to see it.</i>

299
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,969
Someone cleaned this place up.

300
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,388
Yeah, because Laurel
lost too much blood to do it herself.

301
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,099
What, so someone helped her get away?

302
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,773
No, someone took her.

303
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,611
I don't want to believe it, but I can.

304
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,821
We have to find her before
they do something irreversible.

305
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,865
If they haven't already.

306
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,704
-How has the print gotten us nowhere?
-We're not nowhere.

307
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,372
We've already ruled out
all the known vehicles

308
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,041
in the SCPD criminal database.

309
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,502
Which just leaves us with
millions of other unknown vehicles.

310
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,213
-Otherwise, known as "nowhere."
-[Curtis sighs]

311
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,716
Rene is right. This lead is exhausted.

312
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,677
[Rene] What the hell?

313
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,472
[Green Arrow] Where is she?

314
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,891
We know you have Black Siren.

315
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,560
If she dies, you've destroyed the city!

316
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,687
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We do not have Black Siren.

317
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,147
We'll figure that out for ourselves.

318
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,857
Since when is our word not enough?

319
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,525
Since you tried to kill her.

320
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:48,364
If she dies, that money is lost forever.

321
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,368
"Lost forever." Like Vincent Sobel.

322
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,621
Where was the Green Arrow
when he needed saving?

323
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,957
Your team walked into a trap.

324
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,459
If you came with us,
Vincent might still be alive.

325
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,252
Don't you dare say his name.

326
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,630
Thermal imaging is only showing
our six heat signatures inside.

327
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,298
I mean, if Laurel's here, she's...

328
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,467
She's not warm.

329
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,011
Are you hacking us?
Don't hack us, Felicity!

330
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,055
I'm not hacking. I wouldn't hack...

331
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,684
Yeah, technically I'm hacking you.

332
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,019
-Wouldn't be your first time.
-[Green Arrow] No, it wouldn't.

333
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,230
She's tracked all of you before.

334
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,985
Because we needed to know
if one of you broke our trust.

335
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,654
One of you did.

336
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,449
You have already
punished Rene for that mistake.

337
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,912
It's just too bad he doesn't
look like Laurel Lance, Oliver,

338
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,915
because if he did, you would
probably forgive him for murder.

339
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,626
Guys, we're not actually about to
fight about this, are we?

340
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,044
Like, physically fight?

341
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,880
Keep your team in line, Curtis,
and we won't have to find out.

342
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,551
Hold on! You guys barged
into another's team bunker!

343
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,302
Curtis, just listen for once.

344
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,680
Hey, hey, hey, hey, guys, no.

345
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,933
I do think Oliver wants to fight.

346
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,061
'Cause that's how
you always solve your problems.

347
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,148
That doesn't make you a hero.

348
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,233
It makes you a thug.

349
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,278
And it's a real shame,

350
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,240
because he's gonna feel
so betrayed when he figures it out.

351
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,785
You know who I'm talking about,
don't you, Hoss?

352
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,580
William.

353
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,043
Don't turn your back on me!

354
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,755
-Hey!
-Don't move.

355
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,299
-So, you're gonna shoot us, Digg?
-Do it.

356
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,304
[both coughing]

357
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,306
So, this was your plan all along, huh?

358
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,142
To get the chance
to look through our bunker?

359
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,311
And you wonder why we can't trust you.

360
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,647
[Spartan] We don't have to wonder anymore.

361
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,316
[Felicity] Laurel's not here. Let's go.

362
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,279
[Dinah Drake] Just so you know...

363
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,615
We are gonna find her!

364
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,243
And when we do, you better
hope to God you're not there too.

365
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,417
You think you know somebody,
then they do a triple-worm

366
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,294
blue cobalt IP hack that you taught them

367
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,378
right into your soul.

368
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,839
[sighs] God, I can't believe
we even ever worked with them.

369
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,801
[scoffs] You say "with,"
but what you really mean is "for."

370
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,511
They never treated us like we were equals.

371
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,262
Perimeter alarm's reset.

372
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,934
Also, I borrowed
a piece of your tech, Curtis.

373
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,561
What did you do?

374
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,647
You didn't really think
I wanted Oliver to hit me.

375
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,525
Would you care to share
with the rest of the class?

376
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,985
I planted one of Curtis'
audio chips on Oliver.

377
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,905
So, if they get the drop on Laurel...

378
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,241
So will we.

379
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,202
[Felicity chattering indistinctly]

380
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,912
Karma, bitch!

381
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,580
[John] <i>...the thought of being
against our guys, you know.</i>

382
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,375
[Felicity] I hate to state
the oh-so-depressingly-obvious,

383
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:52,005
but since Dinah and company
don't have Laurel, we have nothing.

384
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,508
Nada, zilch, bupkis.

385
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,593
Not true. We have three former teammates

386
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,470
who hate us more now than they did before.

387
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,974
Can't worry about them.
Guys, we're out of time here.

388
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,226
-Should I reach out to Lyla?
-I appreciate that, John,

389
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,561
but the last thing that we need right now

390
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,355
is yet another group
putting Black Siren in their crosshairs.

391
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,023
-[computer beeps]
-Oh, square, meet one.

392
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,817
She didn't vanish
off the face of the Earth.

393
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,486
Are you sure? I mean, 'cause,
technically, she is from another Earth.

394
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,072
We're gonna find her.

395
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,950
Because we have to.

396
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,292
Quentin.

397
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,255
Thea, what are you doing here?
You followed me?

398
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,633
Yeah, well, I... I knew
you were lying about something.

399
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,178
But, I, I did not think it was this.

400
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,721
Okay, she's sleeping, please.

401
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,431
[softly] Okay, but why didn't you tell me?

402
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,807
I thought we were in on this together.

403
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,810
I didn't wanna put you in a position
where you had to lie to Oliver, okay?

404
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,896
But listen, this is the right thing.

405
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,606
Okay...

406
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,150
I think I am getting through to her.

407
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,319
But you got to go
before she wakes up, please.

408
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,155
Okay, fine. But did you at least
find out where the money is?

409
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,781
Well, I'm building up to that.

410
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:05,829
Look, I know how important she
and this whole thing is to you.

411
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,331
I get it.

412
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,459
But the city is dying without that money.

413
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,711
-We need to find it.
-Right, right, right.

414
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,630
And, you know, I'll ask her.

415
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,091
But she just can't feel like
she's being forced into something.

416
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,843
Okay, we are running out of time.

417
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,386
I got to call Ollie
and get him in on this.

418
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,846
Okay, I'm sorry,
but your brother's not exactly

419
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,348
known for his light touch, all right?

420
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,558
And you and I, we both know
that I'm the only person

421
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,268
with any chance of getting through to her.

422
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,938
Well, that's so sweet
of you to think, Daddy.

423
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,981
But Thea's right.

424
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,400
You should probably call your BFF.

425
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,821
[cell phone vibrating]

426
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,368
Thea, I'll be back to City Hall
as soon as I can be.

427
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,703
<i>Ollie, I'm not in the office.</i>

428
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,997
-Where are you?
<i>-With Quentin.</i>

429
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,208
<i>-And Laurel.</i>
-What?

430
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,127
Are you okay? Did she hurt you?

431
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,587
<i>No, I'm fine. Don't worry.</i>

432
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,923
She's too torn up to scream.

433
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,051
Quentin has been
taking care of her in a cabin.

434
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,970
It's really cool.
He's been hiding her up here.

435
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,931
Excuse me, it's a little
more complicated than that, okay?

436
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,849
No, Quentin, it's really not.

437
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,685
[Black Siren] <i>Okay, let's cut the crap.</i>

438
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,853
I hear your city's on a clock.

439
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,938
Where's the money?

440
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,940
Don't worry, I'll tell you everything,

441
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,567
after you help me
get the hell out of this country.

442
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,112
No deal.

443
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,155
<i>The offer's not getting any better, Ollie.</i>

444
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,325
And the only reason I'm even
considering handing over my nest egg

445
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,952
is because I need help getting away

446
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,579
<i>from that nasty little
songbird friend of yours.</i>

447
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,333
Fine.

448
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,045
Speedy, text me the address.

449
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,802
That was easier than expected.

450
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,556
Oliver's willing to burn Vince,
but he'll let that murdering bitch go.

451
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,640
You were right, D.

452
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,351
Oliver just took Laurel at her word.

453
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,895
The city's not getting
its money back that way.

454
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,689
It's up to us.

455
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,566
Can you track the bug?

456
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,568
You know I can.

457
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,361
Then let's suit up.

458
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,120
Six miles out. Head west.

459
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,001
Felicity, you might wanna make sure
your seat belt is on.

460
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,294
Yeah. It looks good.

461
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,296
-Why?
-We got a tail.

462
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,759
We're marked!

464
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,107
Oh!

465
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,193
-You think it's the others?
-Has to be.

466
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,652
How did they find us?

467
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,990
-Oh, my...
-What?

468
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,077
[Felicity] This.

469
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,832
Rene wanted me to hit him.

470
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,459
It doesn't matter now,
they're in our dust.

471
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,627
Can you keep them there?

472
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,296
You forgot
what you hired me for six years ago.

473
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,923
[Felicity] You know,
that was exhilarating.

474
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,758
It was Alanis Morissette-level ironic.

475
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,426
But exhilarating.

[Quentin clears throat]

478
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,025
Hello, Ollie.

479
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,318
Where's the money?

480
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,821
[sighs] Haven't we gone
through this already?

481
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,949
No money until
I am safely out of this country.

482
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,326
You are in no position to make demands.

483
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,665
I can think of 70 million different
reasons why you're wrong about that.

484
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,874
Okay.

485
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,210
Oliver, Oliver, please, please.

486
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,296
Listen, Dinah's just got her scared,
all right? And for good...

487
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,881
Good reason.

488
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,134
Laurel needs our protection.

489
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,138
Which is why
you should let me go with you.

490
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,974
I'll make sure you get
out of the country safely,

491
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,600
and then we can start your new life.

492
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,770
-Together.
-Quentin, that's insane.

493
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,689
Well, well, well...

494
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,524
That was quite the performance,

495
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,360
but now that I know that it was
only about the money, hard pass.

496
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,571
Actually, Thea had it right earlier.

497
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,074
I was more focused on getting
through to you than the money.

498
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,450
But I believe

499
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,913
that if you'd had someone
in your world to support you

500
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,999
when things got bad,

501
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,168
you wouldn't be a criminal.

502
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,296
This is our chance
to find out if I'm right.

503
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,302
If, after a while, you decide
that you don't want me there,

504
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,637
I'll leave.

505
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:33,930
Promise.

506
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,392
This time around,
everything's down to you.

507
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,189
[exhales deeply]

508
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,523
Pack your sunblock.

509
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,026
I've always wanted
to live somewhere tropical.

510
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,153
[Green Arrow] Quentin.

511
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,906
The minute that she is out of the country,

512
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,575
you get added to
the list of people she's killed.

513
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,621
I'm betting otherwise.

514
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,415
And you trust her enough

515
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,586
to risk yourself? To risk the city?
Tell me now.

516
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,258
I do.

517
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,013
Then so do I.

518
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:27,234
That's it. I am not sitting here
on the side of the road like trash

519
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,569
while they let that murderer go free!

520
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,196
Guys, we're gonna find them.

521
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,824
How? They tossed away our bug
like it was a bug.

522
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,451
I think I know a way.

523
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,246
But it's gonna hurt John.

524
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,289
You say that like it's a deal breaker.

525
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,416
That guy's the whole reason
I got shot, hoss.

526
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,835
Curtis, this is not the time
to be worrying about John's feelings.

527
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,755
No, I mean, really hurt John.

528
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,758
Physically.

529
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,386
Find them.

530
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,680
Whatever it takes.

531
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,685
The union rep's deadline
is coming up soon.

532
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,687
Three-and-a-half hours
to be depressingly exact.

533
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,813
Don't worry. We'll be gone

534
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,898
and the money will be back
in the city coffers by then.

535
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,191
It better be.

536
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,318
Your new cover identities are almost done.

537
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,362
You have a one-way ticket
on a private plane

538
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,572
to your father-daughter trip
of a lifetime.

539
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,867
Just keep that vengeful bird of yours
from finding me.

540
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,078
[screams]

541
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,080
John? It's his arm.

542
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,623
The implant, it's been disabled.

543
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,542
Someone's hacking it remotely
to broadcast our location.

544
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,253
It's not "someone." It's Curtis.
They know where we are.

545
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,380
-Can you fix John?
-[Felicity] Rebooting the chip now.

546
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,924
It's gonna be a while
before you have full functionality.

547
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,427
You're going to be dealing with
your post-injury symptoms for a bit.

548
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,512
I'm aware.

549
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,931
-How long do we have?
-Based on the amount of time

550
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,350
that's passed since we last lost them
and now that they've attacked John,

551
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,435
not long.

552
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,062
I'm sorry, but with the other team
that angry, that close,

553
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,647
I can't protect Laurel by myself.

554
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,732
You don't have to.

555
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,526
Wait, are you gonna fight your old team?
This is insane.

556
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,697
Let's get ready to move.

557
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,661
You're gonna turn right in a mile,
dirt road.

558
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,872
You got us back on track, Mr. T.

559
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,082
[chuckles] I pity those fools now.

560
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,709
Do they know that we know where they are?

561
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,544
Trust me, they know.

562
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,797
Here's the turn.

563
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,177
Listen...

564
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,054
Laurel is a meta.

565
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,098
Now, I know that people
protecting her were our friends,

566
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,810
but if you hold back, if any of us
hold back our punches here,

567
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,562
we are the ones who are gonna get hurt.

568
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,484
And Laurel and the city's money
will both be gone. Understood?

569
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,447
Sonic dampener arrow.

570
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,575
Never thought Dinah would be the one
we'd use that against.

571
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,910
Having second thoughts?

572
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,913
Best-case scenario, man.

573
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,582
Laurel avoids punishment
for what she's done.

574
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,459
We put a hurtin' on the people
who used to be our friends.

575
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,127
But we keep the city from dying.

576
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,545
But at what cost?

577
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,090
If the people going after her

578
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,634
didn't look like Curtis, Dinah, and Rene,

579
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,011
would you even be asking this question?

580
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,262
No.

581
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,430
No.

582
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,184
But I can't help but wonder,

583
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,853
would we be doing this

584
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,647
if the person they were after
didn't look like Laurel?

585
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,734
Listen, man, I would back any call
you make, Oliver.

586
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,694
Always have, always will.

587
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,864
But we should acknowledge the fact

588
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,411
that going after our former teammates
may be a line we can never uncross.

589
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,621
I agree.

590
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,041
But they crossed it first.

591
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,634
Take the other car
to the main road and don't turn back.

592
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,969
We'll stop the other team from following.

593
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,555
You'll have the city's money
in two hours. I promise.

594
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,098
[gasping]

595
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,725
Thank you for fighting for me.

596
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,727
I'm not doing this for you.

597
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,187
But when it's over,

598
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,523
I don't wanna hear your name,

599
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,277
or see your face ever again.

600
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,238
Why not let me handle that?

601
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,576
You know, it's a shame you can't scream.

602
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,952
It almost makes this too easy.

603
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,247
[scoffs] Oh, sweetie,
I don't have to scream to kill you.

604
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,000
You are unbelievable.

605
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,462
I cannot believe you did that.
You could've seriously hurt John!

606
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,380
Just like you guys
are really gonna hurt the city

607
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,631
if you let her go!

608
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,884
Nothing's happened that can't be undone.

609
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,553
We're not saying it's a perfect
outcome, or even a good one,

610
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,971
but at least the city gets its money.

611
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,098
-That's not justice, hoss.
-That's enough.

612
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,476
We've debated this already.

613
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,561
We know where you stand.

614
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,022
-It's time to finish this right now!
-Dinah.

615
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,816
Not one more step.

616
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,874
Get to the car!

617
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,173
Rene!

618
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,800
[groans]

619
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,514
You're wasting arrows.

620
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,932
Am I?

621
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,027
Hey, hey! Stop!

622
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,280
-Are you crazy?

00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,111
Outside of Star City.

785
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,823
Mr. Ramirez is resting now.

786
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,075
You and your friends
will have to wait to see him.

787
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,576
What friends?

788
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,495
We thought Rene would be here.

789
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,999
Well, of course he's here.
You saw what Oliver did to him.

790
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,460
Yeah. Yeah. How's Rene doing?

791
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,921
You've lost the right
to ask that question.

792
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,133
-You two need to leave.
-No.

793
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,552
No, not until you tell us
if Rene is okay. This is...

794
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,095
Stop it.

795
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,140
Don't you guys get it?

796
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,017
We're not just done fighting you,

797
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,353
we're done with the three of you, period.

798
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,273
No more cooperation,

799
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,443
no more communication, forever.

800
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,448
Let's go.

801
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,326
Fine.

802
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,183
[whimpering]

803
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,185
[shakily] I don't know what day it is.

804
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,228
I gotta go...

805
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,690
-Are you okay?
-I just escaped. I...

806
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,737
I was kidnapped two year...
Two years ago, I think. I...

807
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,614
I don't know, I... [groaning]

808
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,200
Lady, what's your name?

809
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,744
[labored breathing]

810
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,914
Laurel.

811
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,584
Laurel Lance.
