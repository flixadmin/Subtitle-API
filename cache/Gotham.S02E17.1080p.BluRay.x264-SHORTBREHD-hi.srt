Father, I only knew you a short time.

00:08:56,871 --> 00:09:01,083
But you came to me
when I was alone in this cold, dark world.

161
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,796
You gave me a family.

162
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:13,930

(CHUCKLES)

As painful as this is,
we need to talk practicalities. Um...

172
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,340
Can I call you a cab,
or will you take the bus?

173
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,467
I don't understand.

174
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,761
Well, you're not returning
to the house with us.

175
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,932
- But where shall I go?
- Anywhere, but there.

176
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,393
Oswald, I'm so happy that you
and your father reconnected,

177
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,188
but he left the house
and the estate to me, and I'm...

178
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,565
Well, I'm simply not comfortable sleeping
under the same roof

179
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,234
as a notorious murderer.

180
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,361
But I'm not like that anymore.

181
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,739
I couldn't hurt a fly,
even if I wanted to.

182
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,867
Please, my father was all that I had.

183
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,703
We shared the same blood, and--

184
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,706
And he wanted us to be together.
He told me.

185
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,709
Let me stay. I'll do anything.

186
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:34,176
You are his blood.
We do need help around the house.

- Mother.
- Mother.

188
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,597
Why waste good money on servants
when we have Oswald?

189
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,349
I'll do anything.

190
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,893
Well, you can start by getting rid
of those disgusting flowers.

191
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,981
- I've always detested lilies.
- (LAUGHS) Yes, of course.

192
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,360
You're not really letting him stay?

193
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,779
He's Elijah's only natural son.

194
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,824
If he found the right lawyer,
he could make things difficult.

195
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,993
Especially if people look into
how his father died.

196
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,703
So, we just live with him, then?

197
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:04,206
Yeah, we keep him close and
after a suitable amount of time goes by,

198
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,835
poor Oswald, overcome with grief,
will take his own life.

199
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:12,214
Till then, we have a free servant.
I can fire the maid.

200
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:22,224
I murdered my parents.

201
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,061
I cut their throats.

202
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,104
Um...

203

<i>I joined a gang of psychopathic killers.</i>

204
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,822
I tried to kill Jim Gordon
and Lee Thompkins.

205
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:41,577
I was a puppet
of these demons in my head

206
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:45,206
and, uh, they were forcing me
to do these terrible things.

211
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,186
I feel sad.

212
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,273

213
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,818

Off you go.

472
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,568
If you keep releasing lunatics
so liberally,

473
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,820
you're going to get a bad reputation.

474
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,030
I'm not looking for a good reputation.

You know what she's going to do,
don't you?

478
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,083
I don't, actually.

479
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,545
But I do know it will be interesting.

480
00:29:58,339 --> 00:29:59,883
Nygma was right about one thing.

481
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,052
I can't just go to the cops.
They'll never believe me.

482
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:06,514
- I need hard proof.
- Cops, right? Jerks.

483
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,602
Nygma said he met Penguin
for the first time in the woods.

484
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,480
<i>That's right around the same time
his girlfriend went missing.</i>

485
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,941
I think he was burying her.
Just like he was going to bury me.

<i>What? You wanna find her body?</i>

487

Touch of the old "needle
in the haystack," isn't it?

488
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,324
Nygma knows where she is.

489
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,409
What? You think he's gonna, what?
Straight tell you?

490
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:29,204
That's exactly what he's gonna do.
But I need help.

495
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,599
Who do I talk to about the reward
for Jim Gordon?

496
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,227
Hey! Psst. Come here. Come here.

497
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,979
- Come here. Come here.
- Let go of me! I'm here for my reward.

498
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,273
- I'll give you a reward.
- BARNES: <i>Bullock!</i>

- Depends. There really a ten grand?

500
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,614
Depends on your information.

501
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:07,617
He was at my place a couple of hours ago.
He'd been shot.

502
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,494
Shot? Who shot him?

503
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,829
<i>Didn't say.
He wasn't making a lot of sense.</i>

504
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,165
- Is he still there now?
- No, he took off.

505
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,416
I don't know where,

506
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,961
but he was just looking for a place
to lie low for a while, I guess.

507
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,088
That's not worth $10,000.

508

(SIGHS) Fine.

509
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,843
Before he left he said he'd found out
where the Penguin was hiding

510
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,262
<i>and he was gonna go see him.</i>

BARNES: <i>Why would he go see the Penguin?</i>

512
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,599
I don't know. Something about,
"Penguin knows where the body is buried."

513
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,393
- What bodies?
- I don't know!

514
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,812
- Where's the Penguin now?
- No one knows.

Maybe Gordon won't even find Penguin.

519
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:00,169
You idiot. He's a detective.
He finds people for a living.

520
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:05,091
Penguin won't tell him.
He's my friend.

521
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:11,347
Who am I kidding?
You idiot. Stupid. Stupid!

522

Okay, okay.
Okay, calculate, cal-- Calculate.

523
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:19,897
Chances of Gordon finding Penguin,
let's say 80%.

524
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,735
Chances of Penguin telling Gordon,
also 80%.

525
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:27,447
So that's a 60% chance
of Gordon finding Kristen.

526

(LAUGHS)

You fed information to that little

00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:42,605
Or no. No, no, no.
Of course, you were in cahoots.

and I'll give you the Wayne files.

It was nothing that you did
or didn't do, Alfred.

629
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:23,362
Why I went away.
I want you to know that.

630
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:25,239
I do.

631
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:27,616
Thank you very much.

632
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,660
I'll be going back to the city
as soon as Selina's ready.

633

She's just taking a hot shower.

Hmm.

a couple of days ago, don't you?

637
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,923
And when were you going
to tell me, Alfred?

638
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,802
Well, I tried telling you this morning.
I'm telling you again now, aren't I?

639
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,805
- Don't--
- What're you doing?

640
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:52,641
She could walk in here.
Have a word.

641
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,478
- I trust her.
- It's about trust, is it?

642
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,898
Look, whatever your father was doing,
he did it in secret for a reason.

643
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:00,858
To protect those he loved.
And it's got--

644
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:03,319
It doesn't matter about
my personal opinion about that young girl.

645
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:05,988
But she has been a bloody good friend
to you and she's been loyal.

646
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:07,782
So, I'm gonna let you go ahead.

647
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,451
Continue your father's work.
I can't stop you.

648
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:12,328
I mean I've tried, haven't I?

649
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:16,624
But I will not have you put that
little girl's life in danger.

650
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,169
It's either the work or it's her.

651
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,838
Can't have both. Do you understand?

652
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:26,509
Ugh! Man, rich people

Bruce, what's going on?

I'm not going back.
