1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,857
Howdy, boys.

2
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,692
Oh, sorry. sorry, sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,569
How are you guys doing? Good?

4
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,239
Why don't you go have a smoke
or something, okay?

5
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:31,157
I got this.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,869
Oh, and you guys...

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,664
you are the real heroes.

8
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,559
Gentlemen.

9
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:11,757
All clear, boys. Mission accomplished.

10
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,017
God bless America.

11
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,018
Captain.

12
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,521
I found this.

13
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:33,612
The Islamic State is not exactly
a hotbed of scientific expertise.

14
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,700
But they've counterfeited

15
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,535
this Compound V shit of yours?

16
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,331
It seems that way, Mr Secretary.

17
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,750
How did they get the formula?

18
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,461
Honestly, we have no idea.

19
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,881
Well, you must have some idea.

20
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:55,885
Some tourist shoplift it from your lab?

21
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,179
Or maybe an inside job?

22
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:02,892
Sir, we would like to get to the bottom of this
as much as you would.

23
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,812
Ms Stillwell, if I had my way,
the Justice Department

24
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,939
would haul your smug, tennis-toned ass

25
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,360
into Congress and make you testify

26
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,362
to corporate fraud.

27
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,699
What is Lockheed Martin's number one product?

28
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:19,825
Sorry?

29
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,535
Its top seller.

30
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:25,164
You should know this,
you served on their board of directors.

31
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,166
- The Patriot missile.
- Correct.

32
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,793
Northrop?

33
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,211
B-2 Stealth.

34
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,796
General Dynamics?

35
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,590
Tomahawk and the M1 Abrams.

36
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,676
Billions of dollars of bleeding-edge hardware.

37
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,098
Do you know what all of that is as of today?

38
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,975
A worthless pile of shit.

39
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:48,604
Because Naqib and other super terrorists like him

40
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,357
can flick away that junk like flicking a flea.

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,319
So it doesn't matter
where heroes really come from.

42
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:59,281
Frankly, it doesn't even matter
how the enemy got the Compound V.

43
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,118
What matters is they've got it.

44
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,579
It is a whole new world now.

45
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:11,585
And there is only one company
that has the product to fight back.

46
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,550
My company.

47
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,343
My product.

48
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:25,141
What can I say? The Pentagon's agreed
to keep Compound V classified.

49
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,517
Classified?

50
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,060
What the fuck are you on about?

51
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,813
Because of the Naqib asshole that is out there,

52
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,023
we have to keep Vought happy now.

53
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,901
Vought are the ones that fucking created the cunt.

54
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,487
- We have no solid proof on that.
- No hard proof?

55
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,656
I fucking well rescued
the proof from a basement.

56
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,576
She's sitting on a bloody bog as we speak.

57
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,244
Listen. Listen.

58
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,496
Vought's manufacturing super villains.

59
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,081
It's the story of the century.

60
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:51,292
Don't you want a fucking Pulitzer?

61
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,336
Well, fuck you, too, then.

62
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,810
Susan, come on.

63
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,938
There must be something we can do here, yeah?

64
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:16,025
Look, the military deal is signed and sealed.

65
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:19,153
Do you think one mute girl
is going to derail that?

66
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,030
Especially coming from the fugitives

67
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,449
- that killed Translucent?
- Fugitives?

68
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:27,912
Vought insisted and... And the DOJ agreed.

69
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,079
You're wanted men now.

70
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,081
Hello?

71
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,333
This isn't a day spa.

72
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,168
Other people got to use the facilities.

73
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,653
Look, I gave you the V.

74
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,863
I gave you everything you asked for and more.

75
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:05,282
I trusted you, and this is
the fucking thanks I get.

76
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,660
Butcher, I will still protect your families.

77
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,037
Yeah, and keep your bleeding career even safer.

78
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,414
Well, what about me and the Boys, then, eh?

79
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,583
You cut bait and run for your lives.

80
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,418
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,966
Yeah.

82
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,384
Right.

83
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,302
All right, then, love.

84
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,139
Well, that's all under control, isn't it?

85
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,976
We need to split up.

86
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,727
Oi, what the fuck are you doing?

87
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,020
We ain't done yet.

88
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:38,190
The hell we ain't. We got Vought, the Supes,
and the feds on our asses.

89
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,483
I'm going to Montreal.

90
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,069
How you gonna get
your crazy-ass girlfriend over the border?

91
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,988
She has a name.

92
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,739
It's Kimiko. Okay?

93
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,241
- Kimiko.
- Oi, listen.

94
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,659
Shut your fucking traps.

95
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,745
We're on the verge of nailing these cunts.

96
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,873
And you want to cut bait and run
before we've played our final card.

97
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,542
Okay, what is it, man?

98
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,671
Give us a couple hours. Yeah?

99
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,464
Hughie, you're with me.

100
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,842
Come on, son.

101
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,594
Chop-chop.

102
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,237
Annie.

103
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,905
You scared me.

104
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,991
You didn't say you were coming.

105
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:34,705
I hid this under my floorboards
right after Daddy left.

106
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:40,377
I thought that maybe he would come back
for it, but...

107
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,797
- Still smells like him.
- It was a bad habit.

108
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,467
His father smoked a pipe,
so, you know...

109
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,803
What's Compound V?

110
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,263
Compound V?

111
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:54,016
I don't know, sweetheart. Should I?

112
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,522
How old was I?

113
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,946
How old was I when you let
Vought pump me full of drugs?

114
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,115
- Annie, honestly, I don't know what...
- How old

115
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,368
when you let them turn me into a freak?

116
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,286
You're not a freak.

117
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,496
Never say that.

118
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,417
So it's true.

119
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,176
Annie...

120
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,721
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

121
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:43,524
- Did Vought tell you all this?
- No. No. A friend told me.

122
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,613
How much did they pay you?

123
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:53,492
- It wasn't about money.
- How much?

124
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:58,497
There was no money.
They just paid for the medical bills, that's it.

125
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,916
I did it because they, they promised

126
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,169
that you'd have a chance at an extraordinary life.

127
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:09,758
To be strong and successful and special.
I mean, who wouldn't want that for their...?

128
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,678
You made me think that I was chosen by God.

129
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,721
You were!

130
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,557
God brought Vought into our lives.
He made this possible.

131
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,392
Bullshit!

132
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,394
You did!

133
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:24,606
And then you controlled every single minute of it.

134
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,775
You woke me up at 5 a.m.

135
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,194
to train for those stupid pageants,

136
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,906
and the tap dancing and the tae kwon do.

137
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,033
I gave up every moment of my life.

138
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,077
And I was happy to do it.

139
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,037
- This was our dream.
- This was your dream!

140
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,624
I never got a chance
to choose my own dreams.

141
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,170
No wonder I don't know who
the fuck I'm supposed to be!

142
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,796
Annie.

143
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,389
Was it really bad investments?

144
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,516
- What?
- You told me that Daddy left

145
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,352
because he lost all of our savings.

146
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,776
He agreed to all of it.

147
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:13,030
And then, one day, he didn't,

148
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,282
so he walked out on us.

149
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,873
Maybe he didn't want to lie to me.

150
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,833
So I'm the monster?

151
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,210
You have a good life.

152
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,963
People would give anything to be what you are.

153
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:33,175
I thought I did what was right.

154
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,221
Annie, Annie.

155
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,516
Annie! Annie!

156
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,268
It's time to knock back some
of this per diem, buddy.

157
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,647
Oh, it's a pretty fancy bottle.

158
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,191
What are we celebrating?

159
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,735
What are you talking about?
The Seven getting called up.

160
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,070
Yeah.

161
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,908
You know the whole reason the Navy discontinued

162
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,786
their sea mammal mine clearance programme?

163
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,039
It's because it cost way too much
to train the fucking dolphins.

164
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,833
Yeah.

165
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,376
But with me onboard,

166
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,837
it's like a pick-up game of basketball.

167
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,925
I've always wanted to lead my own unit, Jeff.

168
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,094
It's like a dream come true for me.

169
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,852
Smells like a comeback.

170
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,813
Anyways...

171
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,232
Cheers, buddy.

172
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,483
So, when?

173
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,736
When, what?

174
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,946
When do I ship out?

175
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,741
Gosh.

176
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,411
You know that water park's
opening up a new splash zone,

177
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,372
and they are real excited
to have you cut that ribbon.

178
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,711
You know, I'm seriously leaving, Jeff.

179
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,004
Fuck Ohio.

180
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,883
Here's the sitch.

181
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,886
I talked to New York.

182
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,889
And... you're not.

183
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,557
So much.

184
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,683
Leaving.

185
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,020
What?

186
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,230
They didn't share details.

187
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,984
But hey, look...

188
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:18,989
the boys in Marketing have
created a primo tag for you:

189
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,200
The Saviour of Sandusky!

190
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,913
That has a nice ring, doesn't it?

191
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,115
William.

192
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,454
What are you looking at out there?

193
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,164
Eastern meadowlarks.

194
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,876
It was either bird-watching or alcoholism, so...

195
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,504
birds.

196
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,715
I thought we agreed that you
were never going to come out here.

197
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,969
Yeah, well, you taught me a thing or two

198
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,596
about broken promises.

199
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,682
Didn't you?

200
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,018
This is Hugh Campbell.

201
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,106
We're working with M.M. and Frenchie.

202
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,857
I got the Boys back together.

203
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,651
Grace Mallory.

204
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,653
I'm the founder of your little club.

205
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,990
- You're...
- So, let me hear it.

206
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,411
I need your help.

207
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,579
Sorry, I can't.

208
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,541
I'm hoping to photograph
a snowy owl in the dunes.

209
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:55,919
Look...

210
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,880
I didn't want to come here,

211
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,134
but I need your help.

212
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,052
And you're going to fucking help.

213
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,430
Why's that?

214
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,148
Because you owe me.

215
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,608
You fucking owe me, goddamn it.

216
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,500
Look at you, mon coeur.

217
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,421
Run! Run!

218
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,909
Who's got eyes on her?

219
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,410
Over here!

220
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,420
Good job.

221
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,924
We won't let her get away.

222
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,514
This is Alpha Team. Suspect is in custody.

223
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,100
There's simply nothing else to say.
I can't help you.

224
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,935
You're gonna have to do better than that.

225
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,105
- Do I? Why?
- Because you made me a promise.

226
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:24,693
But then my grandchildren got incinerated.
Tends to change one's perspective.

227
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,069
There weren't even teeth left,

228
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,114
Lamplighter had burnt them alive so thoroughly.

229
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,784
Well,

230
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,246
I think I've had enough sun for one day.

231
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,708
Pleasure meeting you, Hugh.

232
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,834
Butcher.

233
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,046
Well, what about what you've done?

234
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,089
What I've done?

235
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,925
To who?

236
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,806
To me, goddamn it. To me.

237
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,058
You trained me up, manipulated me,

238
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,519
aimed me at Homelander like a fucking howitzer.

239
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,814
And then when it didn't suit you anymore,
you just threw me away.

240
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,317
And not a day goes by I don't regret it.

241
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,444
Day late, dollar short, love.

242
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,824
Now, I'm going to finish what you started,

243
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,327
and I need your help.

244
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,999
Please.

245
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,633
You can leave with something,

246
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,594
if you never come back

247
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,138
and you keep your goddamn promise this time.

248
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,602
Madelyn Stillwell.

249
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,937
Vought's VP?

250
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,273
- Homelander's her main account.
- Yeah, that ain't news.

251
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,192
No, but this is:

252
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:51,780
They have a... What shall we say?
A very special relationship.

253
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,866
Complicated, intimate, hard to quantify.

254
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,201
And you know this how?

255
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,411
Still have a few fingers in a few pies.

256
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,580
I don't know if Homelander has a weakness,

257
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,750
but if he does, she'll know it.

258
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,466
Goodbye, Grace.

259
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,970
You want to kill yourself, that's your right...

260
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:19,891
I won't stop you, but, Billy, not the others.

261
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,438
Vengeance isn't a path to glory, Hugh.

262
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,732
It's a one-way ticket to a dead end,

263
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,610
looking at fucking birds.

264
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,540
No, go ahead. Sure.

265
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,947
- Dude. Dude, it's A-Train.
- Really?

266
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,243
It's fucking A-Train.

267
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,165
- Can I help you?
- I'm just keeping an eye out.

268
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,421
That's funny, it really looks like
you're only keeping an eye on me.

269
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,674
You know I'm A-Train, right?

270
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,635
Yeah, and I'm Homelander.

271
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,096
Dude, whip back to A-Train.

272
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,435
Listen, I'm sorry about that.

273
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,188
We're good.

274
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:52,692
Wait, so now that you...?
Now you know I'm A-Train, now we're good?

275
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:56,071
Listen, man, I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

276
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,074
Yeah, you're damn right it's your mistake.

277
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,492
I'm A-Train.

278
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:03,411
I'm the fastest fucking man alive!

279
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,792
What are you all fucking looking at?

280
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,675
- You missed it.
- Eyes front.

281
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,220
Eyes fucking front, Hughie.

282
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,805
- Boys are gone.
- What?

283
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,765
Someone's grabbed them.

284
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,475
Oh, yeah? How do you know that?

285
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,104
The window's new, the path is scrubbed,
and there's a black van with "Flowers" on it,

286
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,022
probably full of cunts waiting to jump us.

287
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,441
- Vought?
- Nah, someone else doing

288
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:37,278
their dirty work for them,
probably some fed black ops unit.

289
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,495
Okay. Okay, what are we...?
What are we gonna do?

290
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,205
How are we gonna get the guys back?

291
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,666
We're on our own. We've got to get to Stillwell

292
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,127
- before the walls close in.
- Who gives a fuck?

293
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,837
- We have to go back.
- You don't get it.

294
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,465
We got about a couple hours before they find us,
and that's if we're lucky.

295
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,176
We got to hit back and hit back now.

296
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,678
You're abandoning them.

297
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,722
I mean, they all... They risked their...

298
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,766
Mother's Milk has a daughter.

299
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,352
- They'd want us to finish the job.
- Your job.

300
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,647
Your job, not theirs.

301
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,276
It's all about Homelander, isn't it?

302
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,571
And A-Train. This is your
fucking shit, too, Hughie.

303
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,948
I promised you payback, didn't I?

304
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,285
Mallory give you the same speech
back in the day?

305
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,412
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

306
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,539
But she broke her promise.

307
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,665
I'm keeping mine.

308
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,086
I'm so fucking stupid.

309
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,257
You never cared about me.

310
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,967
Or Robin, did you?

311
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,011
I was just useful to you.

312
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,681
Fuck, Hughie. Of course you're useful.

313
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,434
I mean, that's why you're here, isn't it?

314
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,520
Now we just got to take one more step.

315
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,440
Yeah?

316
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:56,399
Come on.

317
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,736
No.

318
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,905
We have to save them.

319
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:06,409
For fuck's sakes, Hughie, we don't have time
for this shit right now, okay?

320
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,786
We get Stillwell. Now, get in the fucking car.

321
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,996
Then what?

322
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,708
Becca comes back from the dead?
Robin, too?

323
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,419
This is never gonna stop,
it's just gonna be more blood

324
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,254
and... awfulness.

325
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,342
That's the fucking game.

326
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,553
If you don't like to play,
why did you join the fucking team?

327
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,766
Mallory's right, you're just
gonna drag us all down with you.

328
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,852
Not me.

329
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,146
Not anymore.

330
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,944
You're a fucking pathetic cunt

331
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,530
and an insult to Robin's memory.

332
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,075
I think I'm doing this for her.

333
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,498
Goodbye, Hughie.

334
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,875
Fucking idiot.

335
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,505
Stupid fucker.

336
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,599
Fuck.

337
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,019
Idiot.

338
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,072
Fuck.

339
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,450
Stupid fucking idiot.

340
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,339
I remember you telling me
you like to come here to listen

341
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,008
to the choir rehearse,
so I figured I'd take a shot.

342
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,386
You've got a lot of balls.

343
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,512
Just two.

344
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,224
I mean, you must want me to arrest you.

345
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,352
Actually...

346
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:25,733
Annie... I need your help.

347
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,411
- Please just listen to me.
- Why?

348
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,538
More awful secrets you want to tell me,

349
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,790
more drugs that I was dosed
with as a kid, maybe?

350
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,793
That just came out. I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted to know the truth.

351
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,254
Oh, okay, so you're all about the truth.

352
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:50,299
Vought is giving Compound V
to some bad fucking people, like really bad.

353
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,176
Like, that Supe terrorist.

354
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,013
That's insane.

355
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,598
No, it's true.

356
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,059
Look, my friends want to stop it,
but they got caught

357
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,854
on Vought's orders, and I figured,

358
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:06,065
because you had security clearance,

359
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,942
maybe you could help find them.

360
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:14,282
Hughie, I was almost arrested
just for knowing you.

361
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:17,410
I had to convince them that I was an idiot
that you threw out

362
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:21,330
and you used, and now you want me
to help your psycho killer friends?

363
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,166
When you put it like that...

364
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,713
You have 30 seconds to get the hell out of here.

365
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,593
Okay.

366
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,429
I'm sorry to bother you.

367
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:43,936
I mean, why the hell would I ever help you?

368
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,735
Because Vought's up to some evil shit?

369
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,031
Because it's your job.

370
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,243
Because you're a superhero.

371
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,995
Really?

372
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:07,376
I can't remember the last time I saved anyone.

373
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,961
You saved me.

374
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,172
When did I ever save you?

375
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,468
Bowling alley.

376
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,722
What are you talking about?

377
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,854
I was angry after Robin.

378
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:31,818
I was headed for this cliff,
and then you and me went bowling.

379
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,071
Bowling?

380
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,405
Yeah.

381
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,825
Bowling.

382
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,035
That's it.

383
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:45,081
That's not saving you, that's just being there.

384
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,590
The thing is...

385
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,768
I don't care.

386
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,924
Hey!

387
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,385
What the hell are you doing?

388
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:43,055
Doc said six weeks minimum
after a fracture like that.

389
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,432
I'm all good, man.

390
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,850
Look, I'm back to training.

391
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,144
I feel fucking great.

392
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,979
- You're healed?
- I'm healed.

393
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,606
How the fuck are you...?

394
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,693
You back on that Compound V.

395
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,195
You promised me that you would stay clean.

396
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,281
No. I am clean.

397
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,700
A-1, all-natural A-Train, baby.

398
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:06,037
Your fucking bones fused back
together overnight?

399
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,539
- That sound natural to you?
- Maybe I'm just strong.

400
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:12,251
- Oh, yeah.
- I am the world's fastest man.

401
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,882
Bet you can't outrun this.

402
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,384
Hey. Wait, hey, where you going?

403
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:23,846
I'm not gonna sit here and
watch you kill yourself.

404
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:28,100
You know what? I don't need this shit.

405
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:32,396
You've always just been jealous of me,
so go ahead, slow-ass fucking loser.

406
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:12,853
I'm just, yeah, I'm just gonna...

407
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,536
- There he is!
- Our hero.

408
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,331
Stop it.

409
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:34,000
Stop, please.

410
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,303
Amazing. Great job, everybody.

411
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,180
- You're gonna make me blush here.
- Madelyn?

412
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,517
- Stop, please.
- Mr Edgar.

413
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,436
I didn't know you were gonna come.

414
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,146
Let me borrow you for a moment.

415
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,871
The Pentagon's shelling out
north of $40 billion per year.

416
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,623
You should enjoy a bonus that reflects that.

417
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,376
I don't know what to say.

418
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,086
Well, say thank you.

419
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,714
Thank you.

420
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,132
Don't get too excited.

421
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,717
It comes with strings.

422
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,219
You're gonna need to move
your office down to 82.

423
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,596
- That's your floor.
- And...

424
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,599
I'm gonna want you to start
riding shotgun on my meetings.

425
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,434
Hey, don't go planning my retirement yet.

426
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:38,189
I'm just saying, someone needs to run
this shit show when I move to Belize.

427
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,149
Enjoy yourself, Madelyn.

428
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,110
Start thinking about the view from 82.

429
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,614
Thank you.

430
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:01,253
Electricity goes in, blast comes out.

431
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,968
That's a hell of a party trick.

432
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:11,138
Do you ever use it for fun?

433
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,141
Can I tell you a secret?

434
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:19,105
Sometimes, my eyes light up when I...

435
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:21,398
you know.

436
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,782
Will you excuse me?

437
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,826
Just a second.

438
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,218
You want me to hold your hair back?

439
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,137
Don't touch.

440
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,307
Leave me alone, I'm not in the mood.

441
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,143
Not in the mood for what?

442
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,897
Your bottomless casual cruelty.

443
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:05,109
So just make whatever shitty comment
you're gonna make and then go.

444
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,243
Look.

445
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,998
What am I supposed to be looking at?

446
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:23,127
No... my radius never healed straight.

447
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,175
I really did break every bone in my right arm.

448
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,927
- What?
- Stopping the bus from falling.

449
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,513
You said the Marketing guys made it up.

450
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,558
It was me.

451
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,145
Twenty-three-year-old, bright-eyed,

452
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,814
ass you could bounce a quarter off of...

453
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:45,149
me.

454
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,072
I really did want to make a difference.

455
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,325
I really did care.

456
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:57,203
I was just like you.

457
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,748
And then...

458
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,375
I started giving pieces of myself away...

459
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,588
and I guess I gave away everything.

460
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,056
So you know what? Be...

461
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,017
Just be original.

462
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,310
For fuck's sake.

463
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,814
My position is already taken.

464
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,864
Be the annoying goody two-shoes
asshole that you are.

465
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,994
One of us has to be.

466
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,777
You've been avoiding me.

467
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,697
- No, I haven't.
- Really?

468
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,156
Seems that way.

469
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,495
You do know that I went to see Vogelbaum,
though...

470
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:22,955
right?

471
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,126
And you do know what he told me?

472
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,878
I never meant for you to find out that way.

473
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,923
Let me guess.
You wanted to protect me.

474
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,009
Well, we all did.

475
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,677
Of course.

476
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,638
You think I'm fragile?

477
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,348
No, I do not.

478
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:43,100
You try doing any of this...

479
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:47,271
I mean fucking any of it.
...without me.

480
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,524
I couldn't.

481
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,860
Madelyn.

482
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,073
Did it ever occur to you...

483
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,451
that a Supe terrorist showing up

484
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:03,329
exactly when we needed him to was...

485
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:07,082
a pretty fucking incredible coincidence?

486
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,670
It's almost like...

487
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:13,464
someone planned it.

488
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,513
Me.

489
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,184
Me.

490
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,644
I made him.

491
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:31,273
What do you mean you "made him"?

492
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:34,485
Well, I borrowed some Compound V,

493
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:37,571
had A-Train run it all over the globe,

494
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:40,491
and I supercharged some jihadis.

495
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,204
Not to oversimplify it.

496
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:49,875
I mean, it was actually very difficult
and very messy, using adult subjects.

497
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,212
There's a good reason that Vought doesn't do it.

498
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:58,634
But... well, enough survived
to call the operation a huge success.

499
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,845
Huge.

500
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,806
And now...

501
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:08,977
we have villains all over the globe...

502
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,106
that only we can fight.

503
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:16,402
In sequel after sequel...

504
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,570
after sequel.

505
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:24,827
Well?

506
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,832
Say something.

507
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,397
No.

508
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,694
Take off your pants.

509
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,712
Sit down.

510
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:44,281
- Gentle.
- I'm...

511
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,993
No.

512
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,711
Oh, my sweet boy.

513
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,174
My special, special, sweet boy.

514
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,845
I'm gonna take care of you.

515
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,103
I'm sorry.

516
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,356
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

517
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,691
- No, you did good.
- I'm sorry.

518
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,068
Oh, my boy.

519
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,571
I'm proud of you.

520
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,907
That was so lovely.

521
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,829
Well, you know, in mediaeval times,

522
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,874
they locked prisoners inside a pillory barrel.

523
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:41,421
Then they'd kneel in their own excrement
till they got sepsis and died, so...

524
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:45,217
Thank you, Frenchie,

525
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,762
for that disgusting
yet fascinating piece of trivia.

526
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,889
I'm just saying it could be worse, huh?

527
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,474
Right.

528
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,108
Why didn't you tell us?

529
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,609
Tell you what?

530
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,404
That you had a daughter.

531
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,076
I don't know.

532
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,996
I mean...

533
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,082
I guess she's...

534
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,712
the only good thing I ever did, man.

535
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,009
I just wanted just to leave her
clean out of it, you know?

536
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,929
But I fucked that up to high heaven.

537
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:34,933
Probably never see her again.

538
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,768
I understand.

539
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,398
She made you a better person.

540
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,405
Hey, man.

541
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,492
Kimiko's gonna be okay.

542
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:56,079
So you do know her name.

543
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:59,458
Do you like that?

544
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,044
No.

545
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:13,347
Mr Edgar came to the party tonight
and he practically offered me his job.

546
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,892
Well, not right away. But he...

547
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,520
wants me to move to the 82nd floor
so that I can be closer to him.

548
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,397
Really?

549
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,192
Okay, but you'll still be my day-to-day, right?

550
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:29,279
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Of course.

551
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:32,866
I will be there for you always.

552
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,493
Okay, good.

553
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,163
Good.

554
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,709
Madelyn.

555
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:45,962
From now on, no more secrets.

556
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,468
- Promise me.
- I promise.

557
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:53,762
No more secrets.

558
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,682
Okay.

559
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,939
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about your baby.

560
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,025
It's just that...

561
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,986
you carry so much...

562
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,449
and the pain of losing a child to...

563
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,785
miscarriage is...

564
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:21,581
I just wanted to spare you that burden.

565
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,959
Do you understand?

566
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,627
Yes.

567
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,114
What the fuck?

568
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,084
Hey, easy with him, man.

569
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:08,879
Fuck wrong with you? Shit.

570
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,383
- Bitch ass.
- You okay? You break any bones?

571
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:14,593
- No, no. No.
- No?

572
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:15,969
Did they get Butcher, too?

573
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,096
- No.
- They got you separated?

574
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,765
When? When?

575
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:20,974
Well...

576
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,059
he went after Homelander.

577
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,352
But I...

578
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,646
I came to save you.

579
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,986
So, you came here?
You meant to come here?

580
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,780
- Without Butcher.
- Yeah.

581
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,207
Never has a man thrown his life away

582
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,834
so completely
like you've thrown yours away today.

583
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:48,752
No...

584
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:52,297
no, what I mean is, you rescuing us

585
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,674
is the most useless,
futile gesture I can think of.

586
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,593
- Yeah, I got it.
- Unbelievable.

587
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:59,221
- All right, so what's the plan?
- Okay.

588
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,432
All right, so they searched me.

589
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:04,476
Very, very thoroughly.

590
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,270
But I managed to Poligrip
in my 12th grade retainer.

591
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,314
- Let me see.
- It looks like a permanent bridge,

592
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,816
- and it totally worked.
- Shit.

593
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:13,318
Frenchie, you can pick a lock
with anything, right?

594
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,111
There's premium metal wire
in this thing.

595
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,447
- Come on, take it out.
- Okay, one second.

596
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,242
Come on, man. Spit that bitch out.

597
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,410
It's stuck.

598
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,162
- Okay, okay, stand still.
- Wait, what?

599
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:25,664
- Stand still. Open.
- What...?

600
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:26,623
Open the mouth.

601
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,793
Come on, get up in there, Frenchie.

602
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,505
Just go deeper. Just a little deeper.

603
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,799
All right, all right, all right, hold...

604
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,008
What the fuck, man?

605
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:39,553
Let me get this. Let me get this.

606
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:40,762
Relax, okay?

607
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:43,932
- Look. Look, focus. Focus.
- Okay, okay. What?

608
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,352
- I'm gonna knock that bitch out your mouth. Okay?
- We're not at that step yet.

609
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,522
- We don't have to do that.
- It's just gonna sting a little bit. All right?

610
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:51,565
- Sting?
- On three.

611
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,400
- One to three.
- Okay, if you count down...

612
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:55,902
You all right?

613
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,946
You okay, buddy?

614
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,155
- Yes.
- Yes!

615
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:01,241
Good job, Hughie.

616
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,640
Good night, Ms Stillwell.

617
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,392
Good night, Miles.

618
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:30,562
Maria.

619
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:36,651
Maria, I'm home.

620
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:41,197
Maria?

621
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:43,825
Your kid's a sound sleeper.

622
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,752
Don't worry.

623
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,420
He's all right.

624
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:57,464
So is the nanny.

625
00:45:57,547 --> 00:46:00,342
She's out the back sleeping off
a little bit of propofol.

626
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,889
Put your phone on the table.

627
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,281
William Butcher.

628
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:28,036
CIA showed me your file.

629
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,915
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

630
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,376
I don't know how breaking into my home

631
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:37,462
and threatening my child
is gonna get you Homelander.

632
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,755
All these years...

633
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,174
I've been searching
for that cunt's weakness.

634
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,176
He doesn't have any weakness.

635
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,679
- No?
- There isn't a weapon on Earth

636
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:47,806
that they haven't thrown at him.

637
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,265
They've all failed.

638
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,518
That's not what I'm talking about.

639
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:56,940
I'm talking... about you.

640
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,400
Me?

641
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,653
Yeah, you're the only thing
he gives two shits about.

642
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,823
You're his weakness.

643
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,541
It's a fucking maze.

644
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:16,459
Where is she?

645
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,675
Ready... go on.

646
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:32,976
Mon coeur.

647
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,937
Frenchie, what the fuck?

648
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:54,748
Fuck! Move. Move.

649
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,802
Fuck.

650
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,601
- No! God.
- Just stay down.

651
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,819
Oh, fuck.

652
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:28,073
She better be fucking worth it.

653
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:29,157
Wait, what?

654
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,034
- You cover him. Cover him!
- Wait, what?

655
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,410
No, I don't... I can't do this.

656
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:36,831
- You just pull the fucking trigger right now!
- Okay!

657
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:38,541
Sorry! I'm sorry!

658
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,296
Shit, it's out, it's out. What do I do?

659
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,548
Take this. Take it.

660
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,884
- Reload.
- What the fuck do I know about reloading?

661
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:50,720
- Reload the magazine.
- How do I do that? Okay.

662
00:48:50,804 --> 00:48:52,514
- Let's go.
- Good? It's good.

663
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,981
M.M.! M.M.!

664
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,363
M.M.!

665
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:11,449
Go!

666
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,757
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

667
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:29,259
I'm out.

668
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:33,805
- Oh, shit.
- Drop your weapon!

669
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,348
- Okay, okay, okay.
- On your knees.

670
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:37,142
- Don't shoot.
- On your fucking knees!

671
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:39,644
Face the wall!

672
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,563
Hands on your heads!

673
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,526
You came.

674
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:33,531
Like you said...

675
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:37,368
I'm a fucking superhero.

676
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:42,665
Come on.

677
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:44,334
Hughie, check the doors.

678
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,503
Is it working?

679
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:49,797
- No, no, no.
- Fuck.

680
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,966
Try this.

681
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,885
Yes.

682
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,514
- Son of a...
- Go, go, go.

683
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:01,935
- Go. Go, go, go.
- Holy shit.

684
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,356
Oh, shit. Go.

685
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,983
- Hughie, let's go.
- Go! I'll be okay. Go.

686
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,618
Homelander was right.

687
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,287
You are a fucking rat.

688
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:27,001
Oh, and you're the jailbreaker?

689
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:29,045
Are you fucking kidding me?

690
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,590
Turn around and walk away, A-Train.

691
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,971
- I got this. Go.
- No. I'm the one he wants.

692
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:40,223
I'm not leaving you.

693
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,360
Please, just go.

694
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:55,882
Hughie!

695
00:52:56,966 --> 00:53:00,178
You killed the only person I've ever loved.

696
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,014
I didn't kill her.

697
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:09,604
I know.

698
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:12,648
I did.

699
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,910
But it was your fault.

700
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:48,935
Holy shit.

701
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:50,686
What? What?

702
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:54,899
I think he's having a heart attack.

703
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:04,534
Oh, fuck.

704
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,327
All right.

705
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:13,000
One, two, three.

706
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,628
Call an ambulance.

707
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:16,546
One...

708
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:19,215
He'll never stop coming for you.

709
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:21,384
I know.

710
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:28,474
This is Starlight.

711
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:31,811
I have a code 78-65. A-Train is down.

712
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:34,230
I think he's had a heart attack.

713
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,901
You have to go. I'll take over.

714
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:41,904
Hughie, go!

715
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:43,948
Or else you'll get caught.

716
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:27,909
Well, well, well.

717
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:31,329
About fucking time.

718
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,833
I know you can see through the ceiling.

719
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,045
You try to kill me...

720
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:43,382
and my trigger finger goes soft.

721
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:48,846
Now... why don't you stop playing rapey Santa...

722
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:51,974
and come down and join us?

723
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:00,233
Take it easy.

724
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:02,985
We don't want to upset Teddy, right?

725
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:04,362
What are you doing?

726
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:06,364
Hey, look. Mommy.

727
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,783
- You all right? Madelyn...
- No.

728
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,577
- Take him upstairs.
- All good. I got it.

729
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:13,704
I got it.

730
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:22,004
Billy Butcher.

731
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,424
You don't mind if I call you Billy, right?

732
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:27,760
You are pretty darn impressive.

733
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:31,681
I mean, especially for, you know, one of you.

734
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:35,518
See, even now, most people
standing where you are

735
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:38,604
would be pissing their pants terrified, but you...

736
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:43,901
Sure, your heart's pounding,
but you're not afraid.

737
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,238
It's anger.

738
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,573
That's a new one for me.

739
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:52,118
Homelander, will you please
take the baby upstairs?

740
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:56,163
All because of your lovely wife Becca.

741
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,457
Right?

742
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:00,001
Okay. Let's cut the bullshit, huh?

743
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,003
You know that we...

744
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,840
Bro, not my fault, okay?

745
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,843
- She came on to me. It happens.
- Will you stop?

746
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:12,430
You know, it's the fame. They get crushes.
There's nothing I can do about it.

747
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:15,683
But what I will tell you is,
she was a hell of a lay.

748
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:19,353
She came three times, eh?

749
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:20,688
Three times.

750
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:24,692
All right, little man, have a little lie-down.
Good boy.

751
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,485
I want you to take him out of here.

752
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,404
There you go.

753
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:35,244
But that's not really it.

754
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:36,621
No, no, no.

755
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:40,625
No, it's more than just that.

756
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,923
You think I'm responsible
for her death, don't you?

757
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:54,722
So now you have a hostage
that I care about, right?

758
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,807
Someone I love.

759
00:57:56,891 --> 00:58:01,354
So, what's your plan... from here?

760
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:02,521
What do you want?

761
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:05,149
Do you want a confession, or...?

762
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:06,692
What's your endgame?

763
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,242
I'm just gonna hurt you.

764
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,913
I mean really fucking hurt you,

765
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,917
and that will be good enough for me.

766
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,587
So, you don't really want anything, per se?

767
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:29,632
You just... You want to blow her
up in front of me.

768
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,676
Right?

769
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,970
Wow, fuck.

770
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:43,854
You are dark, and I kind of like it.

771
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:46,232
Will you please take Teddy upstairs?

772
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,942
It's okay.

773
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,405
Just answer one question for me.

774
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:53,781
Just one.

775
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:57,118
How do you know?

776
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,746
How do you know?

777
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:04,208
I mean, you must have
some rock-solid proof, right?

778
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:08,003
That it was actually me who killed your wife.

779
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:11,966
You must have that, right? So what is it?

780
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,969
Share. We're all very interested.

781
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:20,182
Now's not the time to be strong and silent.

782
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:21,267
Go for it.

783
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:28,190
Are you telling me that this whole thing

784
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:32,611
is based on fucking feelings?

785
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:33,988
- On a hunch?
- Will you please

786
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,948
- take him upstairs?
- A little bit... Hold on.

787
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:39,368
- Take him upstairs!
- Shut the fuck up!

788
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:44,999
Excuse me.

789
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:50,671
You promised me no more lies.

790
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:53,841
You fucking promised me.

791
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,971
You and Vogelbaum should have
got your stories straight.

792
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,182
They were so close.

793
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:06,979
So fucking close, but there was a few
little details that were different.

794
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:09,607
So I went back to Vogelbaum,

795
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:13,277
and I managed to squeeze the truth out of him.

796
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,446
The real truth.

797
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:22,036
Yes, that's it.

798
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:32,004
I'm so sorry.

799
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,799
I should never have lied to you.

800
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:38,844
I know now that you don't need
to be protected.

801
01:00:38,928 --> 01:00:41,096
I'm so sorry.

802
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,933
Will you please take Teddy upstairs?

803
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:49,522
Did you ever really care about me?

804
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,774
You mean everything to me.

805
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,776
No.

806
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:54,777
No, no.

807
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,947
I mean everything to your job.

808
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,575
You care more about that fucking baby

809
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:02,910
- than you do about me.
- No.

810
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,329
I love you.

811
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,289
I love you. I love you. I swear I love you.

812
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:08,833
But?

813
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:14,713
Tell me the truth, or I walk out right now.

814
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:20,594
I'm scared.

815
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:24,014
I'm scared of you.

816
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:27,560
What?

817
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,436
I said I'm scared.

818
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,314
- Of?
- Of you.

819
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:35,192
I'm scared of you.

820
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:37,069
Thank you.

821
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:41,782
Thank you for finally being honest.

822
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,584
Now...

823
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:38,881
what was that plan again?

824
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,426
Oh, well...

825
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:08,786
Wakey, wakey.

826
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,664
Hey, buddy.

827
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:13,290
You were out for quite a while.

828
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:16,877
You can thank me
for saving you sometime later,

829
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,545
but, for now,

830
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:19,964
time to get up.

831
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,423
Come on. You're gonna love this.

832
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:23,217
Come on.

833
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:29,515
Mom!

834
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:32,518
Wow, look at this handsome devil.

835
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,980
Hey, pal.

836
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:38,607
You know who I am?

837
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:40,067
Homelander.

838
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:42,778
Yeah, that's right...

839
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:47,282
but you know who else?

840
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:48,450
No.

841
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,292
Becca?

842
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:58,919
What?

843
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:01,005
Mommy didn't tell you.

844
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:04,591
Well...

845
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,180
I'm your father,

846
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:15,477
and we are a family.
