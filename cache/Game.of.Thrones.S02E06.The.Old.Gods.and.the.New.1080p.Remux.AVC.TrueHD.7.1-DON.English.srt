00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,198
We could do the same.

164
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,533
No, we couldn't.

165
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,952
This is their country.

166
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,830
They know where to walk, where not to walk.

167
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:06,708
I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse
they didn't see till they were in it.

168
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,838
My father always said I'm of the North.

169
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:11,922
(CHUCKLES)

170
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,259
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

171
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,512
This look like home to you?

172
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,182
You start thinking you know this place,
it will kill you.

173
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,935
You understand me?

174
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,271
No, you don't.

175
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,398
We're at war.

176
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,441
We've always been at war.

177
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,069
It's never going to end
'cause we're not fighting an enemy.

178
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,614
We're fighting the North,
and it's not going anywhere.

179
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,450
The Watch has given you a great gift.

180
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,537
You only have one thing to give in return,

181
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,580
your life.

182
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,625
- I'll gladly give my life.
- I don't want you to be glad about it.

183
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,546
I want you to curse and fight
until your heart's done pumping.

184
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,257
And know this, boy.

185
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,760
Your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

186
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,179
They'll never know what you've done.

187
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:05,183
They'll never know how you died.
They won't even know your damn name.

188
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,061
But they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

189
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,647
north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.

190
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,484
Now, do you understand me?

191
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,778
I do.

192
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,614
You're even dumber than you look.

193
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,242
It's just words, boy,

194
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,119
to keep us a little warmer in the night.

195
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,289
Make us feel like we've got a purpose.

196
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,457
(LAUGHS)

197
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,750
Come on.

198
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,420
We've got to find these goat fuckers
before night falls and they find us.

199
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,976
- TYWIN: Can you read?
- My lord?

200
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,854
Can you read?

201
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,277
This letter detailing our infantry movements

202
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,863
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

203
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,700
It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.

204
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,577
My apologies, my lord. I must have...

205
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:09,039
Girl, fetch me the History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses.

206
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,999
It's the one on this...

207
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,084
(CHUCKLES)

208
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,714
My cupbearer can read better than you.

209
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,268
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

210
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,690
My lord, I...

211
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,484
To the Starks of Winterfell!

212
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,738
Who have 20,000 men and my son!

213
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,953
I judged you might be good for something
more than brutalizing peasants.

214
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,288
I see I overestimated you.

215
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:55,335
If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll...

216
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,754
Leave us.

217
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,347
Put the book away, girl.

Maybe you should devise our next battle plan
while you're about it.

(DOOR OPENS)

223
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,407
Lord Petyr Baelish.

224
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,491
Mmm.

225
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,286
Give us the room.

226
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,378
Clear all this.

(DOOR CLOSING)

229
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,676
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

230
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,312
- Wine?
- Thank you.

231
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,192
What news from the capital?

232
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,653
I traveled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

233
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,739
Ah, the late King Renly.

234
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,366
Rather a short reign.

235
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,285
Murdered by a woman, I hear.

236
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,287
So they say.

237
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,084
There has been talk of other forces at work.

238
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,503
Dark forces.

239
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,214
Here.

240
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,217
(SCOFFS)

241
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,096
Men love to blame demons
when their grand plans unravel.

242
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,186
It is my belief that a moment of chaos
affords opportunities lost soon after.

243
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,689
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

244
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,775
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

245
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,778
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

246
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,615
After the Lannisters and the Starks,
the Tyrells command the largest host.

247
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,784
Their lands are the most fertile
in the Seven Kingdoms,

248
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,830
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

249
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:58,333
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

250
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,963
Loras wants revenge.
He blames Stannis for Renly's death.

251
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,215
And Margaery...

252
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,175
Wants to be queen.

253
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,302
Yes, she does.

254
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,516
House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne.

255
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,978
- Against my grandson.
- They did.

256
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,481
And perhaps that treason should be punished

257
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,191
one day,

258
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:26,528
after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.

259
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,074
More wine for Lord Baelish.

260
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,834
If you will allow me to
represent your family's interests,

261
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,336
I believe that an advantageous agreement...

262
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,881
The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?

263
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,340
They have.

264
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,675
(GASPS)

265
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,510
Pardon, my lord.

266
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,262
It's only wine.

267
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,640
You would ride there yourself?

268
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,475
Tonight, with your leave.

269
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,311
I'll have an answer by nightfall.

270
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,979
That'll be all, girl.

271
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,778
And what else?

272
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,697
On your son Tyrion's directive,

273
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,824
I met with Catelyn Stark.

274
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,868
Why?

275
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:19,164
He had an interesting proposal for her
concerning her daughters.

276
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,290
Hmm.

277
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,278

280
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,592
- A girl.
- A wildling.

281
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,595
We could question her.

282
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,806
You could.

283
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,140
She won't answer.

284
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,936
I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue
instead of talking.

285
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,940
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

286
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,068
She was reaching for this ax
when you got to her.

287
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,654
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

288
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,865
I gave you my name.

289
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:38,827
I'm Jon Snow.

290
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,212
You ought to burn them you killed.

QHORIN: We'd need a big fire for that.

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,718
Tell me, Ygritte.

293
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,512
Why do you want us to build a big fire?

294
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,640
Are there some more friends in the area?

295
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,060
Burn them or maybe
you'll need those swords again.

296
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,813
Our boy here's already killed one dead man.

297
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,274
He can do it again if he has to.

298
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,609
What waits beyond the pass?

299
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,737
- The free folk.
- How many?

Tell me true.

If your people captured me,

310
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,319
would they take me prisoner?

311
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,448
They'd take your head off your shoulders
if they was feeling kind.

312
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,076
If not, they'd kill you slow.

00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:10,786
(LAUGHING)

491
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,374
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

492
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,751
I'll have them flogged in the square.

493
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,211
Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host,

494
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,797
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

495
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,383
Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.

496
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,721
So, my little princess, what is it you want?

497
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,264
My birthright.

498
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,141
The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

499
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,102
I fear I'm no better
than a servant in this regard.

500
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,188
I cannot give you what I do not have.

501
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,940
I'm not asking you for the kingdoms.

502
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,525
I'm asking you for ships.

503
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,110
I need to cross the Narrow Sea.

504
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,945
I need my ships as well.

505
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,616
I use them, you see,
to bring spices from one port to another.

506
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,618
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid

507
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,162
three times over
when I retake the Iron Throne.

508
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,288
Retake?

509
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,083
Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?

510
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,835
My father sat there, before he was murdered.

511
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,254
But if you did not sit on it yourself,

512
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:05,674
would it not be correct
to say "take the Iron Throne"?

513
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,927
I didn't come here to argue grammar.

514
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,513
Of course not. You came to take my ships.

515
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,767
So let me explain my position, little princess.

516
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,021
Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.

517
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,773
I make my living by trade.

518
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,734
And I judge every trade on its merits.

519
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,903
You ask for ships.

520
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,739
You say I shall be repaid triple.

521
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,784
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

522
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,120
But before you repay your debts,

523
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,539
you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.

524
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,958
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

525
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,584
You do not have an army.

526
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,337
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

527
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,297
There are many there that support my claim.

528
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:46,423
When were you there last?

529
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,343
I left when I was a baby.

530
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,179
So, in truth, you have no allies.

531
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,684
The people will rise to fight for
their rightful queen when I return.

532
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,893
Ah.

533
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,312
Forgive me, little princess,

534
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:03,899
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

535
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:05,401
Now if you'll pardon me.

536
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,070
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

537
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,906
Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.

538
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,243
For my wedding, he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

539
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,165
He believed... The world believed
that the ages had turned them to stone.

540
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,668
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

541
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,504
But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs

542
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,923
into a great fire, they would hatch.

543
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,344
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

544
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,139
But when the fire burned out,

545
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,057
I was unhurt,

546
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,393
the Mother of Dragons.

547
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,190
Do you understand?

548
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,486
I'm no ordinary woman.

549
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,489
My dreams come true.

550
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,622
I admire your passion.

551
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,460
But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.

552
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:07,046
I'm sorry, little princess.

553
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,839
I am not your little princess.

554
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:12,343
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of Old Valyria,

555
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,220
and I will take what is mine.

556
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,680
With fire and blood, I will take it.

557
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:20,434
Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.

558
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,455
Who taught you to read?

559
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,666
My father, my lord.

560
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,750
Hmm.

561
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,170
I taught my son Jaime to read.

562
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:54,510
The maester came to me one day,
told me he wasn't learning.

563
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,304
He couldn't make sense of the letters.

564
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,807
He reversed them in his head.

565
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,978
The maester said he'd heard tell
of this affliction

566
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,230
and that we simply must accept it.

567
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,314
Ha!

568
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:14,321
After that, I sat Jaime down
for four hours every day until he learned.

569
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:18,367
He hated me for it, for a time.

570
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,453
For a long time.

571
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,039
But he learned.

572
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,458
Hmm.

573
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,630
Where is your father? Is he alive?

574
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,427
Who was he?

575
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,179
A stonemason.

576
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,515
A stonemason who could read?

577
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,641
Hmm.

578
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:43,851
He taught himself.

579
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,520
Quite a man.

580
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,398
What killed him?

581
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,152
Loyalty.

582
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,239
You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?

583
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,119
Did...

584
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,874
Forgive me, my lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

585
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:09,585
No.

586
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,588
But you've already begun.

587
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,633
Did you know your father, my lord?

588
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,428
I did.

589
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,057
I grew up with him.

590
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,436
I watched him grow old.

591
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,358
He loved us.

592
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,610
He was a good man,

593
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,738
but a weak man.

594
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:41,617
A weak man who nearly destroyed
our house and name.

595
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,537
I'm cold.

596
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,749
I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.

597
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:49,875
Mmm.

- Lord Tywin sent me.

What might this be?

Lord Tywin gave it to me.

What for?

607
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,381
To take to the armory.

608

Why would he do that?

Westerosi customs are
still a bit foreign to me.

It's hard to keep all the rules straight.

633

But if I remember my lessons,

634
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:58,438
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady.

Unless she's a queen or a princess.

I could find someone who knows.

Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

638
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,281
Because it's obvious.

639

sold lace on the Long Bridge,

655
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:08,634
Mother.

656
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,893
Mother, this is Lady Talisa.

657
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,270
She's been helping with the wounded.

658
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:22,981
She's been very helpful.

659
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,234
- Lady Talisa.
- Lady Stark.

660
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,695
Lady Talisa...

661
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:31,073
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

662
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,868
Forgive me, I do not know this name.

663
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,788
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

664
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,333
Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace.

665
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,511
I've missed you.

666
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,972
Yes, you look positively forlorn.

667
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,100
You surprised me, that's all.

668
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,561
I didn't think I'd see you today.

669
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,523
I wish that you were free to follow your heart.

670
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,024
I know.

671
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:08,735
You have inherited
your father's responsibilities.

672
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,738
I'm afraid they come at a cost.

673
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:14,950
- You are promised to another.
- I know.

674
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,245
A debt that must be paid.

675
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:23,250
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace. My lady.

676
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,377

679

I can tell you which way to go.

680
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,064
We'll stop here.

681
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,983
Too dark to go any farther today.

682
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,610
Here? There's no shelter here.

683
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:52,070
There's no shelter anywhere.

684
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,740
There is...
if you know where to look.

685
00:42:58,452 --> 00:43:00,203
The cold could kill us both.

686
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,497
- If you light a fire...
- No fire.

687
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,708
- But a fire is...
- No fire.

688
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,421
Have it your way.

689
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,514
We'll stay warmer if we stay close.

690
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,227
Bet you freeze to death before I do.

691
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,980
Bet your life.

692
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:54,883
Think they're out looking for you?

693
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,428
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

694
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,348
Yes.

695
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,560
You're brave.

696
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,396
Stupid,

697
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,357

We start again at first light. Get some sleep.

699
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,506
Stop moving.

700
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,424
I'm just trying to get comfortable.

701
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:39,427
Stop it!

702
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,192
- You're still moving.
- Was I?

703
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,112
I didn't notice that time.

704
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:10,542
This cannot be true.

705
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,711
We've had ravens from White Harbor,

706
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,754
Barrowton and the Dreadfort.

707
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,131
I'm afraid it is true.

708
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:19,050
Why? Why would Theon...

709
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:21,511
Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.

710
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:25,056
- My brothers?
- We've heard nothing of them.

711

(SIGHS)

712
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,977
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

713
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,981
I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!

714
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,236
I must go north at once.

715
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,030
There's still a war to win, Your Grace.

716
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:43,199
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

717
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:46,119
- How can I ask men to follow me if I can't...
- You are a king.

718
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:49,039
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

719
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,874
Let me go and talk to Theon.

720
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,918
There will be no talk. He will die for this.

721
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,213
Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.

722
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,883
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

723
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,929
He can raise a few hundred men and retake
Winterfell before the new moon.

724
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:06,640
We have the Lannisters on the run.

725
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:10,936
If you march all the way back north now,
you'll lose what you gained.

726
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,231
My boy would be honored
to bring you Prince Theon's head.

727
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,819
Tell your son Bran and
Rickon's safety is paramount.

728
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,656
And Theon, I want him brought to me alive.

729
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:27,202
I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.

730
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,454
And then I'll take his head myself.

731
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:33,458
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

732
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,001
I'm no liar.

733
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,674
All wildlings are liars and savages
with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

734
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,717
I done what I had to do to stay alive.

735
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:46,262
I hate the Starks as well as you do.

736
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:47,931
Let me serve you, my lord.

737
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,601
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

738
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,229
There are other ways to serve, my lord.

739
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:59,734
- I'm a prince now, and you'd do well...
- There are other ways to serve, my prince.

I always wondered what you had under there.

751
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:50,994
It comes at a price.

752
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:53,121
I'm not killing you. That's your price.

753
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,664
I already had that.

754
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,168
What do you want then,

755
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,836
other than your miserable life?

756
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:02,464
What all free people want.

757
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,340
My freedom.

758
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,639
Well, you shall have it, then.

759
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,186
But only if you serve me well.

760
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,152
- Ow!
- Shh.

761
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,197
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

762
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,407
They thought so, too.

763
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:31,576
He hated me, the man who hit me.

764
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,995
I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.

765

He never met me before,
but he wanted to hurt me.

766
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:42,087
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger...

You are everything he will never have.

I would have given them bread if I had it.
