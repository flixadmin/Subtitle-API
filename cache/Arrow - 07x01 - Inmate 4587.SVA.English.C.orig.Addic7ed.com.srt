1
00:00:01,453 --> 00:00:03,148
Last season on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:05,078
This is my city!

3
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:06,629
You want to stop me,

4
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,215
you're gonna have to kill me!

5
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,207
No!

6
00:00:10,786 --> 00:00:13,192
So far Ricardo Diaz
has been unstoppable.

7
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,929
You want my help? I'm gonna
need two things from you.

8
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,083
- Mr. Queen, it's time.
- What is she talking about?

9
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,479
I thought you said we had immunity!

10
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:22,515
You do, but only if Oliver
agreed to turn himself in.

11
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:25,256
There is still work to be done.

12
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,234
I am the Green Arrow.

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,921
- William, run!
- I can't run anymore.

14
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:46,068
Yes, you can! Get up. Get up.

15
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:48,059
Oliver, help!

16
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:49,739
Oliver can't help you.

17
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,508
Run now! Now!

18
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:55,161
You're brave.

19
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:58,557
Oliver Queen took everything from me.

20
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:11,835
I'm gonna enjoy taking
everything from him.

21
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,097
Morning, 4587.

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,575
Beautiful day.

23
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:47,031
Watch it, Arrow.

24
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:24,134
You're not gonna eat that, are you?

25
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:50,085
Lights out!

26
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,623
Morning, 4587.

27
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,140
Beautiful day.

28
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:10,203

29
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,644
You... you're the Green Arrow.

30
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,980
Wrong guy.

31
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:28,132
But I saw you on TV.

32
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:29,624
That beard threw me off a little bit,

33
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,067
but... it's definitely you.

34
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,702
I'm a big fan.

35
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:34,279
"You have failed this city."

36
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,257
Okay, I'm not that
person anymore, all right?

37
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:43,332
Look, I'll join whatever gang you're in.

38
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,048
I don't care what I have to do.

39
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,791
I just... I need your protection.

40
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,477
I'm not in a gang.

41
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,837
Then let me be your, uh, sidekick

42
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,839
or your lookout or something. Please.

43
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:55,133
Just... I...

44
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,801
How am I supposed to survive in here?

45
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:01,156
I don't know. Leave me alone.

46
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,821
What the hell?

47
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:54,192
I told you this wasn't over, didn't I?

48
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,069
We waited a long time for this.

49
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:58,881
Revenge is a bitch.

50
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,492
We don't have to do this.

51
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:01,758
But we want to.

52
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,530
Break it up! Break it up!

53
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,756
You've all had enough fun
for today, don't you think?

54
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,989
You know the penalty
for being in possession

55
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,775
of a weapon, Mr. Turner.

56
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:36,051
Take him to the hole.

57
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:37,419
You're dead.

58
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,450
When I get out, you're a dead man!

59
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:41,840
He planted that. That's not mine.

60
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,745
Deals can't miss, bro.

61
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,622
Primo product, great price.

62
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:52,059
Look, I'm on my way over now, okay?

63
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,382
It can't be you. Aah!

64
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:08,567
Would you mind handling
the incident report?

65
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,744
I'd like to make date night
with Curtis for a change.

66
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:16,166
Go get the captain.

67
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:30,668
4587, you pull that crap
again from yesterday,

68
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:32,500
I'm gonna make an example out of you.

69
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:34,687
Understood, inmate?

70
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,107
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,778
You got a visitor.

72
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:51,495
You know the drill.

73
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:07,627
You've looked better.

74
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,663
I've looked worse.

75
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:13,043
How are William and Felicity?

76
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:15,211
Still safe and sound
in witness protection.

77
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:16,973
I've upped surveillance to 24/7

78
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:18,263
since we spoke last week.

79
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,684
Has the FBI made any progress?

80
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,627
No. No. Nothing.

81
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,223
Watson says she won't stop looking,

82
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,293
and neither will I.

83
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:29,449
But, Oliver, it's been 5 months, man.

84
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:31,802
Five months.

85
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:33,653
Maybe we need to think
about the possibility

86
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,288
that Diaz is off the grid for good.

87
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,057
I can't believe that.

88
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,002
I know this must be so frustrating...

89
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:43,129
Losing all sense of agency like this.

90
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:44,589
Being out of control, I know,

91
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:46,892
is not your strong suit.

92
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:48,968
I'm focusing on what I can control.

93
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,721
What's that?

94
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:53,973
Keep my head down.

95
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:56,518
Hopefully shorten my sentence.

96
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,311
That's smart.

97
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:01,206
I think that's a good play.

98
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:04,442
But I worry about the toll

99
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:06,411
that's going to take on you, Oliver.

100
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:07,904
Cuts heal, John.

101
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:10,123
Not physically, bro.

102
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,844
Keeping passive, not fighting back.

103
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:16,371
Never been who you were.

104
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:19,183
I've always done what I had to do.

105
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,853
Right now...

106
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:26,548
This is what I have to do.

107
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,675
Don't lose yourself in here, Oliver.

108
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,110
I'll be okay.

109
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:34,895
Damn it.

110
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:35,960
What's up?

111
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:37,868
We're supposed to go
live on this app today,

112
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,421
but something in the upgrade

113
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,543
is corrupting the break. It's...

114
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:43,022
Can I take a look?

115
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,732
Be my guest.

116
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,952
Oh, yeah.

117
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:49,862
Are you some sort of, like,
secret tech wiz or something?

118
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:52,304
I just know my way around a computer.

119
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:54,959
There you go.

120
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:57,840
You are a woman of many
talents, Erin. It's...

121
00:08:57,843 --> 00:09:00,554
Saving the world one Espresso at a time.

122
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,262
This coffee's crap.

123
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:06,921
I'll make sure to take
it up with our barista.

124
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,640
You ready to talk?

125
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,141
To a beat cop?

126
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,385
I've already wasted enough of my time.

127
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,220
I want to talk to your captain.

128
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:16,389
You sure about that?

129
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:19,582
Because officer anastas
is a lot more patient

130
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:20,652
than I am.

131
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:23,661
Lady Captain? Oh, nice.

132
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,157
Hmm. Well, you have

133
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,953
quite the list of
allegations against you, huh?

134
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:31,495
Fraud, racketeering, embezzlement.

135
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:33,497
The key word being allegations.

136
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,410
Well, where there's smoke,
there's fire, Mr. Stent.

137
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,245
And in my experience, innocent men

138
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:41,770
don't typically show up bound
and gagged at my doorstep

139
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:42,840
without reason.

140
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,584
There's a reason, all right.

141
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:47,132
The Green Arrow.

142
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:48,796
Maybe you hit your
head a little too hard,

143
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,520
but Oliver Queen is in prison.

144
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,759
Then there's another
psycho in green leather

145
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:54,853
assaulting people with a bow and arrow.

146
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:57,726
There have been no Vigilantes
in this city for 5 months.

147
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,325
Looks like you got your work
cut out for you, then, don't you?

148
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:02,310
Now, are you gonna let me go,

149
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,978
or do I have to sue your asses?

150
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,606
Yeah. Just as soon

151
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,500
as officer anastas
takes your statement...

152
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:15,281
Very slowly.

153
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:21,020
Guys, guys, remember,
always keep your hands high.

154
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:22,312
That's your guard.

155
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:24,123
Tony, yeah. In and out.

156
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,475
Yeah, but keep your distance.

157
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:27,223
Nice one, peanut.

158
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,983
Isn't it bad to punch things?

159
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:30,911
Ms. Lopez says Gandhi wasn't violent.

160
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,465
Gandhi ain't from the glades.

161
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:37,562
Besides, self-defense
isn't about being violent.

162
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:40,225
It's about being focused and disciplined

163
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:42,965
so you can protect yourself
and the ones that you love.

164
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,832
That's just 'cause there's no
more heroes to keep us safe, right?

165
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:49,190
Hey, dad, my bag's leaking.

166
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:53,887
Uh, nothing a little
duct tape can't fix.

167
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,801
Are we ever gonna get new stuff?

168
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,187
This bag's kind of gross.

169
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,367
Still waiting to hit that lottery, Zoe.

170
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:02,062
Besides, gross builds character.

171
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:05,163
Ten-minute break while
I patch these things up.

172
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,759
What's up with you, man?

173
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:09,054
This class is dumb.

174
00:11:09,057 --> 00:11:11,630
Boxing's not gonna win you a fight
in the glades, and you know it.

175
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:13,114
Boxing's not about winning.

176
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:15,278
It's about being focused and disciplined

177
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,676
so you don't have to fight.

178
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,594
You mean with, like, a hockey mask?

179
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,031
Come on, man.

180
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,615
Everyone here knows that you're wild dog

181
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:22,692
after that trial.

182
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,161
And you just didn't punch people.

183
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:25,518
I don't do that anymore.

184
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,034
Yeah? Maybe you should.

185
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:31,688
'Cause my family just
got robbed last week.

186
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,207
And the cops don't care
about us in the glades.

187
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,672
So it's on us to protect ourselves.

188
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,342
Hitting these bags isn't gonna do it.

189
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,633
You know, I ain't into blondes myself.

190
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:51,878
Put that down.

191
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,755
Slow your roll, Arrow.

192
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:57,425
You wouldn't want this
conversation to get messy.

193
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,489
You know I can just take
that from you, right?

194
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,387
Well, that'd be a good thing.

195
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,556
You see, it'd save us
the trouble of planting it

196
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:05,481
when we rat you out to yorke,

197
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:07,226
just like you did to Turner.

198
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,079
Now, I know you're trying to get back

199
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:11,105
to this pretty little face.

200
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:13,917
You're probably counting down the days.

201
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,476
Just tell me what you want.

202
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,754
Yeah. Well, you see...

203
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:20,129
You see, me and Sampson here,

204
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:23,093
we've got a 3-man operation with Turner.

205
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:24,928
Side hustle.

206
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,339
And, uh, because of
you, we're a man down.

207
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:31,584
So I think you should take his place.

208
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,252
No chance.

209
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:37,131
Now, here's two reasons
why I don't believe you.

210
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:38,808
Now, I bet you really wish you

211
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,195
hadn't have stopped merlyn
from killing me, don't you?

212
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,951
See you soon, Arrow.

213
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:57,985
So I can sell cheap to
the culebras, no problem.

214
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,871
Whatever you want, Mr. Stent.

215
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:03,374
Heh. You got it. I got you.

216
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,785
My man.

217
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:07,879
This ain't no playground,
kid. Keep it moving.

218
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:09,664
Y'all sell guns, right?

219
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,624
That depends.

220
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:13,293
How much money you got, little man?

221
00:13:13,296 --> 00:13:15,053
He's not interested.

222
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,388
You followed me?

223
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,316
Yeah, I figured you
would do something stupid,

224
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,151
and it looks like I was right.

225
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:24,637
Hold on.

226
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,564
I know you.

227
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:28,808
You're the one that dropped
a dime on Oliver Queen.

228
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,197
Uh, crazy dog or something like that.

229
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,826
I don't know what you're
talking about. Let's go. Come on.

230
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,193
Unfortunately for you,

231
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:41,671
you just saw my whole operation.

232
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,200
And that can't be good for anybody.

233
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,143
Get down.

234
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,457
You okay?

235
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,534
Was that the Green Arrow?

236
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,846
I don't know who the hell that is.

237
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,732
We should turn around! It's not safe.

238
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:44,401
But is it impossible?

239
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:47,720
No, not impossible,
but it's not very smart.

240
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:49,314
Then how about I add another 100 grand

241
00:14:49,316 --> 00:14:51,057
to the 200,000 I've already paid you?

242
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,457
Most people would pay that kind of money

243
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,269
to stay away from here.

244
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:58,773
This place must be
very important for you.

245
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,458
It's not the place.

246
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,086
It's the person I'm
hoping to find there.

247
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:18,953
- Hey.
- Hey.

248
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:21,331
Thanks for your help the other day.

249
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:22,792
Yeah, it was nothing.

250
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:24,200
Ah, it was more than nothing.

251
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:26,469
The app's number one
thanks to your genius.

252
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:29,263
Oh, well, I'm pretty sure I just touched

253
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:31,282
somebody's snotty snot rag,

254
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,187
so I am also living the dream.

255
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,356
Well, I hope I'm not
one of those customers

256
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,817
that you secretly complain about.

257
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,067
You? No. You're polite and nice.

258
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,426
And your hygiene is fairly
on point from what I can tell.

259
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:43,546
The bar seems pretty low.

260
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,677
Yeah. You should work here a
month, you might change your mind.

261
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,159
You could always... I don't
know... change my mind over dinner?

262
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:54,007
Unless if that just put me
on your creepy customer list.

263
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,187
You're asking me out.

264
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,382
And now I'm regretting it.

265
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:58,309
No. I mean, I'm
flattered and everything,

266
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:01,794
because, like, "Whoa. Still got it!"

267
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,945
Not interested? I... I get it.

268
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:07,257
No, you definitely don't get it.

269
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,778
Breaking news out of
star city this morning

270
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:11,914
as the D.A.'S office is set to comment

271
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,460
on growing speculation
that the Vigilante known

272
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:17,140
as the Green Arrow has returned.

273
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,634
For an official statement
from the district attorney,

274
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:21,093
we go live to city hall.

275
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:23,044
- Are the rumors true?
- Is the Green Arrow really back?

276
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:24,320
Did Oliver Queen escape?

277
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:26,726
Do you have any idea
who's under that mask?

278
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,484
We have reason to believe

279
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,417
that a Vigilante impersonating
the Green Arrow is out there.

280
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,843
While we're still pursuing
leads as to the identity

281
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:39,307
of this unknown assailant, we
can tell you with 100% certainty

282
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,661
that he is not Oliver Queen.

283
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:43,007
This is someone new.

284
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,003
You said, "assailant."

285
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:46,270
Does that mean city hall
considers this new Green Arrow

286
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:47,351
a threat?

287
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,375
To the rule of law? Absolutely.

288
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:52,856
Star City continues to
employ a zero-tolerance policy

289
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:55,957
against any and all acts of vigilantism.

290
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,257
Anyone found committing or
aiding and abetting these acts

291
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,745
will be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

292
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:07,915
Think she's full of crap?

293
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:09,676
You really have to ask me that?

294
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,295
You done giving your statement?

295
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:14,091
Green guy with a bow and arrow

296
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,593
takes down a weapons
deal and saves my ass.

297
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:18,570
If you ask me, you should
be helping this guy,

298
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:20,062
not hunting him down,

299
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:22,070
especially with Diaz still out there.

300
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,632
Diaz has been gone for months,

301
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,289
and the FBI still has its eye on us.

302
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,750
So as much as I doubt
Laurel's motives...

303
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:29,609
And, uh, believe me, I do...

304
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:31,703
Taking a hard-line
stance was the right play,

305
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:34,319
because if Agent Watson
even so much as suspects

306
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,579
we have something to do with this...

307
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:37,078
Our immunity goes adios.

308
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,915
That's right. And that's
why we have got to find

309
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,414
this Green Arrow wannabe
and shut him down.

310
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:44,804
Rene, we all agreed,
for better or for worse,

311
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,516
we were not gonna go out as Vigilantes.

312
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,710
Otherwise, what was
Oliver's sacrifice for?

313
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:50,930
Ok, so we're supposed to just ignore

314
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,007
the rising crime rate
and do nothing about it?

315
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,759
Actually, I think risking
my officers every day

316
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:57,250
fighting to maintain law and order is

317
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:58,648
doing something about it.

318
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,818
I... I get that, D.,

319
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:03,768
but Oliver asked us to carry on.

320
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,045
So whoever's behind that mask is doing

321
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:07,796
what we're supposed to be doing.

322
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:09,757
But he's not helping the problem.

323
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,018
Actually, he's making it worse.

324
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,779
Rene, I'm not saying

325
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:16,947
that we can't still
be heroes to this city.

326
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,190
We just have to do it in a
little bit of a different way.

327
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:24,605
So where you at finding this wannabe?

328
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:27,299
Well, we retrieved a few
arrows from the scene,

329
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:28,986
but forensics still turned up empty.

330
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:30,065
But what about the perp?

331
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,916
Any pattern as to how
he's selecting his targets?

332
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,382
This weapons dealer has
a rap sheet 12 feet long.

333
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,596
He was an obvious mark.

334
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,313
But this first guy... Stent...

335
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,983
I still haven't figured out
how he fits into the puzzle.

336
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,205
You don't think he's innocent.

337
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,838
This guy? Hell, no.

338
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:45,337
But his rap sheet's only clean

339
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,035
because he paid to make sure it was.

340
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:48,293
Well, it looks like
you might have to take

341
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,845
a deep dive through his financials.

342
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,174
Yeah. But I can't exactly

343
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:53,111
subpoena his records based on a hunch.

344
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:55,656
Who said anything about a subpoena?

345
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:57,736
I really miss this, guys.

346
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,848
Not that I don't like being
the head of R&D at A.R.G.U.S.

347
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,517
It has better benefits, as in
there are actually benefits.

348
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,424
I just miss the team.

349
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:04,846
Less talking, more typing.

350
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:07,197
Right! Sorry. Uh, it should
only be a couple of minutes

351
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,058
before I'm in, which Felicity
could beat one-handed.

352
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,994
Miss her.

353
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:12,408
I really appreciate the
assist here, you guys.

354
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:13,916
You especially, John.

355
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,803
I know you've been in some
hot water here at A.R.G.U.S.,

356
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:18,491
burning so many of their
resources going after Diaz.

357
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:19,852
Well, Lyla's down at HQ right now,

358
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:20,933
trying to smooth things over.

359
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:23,177
Besides, I want to get
this Green Arrow imposter

360
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,530
off the streets as bad as you.

361
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,349
I don't want Watson thinking that Oliver

362
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:28,852
set this in motion in some type of way.

363
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:30,838
There's enough trouble as it is.

364
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,649
How's he holding up?

365
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:36,166
He's surviving.

366
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,434
- And that's a bingo.
- What did you find?

367
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:39,937
How stent's been making his money.

368
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:41,308
And it's not from defrauding pensions.

369
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,846
He's been peddling black-market arms.

370
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,190
What kind of dumbass leaves his
entire criminal enterprise online?

371
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:48,026
He was actually pretty smart about it.

372
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,869
He kept himself clean, off the radar,

373
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:52,463
activities washed through a
series of shell corporations.

374
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:54,760
I just happen to be smarter. Boo-ya.

375
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:56,880
So this is how the
targets are connected.

376
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:58,958
Stent supplied the
weapons, Medina sold them.

377
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,987
The Vigilante's trying to shut
down stent's whole network.

378
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:03,494
Yeah. And according to this
text exchange, he's panicked.

379
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:05,718
Stent's trying to sell the
rest of his inventory off

380
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:06,861
in a huge buy tonight.

381
00:20:06,864 --> 00:20:08,730
Do we have a location?

382
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,377
Not until an hour before the buy.

383
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,440
I'll keep you guys posted.

384
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,505
That's where we'll find
our Green Arrow wannabe.

385
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:18,101
So, uh, any guesses
on who this might be?

386
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:20,554
Well, my money was on John.

387
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:22,107
Whoever it is,

388
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,286
they won't be hiding
under the hood for long.

389
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:31,432
If you don't hear from me in
a week, I'm not coming back.

390
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:32,768
I hope you do.

391
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:34,822
You know, you pay me
a lot of money to do

392
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:37,503
very stupid things.

393
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:40,107
Always a pleasure.

394
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:28,518
This food isn't as bad
as I thought it'd be...

395
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,124
You can't sit here.

396
00:21:32,312 --> 00:21:33,658
It's just like high school.

397
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:35,494
I don't really know
how to be much clearer

398
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:38,005
than I've been being.

399
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:40,002
Go away.

400
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:41,857
So what do you think
about your replacement?

401
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,836
It's got to bug you there's
a new guy that can do

402
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,791
all the things that
you can't do anymore.

403
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:48,604
Okay. Just because I have
decided to let you sit here

404
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,351
doesn't mean that we're
having a conversation.

405
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:52,538
You understand?

406
00:21:54,242 --> 00:21:57,721
- You ready to hustle?
- No.

407
00:21:57,724 --> 00:22:02,502
Listen, if you try to
leverage my family ever again,

408
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:05,046
I will expose whatever
it is you have going on

409
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:07,963
to every single guard in here.

410
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:09,502
Disappointed to hear that.

411
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:14,940
We'll just have to try
this a different way.

412
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:17,128
This your new friend?

413
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:20,018
It's nothing to do with him.

414
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:22,596
- It is now.
- I didn't do anything.

415
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:25,888
Do you want to come with us now, Queen?

416
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:29,737
No.

417
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,948
Oliver.

418
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,817
I can't help you.

419
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,843
Oliver... don't.

420
00:22:35,846 --> 00:22:40,159
Don't. Please... Uh! Uh!

421
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,221
Looking pretty crazy out there.

422
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:58,783
I wanted everyone ready to move

423
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:00,643
the second Curtis has a location.

424
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,404
With any luck, we'll
establish a perimeter

425
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:04,056
and gain some lead time.

426
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:06,563
And if that vigilante shows up?

427
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:08,232
Then we take him down, too.

428
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:10,327
I still don't think you should do that.

429
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:12,494
I thought we settled this, Rene.

430
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:14,619
For the last few months,
all I kept hearing is

431
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:16,799
how scared my kids at the center were.

432
00:23:16,802 --> 00:23:19,979
And then this Green
Arrow wannabe shows up,

433
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,316
and they have hope again.

434
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,277
So, to me, that's worth
a hell of a lot more

435
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,932
than our immunity deal, rule of law,

436
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:29,695
whatever the hell crap Laurel said.

437
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:32,255
Sometimes people just need
something to believe in.

438
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:34,088
Right. I get it, Rene. I really do.

439
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:36,710
But how do you know you
can believe in this guy?

440
00:23:36,713 --> 00:23:38,212
You don't know what his motives are.

441
00:23:38,214 --> 00:23:39,597
You don't even know who he is.

442
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,882
I know he could've let
me die, and he didn't.

443
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:43,377
That's good enough for me.

444
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,981
Yeah? You sure he saved you?

445
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:47,416
Or were you just not his target?

446
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:49,344
Because there's a big, big difference.

447
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,099
Curtis?

448
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,565
The buy's going down in an hour.

449
00:23:57,568 --> 00:23:59,628
Old manufacturing plant by the wharf.

450
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,323
You arrest that vigilante, D.,

451
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,117
you're making a big mistake.

452
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,639
No, Rene. I'm doing my job.

453
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:24,425
Felicity...

454
00:24:24,427 --> 00:24:26,705
Hey. Sorry. Did I wake you?

455
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:27,955
I couldn't sleep.

456
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,143
Everything okay?

457
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:31,105
I guess.

458
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:32,899
How was school today?

459
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:35,033
The same. It sucked.

460
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:37,352
Well, did you at least
crush your geometry test?

461
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:41,244
Yeah. I just miss my old school.

462
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,363
And I miss old my job.

463
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,807
I really, really miss your dad.

464
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,432
Me, too.

465
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,286
At least we still
have each other, right?

466
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,354
How much longer do we
have to stay here for?

467
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:58,018
I don't know.

468
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:28,158
Are you okay?

469
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:31,470
What do you care?

470
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:35,788
I'm not gonna survive in here.

471
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,166
Yeah, you will. You'll be fine.

472
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,502
You... you just left me to die.

473
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,221
I...

474
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:45,447
I knew that they didn't want to kill you

475
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,433
because they...

476
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:50,111
I knew that they were coming after me.

477
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:52,395
So you just let them
beat the crap out of me?

478
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:56,567
I'm on the guards' radar

479
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:58,440
after what happened the other day.

480
00:25:58,443 --> 00:26:00,002
And I...

481
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,757
I get another strike against me,

482
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,236
and I'm back to square one,

483
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,548
and I want to get back to my family.

484
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:10,218
I can't...

485
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:11,971
I can't do that to them.

486
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:16,362
I have family, too. Did
you ever think about that?

487
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:23,185
I mean, I shouldn't even be in here.

488
00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:27,265
I was wrongfully accused of murder.

489
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:31,027
And that's what the city's like now.

490
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:33,178
There's no justice.

491
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,773
Just keep your head
down, you'll be fine.

492
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:39,002
That... that's your advice?

493
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:43,175
All this time, I thought
you had a raw deal,

494
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:45,628
like I did.

495
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:46,986
But it makes sense now

496
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:49,861
why there's a new Green Arrow out there.

497
00:26:49,864 --> 00:26:53,240
Because the old one is a coward.

498
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:56,386
Lights out!

499
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:04,227
There's close to $1 million
worth of product here.

500
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:06,137
All yours for 400k.

501
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:07,385
What's the catch?

502
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:09,440
I got burned out on the business.

503
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:11,627
I decided to liquidate
for my mental health.

504
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:19,433
Stent's about to make the exchange.

505
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:21,010
Should we move in?

506
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:23,102
We can make this bust in our sleep.

507
00:27:23,105 --> 00:27:25,611
I'm waiting for the Vigilante.

508
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:32,792
400K of assorted cryptocurrencies,

509
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:34,341
as requested.

510
00:27:36,502 --> 00:27:38,167
I do miss the old ways.

511
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,769
You mean a briefcase
full of money? No, thanks.

512
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:49,315
That's him. Move!

513
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:20,952
Please. I'll give you anything.

514
00:28:20,955 --> 00:28:24,081
I have what I came for.

515
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,936
Jason Stent, you have failed this city.

516
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,331
Drop your weapon now.

517
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:39,000
Don't be stupid.

518
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:46,412
Vigilante heading north!

519
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:57,730
Where the hell are you hiding?

520
00:29:05,608 --> 00:29:07,224
I was just trying to get free!

521
00:29:07,227 --> 00:29:09,198
You never should have come here.

522
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,619
Morning, 4587.

523
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:26,246
Beautiful day.

524
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,292
Ohh, you think I'd be
sick of coffee by now.

525
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:15,503
Will?

526
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:30,018
Heh heh. Hey, Erin,

527
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,687
you're a hard woman to find.

528
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:48,315
No one to save you now.

529
00:30:48,318 --> 00:30:50,401
It's just you and me.

530
00:30:50,404 --> 00:30:51,953
I swear to God, if you hurt him.

531
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:53,665
You're gonna do what?

532
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:55,876
You're gonna sic Oliver after me?

533
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:57,839
Right now, he's realizing

534
00:30:57,842 --> 00:31:00,018
how difficult prison life is.

535
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,860
What the hell do you want?

536
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:17,011
Pretty simple, actually.

537
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,080
I want Oliver to spend

538
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:24,706
the rest of his life in prison knowing

539
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:26,769
I killed his wife.

540
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:29,241
Oh, thank god, you monologue. Run now!

541
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:57,870
No!

542
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:06,239
You're gonna suffer for that.

543
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:27,436
The only reason you're
still breathing is

544
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:28,888
so you can hear this message:

545
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:30,682
Diaz found Felicity.

546
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:32,202
Your wife is dead.

547
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:53,565
I, um...

548
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:55,231
I need to make a phone call.

549
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,842
Rough night, 4587?

550
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:57,995
I have reason to believe

551
00:32:57,998 --> 00:33:00,609
that my family has been attacked.

552
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:03,922
Please allow me to make a phone call.

553
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:06,297
You know you don't
have phone privileges.

554
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,635
You got a visitor, though.

555
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:28,864
You're okay.

556
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:33,685
How's William?

557
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:35,537
He's fine.

558
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,981
Are you?

559
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,525
I am now.

560
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:42,586
I've missed you.

561
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:46,256
I love you so much.

562
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,258
And I'm so sorry that I wasn't there.

563
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,041
I should have been there.

564
00:33:52,044 --> 00:33:53,794
How could you have been?

565
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:55,672
The only reason that I'm here is

566
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,542
to keep you and William safe.

567
00:33:57,544 --> 00:34:00,328
Yeah. I know.

568
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,004
I need you to tell John

569
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,320
to set the two of you
up with new identities.

570
00:34:04,323 --> 00:34:05,517
I need...

571
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:10,864
I need you... I need you back

572
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:13,015
in the witness protection program.

573
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,351
I have William set up

574
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,896
at a boarding school in Cambridge.

575
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:20,766
He leaves tomorrow.

576
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:22,914
You're not going with him?

577
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:25,528
No, I'm not.

578
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,881
- Felicity...
- I'm done hiding, Oliver.

579
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:30,217
I'm done being a person
who doesn't fight back.

580
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:33,281
Diaz broke in, and all
I could think about was

581
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:34,844
protecting William.

582
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:37,540
I tried, and I couldn't do it.

583
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,418
If A.R.G.U.S. Hadn't gotten
there when they did...

584
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,304
Do you know what it feels like

585
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:45,590
not being able to protect your family?

586
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:49,310
I have lived with that
feeling every second

587
00:34:49,312 --> 00:34:51,633
since I stepped in here, Felicity.

588
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:52,906
Don't...

589
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:55,099
Don't tempt that,

590
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:57,819
please.

591
00:34:57,828 --> 00:34:59,712
Please.

592
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,916
I am begging you to go back

593
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,102
to witness protection.

594
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:09,781
No. I won't.

595
00:35:09,783 --> 00:35:13,635
You don't get to decide
this time, Oliver.

596
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:18,339
I love you,

597
00:35:18,341 --> 00:35:21,083
and I will always...

598
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,938
Always wait for you.

599
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:28,653
But I can't let what happened

600
00:35:28,656 --> 00:35:30,955
to William and I happen again.

601
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,353
I can't.

602
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:36,432
I have to fight back.

603
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,101
You, of all people, understand that.

604
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:42,122
Time's up, 4587.

605
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:44,816
I... I need a bit more time.

606
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:46,753
And I don't care.

607
00:35:50,156 --> 00:35:53,216
I love you.

608
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:56,137
Okay. Okay.

609
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,237
I love you.

610
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:10,758
Hey, guys, listen up. I got some news.

611
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,666
We need more duct tape, Dad.

612
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:13,958
Not anymore, peanut.

613
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:15,572
We got ourselves some new equipment.

614
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,942
I'm talking about bags, gloves.

615
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:20,228
You were talking about you
wanted some new shoes, right?

616
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:21,164
We got that, too.

617
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:22,631
Hey, you win the lottery or something?

618
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:25,489
Nah. I just got some help
from somebody looking out.

619
00:36:25,492 --> 00:36:28,066
But I thought you said the
old stuff builds character.

620
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,630
That... that was before I
knew we would get newer stuff.

621
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:33,088
Dad?

622
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,907
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

623
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:36,512
Uh, keep practicing.

624
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:37,923
And when we get back,

625
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:39,568
we're gonna be ripping these bags apart.

626
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:45,918
Hey. What's up, D.?

627
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,295
What brings you to these parts?

628
00:36:48,297 --> 00:36:52,776
Well, uh, a couple of mom and
pop shops called the precinct.

629
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,969
They said they opened
up to find cash waiting.

630
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:57,855
It seems like 15 other hard-up businesses

631
00:36:57,857 --> 00:37:00,666
from the glades also got the same
exact amount that went missing

632
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:02,314
from the weapons buy the other night.

633
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:04,200
So, uh, you wouldn't happen

634
00:37:04,203 --> 00:37:05,938
to know anything about that, would you?

635
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,481
Uh, no. No. I can't... I did.

636
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:10,947
But it does sound like
the work of a hero, though.

637
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,945
That's what it feels like.

638
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:14,325
I should be arresting you

639
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:16,541
for the crap you pulled the other night.

640
00:37:16,543 --> 00:37:19,118
Do you have any idea the position
you're putting me in, Rene?

641
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,804
Hey, look, I'm sorry, D., all right?

642
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:22,472
But I couldn't let you lock him up.

643
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,239
He's not a criminal, and you know it.

644
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,137
No, I don't.

645
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,489
And it's not a leap of
faith I'm willing to take.

646
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:30,962
You know, I am working so hard
to restore the city's faith

647
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:34,133
in the men and women who serve it.

648
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:36,595
Rene, if you go out
there as wild dog again,

649
00:37:36,598 --> 00:37:38,971
I will not hesitate to lock you up

650
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,583
just like that vigilante.

651
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:42,098
Are you serious, D.?

652
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:44,019
I just want you to think long and hard

653
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:46,352
about what that means, okay?

654
00:37:46,355 --> 00:37:49,666
For these kids and for Zoe

655
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,127
and for our city, man.

656
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:56,089
'Cause I'm not gonna
give you a second warning.

657
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:05,997
- Hey.
- Hey.

658
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,517
How is he?

659
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,421
Quiet. Reading, mostly.

660
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:12,591
I'll give you two a minute.

661
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:13,860
Thank you.

662
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:21,680
Hey.

663
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:24,868
Did you see him?

664
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,494
I did.

665
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:28,447
I wish I could've come with you.

666
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,856
Yeah, me, too.

667
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:32,858
It's too dangerous.

668
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,194
No one can know that you're here.

669
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,788
Hey, I got something for you.

670
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:44,703
What's this?

671
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:47,039
It's a symbol of reconnection.

672
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,072
Your aunt Thea gave it to me

673
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:50,251
before she left town,

674
00:38:50,253 --> 00:38:52,136
and it's something your
father had given her.

675
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:54,922
As long as you have this,

676
00:38:54,924 --> 00:38:57,275
I will always be able to find you.

677
00:38:57,277 --> 00:38:59,068
I don't understand.

678
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,928
You have to go somewhere.

679
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,057
It's super-super safe.

680
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,944
I can't come with you.

681
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,979
- You're leaving me.
- I'm not leaving you.

682
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,778
It's only temporary, okay?

683
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:14,440
Just until we get Diaz, I promise.

684
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:16,728
And then as soon as we
do, I'm gonna come get you.

685
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,421
It's all gonna be over...

686
00:39:19,832 --> 00:39:22,050
I swear.

687
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:42,942
Check it out.

688
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:46,866
Queen, you don't look too hot there.

689
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:49,872
Maybe I can help you... Uh!

690
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:59,653
Stand down.

691
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:01,598
Don't be a hero.

692
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:28,700
You should've killed me.

693
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:05,814
Who sent you?

694
00:41:05,817 --> 00:41:08,222
No one.

695
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:09,809
But you knew my father.

696
00:41:09,812 --> 00:41:11,868
How am I supposed to
know who your old man is?

697
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:15,020
No.

698
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,166
My father...

699
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:19,028
Is Oliver Queen.

700
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,258
William?

701
00:41:34,085 --> 00:41:38,117
