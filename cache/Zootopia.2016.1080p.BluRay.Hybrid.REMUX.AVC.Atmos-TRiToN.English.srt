What can you tell us about

1655

(STAMMERS) Well, the animals
in question, um...

Oh, all we know is that they...

are all members of the predator family.

1661

So, predators are
the only ones going savage?

We still don't know.

01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:13,561
It may have something
to do with biology.

SHEEP REPORTER: What do you
mean by that?

1667
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:17,148
A biological component.

1668
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:20,693
You know, something in their DNA.

1669

In their DNA? Can you
elaborate on that, please?

1670
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,867
Yes, what I mean is,
thousands of years ago...

01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:34,082
uh, predators survived through
their aggressive...

hunting instincts.

1673

For whatever reason...

Right. But a fox could, huh?

You're not that kind of predator.

The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1708

The kind that makes you think...

1709

you need to carry around fox repellent?

Yeah, don't think I didn't...

notice that little item
the first time we met.

1712
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:56,915
So let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

1713
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,877
Do you think I might go nuts?

1714
