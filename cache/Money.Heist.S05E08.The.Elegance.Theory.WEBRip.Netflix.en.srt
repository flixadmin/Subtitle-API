1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,375
Good evening.

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,833
-Good evening, thank you.
-Good evening.

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,791
Look, there's lobster thermidor.

4
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,583
We're going to dine like royalty, my love.

5
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,500
Andrés, we need to talk.

6
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:41,416
I don't like the sound of that sentence.
That's how all breakups begin.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,375
I know.

8
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,875
I tried to find the best time to tell you,
but I guess there never is one.

9
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,750
Don't say it's because of my illness.

10
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,375
Hey, my love.

11
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,166
My love,

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,791
but that's the best reason
to stay together.

13
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't you see? We're not weighed down
by "the rest of our lives."

14
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,333
That burdens any relationship.

15
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,625
Our love is just for our enjoyment,

16
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:12,416
because it's vibrant, light, ephemeral.

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,583
It's pure hope. Do you know why?

18
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,125
Because

19
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:22,500
loving someone who's terminally ill
opens the door for the next love.

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,791
It's like one of those wonderful trips
around old Europe.

21
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,083
First, you go to Rome, then Vienna…

22
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:32,541
You don't like Vienna? No problem.
Istanbul is around the corner.

23
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,583
What if I make it easier?

24
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,666
Let's say our relationship has changed.

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,041
That we used to dream big.

26
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,291
We wanted to visit Greenland,
see the northern lights.

27
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,125
But after the vineyards in California

28
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,333
came Madrid.

29
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,750
And we're still here.

30
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,750
You used to talk about
stealing the Spanish gold reserve.

31
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,458
And here we are, city hopping. Doing what?

32
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,583
Stealing some diamonds here,

33
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,250
some Viking gold chalices there.

34
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,666
It's not easy to retain
that initial level of fascination.

35
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,625
Everyone gives their all during the chase.

36
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,875
So, you want a divorce?

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,583
I do.

38
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,208
Can I take your order now?

39
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:32,791
Not yet. You don't need to fill her glass.
It seems I'll be having this wine alone.

40
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,541
I just want to know one thing.

41
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,916
It's something small. Can I ask?

42
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,166
Is there someone else?

43
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,250
Don't make this harder.

44
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,541
No. Come on, I can't believe it.

45
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,791
That's the last thing
you're going to say to me?

46
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,791
I've spent my whole life
searching for something real.

47
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,625
Every second of my life,
in every decision I've made.

48
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:13,500
And now I'm left with two of the most
overused sentences in movie history?

49
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,125
"We need to talk,"
and "Don't make this harder"?

50
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:56,666
Follow that car.

51
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,666
Stop here.

52
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,916
We're running out of water.

53
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,791
This is the stormwater tank.

54
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,791
The water's fluctuating.

55
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,208
That's it! The last nuggets just came out!

56
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,875
It's done!

57
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,125
We did it!

58
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,500
Colonel.

59
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,875
Besides the engine,
I just heard a sharp suction noise.

60
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,250
Did you say "suction"?
What are you talking about?

61
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,500
It sounds like water going down a drain,
but on steroids.

62
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,833
They're drawing water out.
Lots of gallons.

63
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,083
No.

64
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,250
Play it again.
Clear the signal as much as you can.

65
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,000
It does sound like water being suctioned.

66
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,291
I'd say they've emptied the vault.

67
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,125
Did they get the gold out?

68
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,958
I don't know. Maybe.

69
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,833
You and the other engineer
told me it wasn't possible.

70
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,166
It wasn't possible using the bank's pump.

71
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,500
It isn't strong enough
to get that gold out.

72
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,083
Unless it's been reduced
to micron-sized pieces.

73
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,000
Even still,
I doubt they could move 90 tons.

74
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,333
You don't know what they're capable of.

75
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:27,666
They're pumping the gold out!
Tell me where it's going! Figure it out!

76
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,250
Professor?

77
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:39,166
Hey, in class you never told us
it'd be so fucking hard

78
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,750
to get the gold out.

79
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,375
Nor did I say it'd be easy.

80
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,625
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
the criminal genius

81
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,750
you fell in love with, like a 15-year-old.

82
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,083
You're so silly.

83
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,916
Over and out.

84
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,833
Well, it seems things are coming
to an end, aren't they?

85
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,625
Yes.

86
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,458
When we get out…

87
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,458
I'm going to buy a motorcycle,

88
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,750
and imprint the shape of my ass
in the seat.

89
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,541
I'll ride it around the world.

90
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,875
Sounds good.

91
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,041
What do you prefer, beach or pool?

92
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Beach?

93
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,041
One-piece or bikini?

94
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,791
What's this, a Cosmopolitan questionnaire?

95
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,333
It's just small talk.

96
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,875
But if you want, when we get out,

97
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,500
I'll take you out.

98
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,375
And finish the questionnaire.

99
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,291
Those embraces were not only
a celebration of triumph,

100
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,291
or the heartfelt tribute
to those who fell along the way.

101
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,291
It was the uproar
of a handful of insignificant people

102
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:30,291
who had managed to move
90 tons of gold through a pipe,

103
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,416
sending out
a message of hope to the world.

104
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,333
"The impossible is possible."

105
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,833
But the attack wasn't over.

106
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:46,375
And we were going to need
massive amounts of that hope

107
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,333
in the next few hours of the heist.

108
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,208
Ahead of us we'd simply have to face

109
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,291
the harshest reality check ever.

110
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,916
I heard we got the gold out.

111
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,166
I kissed Manila.

112
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,666
Actually, that's not important.

113
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,875
What matters is I'm really confused.

114
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,541
I think I have more in common with her
than with you.

115
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,416
Do you know
what I used to do in Indonesia?

116
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,875
I'd tell you I was going to buy wood,
but I'd go party for two days.

117
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,541
I did it behind your back because I felt
everything I wanted was wrong.

118
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,833
I don't know.

119
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,750
Being with Manila somehow

120
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,500
made me realize that I'm not wrong.

121
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,166
Aren't you going to say anything?

122
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,916
I'd rather talk later, Denver.

123
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,375
I have an awful headache, and…

124
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,708
I'd rather get some rest.

125
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,250
Alone.

126
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,750
Sure.

127
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,916
They must be moving it
through the stream that floods the vault.

128
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,208
All the water is gathered
in two natural streams,

129
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,083
and then drains
into another stream in the south.

130
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,791
Motherfuckers.

131
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,416
They wouldn't move it
through the drain or sewer.

132
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,041
They're pumping the gold far away,
through the stream.

133
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,458
They must have brought in
a more powerful pump.

134
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:46,625
To cover those 16 miles of channels
carrying 90 tons of gold,

135
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,291
they'd need at least an oil-pipeline pump.

136
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,666
Find Suárez. We need to comb that stream.

137
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,458
And bring me the pipe maps.

138
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,208
I want to know
everywhere those channels go,

139
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,833
where they end, everything.

140
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,916
We're launching an offensive.

141
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,708
What now?

142
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,541
Well, now we'll assign lookout shifts,
freshen up. How does that sound?

143
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,833
And wait for the Professor to act.

144
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,625
Where are they sending the gold?

145
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,625
These channels lead to many factories,
treatment plants,

146
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,416
hydraulic facilities, stormwater tanks…

147
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,125
We need to check every single one.

148
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:24,083
I want soldiers combing
every cubic inch of water in those pipes.

149
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,666
There are over 5,000 soldiers
surrounding the bank,

150
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,208
and running Operation Cage
to find the Professor.

151
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,750
-How many police officers can we count on?
-About 480 units.

152
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,000
And your men, Suárez.
Everyone, off to the stream!

153
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,000
Come on!

154
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,083
Constant communication.

155
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,708
SUBWAY
BANK OF SPAIN

156
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,875
Let's go!

157
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,875
There's not much movement outside.
Just some vehicles leaving the perimeter.

158
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,833
I think things are calming down.

159
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,000
The police are still looking for me
in Madrid. Get some rest.

160
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,166
Arteche, do you copy?

161
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,250
Arteche, what's going on?

162
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,000
I need a few minutes.

163
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,583
Okay, roger that.

164
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,333
Stockholm.

165
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,458
Stockholm.

166
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,750
Stockholm. It's Tokyo.

167
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,083
I'm here.

168
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,708
What's going on? Mónica!

169
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,583
Mónica!

170
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,333
What's wrong?

171
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,125
What's wrong?

172
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,458
I'm going crazy.

173
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,500
I saw Arturo. Arturo talks to me.

174
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,541
And Tokyo is in the dumbwaiter.

175
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,333
It's okay.

176
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,416
I think I have psychosis.

177
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,458
I see things and shoot at them.
I'm dangerous. I need to get out.

178
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,916
-I need medical help.
-You can't leave.

179
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,333
Denver, I surrender. I want to get out.

180
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,000
I almost killed you.

181
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,833
-I'm dangerous.
-Listen.

182
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,583
I have an idea, okay?

183
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,875
I'm going to lock you in the vault.

184
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,833
-No.
-You can't hurt anyone in there.

185
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,208
-I have to get out.
-I'll look after you.

186
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll look after you.
If you don't get better, I'll get you out.

187
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,125
Okay?

188
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,250
Okay.

189
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,458
Suárez, all channels must be checked.

190
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:30,875
Your unit will go to the treatment plant.
The rest will continue southbound.

197
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,166
I should've kept quiet. Sorry.

198
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,208
I don't know why I told you about Manila.

199
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,583
No, Denver.

200
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,583
What you said was painful, but…

201
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,833
somehow I'm glad.

202
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,375
It's the most honest thing
you've said to me

203
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,666
in a long time.

204
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,125
And anyway, don't worry about Manila.

205
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,833
I already knew.

206
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,541
You already knew?

207
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,583
She told me.

208
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,833
And I knew about Indonesia as well.
Well, I guessed.

209
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,833
And why did you let me lie to you?

210
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,708
I guess it was easier to accept
that you needed an escape than…

211
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,833
ask you whether
our life together bored you,

212
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,041
in case you said "yes," Denver,

213
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,833
because I loved our life together.

214
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,583
A lot.

215
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,875
Me too.

216
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,083
Then why did you lie to me?

217
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,291
I don't know.

218
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,500
I don't…

219
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,750
I guess I was afraid my dad was right.

220
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,083
He always used to say
I wasn't good enough for you.

221
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,666
That I didn't measure up, you know?

222
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,333
He was right.

223
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,708
Who'd want a guy who needs to go to a club
60 miles away from home

224
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,666
to party, get high as a kite,

225
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,416
raise hell,
and fight with the first guy I see?

226
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,916
I was afraid to show you that side of me.

227
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,791
That beast.

228
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,916
I was afraid you'd leave.

229
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,708
-Are they here?
-Yes.

230
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,750
The ectoplasms?

231
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,500
It's not funny.

232
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,750
-I wasn't joking.
-No.

233
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,041
-You know what bugs me?
-What?

234
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,333
Fucking Arturo. He's so annoying.

235
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,583
He's so annoying he even managed
to butt into your psychosis.

236
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,791
I know they're real because, well,

237
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,875
post-traumatic stress,
tension during the heist…

238
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,791
Psychosis. Okay.

239
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:16,000
But since you're having visions…
Why don't you try and see nice things?

240
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,208
-What do you want me to see?
-Something that makes you smile.

241
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:23,166
Anything that won't make you empty clips.
You almost killed me.

242
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,416
Do you know what I'd like to see?

243
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,541
What?

244
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,333
You.

245
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,791
In one of those clubs,
dancing your head off.

246
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,958
-I'm not sure you'd like it.
-Yes.

247
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,333
What about you?

248
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,791
-What about me?
-Dancing.

249
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,750
-Here?
-Yes.

250
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,916
-No.
-Yes, dance for me.

251
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
-No, I can't.
-Why not?

252
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,416
Look at me,
I'm all dirty and wearing red overalls.

253
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,958
I can fix that.

254
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,375
You're going to love it.

00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,208
Approaching the treatment plant.

257
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,750
Come on. Stay alert, and move steadily.

258
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,541
Colonel, we're going underground.

259
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,833
Police!

260
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,000
Police! Everyone get on the ground!

261
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,875
All clear here, Colonel.

262
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,375
Next location.

263
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,833
Hydraulic dam. I repeat, hydraulic dam.

264
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:02,750
Well?

265
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:15,625
My God.

266
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,250
I'm going to the main door
to defuse the last explosives.

267
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,041
Roger that. Keep me informed.

268
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,500
Unit 2 approaching the hydraulic dam.

269
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,125
Let's go.

270
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,083
Unit 2 entering the dam, sir.

271
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,125
Watch out for the bifurcations.

272
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,916
-Roger that.
-Roger that.

273
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:22,666
Now.

274
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,708
Stop, police! Get on the ground!

275
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,125
Hands up!

276
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,250
There are two suspects at close range.

277
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,958
-What's going on?
-Get back!

278
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,500
Don't move! On the ground!

279
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:36,791
It's not them, sir.

280
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:37,833
Shit!

281
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,875
Next location.

-Cheers! To the 90 tons.
-To the 90 tons, sweetie.

284
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:20,833
Guys.

285
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,916
I want a city name.

286
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,291
This late in the game?

287
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,375
Well…

288
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,625
If it ends badly and we get arrested,

289
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,458
what will they say on TV?
"They've arrested Palermo, Rio,

290
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,708
Manila, Bogotá…

291
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:42,500
and Matías Caño."
I sound like a fucking intern.

292
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,875
Have you thought of a name?

293
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,541
Pamplona.

294
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:53,625
You nailed it.

295
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:56,500
It's the perfect name
for a crook like you.

296
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:02,000
-What's wrong with "Pamplona"?
-Find something stronger, more memorable.

297
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,250
Something that can be said in one go.

298
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,208
Rio.

299
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,458
Sweetie, "Manila."
Manila is exotic, sexy, burlesque…

300
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,000
-"Sydney."
-"Palermo."

301
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,375
Palermo is taken.

302
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,250
-"Marrakesh."
-"Charbonier."

303
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,291
But have you ever been to Pamplona?

304
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,916
The wildest festival in the world
is held there, Sanfermines.

305
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,833
Even the Japanese come for the bull-run,

306
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:28,541
and Hemingway wrote a novel
that's studied at colleges in the States.

307
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,583
Do you know the title?

308
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,041
-No.
-The Sun Also Rises.

309
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,833
It's called The Sun Also Rises!

310
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:37,166
You want to party until dawn?
Then go to the Sanfermines.

311
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,791
-Fine, "Pamplona" it is!
-To Pamplona!

312
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,750
-To Pamplona, what the hell.
-Come on.

313
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:44,916
-Pamplona it is.
-That's right.

314
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,833
-No problem.
-To Pamplona.

315
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:52,416
Don't worry,
Tatiana just went up to her room.

316
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,791
Good evening.

317
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,583
I'll have a negroni, please.

318
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,125
Do you know what elegance is?

319
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,583
Look at that.

320
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:08,333
When you see a guy like that,
dapper, immaculate,

321
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,416
you can say, "I'd fuck his wife"

322
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,458
without ever seeing her.

323
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,666
Because you're absolutely convinced

324
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,958
that woman is amazing.

325
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,041
And that's why you slept with my wife.

326
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,750
Although you should be the one
to seduce the women.

327
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:32,333
I'm not sure it should be your father
who seduces women on your behalf.

328
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,250
I couldn't help it.

329
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:46,708
I wish it had been me who told you
about the whole situation, but…

330
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:51,666
I couldn't help it, Dad. I'm sorry.
I just couldn't.

331
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:00,708
Since when?

332
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,583
It's been two weeks.

333
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:06,375
Three.

334
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:08,791
Three weeks.

335
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:12,458
Then what we had
wasn't robust and strong enough

336
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:16,833
to resist the sweeping winds
of a fleeting lover.

337
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:18,916
A fleeting lover?

338
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,541
Really, Dad?

339
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,458
A fleeting lover?

340
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,375
Maybe Tatiana's head over heels
in love with me.

341
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,666
You didn't consider that option, did you?

342
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,833
I'm really in love with her, Dad.

343
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,083
Really.

344
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,291
As strange as it may seem,
this is a true love story.

345
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,083
It was fate.

346
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,125
Look at that.

347
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,166
This is the first time I feel like
you're going to measure up.

348
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,916
I would've gone after my dad's wife too
if I'd fallen in love with her.

349
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,375
I wouldn't have given it a second thought.

350
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:04,708
I would've broken
the sacred bonds of family,

351
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,750
and respect,

352
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,000
to satisfy my love.

353
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,125
And in that respect, I'm…

354
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,708
very proud of you.

355
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,708
Look who's coming.

356
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,416
I admit, you're better off with him.

357
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,375
An attractive, intelligent,

358
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,208
ambitious and unscrupulous young man,
like his father.

359
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,750
And apparently he's healthy.

360
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:42,208
The only downside
is that short of a year or two,

361
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:46,958
you're not going to get a widower pension
and a huge inheritance.

362
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,416
We had so much fun.

363
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,125
I wish you the best.

364
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,791
Go in peace.

365
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,708
That was the only time
Berlin ever went to prison.

366
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,000
Arrested for vandalism.

367
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,708
And all for a broken heart.

368
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,083
He let them catch him.

369
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,875
On top of that,
he was given a few more months

370
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,708
for some fingerprints found
at the scene of a robbery.

371
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:41,583
But he couldn't care less about prison

372
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,708
when his heart had just been broken.

373
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,166
Santa Justa stormwater tank.

374
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,333
I repeat, that's where they are,
Santa Justa stormwater tank.

375
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,375
Bronze Unit to Tamayo.
We're approaching the exit.

376
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:14,791
Colonel, Suárez speaking.

377
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:17,083
Approaching the stormwater tank.

378
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:33,208
Let's go.
It has to be here! We got it this time!

379
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,833
Police!

380
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,666
They're coming!

381
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,541
Go, grab your weapons!

382
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,500
They're coming!

383
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,375
Grab the weapons, for fuck's sake.

384
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,750
Professor, take shelter. Grab the gun.

385
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,000
Grab the gun.

386
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,041
Grab the gun!

387
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,791
Professor! What's wrong? Wake up!

388
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:45,041
-They're coming! Grab the gun!
-No.

389
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,041
No, drop the gun.

390
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,916
Drop the weapons!

391
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,083
-It's just four cars. We can take them.
-No.

392
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,375
Now it's four cars.

393
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:57,875
Then it'll be ten, then 50, then the army.
Don't you get it?

394
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:00,958
They found out we're here.
We can't do anything.

395
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:03,458
They know we're here.
There's nothing we can do.

396
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,625
Benjamín, nothing!
Do you hear me? Drop them.

397
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:11,041
Didn't you hear me? Drop your weapons!

398
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,500
Let's defend ourselves!

399
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,500
No.

400
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,416
-Move over.
-Please, Marseille, don't.

401
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,208
I didn't surrender
when they arrested Lisbon.

402
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:23,458
I didn't do it
when the army entered the bank,

403
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,833
or when fucking Gandía killed Nairobi!

404
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,541
-You're going to do it now.
-No.

405
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:28,625
It's an order!

406
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,541
Sergio, they killed Tokyo!

407
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,583
Marseille, listen to me.

408
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,958
-I'm not going to cause a massacre.
-No.

409
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,625
I won't let people die
for something that's already lost.

410
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:44,541
No!

411
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,250
It's already lost.

412
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,125
It's already lost.

413
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,500
Stop! Get on the ground!

414
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,666
On the ground!

415
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:53,583
Don't move!

416
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,916
Don't move!

417
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,791
I just got out of prison.

418
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,125
You came to pick me up, brought me here,

419
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:55,833
and you spent 98 miles
in complete silence.

420
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,875
There's nothing you want to know?

421
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,833
Maybe I was raped in the showers.

422
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:08,083
Or maybe I got Mom's name tattooed
on my bicep.

423
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,541
You let them catch you.

424
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,333
You've pulled off 27 heists in Europe,

425
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:18,541
but that day you destroyed a cocktail bar
in Madrid and let them catch you.

426
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,708
The negroni was terrible.
I couldn't allow such a disgrace.

427
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,583
Losing my son broke my heart.

428
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,541
I can understand my wife betraying me.

429
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,708
Or my business partner, even my son.

430
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:38,958
But I lost him,

431
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,625
right when I decided

432
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,500
to admit he existed for the first time.

433
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:52,750
That's something
failure throws in your face

434
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,916
when something in your life isn't right.

435
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:59,625
But it's failure…

436
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,500
…that defines a man.

437
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:09,541
Some behave pusillanimously.

438
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,500
Some accept it.

439
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,125
Others rebel against it,

440
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,291
but without dignity.

441
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:18,875
And others

442
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,666
can't help but destroy everything

443
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,583
in order to have another life.

444
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,083
I swear…

445
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:34,833
I'm determined

446
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:37,583
to squeeze every second
out of the life I have left.

447
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:38,875
Every last drop.

448
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,291
That's why, now, I want to help you

449
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,708
pull off the heist of a lifetime.

450
00:41:54,541 --> 00:42:00,041
Before I die, you and I are going to rob
the Royal Mint of Spain.

451
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,041
God!

452
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,958
God!

453
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,625
God!

454
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,083
God!

455
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,666
Little brother!

456
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,750
God!

457
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,750
How long will we get?

458
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,666
A thousand years.

459
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:09,458
-How long have we been here?
-Fifteen or twenty minutes.

460
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:14,041
They should have taken us
into police custody.

461
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:16,125
Exactly.

462
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:19,666
They'll be waiting for forensics.

463
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,208
We can only hear police sirens.

464
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:27,750
We can hear the walkie-talkies,
but not the cars.

465
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,041
Why can't we hear more cars?

466
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:41,083
Why won't the police be waiting for us?

467
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:45,166
That's an excellent question, Sergio,
but we do have the answer.

468
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,208
Yes, we'll get the gold out

469
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,958
through the only place we can, but…

470
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,625
not in the direction
the police will expect.

471
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,083
It's a wastewater tank.

472
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,791
Suárez, go get them! They're in there!

473
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,333
-Police!
-We got them!

474
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,416
Colonel, the stormwater tank is empty.

475
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,625
Fuck, no way.

476
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:12,000
Logically, we should take advantage
of the gentle river slope

477
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:16,208
and get the gold out that way,
but that would be too easy.

478
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:19,750
It's the last place
the channels flow into. I don't get it!

479
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,250
How can it be?

480
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:25,583
Then, we'll take advantage
of the 5,000 kilowatts of our pump

481
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,291
to push the gold

482
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,541
almost 11 miles upstream.

483
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:34,750
We'll get the gold up the river,
like fucking salmons,

484
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:36,583
to the stormwater tank.

485
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:39,000
That, my dear,
is something no one expects.

00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:42,791
We've combed 16 miles of pipes
with metal detectors and found nothing.

487
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:44,875
Not the police, not the CNI,

488
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,541
not even
the Spanish National Research Council.

489
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,541
No one.

490
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:51,125
It's impossible for 90 tons of gold
to leave no trace.

491
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,541
They didn't get it out that way, fuck!

492
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:57,125
Then where is it?
They couldn't get it out any other way!

493
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,833
Someone tell me
where that fuck that gold is!

494
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,083
LOS MIGUELES STORMWATER TANK

495
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,291
What are you doing?

496
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,500
My baby!

497
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:19,833
It's my baby!

498
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:21,625
Fuck!

499
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,000
Kick it!

500
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:46,833
Victoria.

501
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,583
Our gold's been stolen.

502
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,958
-We did it!
-We did it!

503
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:56,625
