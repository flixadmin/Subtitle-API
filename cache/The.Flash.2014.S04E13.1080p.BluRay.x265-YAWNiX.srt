1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:06,212
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,294
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,172
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,050
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,181
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,055
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,313
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,898
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,476
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,062
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,149
These tears are just more than water,
it's like a love drug.

12
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,111
I think I can read minds.

13
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,321
<i>Cecile's a telepath.</i>

14
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,657
That's way more important
than getting Allen out of prison.

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,663
Cecile filed an appeal last week.

16
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,745
We have no new evidence,
so that doesn't matter.

17
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,828
Did you know
the oscillating cameras

18
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:48,913
aren't the only ones in this wing?

19
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,415
You're the Flash.

20
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,296
You said to call you
when I was ready to do business.

21
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,378
Do you have another fish to sell me?

22
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,513
Welcome to my own personal meta-block.

23
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,854
Built on the ruins
of the first Iron Heights,

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,353
completely off the books
and camera-free.

25
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,685
Yes, yes, less history lesson,
more window shopping.

26
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,606
Mina Chaytan.
Her powers bring effigies to life.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,612
Now that is a nifty trick.

28
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,368
Can she animate anything else? Hmm?

29
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,287
- How about my finger?
- Oh!

30
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,740
I like her. She's feisty.

31
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,451
Then you are going to love me.

32
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,161
And I'll come willingly, gorgeous.

33
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,245
Sylbert Rundine.

34
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,797
He can shrink objects
and return them to original size.

35
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,966
I know a drug smuggler who would pay
a pretty pence for that man.

36
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,671
Ramsey Deacon, controls technology.

37
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,887
And Becky Sharpe can manipulate luck
on the quantum level.

38
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,969
I smell a bidding war.

39
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,148
And who might this be?

40
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,317
Something you've been wanting
for a long time.

41
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,194
A speedster.

42
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,396
The pièce de résistance.

43
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,861
Terms are the same as always.

44
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,193
Any metas you sell,
we split the profits evenly.

45
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,161
So, who would you like?

46
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:07,455
Oh, well, eenie, meenie,

47
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,086
miny...

48
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,756
All of them!

49
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,677
Drakkar Noir...

50
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,220
Onions...

51
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,390
And liverwurst?

52
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,097
Oh, no.

53
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,232
Earl Cox.

54
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,193
Earl! It's the cops.

55
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,153
It wasn't me! I'll fight
every one of you...

56
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,704
Hiyah! Hiyah!

57
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,699
Oh!

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,041
Hello, Ralphy.

59
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,413
How'd you get in here, Earl?

60
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,496
- The door was unlocked.
- No, it wasn't.

61
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,751
Was after I picked it.

62
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,591
Ow! Oh, look at you,
you went all Zac Efron on me.

63
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,549
What, you drink so many six-packs,
you end up growing one?

64
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,723
Nice suit, Earl.

65
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,928
Ah, thank you, kindly.
Armani knockoff, I love it.

66
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,638
Listen, it's always great seeing you,
but if you'll excuse me,

67
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,268
I've got a very busy day.

68
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,103
Clear your calendar, slim,

69
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,528
'cause I've got a score that will
knock your honey-glazed holiday ham

70
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,946
into next Christmas.

71
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,740
Yeah, I don't think any of those
words mean what you think they do.

72
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,363
How about these words for you?

73
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,578
A rich, old heiress hires me

74
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,372
to find out if her boyfriend,
the pool boy,

75
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,494
is a gold-digger.

76
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,034
Turns out he is.

77
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,621
But pool boy is
willing to share said gold

78
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,166
with someone who can help him
keep up appearances, so to speak.

79
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,217
And that, my friend, is your specialty.

80
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,794
Are you in?

81
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,971
I don't do that kind of stuff anymore.

82
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,639
Ralph Dibny's gone straight.

83
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,467
You serious?

84
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,974
I got friends now. They're good people.

85
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,685
Helped me turn over a new leaf.

86
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,310
- Are they now?
- Yeah.

87
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,857
We'll see.

88
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,273
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

89
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,027
I love you, Ralphy, I really do.

90
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,987
But you let people down.

91
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,372
Especially the good ones.

92
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,493
They get close to you,
place their trust in you,

93
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,290
and then, bam,

94
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,837
you screw up.

95
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,377
Every single time.

96
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,297
So when you let your new friends down,

97
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,845
give your old one a call.

98
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,267
Thanks for coming, Cecile.

99
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,974
I know Barry isn't too optimistic
about the appeal hearing.

100
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,560
Don't lose hope, Iris,
we still have a few days to prepare.

101
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,987
I know, but it's not like
we've come up with any new ideas

102
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,109
for clearing Barry's name.

103
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,327
A bigger issue is,
we don't seem to have Barry.

104
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,991
Mrs. West-Allen.

105
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,071
Warden Wolfe.

106
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,407
Unfortunately, you won't be able to
see your husband today.

107
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,617
He was in an altercation.

108
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,996
What, an altercation?

109
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,169
- A prison yard fight.
- What? Is he okay?

110
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,416
He's fine. He's fine.

111
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,214
He wasn't harmed and he wasn't at fault.

112
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,711
But per Iron Heights protocol,

113
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,089
everyone involved
is in isolation for the week.

114
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,422
- And is he safe there?
- He couldn't be more safe.

115
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,261
Actually,
it's a pretty common occurrence.

116
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,681
<i>Safe until midnight.</i>

117
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,388
<i>Then Allen and the others
belong to Amunet.</i>

118
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,061
The important thing to know is,
he's in good hands.

119
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,484
- You can rest easy at night.
- Thank you, Warden.

120
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,402
Yes, thank you.

121
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,116
What's wrong?

122
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,577
Wolfe is trafficking meta-humans?

123
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,405
Is everybody crooked in this town?

124
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,579
Ah, he always did look smug
in those Italian wool suits.

125
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,956
Oh, my God, he's literally a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

126
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,541
It's kind of the perfect partnership.

127
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,499
I mean, Amunet deals in metas
and Wolfe has a prison full of them.

128
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,960
And him being the warden,
he can make some inmates disappear

129
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,129
without raising any eyebrows.

130
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm gonna go talk to Singh.

131
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,756
And say what?

132
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,431
Your pregnant girlfriend with
gestational psychic powers told you?

133
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,682
Joe, Singh's just gonna think

134
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,934
that you're a father desperate
to get his son out of prison.

135
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,640
Well, if we don't figure out
something before midnight,

136
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,941
that's exactly what I'm gonna say.

137
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,859
Hey, where's Harry? He can help.

138
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,316
He went to Earth-2.
He's checking in on Jesse.

139
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,568
So...

140
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,773
Great.

141
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,404
Okay, we're out of legal options,

142
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,453
and Cisco can't breach Barry
out of the meta-wing,

143
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,576
so how do we stop this?

144
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,700
Hey, guys. Got your alert.
Sorry I'm late.

145
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,751
- It's okay, Ralph.
- No, it's not okay.

146
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,545
I ran into this old
business partner of mine.

147
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,964
This guy, he's a big, fat creep.

148
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,884
He's always sticking his nose
in my business.

149
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,052
Oh, my.

150
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,926
And he's so shady.

151
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,925
He's got these beady eyes
and this crooked smile.

152
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,636
He's just
a real two-faced rat from head to toe.

153
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,392
- Well, freaky.
- What?

154
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,316
He's a two-faced rat, he is.

155
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,320
What's wrong with my voice?

156
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,690
Do you hear that?

157
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,150
Um...

158
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,408
That's him, right there.

159
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,958
That's him. Do you see him?
That's him. That's him! That's him!

160
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,959
Right there.

161
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,086
That's me.

162
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,709
That's me.

163
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,213
Why is that me?

164
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,926
You somehow willed your body to
shape-shift into Earl's appearance.

165
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,349
Seems like your cells can do
a lot more than just elongate.

166
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,017
Ugh, brilliant!

167
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,603
How do you undo it?
Undo this? That? This?

168
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,975
Control Z?

169
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,557
Control Z...

170
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,284
Guys, I think I just figured out
how to stop Warden Wolfe.

171
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,239
If Ralph could shape-shift
into Braveheart here,

172
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,164
then he could easily
shape-shift into Wolfe

173
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,616
and meet Amunet before midnight.

174
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,043
And call off the whole deal
before it ever even happens.

175
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,119
Right.

176
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,248
I can call off what now?

177
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,264
If he doesn't stop soon,
I'm gonna ask to be sold early.

178
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,634
Being a meta-prisoner or a meta-pet,

179
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,226
what's the difference?

180
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,061
The difference is Amunet Black.

181
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,932
She captures metas,
sells them to the highest bidder.

182
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,608
Mob bosses, drug traffickers, gangs.

183
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:10,063
Just imagine how our powers
could be used in the wrong hands.

184
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,943
I ain't gonna be nobody's weapon.

185
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,149
We gotta get out of here!

186
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,984
Agreed. But how?

187
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,500
Wolfe and Amunet's latest
criminal undertaking

188
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,207
throws an annoying wrench in our plans.

189
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,872
What shall we do?

190
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,299
I don't know.

191
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,963
You... You don't know?

192
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:40,222
My mind is consumed by a near
infinite web of variables,

193
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,554
more plentiful than there are atoms
in an exploding star.

194
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:47,187
So, for the moment, I do not know.

195
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,313
I fail to see the humor in this.

196
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,483
I heard that. In your mind,

197
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,910
a flash of stimuli racing through
your ventromedial prefrontal cortex

198
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,239
where belief is formed. And doubt.

199
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,915
I don't have any doubt.

200
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,210
And if you had asked
instead of reading my mind,

201
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,374
then you would know.

202
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,919
I do know.

203
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:18,259
As for your earlier inquiry,
it's not about what we're going to do.

204
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,598
It's about what Barry Allen
is going to do.

205
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,467
<i>Sitter, how goes it?</i>

206
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,299
Hold your horses, almost done.

207
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,362
Looks like the trap got clogged
with a bunch of hair.

208
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,360
I'll head underneath,
make sure the stack is clear.

209
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,903
- Good to go.
- Thank you.

210
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,344
Okay, how's this?

211
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,549
You know that painting in <i>IT,</i>
the one that comes to life?

212
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,633
It's like that.

213
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,855
This is impossible.

214
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,400
We might as well just gift-wrap Barry,
hand him to Amunet and call it a day.

215
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,024
No, Ralph, this is not impossible.

216
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,902
Your polymerized cells
are linked to your thoughts.

217
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,780
You should be able to change
into anyone you can think of.

218
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,408
Just like when you squeezed
your belly into abs.

219
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,285
Okay, first off,
I have been working out.

220
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,957
This is au naturel now.

221
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,579
And second, that was just some abs.

222
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,336
This is an entire person.

223
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:17,549
Look, when I first learned how to vibe,

224
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,337
I had to learn how to clear my mind
of all other thoughts.

225
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,888
You think you can do that?

226
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,388
Okay, uh, all right. I'll try.

227
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,310
Do better than "try"!

228
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,265
Barry's life is in your hands,
and we're all counting on you.

229
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,528
I think what you meant to say was,
"No pressure, Ralphy."

230
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:41,153
- Here we go!
- All right. Focus. Be Wolfe.

231
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,528
Be the Wolfe.

232
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,363
Big, bad Wolfe.

233
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,967
Oh, wow, sweet chiseled cheekbones,
I did it.

234
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,962
Wow, maybe I can save Barry.

235
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,297
Oh, uh-oh.

236
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,927
Uh, a little help?

237
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,471
Next, we need to
work on his motor skills.

238
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:14,495
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

239
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,851
Well done, boy.

240
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,600
And hey, for the record,

241
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,229
I was already planning on making
that stuff that you used, so...

242
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,526
Sure, right after your lunch tray
crowbar method.

243
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,109
Can we continue on with the breaking
and exiting, please?

244
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,281
You want us to follow a cop
on a prison break?

245
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,700
I'm not a cop in here. I'm a prisoner.

246
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,699
And I'm not about to let Amunet
turn me into a weaponized slave.

247
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,405
- Are you?
- Okay.

248
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,741
- You convinced me. Let's go.
- I'm staying.

249
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,622
What? Why?

250
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,829
Because I don't wanna hurt anyone else.

251
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,545
Last time I was out there,
I almost destroyed the whole city.

252
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,968
- Yeah, she can stay.
- No, we're all leaving.

253
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,719
Becky, if Amunet sells you,

254
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,141
your powers will be used
to hurt a lot of people.

255
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,311
The only way to prevent that
is to escape with us.

256
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,022
Please, trust me.

257
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,358
Yay, one big happy. Now what?

258
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,902
Wolfe said that this wing
was built on top of the old prison.

259
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,369
I also heard the plumber talking
about piping underneath us.

260
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,745
Once we're far enough away
from the meta-wing,

261
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,250
we'll get our powers back.

262
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,083
That's how we get our freedom.

263
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,769
Ew...

264
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,643
My bad, tiny.

265
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,400
Hey, as soon as we get out,

266
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,356
I'll steal you
a brand-new pair of Timmy Choos.

267
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,031
It's Jimmy. I'm size six.

268
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,237
You're so sweet.

269
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,239
If you want to use your powers
for something useful,

270
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,700
you can help me steal back
some native artifacts.

271
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,285
If you two plan on going back to crime,

272
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,745
you might as well just turn around.

273
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,081
Flash will just run you back here.

274
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,415
Same goes for all of you.

275
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,671
Don't look at me, I'm reformed.

276
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,753
From now on I only commit legal crime.

277
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,091
"Legal crime"?

278
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,098
- The stock market.
- Come on. We have a long way to go.

279
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,845
Augmentation is complete.

280
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,522
Your chair will serve its purpose.

281
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,148
You have outdone yourself once again.

282
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:16,322
<i>Well, I think I'm going
out of my head...</i>

283
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,827
That melody in your head...

284
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,122
You don't recognize it?

285
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,959
- It was playing...
- The first time we danced.

286
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,456
Yes.

287
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,917
So you do remember.

288
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,345
June 27th, 1997 at 8:13 p.m.

289
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,516
In the countryside
in the small hamlet of Boars Hill.

290
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,265
That was also the first time we kissed.

291
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,521
And the first time I realized

292
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,599
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life by your side.

293
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,437
Marlize, I forget nothing.

294
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:54,865
Perhaps our song was once
at the forefront of my consciousness,

295
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,866
but now...

296
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,658
<i>Think I'm going out of my head</i>

297
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,917
That song playing in your head makes
it difficult to read your thoughts.

298
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,131
Quite difficult.

299
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,091
Perhaps that's on purpose.

300
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,630
Of course not.

301
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,216
Of course not.

302
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:21,433
I know this unforeseen change
concerns you,

303
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,888
but fear not.

304
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,316
Once this next phase is complete,

305
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,692
I will erase every doubt from your head.

306
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,910
Wolfe-man to S.T.A.R.
- base, I'm in.

307
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,873
Ralph, to help you stay as Wolfe,
I'm gonna hand you over to Joe, okay?

308
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,457
He's gonna quarterback.

309
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,543
- Ralph, you copy?
- Yep.

310
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,670
So what's the next move?

311
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,301
Preferably something
without a lot of moving.

312
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,348
Okay, Amunet's point man is Norvok,

313
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,767
so you're gonna have to
talk to him first.

314
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,516
Grab a drink. Act like a hard-ass.

315
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,722
Barkeep?

316
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,683
Something cold and frosty,
if you please.

317
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,392
Jeez.

318
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,190
That's on you, bro.

319
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,407
Snake's on the brain. Five o'clock.

320
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,914
Stay focused, Ralph.
No distracting thoughts.

321
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,203
Gingold on the rocks.

322
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,872
Hand it to me, please.

323
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,292
What the hell are you doing here?

324
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,723
I'd like to talk to Amunet, please,
about the deal.

325
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,468
You can talk to Amunet at the deal.

326
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,563
Damn it, Ralph.
Nobody talks to Wolfe like that.

327
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,891
<i>He's the warden of the most
dangerous prison in the Midwest.</i>

328
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,016
Demand some respect.

329
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,688
Listen, you lapdog.

330
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,447
Set up the meeting with your boss, now.

331
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,151
Or I'll pull out your eye snake
and strangle you with it, understood?

332
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,986
All right. All right.

333
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,580
Let me see what I can do.

334
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,502
Oh, God.

335
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,137
- Sup?
- Ralph, are you okay?

336
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,809
Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah.

337
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,307
No problem here.

338
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,224
I'm definitely holding it together.

339
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,731
Yeah, that doesn't sound too convincing.

340
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,769
I have complete control
of the situation.

341
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,405
<i>Ol' Dibny won't let his friends down.</i>

342
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,655
Wolfe.

343
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,784
Amunet's ready.

344
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,455
Then let's not keep her waiting.

345
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,548
Are you sure this is the right way?

346
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,254
You hear the water in this sewer drain?

347
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,885
It's moving in this direction.

348
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,547
We keep going this way,
we'll head away from the prison,

349
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,757
find our exit.

350
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,058
Wow, good catch.

351
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,553
You must have been a really smart CSI.

352
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,314
A CSI who killed a teacher
in his own apartment,

353
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,107
and left evidence everywhere.

354
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,652
Yeah, doesn't sound so smart to me.

355
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,525
Hey, speaking of,
maybe we shouldn't be...

356
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,859
Crap.

357
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,448
Hey, easy! Easy. Rundine.

358
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,699
Easy.

359
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,452
If we let him go, he will out us.

360
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,908
- We can't do that, can we?
- Deacon...

361
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,251
What are you doing?
No, we can't hurt him!

362
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,295
We have to do more than hurt him.
We don't have a choice.

363
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,840
No. Hey, we do not have to kill him.

364
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,167
Yes, we do.

365
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,430
No, we don't.
All right, just duct-tape him.

366
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,683
Come on, let's move.

367
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,848
It looked like it hurt.

368
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,017
Ding, ding.

369
00:19:56,112 --> 00:20:00,527
Boys, have some orange slices.
Mommy needs to work, okay?

370
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,524
Warden.

371
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,662
I'm going to assume this is not
one of those good emergency meetings.

372
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:11,041
A few hours before
major criminal undertaking.

373
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,868
- We have to delay the deal.
- What?

374
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,921
My ears outside tell me
the police have been tipped.

375
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,122
I don't know how.

376
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,799
Maybe CCPD hacked into the cameras.

377
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,590
You said there were no cameras.

378
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,012
- I did?
- Mmm...

379
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,215
Yes, I did say that.

380
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,892
But then, afterwards, I installed a few.

381
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,855
- Did you?
- Mmm.

382
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,224
Hmm...

383
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,236
Something seems off
with the big, bad Wolfe.

384
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,614
If you even are Wolfe.

385
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,820
Stay in it. She's testing you.

386
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,080
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

387
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,949
I'm the same man
you've always dealt with.

388
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,586
Okay. And who would that be?

389
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,831
The one who gives you your merchandise.

390
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,919
And trust me,

391
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,876
you need me a lot more than I need you.

392
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,713
So when I say
the deal has to be delayed,

393
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,640
it's because the deal has to be delayed.

394
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,844
Okay.

395
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,854
What the hell?

396
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:22,854
What?

397
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,991
You know, sometimes I hate
being right all the time.

398
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,654
Ralph, get out of there.

399
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,952
Uh...

400
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,874
Damn it!

401
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,425
Get me Wolfe, yeah?

402
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,099
I understand your concern, Amunet,

403
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,768
but you have my word.

404
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,891
Your metas are exactly
where they're supposed to be.

405
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,599
Locked up tightly in their cells,
waiting for you to claim them.

406
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,400
Very good. I'll see you then.

407
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,231
Find them!

408
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,206
I mean, there has to be another way.

409
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,624
There isn't.

410
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,373
There is one card left to play.

411
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,797
Go to Iron Heights
and stop the deal before it happens.

412
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,465
You're talking about finding Amunet,

413
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,636
plus a prison full of
armed meta-guards on their turf.

414
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,257
This is the only option we have left.

415
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,553
You guys can do this.

416
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,014
Let's go.

417
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,140
Ralph.

418
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,431
Yeah, maybe not this time.

419
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,891
What, why?

420
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,402
Look, you're gonna have a better
chance saving Barry without me.

421
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,313
Ralph, you know that isn't true.

422
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,690
I just screwed everything up.

423
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,696
You know what could happen
if I screw it up again?

424
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,902
You won't.

425
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,828
Okay, you know what?
Maybe we just need to talk this out.

426
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,325
Let's go visit with Dr. Hallway.
Come on.

427
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,331
Look, talk's not gonna fix my head.

428
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,794
I just can't do it this time, guys.

429
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,914
Sorry I let you down.

430
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,086
Hey! Hey, Ralph!

431
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,552
Looks like we're finally
in the old prison.

432
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,931
We must be close.

433
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,721
Maybe closer than we think.

434
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,272
I know this lock.

435
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,600
It's the same kind they use
in the general population wing.

436
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,227
Which means there are no meta-dampeners

437
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,565
on the other side of this door.

438
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,064
We get through, we get our powers back.

439
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,492
Well, that's all I needed to hear.

440
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,239
Out of the way.

441
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,827
You good?

442
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,871
No brains, no brawn.

443
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,418
Allow me.

444
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,417
I may not have my powers...

445
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,636
But I don't need them
to hack my way out of trouble.

446
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,797
Give me a few minutes.

447
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,506
Come here.

448
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,888
I'm fine. It doesn't really hurt.

449
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,184
Are you sure?

450
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,021
- I mean, it hurts a little.
- Yeah, come here.

451
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,858
- There.
- Thanks.

452
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,902
Guess I forgot what it feels like

453
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,945
to punch someone in the face
without my powers.

454
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,653
Judging by the swelling,
I'd say

455
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:17,283
you have a fracture on either
the fourth or fifth metacarpal.

456
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,579
I used to fall down a lot. Super klutz.

457
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,254
So what are you gonna do
when you're free?

458
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,544
I hope it's not more of what you did
to get you in here.

459
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,633
Oh, no, trust me.

460
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,092
I am so over prison jumpsuits.

461
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,849
Orange is not the new anything.

462
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,469
Neither is gray. Neither is gray. So...

463
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,557
So, what then?

464
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,431
I don't know.

465
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,810
Using my powers
just hurt those around me.

466
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,567
My good luck just jinxed everyone else.

467
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,743
You know, you seem to really care
about people.

468
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:03,868
Not like the type of person
who'd take someone's life.

469
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,128
I didn't kill that teacher.

470
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,709
I wouldn't take a life.

471
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,761
You know, not every meta
uses their powers to hurt people.

472
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,716
Some use them to help others,
to protect people.

473
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,760
Our powers don't decide who we are.

474
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,553
We do.

475
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,360
Ralph? Hey, Ralph, you in here?

476
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,654
Ugh, the light, it burns.

477
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,448
All right, come on. Time to get up.

478
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,579
I can't. I'm dead.

479
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,414
Okay, I don't know
what's going on with you,

480
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,537
but I'm betting it has something
to do with the reason

481
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,539
you literally fell apart at the bar.

482
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,997
I told Cisco that a talk from him
is not going to help.

483
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,129
So a talk from you
is not going to help either, Caitlin.

484
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,423
Okay.

485
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,425
I'll get somebody else.

486
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:00,848
Hey.

487
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,273
Hello, stretch.

488
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,408
They call me "man who elongates" now.

489
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,574
Hmm. They should call you pathetic.

490
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,491
So you screwed up, get over it.

491
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,410
You are a mean lady.

492
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,416
I'm just telling you
what you need to hear.

493
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,372
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna miss you
when you leave.

494
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,379
"Leave"? Is that what this is about?

495
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,130
Well, yeah.

496
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,844
Everybody leaves Ralph Dibny eventually.

497
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,297
That's how this whole thing works.

498
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,558
I screw up big time and they take off.

499
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,434
This time, the people
who are gonna leave

500
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,517
are actually my friends.

501
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,520
They're the first ones that I've had
in a really long time.

502
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,647
That's stupid.

503
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,657
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
expect you to understand.

504
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,234
You kidnap and stab all your friends.

505
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,196
Right, I'm the queen of letting
these people down.

506
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,823
But you know what, they're still here.

507
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,957
No matter how much I disappoint them,
they still show up for me.

508
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,457
I don't really understand it,

509
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,710
but I think it's part of this
whole friends thing.

510
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:20,842
So, unless you do something worse
than kidnap and stab them,

511
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,718
I think you're gonna be just fine.

512
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,224
- You really think so?
- Yes, I do.

513
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,176
Huh.

514
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,056
You know, that
actually wasn't a bad pep talk.

515
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,434
Well, it's your turn next time.

516
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,440
If I ever decide
to go full villain again,

517
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,237
you can give me the lame heart-to-heart.

518
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,364
"Full villain."

519
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,570
Wait.

520
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,028
Wait.

521
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,909
I know how to fix this!

522
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,332
I gotta see a girl about a guy.

523
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,126
Thank you, Frosty Oprah.

524
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,011
Presto.

525
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,432
Everyone's powers work?

526
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,648
Yep.

527
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:15,892
Ah...

528
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,943
I can smell all the tech
within five miles of here.

529
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,574
Thank you, Barry. You saved us.

530
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:24,780
You did good, boy.

531
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,872
Not good enough, it seems.

532
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,508
Everyone back inside
and you'll live to see another day.

533
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,210
I think the only one
who should be worried about

534
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,715
surviving right now is you.

535
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,562
There's no cavalry.

536
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,019
No one's gonna see what happened here.

537
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,022
It's just you and us, Wolfe.

538
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,571
You want revenge? Understandable.

539
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,948
Just one thing.

540
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,653
If you're thirsty for vengeance,
you might wanna start with the Flash.

541
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,666
Barry Allen is the Flash.

542
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,210
The same man who put you behind bars,

543
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,663
and who will no doubt
recapture you after you escape.

544
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,167
That was probably his plan
all along.

545
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,501
Is all that true?

546
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,304
I'm gonna squash you so quick,
you won't even know what hit you.

547
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,053
No, not quick.

548
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,644
Let's take our time.

549
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,643
The Flash on his knees.

550
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,729
I suppose there is justice after all.

551
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,025
Let's see how fast he can run
when he's the size of a flea.

552
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,698
Stop! Stop!

553
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,446
What are you doing, runt?

554
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,322
Deciding who I am.

555
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,871
You're not gonna hurt him.

556
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,707
Join us or get out of the way.

557
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,454
Either way, we're taking him.

558
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,789
Good luck with that.

559
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,186
Told ya.

560
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,992
Shoot to wound.
They're no good to me dead.

561
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,278
They most certainly are not.

562
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,788
Amunet. You're early.

563
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,709
And you are exactly as I suspected.
A liar.

564
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,207
Who's obviously in way over his head.

565
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,791
But no matter,

566
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,127
I will clean up your mess for you.

567
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,296
Step aside, boys.

568
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,927
Mommy needs to work.

569
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,092
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

570
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,848
Not again.

571
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,099
Oh.

572
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,198
DeVoe...

573
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,081
Oh, I don't pay me enough for this.

574
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,125
My powers won't work.

575
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,252
Mine either.

576
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,303
He must have blasted us with something.

577
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,676
Who the hell are you?

578
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,924
I am your destiny.

579
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,033
No!

580
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,664
Help me.

581
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,720
Too late, Mr. Allen.

582
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,608
Oh, what an inconspicuous body.

583
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,145
This will be quite useful.

584
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,577
<i>Not so fast, Warden.</i>

585
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,495
You won't take my body.

586
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,205
I don't want your body.

587
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,748
I want your life.

588
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,104
Goodbye for now, Mr. Allen.

589
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,499
What happened?

590
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,255
DeVoe.

591
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,595
Well, the party's over.

592
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,766
Let's get the hell out of here.

593
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,593
I'm staying.

594
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,845
What? Barry.

595
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,273
I was only willing to do this,

596
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,566
trying to break everybody out,

597
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,938
because Wolfe was gonna sell us.

598
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,315
But that's not gonna happen now.

599
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,484
I'm staying.

600
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,115
Until you find a way to
get me out of here legally.

601
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,449
It's the only way I'd ever
really feel free, you know that.

602
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,994
This could be our only chance
to save you.

603
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,750
We all have to decide who we are.

604
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,496
This is who I am.

605
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,258
<i>Prison breach.</i>

606
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,714
<i>Breakout in progress.</i>

607
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,932
<i>Engage lockdown.</i>

608
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,477
<i>Code Xprison breach.</i>

609
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,851
<i>Repeat, we have a Code X.</i>

610
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,227
Move, move, move!

611
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,647
Stand against the wall!

612
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,112
Cell block secure.

613
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,067
New evidence, Ms. Horton.

614
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,238
That's what you told this court
had come into your possession.

615
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,945
Only I haven't heard it or seen it,

616
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:23,619
nor have the circumstances changed
in any way that would convince me

617
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,162
to move for a retrial.

618
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,453
So unless you have
something more to add,

619
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,876
this appeal hearing is over.

620
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,828
I understand,
Your Honor, I do.

621
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,710
If we could just wait
a few more minutes,

622
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,838
- I am sure that...
- I am tired of waiting.

623
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,050
Either you have something new to add
or you don't.

624
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,056
Which is it?

625
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,394
We have nothing further, Your Honor.

626
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,599
Then I hereby deem
Barry Allen's appeal...

627
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,350
Wait...

628
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,322
DeVoe?

629
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,778
Nope. Not DeVoe.

630
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,996
It's Ralph.

631
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,583
I believe you are looking for me,
Your Honor.

632
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,456
I don't know how any of this happened.

633
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,962
You were found in Barry Allen's loft.

634
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,260
- You were dead.
- I was stabbed.

635
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,595
I heard a voice saying
something about framing someone.

636
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,967
- Then I blacked out.
- It's gonna work.

637
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,559
And this morning,
I woke up in my own home.

638
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,975
Mrs. DeVoe, does any of this
make any sense to you?

639
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,856
No.

640
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,155
I am just as surprised by all of this
as everyone.

641
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,784
Your Honor, the city has had
reports in the past

642
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,954
of people who have appeared dead

643
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,578
only to later emerge very much alive.

644
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,950
That's impossible.

645
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,288
"Impossible"?
Your Honor, is it as impossible as

646
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,840
a man who can run faster than
the speed of sound?

647
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,508
I submit that Central City is home
to the impossible.

648
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,342
I have as many questions as
you have, Your Honor.

649
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,094
And I am looking forward

650
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,555
to working with the authorities
to solve this mystery.

651
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,852
Yes, I'm sure that CCPD
will be very interested in this.

652
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,943
And as for Barry Allen's appeal...

653
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,077
I guess the court must deem that

654
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,531
Clifford DeVoe is alive and well.

655
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,954
Barry Allen is hereby cleared
of all charges

656
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,660
and ordered released from

657
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,247
Iron Heights Penitentiary immediately.

658
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,226
- You're home.
- You're my home.

659
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,560
Aw. He couldn't wait to do that.

660
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,940
How you feeling, Barry? You doin' okay?

661
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,147
I'm feeling great, Dad.

662
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,114
Well, you look like
you can use a good meal.

663
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,864
And don't you worry,
I made a fresh batch

664
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,071
of Grandma Esther's meatloaf.

665
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,656
- Oh, yeah.
- Just like you like it.

666
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,161
Meatloaf? Gross.

667
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:20,163
I just meant meatloaf is a grossly
undervalued menu item

668
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,963
in most restaurants, I think.

669
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,671
You guys, now that I'm free,
I don't care what I do.

670
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,756
I'm just so happy
to be back with all of you again.

671
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,922
Team Flash.

672
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,426
Today, we celebrate Barry.

673
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:37,013
Tomorrow, we go back to
stopping the man that framed you.

674
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,556
I'll drink to that.

675
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,641
Hear, hear.

676
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,062
You okay, Barry?

677
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,612
Yeah, it's DeVoe.

678
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,573
Barry, we're gonna stop him.
I know we will.

679
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,328
No, that's not it. He...

680
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,039
There was nothing keeping him

681
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,539
from going inside the meta-wing
and absorbing the powers

682
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,245
of every meta in Iron Heights.

683
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,502
Peek-a-Boo, Top, Weather Wizard...

684
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,961
I mean, he could have stolen
their powers and more, but he didn't.

685
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,929
He only wants the bus metas,

686
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,718
he wants their powers for something,
all of them.

687
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,052
We know a bus meta.

688
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,231
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

689
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,684
Just couldn't get this left glute
to shape-shift back to

690
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,064
its normal perky...

691
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,481
Why is everyone looking at me
like I'm a dead man?

692
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:39,704
What's all this?

693
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:47,001
After last night's success,
I thought a toast was in order.

694
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,423
"Success"? Is that what
you call last night?

695
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,425
Yes. How would you describe it?

696
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,975
Barry Allen was...

697
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,105
Supposed to remain in
the meta-human wing at Iron Heights.

698
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,399
But he's now free.

699
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,155
Even Team Flash has good luck sometimes.

700
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,565
And the bus metas?

701
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,071
We were supposed to wait
till all of them were captured.

702
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,618
But you only got four.

703
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,867
I said I would retrieve them
from confinement.

704
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,084
I never said when or where.

705
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,259
There is something else on your mind,
isn't there?

706
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,254
Warden Wolfe's death.

707
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,839
He needed to die.

708
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,850
I just don't recall it
being necessary for our plan.

709
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:46,271
<i>Well, I think I'm going
out of my head...</i>

710
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,327
The chair can wait till morning.

711
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,706
For now, to the Enlightenment.

712
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,964
To the Enlightenment.

713
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,052
I love you, Clifford.

714
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,138
Yes. And I, you.

715
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,772
<i>I think I'm going out of my head</i>

716
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,944
<i>Yes, I think I'm going out of my head</i>

717
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:45,968
