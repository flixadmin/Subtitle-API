We got a dead man walking here!

PAUL: Percy.

171
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,119
That's enough.

172
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,770
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

173
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,901
Can you talk?

174
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,906
(GASPS)

175
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,952
(STUTTERS) Yes, sir, boss.
I can talk.

176
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,588
Move your ass. Let's go.
(TAPPING STICK)

177
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,340
Come on.

178
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Percy,

179
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,475
they're moving house
down in the infirmary.

180
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,396
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help?

181
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,815
No. They got all
the men they need.

182
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,109
Why don't you just
go and make sure?

183
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:04,987
Uh-uh.

184
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,238
I don't care
where you go, Percy,

185
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,657
just as long as it's not here
at this very moment.

God, you bust my finger.

00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,264
I wiped that grin off your
shit-poked face, didn't I?

193
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,600

get the hell off my block!

Fuck you, Percy.

We're gonna get
that looked at, Del.

198

In the meantime,
you just stay quiet.

Yeah. Yeah.

Oh, you can spell, can you?

If I'm not here, you can ask for Mr.

Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton,
these gentlemen right there.

213

Do you leave

It stays pretty bright
around here all night long.

We always keep a few lights
burning out in the corridor.

The corridor?

219
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,579
Right out there.

I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

224

Dean, pull Delacroix's card,

225
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,146
take him down to the infirmary,

226
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,564
see if those fingers are broken.

227
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,899
Yes, sir.
Of course they're broken.

228
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,776
I heard the bones crack.

229
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,194
Did you hear what he was yelling

230
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,779
when we brought
the big dummy in?

231

How could I miss it, Harry?
The whole prison heard.

232

Goddamn Percy.

233
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,620
You'll probably have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

234
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,414
Hmm. I'll chew that
food when I have to.

Right now I wanna hear
about this new inmate.

Aside from how big he is, okay?

237
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,380
Monstrous big.
(CHUCKLING) Damn.

238

Oh, he seems meek enough.

Is he retarded, you figure?
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,638
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

241
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,099
Imbecile or not, he deserves
to fry for what he done.

I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

who knows what else.

can see on the X-ray,

You didn't come all the way down
here just to hand me a DOE.

288
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,852
I had an angry call from the state
capitol about 20 minutes ago.

Is it true you ordered
Percy Wetmore off the block?

It is.

Now, I'm sure
you had reason, Paul,

292

but like it or not,

293
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,907
the wife of the governor of
this state has only one nephew,

294
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,034
and his name happens
to be Percy Wetmore.

295
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,078
Little Percy calls his aunt,

296
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,206
and squeals like
a schoolroom sissy.

297
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,627
He also mention
he assaulted a prisoner

298
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,629
this morning out
of sheer petulance?

299
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,548
Broke three fingers on Eduard
Delacroix's left hand?

300
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,092
I didn't hear that part.

301
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,134
I'm sure she didn't either.

302
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,428
The man is mean
and careless and stupid,

303
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,722
and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

304
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,934
Sooner or later, he's gonna
get somebody hurt or worse.

305
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,852
Stick with it, Paul.

306
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,646
It may not be much longer.

307
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,815
I have it on good authority

308
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,359
that Percy has an application
in at Briar Ridge.

309
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,153
Briar Ridge?
The mental hospital.

310
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,446
Administration job.

311
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,573
Better pay.

312
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,908
Hmm.

313
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,035
Then why is he still here?

314
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,289
He can get that
application pushed through.

315
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,874
Hmm.

316
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:21,501
Hell, with his connections,

317
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,670
he could have
any state job he wants.

318
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,381
You know what I think?

319
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,427
I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.

320
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,017
Well, he'll get his chance,
then, won't he?

321
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,980
Maybe then he'll be
satisfied and move on.

322
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,690
In the meantime,

323
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,483
you'll keep the peace?

324
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,821
Of course.

325
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,907
(PATTING) Thank you, Paul.

327

you give Melinda my love, okay?

328
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,420
I'm sure that X-ray will
turn out to be nothing at all.

He was found with
the victims in his arms.

985

And yet you defended him.

I'll tell you something.

990
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,106
And you listen close, too,
because it might be something

991
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,659
you need to know.

992

993
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,579
We had us a dog.

994
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:17,708
Just a sweet mongrel.

995
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,292
You know the kind.

996
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:24,089
Well, in many ways, a good
mongrel dog is like a Negro.

997
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,717
You get to know it.

998
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:31,471
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use,

999
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:34,516
but you keep it around because
you think it loves you.

not to be completely blind.

1010

We get down on our knees and thank
God for that much at least.

1011
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,595
Right, Caleb?

1012
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,390

That dog attacked
my boy for no reason.

1016
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,357
Just got it in his mind one day.

1017
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,902
The same with John Coffey.

1018
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:31,156
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

1019
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,909
But those little girls...

1020
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,161
stayed raped and murdered.

1021
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,081
Maybe he'd never done it before.

1022
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,834
My dog never bit before.

1023
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,380
But I didn't concern
myself with that.

1024
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,883
I went out there with my rifle

1025
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,511
and grabbed his collar
and blew his brains out.

1026
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:54,971
Is Coffey guilty?

1027
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,684
Yes, he is.

1028
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:01,186
Don't you doubt it.

1029
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,856
And don't you turn
your back on him.

1030
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,025
You may get away with it once

1031
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,528
or even a hundred times.

1032

But in the end,

1033
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:15,867
you'll get bit.

Come on, now.

1624
01:56:16,136 --> 01:56:17,136
What?

1625
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:20,014
JAN: Very soon we'll just see your
feet sticking out of there, Brutus.

1626
01:56:20,098 --> 01:56:21,599
Y'all saw what
he did to the mouse.

1627
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,688
I could've gone the rest of the
day without you bringing that up.

1628
01:56:27,773 --> 01:56:29,440
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1629
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:31,567
He did the same thing to me.

1630
01:56:32,361 --> 01:56:33,903
He put his hands on me.

1631
01:56:35,238 --> 01:56:36,947
He took my
bladder infection away.

1632
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:45,247
It's true. When he came
home that day, he was...

1633
01:56:47,209 --> 01:56:48,709
all better.

1634
01:56:50,087 --> 01:56:52,171
Oh, now, wait.
You're talking about...

1635
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:54,256
an authentic healing?

1636
01:56:56,259 --> 01:56:57,718
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1637
01:56:58,637 --> 01:56:59,679
I am.

1638
01:57:00,555 --> 01:57:01,639
Oh, yeah.

1639
01:57:02,182 --> 01:57:04,642
Well, if you say it,
I accept it.

1640
01:57:06,269 --> 01:57:07,520
What's it got to do with us?

1641
01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:09,855
You're thinking about Melinda.

1642
01:57:10,315 --> 01:57:11,399
Melinda?

1643
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:13,651
Melinda Moores?

1644
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:15,069
Yeah. So, Paul,

1645
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:16,904
you really think
you can help her?

1646
01:57:17,656 --> 01:57:19,281
It's not a bladder infection

1647
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:21,534
or even a busted mouse,

1648
01:57:22,953 --> 01:57:24,353
but I think there
might be a chance.

1649
01:57:24,454 --> 01:57:25,913
Hold on now.

1650
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:28,040
You're talking about our jobs.

1651
01:57:28,125 --> 01:57:30,376
Sneak a sick woman
into a cellblock?

1652
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,545
Oh, no. No, no. Hal would
never stand for that.

1653
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:36,215
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything if it fell on him.

1654
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:37,550
So you're talking about

1655
01:57:38,468 --> 01:57:39,927
taking John Coffey to her.

1656
01:57:45,726 --> 01:57:47,685
That's more than
just our jobs, Paul.

1657
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:50,563
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1658
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:51,939
You're dang right, it is.

1659
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:53,899
PAUL: No,
not for you, Dean.

1660
01:57:53,984 --> 01:57:57,236
See now, the way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1661
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:58,821
That way,
you can deny everything.

1662
01:57:59,823 --> 01:58:01,157
Why do I have to stay behind?

1663
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:04,827
Well, our boy's grown up,

1664
01:58:05,495 --> 01:58:06,996
gone off to school.

1665
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,165
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1666
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,083
Brutal's a single man.

1667
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:14,420
You're the only one here with two
children, another one on the way.

1668
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:18,174
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1669
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:22,845
Brutal, help me out here.

1670
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:26,599
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1671
01:58:26,683 --> 01:58:28,100
The finest.

1672
01:58:28,185 --> 01:58:30,644
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1673
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:33,230
To the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1674
01:58:33,315 --> 01:58:34,899
I have no doubt.

1675
01:58:36,485 --> 01:58:38,527
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do, do we?

1676
01:58:38,862 --> 01:58:41,655
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1677
01:58:43,158 --> 01:58:44,700
Now, what if he escapes?

1678
01:58:45,285 --> 01:58:48,204
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison,

1679
01:58:48,872 --> 01:58:52,124
but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1680
01:58:52,209 --> 01:58:53,529
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

1681
01:58:55,879 --> 01:58:57,087
In fact,

1682
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:01,342
I don't think he did it at all.

1683
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:06,180
I do not see God

1684
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:10,684
putting a gift like that in the
hands of a man who'd kill a child.

1685
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:12,645
Well, that's a very
tender notion,

1686
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:15,272
but the man is on
death row for the crime.

1687
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:18,400
And plus,

1688
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:20,486
he's huge.

1689
01:59:20,987 --> 01:59:22,613
If he tried to get away,

1690
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:25,761
it'd take a lot of
bullets to stop him.

1691
01:59:26,076 --> 01:59:27,701
Oh, we'd all have shotguns,

1692
01:59:28,078 --> 01:59:29,578
in addition to side arms.

1693
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:31,831
I'd insist on that.

1694
01:59:33,124 --> 01:59:35,918
If he tried anything,
anything at all,

1695
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:37,962
we'd have to take him down.

1696
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:40,089
You understand?

1697
01:59:52,018 --> 01:59:53,102
So...

1698
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:55,271
Tell us what you had in mind.

1699
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:05,030
PAUL: Oh, there it is.
BRUTAL: Oh, I see it.

Boy, howdy.

1708

Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some, too, ain't I?

1709
02:01:11,222 --> 02:01:12,932
My ass, you get some, too.

1710

What makes you think
you deserve any?
