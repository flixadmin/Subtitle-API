<i>The Essex was stove by a white whale.</i>

1364
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,924
<i>And those of us that survived
in ill-equipped whaleboats</i>

1365
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,050
<i>had to commit abominations
in order to survive.</i>

1366
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:56,967
<i>And, on our return,
we're expected to spread barefaced lies</i>

1367
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:00,248
<i>so that you, the ship owners of Nantucket,</i>

1368
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:04,204
<i>might line your pockets
and sleep well at night?</i>

1369
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,442
<i>Well, I will not embroider the truth.</i>

1370
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,449
<i>Nor should you, George.</i>

1371
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,327
<i>NICKERSON: That last time I saw him...</i>

1372
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,720
<i>Mr. Chase, sir!</i>

1373
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,245
<i>I couldn't find the right words
to say what I wanted to.</i>

1374
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,321
<i>Thomas.</i>

1375
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,449
<i>NICKERSON: Perhaps there are no words.</i>

1376
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,807
<i>Um...</i>

1377
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:48,487
<i>I'm gonna be on my way to Falmouth and...</i>

1378
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,406
<i>It's...</i>

1379
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,961
<i>It's been an honor, sir, to sail with you.</i>

1380
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,042
<i>The honor's been mine, Mr. Nickerson.</i>

1381
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,367
<i>Here.</i>

1382
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,565
<i>Good luck out there, Thomas.</i>

1383
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:31,520
<i>And you, sir.</i>

1384
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,530
<i>Next day, George Pollard was called
before the inquiry.</i>

1385
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,322
<i>(CROWD MURMURING)</i>

1386
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,965
<i>MASON: Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.</i>

1387
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,203
<i>NICKERSON: And all the important men
in Nantucket were there.</i>

1388
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,524
<i>It was a formality.</i>

1389
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,844
<i>Good day to you, Captain. Please sit down.</i>

1390
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,125
<i>For the record, then...</i>

1391
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:34,607
<i>The Essex was stove by a white whale
1,200 leagues west of Ecuador.</i>

1392
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:37,885
<i>It was as if Owen Chase himself
had spoken.</i>

1393
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,285
<i>Told them the truth.</i>

1394
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,568
<i>Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.</i>

1395
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,286
<i>But the inquiry was a sham.</i>

1396
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,201
<i>Pollard went out again,</i>

1397
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:59,164
<i>looking for the white whale.</i>

1398
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,120
<i>He never found it.</i>

1399
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,042
<i>He ran a second ship aground off Hawaii.</i>

1400
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,800
<i>Twice cursed.</i>

1401
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:10,687
<i>Never sailed again.</i>

1402
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,321
<i>And Owen Chase?</i>

1403
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:16,009
<i>He was a man of his word.</i>

1404
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:19,127
<i>First, he sent a boat back
to Ducie Island.</i>

1405
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,051
<i>Mr. Joy had passed.</i>

1406
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:25,969
<i>But the other three were,
incredibly, still alive.</i>

1407
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,206
<i>And then?</i>

1408
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:34,488
<i>And then he packed up his family
and moved to New Bedford.</i>

1409
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,005
<i>Started over.</i>

1410
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,251
<i>Became a merchant captain,</i>

1411
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:43,162
<i>sailing on his own terms.</i>

1412
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:55,729
<i>Well, you certainly got your
money's worth, Mr. Melville.</i>

1413
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,760
<i>These February nights
are the longest of the year.</i>

1414
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,843
<i>Well, you can both rest now.</i>

1415
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:02,411
<i>Believe me,</i>

1416
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,688
<i>I shall not be resting for some time.</i>

1417
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:06,686
<i>NICKERSON: Why?</i>

1418
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,284
<i>You got your story.</i>

1419
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,366
<i>You know, your plot. It's all there.</i>

1420
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,162
<i>Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.</i>

1421
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,530
<i>No. What, then?</i>

1422
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,842
<i>- Something else you've given me tonight.
- And what's that?</i>

1423
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,811
<i>The courage to go where
one does not want to go.</i>

1424
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,405
<i>Mr. Melville,</i>

1425
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,566
<i>what you've heard, what I've told you,</i>

1426
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,725
<i>will it all be of service to your book?</i>

1427
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,483
<i>It will be a work of fiction,
Mr. Nickerson,</i>

1428
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:49,450
<i>inspired by truth.</i>

1429
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:54,243
<i>But I don't believe
I'll feel the need to use all of it.</i>

1430
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,289
<i>- Thank you.
- Here.</i>

1431
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:08,762
<i>- Take that with you.
- No. The money is for you. I insist.</i>

1432
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,604
<i>I insist you keep it.</i>

1433
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,526
<i>And I insist one person
in this conversation is sober.</i>

1434
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:29,091
<i>- So it's back to, uh...
- Pittsfield, Massachusetts.</i>

1435
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,490
<i>Well, good luck.</i>

1436
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,441
<i>Thank you.</i>

1437
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,286
<i>You know,</i>

1438
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:43,528
<i>I heard a man from Pennsylvania
drilled a hole in the ground recently</i>

1439
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,125
<i>and found oil.</i>

1440
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,966
<i>That can't be true.</i>

1441
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,921
<i>I heard it, too.</i>

1442
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,124
<i>Oil from the ground.</i>

1443
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,891
<i>Fancy that.</i>
