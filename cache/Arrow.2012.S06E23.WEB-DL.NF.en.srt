{\an8}We rounded up the SCPD,

{\an8}but Diaz still controls
dozens of city officials.

{\an8}Diaz has a list of all of them.
He keeps it on his person.

{\an8}Once we take Diaz, we won't need a list.

59

{\an8}We need to interrogate
all the people we rounded up

{\an8}No, they won't give it up.

00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,744
Go to hell.

161
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,791
[sighs]

162
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,335
What was that?

163
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,298
Nothing. You said you were ready
to move on Diaz tonight.

164
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,968
I'm ready to come down on him
like God's own righteous fury.

165
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,053
Do it.

166
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,891
I don't think your daddy
loves you anymore.

167
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,144
I think if you were the real Laurel,

168
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,688
he'd already be here.

169
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,900
-Go to hell.
-That's a witty response.

170
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,319
I was expecting better.

171
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,947
Do you know what the funny thing is?

172
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,784
You moved on me because of him.

173
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,788
You got yourself in this situation
because of him.

174
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,250
You could have skipped town,
but you came after me.

175
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,588
Were you afraid of what I was
gonna do to your daddy

176
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:09,966
when you were gone?

177
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,927
Huh?

178
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,887
Come on, baby, talk to me.

179
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,306
Talk to me!

180
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,434
We're on site.

181
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,353
The FBI has graciously given me control

182
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,605
of their Key Hole satellites,
which I gotta say

183
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,108
are a lot easier to operate
when they aren't being hacked.

184
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,568
[Agent Watson] All right, listen up.

185
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,736
Diaz may have lost his police force,

186
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,989
but we believe he still has
his personal security

187
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,740
and Quadrant muscle backing him up.

188
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,327
No warning shots. Let's move out.

189
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,260
[Mr. Terrific] If this is where Diaz
is planning on making his last stand,

190
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,845
I would have expected more guys with guns.

191
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,888
[Wild Dog] Not seeing anything.

192
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,683
I'm getting a big thermal reading
from inside the northwest corner.

193
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,435
That's where we're headed. Stand by.

194
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,119
[Wild Dog] Son of a bitch.

195
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,419
-What is it?
-Laser trip wires.

196
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,087
Trip wires for what?

197
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,304
Triacetone triperoxide.
It's the thermal source.

198
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,139
Diaz was never here.

199
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,183
<i>It's a trap.</i>

200
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,521
[Green Arrow] Hang tight,
we're almost at your position.

201
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,773
Negative. If you go in there,

202
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,274
if anybody moves,
the whole place will go up.

203
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,068
[Wild Dog] If we can't move,
we can't get to the bombs.

204
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,111
-How we going to disarm them?
-I am working on that.

205
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,781
-Everyone else just get clear.
-We can't leave Rene.

206
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,282
No, there might be more explosives rigged.

207
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,492
Just please get away from the building.

208
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,618
[Green Arrow] <i>You heard her. Let's go.</i>

209
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,037
Talk to me, blondie.

210
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,914
Tracing a radio signal to the explosives.

211
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,459
In case Diaz gets impatient,
wants to set off bomb himself.

212
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,003
If I can piggyback off the signal,
I might be able

213
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,547
to fool the triggers into thinking
that you're not moving.

214
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,966
"Might"? You can't see this,

215
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,386
but there's enough explosives in here
to send us into orbit.

216
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,804
Pressure is not helping, Rene.

217
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,641
If the bombs can be triggered remotely,

218
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,976
Diaz can kill us anytime.

219
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,479
We're not making it out of here, are we?

220
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,034
Hey, peanut. It's Daddy.

221
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,495
No, everything's fine. I'm safe.

222
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,455
I just wanted to hear your voice

223
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,876
and tell you that I love you,

224
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,629
and I'm so proud of you.

225
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,341
You give my life meaning every single day.

226
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,094
Yeah.

227
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,179
You're my everything, peanut.

228
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,224
And I need you to know that.

229
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,021
Daddy's gotta go. I love you.

230
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,775
I'll see you soon.

231
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,195
Okay. Bye.

232
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,990
[cell phone beeps]

233
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,243
[Green Arrow] Can we
get in through the roof?

234
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,287
Negative. Blowing the roof
will set off the TATP.

235
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,330
Stand by while I clone
the trigger frequency.

236
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,960
[cell phone ringing]

237
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,336
Hello.

238
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,881
[Diaz] <i>So I'm curious. How many did I get?</i>

239
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,340
[speaking Russian]

240
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,635
You betray me, and I'm the son of a bitch?

241
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,430
<i>The ones trapped in there
with those explosives,</i>

242
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,223
they're gonna die in a blink.

243
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,975
<i>But you, Anatoly...</i>

244
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,059
{\an8}[speaking Russian]

245
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,814
[in English] I'm gonna make it last
for days with you.

246
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,066
[beeping]

247
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,319
He triggered the explosives,
but I'm bouncing the signal off

248
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,446
a bunch of satellites.
You have seven seconds.

249
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,864
Move!

250
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,741
[explosion]

251
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,166
Come on!

252
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,645
You okay?

253
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,492
Thought I'd check in on you.

254
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,744
I'm fine, hoss.

255
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,790
Agent Watson told me about
your call with Zoe.

256
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,960
I thought I was gonna die in that room.

257
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,589
I just wanted to say goodbye.

258
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,466
Tell her how proud you are of her?

259
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,760
There's not enough words to say how much.

260
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,765
I feel the same way about you, Rene.

261
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,520
When I first met you, I... [chuckles]

262
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,607
I didn't think you were much more
than a thug...

263
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,151
[chuckles]

264
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,695
...in a ridiculous costume.

265
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,406
No prize yourself, hoss.

266
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,243
I judged you.

267
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,122
For far too long, I judged you,

268
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,083
and that was a mistake.

269
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,169
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,340
I think that you're a good man, Rene.

271
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,261
I think that you're
the type of man that this...

272
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,139
This city deserves.

273
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,059
I know it seems like I don't give
a crap about what anyone thinks,

274
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,229
but this means a lot.

275
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,565
Yeah.

276
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,364
Guys, we have another problem.

277
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,661
I told Diaz to go to hell
because you were about to move on him.

278
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,121
[Anatoly] It was deception.

279
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,290
He learned I was helping you,
and he manipulated me.

280
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,125
[John] It means
we're right back to square one,

281
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,627
not knowing where Diaz is.

282
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,712
But now we have a way to find out.

283
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,175
You tell Diaz you wanna see Laurel.
Proof of life.

284
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,885
We follow you to her, her to Diaz.

285
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,429
You go in there guns blazing,
my daughter takes the first bullet.

286
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,140
From what Oliver tells me,
she's not actually your daughter.

287
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,934
And she's a criminal
that made her own bed.

288
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,771
This isn't a hostage situation.
Our objective hasn't changed.

289
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,856
-Oliver, please...
-We can keep her safe.

290
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,359
How? The first thing he'll do
when he sees you coming is kill her.

291
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,069
I think this is a risk we need to take.

292
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:49,073
Yeah? Would you be taking that risk
if this was our Laurel?

293
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,741
Or is that the kind of risk
that got her killed

294
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,242
in the first damn place?

295
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,582
[cell phone ringing]

296
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,169
What the hell do you want?

297
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,921
To give you a second chance.

298
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:09,009
When you told me to go to hell,
you know, I figured that you figured

299
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,345
your buddies were about to take me down.

300
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,806
Well, it didn't work out that way.

301
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,849
<i>So now we're back to where we started.</i>

302
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,478
You kicking the FBI out of here
in exchange for Laurel's life.

303
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,565
I need to see her first, proof of life.

304
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,234
<i>I'll send you the address.</i>

305
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,695
Listen, you better come alone

306
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,990
'cause if something happens
that I don't like,

307
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,910
something's gonna happen to Laurel
that you don't like.

308
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,755
Anyone ever tell you it's rude
to sneak up on people?

309
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,305
Diaz?

310
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,102
-He's gonna kill her.
-I won't let that happen, Quentin.

311
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,478
[sighs]

312
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,022
What about Watson, huh?

313
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,898
She doesn't seem so important to her.

314
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,942
Just let me worry about Samanda Watson,

315
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,362
and let me try to keep Laurel safe.

316
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,072
I don't see how you can, Oliver.

317
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,991
You can start by trusting me.

318
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,201
Please.

319
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,079
I mean, I've earned it.

320
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,582
We've known each other
for a very long time, Quentin.

321
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,791
[chuckles softly]

322
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,711
-A lifetime.
-Yeah.

323
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,380
We've come a long way, you and me.

324
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,633
It's been getting better since
the first time you arrested me.

325
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,636
You know, I've always been curious.

326
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,264
How did you beat that lie detector anyway?

327
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,641
It just comes down

328
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,770
to keeping a regular heart rate.

329
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,563
I had a pacemaker that does that.

330
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,023
I didn't know you had a pacemaker.

331
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,734
I got it after that Mirakuru business
a few years back.

332
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,736
The old ticker couldn't
take that pounding. [laughs]

333
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,071
Yeah.

334
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,240
Truth be told,
I don't know if it could take it now.

335
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,202
Yes, it can. Okay? Because you're tough.

336
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,912
Laurel is tough too.

337
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,123
So trust me,

338
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,711
and this will all work out.

339
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,905
[Quentin] You're supposed to bring Laurel.

340
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,281
I give the orders.

341
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,783
[henchman] He's clean.

342
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,703
You're gonna give an order as Mayor
to get the FBI out of here.

343
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,123
<i>And you're gonna do it
at a press conference.</i>

344
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,084
Satellite track is clean.
Audio signal is five by five.

345
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,377
Everyone get ready to move.

346
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,587
Not going anywhere until
we know where he's keeping Laurel.

347
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,089
Not our objective.

348
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,882
[Quentin] <i>You want me
to hold a press conference</i>

349
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,968
before you even let me see my daughter?

350
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,678
Do you have a problem with that?

351
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,764
[Quentin]<i>I'm not doing anything
until I see her alive.</i>

352
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,057
What the hell is he doing?

353
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,019
The FBI is tracking me by satellite.

354
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,438
They're gonna move on you
unless we move right now.

355
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,065
Now, take me to my daughter.

356
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,150
Son of a bitch!

357
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,485
Get him in the car.

358
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,072
All units, move now! Go!

359
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,743
[sirens wailing]

360
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,873
-Can your satellite track him?
-I've lost him.

361
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,666
[Agent Watson] Your friend
just blew this whole operation

362
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,293
and our best chance to get Diaz.

363
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,336
And his daughter's still gonna die.

364
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,055
When this is over, I'm bringing your
friend Quentin up for obstruction.

365
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,974
Our immunity arrangement
doesn't extend to him.

366
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,560
-He was trying to save Laurel.
-Well, I'm trying to save this city.

367
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,395
The city your friend's
supposed to be the mayor of.

368
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,189
I can't believe
he'd so something so reckless.

369
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,983
Or stupid. He knows
Diaz will kill him and Laurel.

370
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,986
-What the hell was he thinking?
-He wasn't. That's the problem.

371
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,449
Before Quentin went to see Diaz,

372
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,285
he went out of his way to tell me
that he had a pacemaker.

373
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,912
And he's never told us that before.

374
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,914
So why would he say something now?

375
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,709
-You can track a pacemaker?
-You know I can.

376
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,837
Quentin knew that Diaz's man
was gonna frisk him for a tracker,

377
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,048
just like he knew that
Diaz wasn't going to actually

378
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,633
bring Laurel to the meet.

379
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:23,096
So Quentin had Diaz bring him to her,
knowing that we could track him.

380
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,724
How long would it take you to find him?

381
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,601
Give me a high speed connection
and a few minutes.

382
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,020
[Quentin groans]

383
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,231
[Diaz] You wanted to see her,
now you see her.

384
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,107
I'm a man of my word.

385
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,819
Great. Now, let her go.

386
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,738
I just promised proof of life.

387
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,074
We'll see how long that lasts.

388
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,208
[Oliver] Felicity has Quentin's location.

389
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,085
It's an abandoned chemical plant
on the border of Pennytown.

390
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,294
We're gonna move out in five minutes.

391
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,379
I'll be ready.

392
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,422
The FBI's only objective is Diaz.

393
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,216
They're gonna do their best
to keep Quentin safe,

394
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,635
but they don't care if Black Siren
is collateral damage.

395
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,220
Your point?

396
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,764
My point, Dinah, is that

397
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,225
it's up to us to keep her safe.

398
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,105
I know that you have
put your vendetta aside

399
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,314
for the sake of the mission.

400
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,108
And you wanna make sure
I keep it that way.

401
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,401
I wanna say thank you.

402
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,864
It takes a very big person to not

403
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,575
seek vengeance for someone they love.

404
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,454
If I haven't always
been sensitive to that,

405
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,249
I'm truly sorry.

406
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

407
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,881
You know, the truth is,

408
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,719
I respect you more
than you could ever know.

409
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,015
You put together a team of heroes.

410
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,351
It's no small thing.

411
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,566
-I'm gonna go get ready.
-All right.

412
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,987
-Hey.
-What is going on?

413
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,363
What do you mean?

414
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,032
I mean, you've been giving
the "Oliver Farewell" tour

415
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,326
all round this place,
including giving John the hood.

416
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,120
You know, everyone's wondering,

417
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,290
what did you have to give Watson
to get her to give us immunity?

418
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,917
I'm just gonna go out on a limb here

419
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,339
and guess that it was giving up
being the Green Arrow.

420
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,424
[sighs softly]

421
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,676
-Sort of.
-You can't be serious.

422
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,013
What happened to becoming your best self?

423
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,431
I don't know if I believe that anymore.

424
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,391
Oliver, this is who you are.

425
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,102
You can't let Watson
get in the middle of that.

426
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,479
She's not.

427
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,815
-It was my idea.
-What do you mean, it was your idea?

428
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,901
[Curtis] [clears throat] Uh, guys.

429
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,069
Uh...

430
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,030
Sorry to interrupt what looks like
a pretty serious marital moment,

431
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,448
but everyone's ready to go.

432
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,286
To be continued. Okay?

433
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,165
[Diaz] Showtime!

434
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,754
You're gonna get in front of the camera,

435
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,673
and you're gonna get the FBI
to leave Star City,

436
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,802
or your baby girl grows a third eye.

437
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,220
He's not gonna shoot me.

438
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,514
-You're willing to bet your life?
-Yes!

439
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,224
-Laurel.
-Yes, I am!

440
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,725
You got five seconds.

441
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,521
-Five.
-Don't let him take this city.

442
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,732
-Four.
-He's bluffing. He's lying!

443
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,944
Three! Two!

444
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,196
One!

445
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,656
[gunshot]

446
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,826
[groaning]

447
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,037
No! Dad. Dad!

448
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,457
-Stay with me. Stay with me, Dad.
-[groaning]

449
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,085
Dad, stay with me. Look at me. Look at me.

450
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,003
Stay with me.

451
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,338
[Quentin groaning]

452
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,340
Don't waste your tears.

453
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,218
Where I shot him,
it'll take a good chunk of time

454
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,553
for him to bleed out.

455
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,846
[groaning]

456
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,224
Laurel, you need to get your dad

457
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,351
to get on the phone

458
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,312
and get the feds to go back
to their swamp.

459
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,524
I'll show him some mercy.

460
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,276
[groaning]

461
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,320
Like the end of the movie
with the little dog.

462
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,448
What's it called?

463
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,075
[panting]

464
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,451
I'm gonna kill you.

465
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,162
I'm not doing anything.

466
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,625
All right, we're gonna do this another way

467
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,919
'cause I'm not gonna count.

468
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,632
Your daughter's brains
are gonna be splattered

469
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,050
on your face.

470
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,845
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

471
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,641
[distant explosion]

472
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,102
Are you all right?

473
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,024
[gunshots]

474
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,567
[Agent Watson] FBI!

475
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,912
[gunshots]

476
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,590
-Quentin!
-[Black Canary] I got him. Get Diaz.

477
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,804

We gotta get him to a hospital.

00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,567
[Diaz] I need a chopper.

[Green Arrow] I agree.

00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,160
You wanna shoot me?

493
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,289
Do it.

494
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,499
Right here.

495
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,296
See, that's your problem.

496
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,007
That's always been your problem.

[Black Siren] He needs

00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,053
[FBI Agent] Yes, ma'am.

This is my city!

You wanna stop me,
you're gonna have to kill me.

506
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,377
He's right, Oliver.

507
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,879
The movie with the dog.

508
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,923
-It's called <i>Old Yeller.</i>
-No!

-[shouting] What did you do?
-I had to.

511
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,560
I had to end it.

512
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,189
You think that fall's gonna kill him?

513
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,482
A girl can only hope.

514
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,068
I had him!

515
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,614
We scoured every inch of the city
and trolled Starling Bay.

516
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,284
He can't have gotten far.

517
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,078
He was launched off a rooftop.

518
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,205
He shouldn't have been able to go
anywhere at all.

519
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,082
Diaz doesn't go down easy.

520
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,584
You seem pretty sanguine about it.

521
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,628
That wasn't a total loss.

522
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,174
Felicity reprogrammed this
with a digital sniffer.

523
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,301
I was able to get close enough to Diaz

524
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,011
to clone the drive that he wears
around his neck.

525
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,764
I got government officials,
city employees.

526
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,226
We can give you everyone on his payroll.

527
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,105
We can give you your city back.

528
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,775
But the fact that Diaz is in the wind,

529
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,569
it doesn't alter our agreement.

530
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,655
I know.

531
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,411
How is he?

532
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,496
He's septic. They're getting him
ready for surgery.

533
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,123
Rene is in there with him right now.

534
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,541
What about Diaz?

535
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,376
[sighs]

536
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,588
You're gonna be fine, hoss.
These docs are gonna fix you up.

537
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,881
[Quentin] Yeah.

538
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,633
-Do me a favor.
-Anything, hoss.

539
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,970
If this thing goes the wrong way,
and I don't make it,

540
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,139
don't call me "hoss" at my funeral.

541
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,101
You're gonna make it.

542
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,145
Yeah.

543
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,772
[door opens]

544
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,611
How's he doing?

545
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,446
Kind of macabre actually.

546
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,573
I'll give you guys a minute.

547
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,908
[Oliver] Mmm-hmm.

548
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,286
Hi.

549
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,664
[clears throat] What's the latest on Diaz?

550
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,085
Diaz... [clears throat] He got away.

551
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,587
How?

552
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,715
Doesn't matter. We'll get him.

553
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,512
We do have a list of everyone
he's been controlling.

554
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,181
FBI is rounding them up as we speak.

555
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,558
So we can take our city back.

556
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,643
Mmm-hmm.

557
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,188
-You did good, Oliver.
-Thank you.

558
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,190
It's not over yet.

559
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,484
It is for you.

560
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,821
Am I wrong?

561
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,908
I've been dealing
with Samanda Watson for months.

562
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,578
There's no way she was gonna help you
without strings attached.

563
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,834
[sighs] But those strings,
Oliver, that's a hell of a sacrifice.

564
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,211
[sighs]

565
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,421
I had to look at the way
I've been doing things.

566
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,591
It's not working.

567
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,178
I lost my city.

568
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,472
I lost my team.

569
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,685
There's a penance for that.

570
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,771
It just seems a little drastic.

571
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,191
Coming from the guy who just took
a bullet for his daughter.

572
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,073
Quentin, I hope I took
the time to tell you,

573
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,325
uh,

574
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,036
you're a really good father.

575
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,539
So are you.

576
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,959
I had a good example.

577
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,753
Yeah, your dad was a good man.

578
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,593
I'm not talking about my dad.

579
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,729
I'm sorry, but we have to
take him to the OR now.

580
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,481
Well, um,

581
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,110
when you get out,
everyone will be here waiting for you.

582
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,408
Thanks, Oliver.

583
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,081
For everything.

-How is he?
-In surgery.

591
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,868
The doctors, they're optimistic, but...

592
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,580
But I thought you should probably be here.

593
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:39,916
Thank you.

594
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,964
This is probably
really strange for you, right?

595
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,549
[chuckles softly] A little.

596
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,973
Are you, um...

597
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,060
Are you like my Laurel?

598
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,939
Hardly at all.

599
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,733
How long is this gonna take?

600
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,153
How many times are you gonna ask that?

601
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,782
As many times as it takes to find out
how long it's gonna take.

602
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,915
Mr. Queen. It's time.

603
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,166
Time for what?

604
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,712
What is she talking about?

605
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,681
I'm sorry that I haven't
explained this to everyone.

606
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,644
There hasn't been any time.

607
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,440
There wasn't time to explain what?

608
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,986
-You're arresting us?
-What the hell are you doing?

609
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,572
-I thought you said we had immunity.
-You do.

610
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,075
-Thanks to him.
-Oh, my God.

[sighs]

612
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,620
It was the only way.

613
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,873
No, it's not the only way.
There are a million other ways.

614
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,333
The judge threw out his case.
You can't do this.

615
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,837
-I can. It's federal.
-Federal.

616
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,215
The Bureau is going to stay in Star City
until Diaz is brought in.

617
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,428
But only if Oliver agreed
to turn himself in.

618
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,807
What the hell is going on here?

619
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,603
Wait a minute. Just wait.

Mayor Lance seized during the procedure.

623
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,579
The surgeons worked to revive him.
They did everything they could.

624
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,208
But his brain was deprived of oxygen
for seven minutes.

625
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,045
He's gone.

626

I'm very sorry.

627
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,726
Unfortunately, this doesn't change
our arrangement.

We'll be transferring you in a half-hour.

637
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,041
Okay, I talked to John.

638
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,003
We have a plan. We're gonna get you out.

639
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,005
-No, you can't.
-Yes, we can. We've done it before.

640
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,089
We got John out of...

641
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,008
We broke him out of Langham Penitentiary.

Yes, we did.

643
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,471
They're transferring me
to a super-max, Felicity.

644
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,183
And even if I wanted to break out,

645
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,020
they would just arrest everyone,

646
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,022
including you.

647
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,611
I think that William deserves
at least one parent.

648
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,739
During your trial,

649
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,909
you said you didn't wanna go public
because you wanted a life

650
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,785
after the Green Arrow. This is that life.

651
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,454
-You can...
-I wanted to stop Diaz.

652
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,750
And I wanted to save you and William more.

653
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,963
Not everything went our way.

654
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,843
Quentin and...

655
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,892
That protective custody
that we talked about

656
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,810
for the two of you during my trial.

657
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,898
-No.
-Lyla's gonna handle everything.

658
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,234
[sobs]

659
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,402
I promise,
just until Diaz is off the board.

660
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,988
[crying] No, I refuse to believe
that this is the only option.

661
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,490
We won back the city.

662
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,661
We got it back.

663
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,540
I thought I lost it.

664
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,421
-You didn't do that alone.
-I know.

665
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,134
Diaz tried to kill everybody close to me.

666
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,098
And I had to find a way
to protect everybody.

667
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,769
[Felicity sniffles]

668
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,980
This was the way.

669
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,820
[Felicity sobbing]

670
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,614
-Is William here?
-Yeah, he's outside.

671
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,699
He's...

672
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,580
He's scared. He's confused.

673
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:15,251
He's wondering how the woman
that he's known for less than a year

674
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,253
is suddenly his only parent.

675
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,381
Would you please go get him?

676
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,925
Yeah.

677
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,326
Buddy, how you doing?

678
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,204
I don't understand.

679
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,415
What's happening?

680
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,591
I'm gonna explain everything to you.

681
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,221
[sobs]

[reporters clamoring]

683
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,943
[reporter] Mr. Queen,
why are you being arrested again?

684
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,322
I have voluntarily handed myself
over to the FBI.

685
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,449
-Can you comment any further?
-Yes, I can.

686
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,455
I am the Green Arrow.

687
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,167
<i>I realize that I've denied
that claim with the same conviction</i>

688
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,794
<i>with which I'm speaking now.</i>

689
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,673
<i>I have let good people stand accused
of things that I have done.</i>

690
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,136
<i>Roy Harper is not the Green Arrow.</i>

691
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,974
Tommy Merlyn is most certainly
not the Green Arrow.

692
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,104
These are two names
on a long list of people

693
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,190
<i>who have given so much</i>

694
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,485
<i>and sacrificed everything</i>

695
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,238
<i>in the name of my crusade.</i>

696
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,533
Some of them gave their lives

697
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,577
in the pursuit of one simple objective,

698
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,455
to save our city.

699
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,457
<i>Star City still needs saving.</i>

700
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,670
<i>Last night, we dealt our enemy
a critical blow.</i>

701
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,965
<i>But there is still work to be done.</i>

702
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,427
<i>So I'm looking to the people of this city.</i>

703
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,140
<i>I'm looking to my allies, to my friends,</i>

704
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,600
<i>to my partners,</i>

705
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,271
<i>and I'm asking them to continue,</i>

706
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,815
<i>to keep fighting.</i>

707
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,318
<i>I'm asking them to complete our mission,</i>

708
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,823
to save our city.
