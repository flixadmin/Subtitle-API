00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:10,184
for some very interesting
dinner conversation.

334
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,920
He's definitely going to ask

335
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:16,223
about our living situation now.

336
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:17,491
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

337
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:22,129
Maybe, uh...

338
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:24,965
maybe you should move back in,

339
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:26,333
you know,

340
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:29,604
just so it's, uh, easier
to explain to everyone.

341
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:33,175
You think?

342
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:40,615
[alarm beeps]

343
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:58,935
I have to get back to work.

344
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:01,838
You know, schedule.

345
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:03,539
Yeah.

346
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,744
Whoa. Ohh--

347
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
Ahh--

348
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,884
Damn it.

349
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,285
Hey!

350
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,087
Hey! This is a two-man job!

351
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,354
I can't do it alone!

352
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,623
I'm done! That's it!
Finished!

353
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,159
Nothing else happens
until I get my partner back.

354
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:42,839
[door opens, closes]

355
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:45,541
[footsteps]

356
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:49,745
Jesse?

357
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,585
Where's Jesse?

358
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,387
I need him.

359
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,021
You people have me down here

360
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:03,191
trying to complete
a two-man operation by myself!

361
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:04,659
It's unacceptable.

362
00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:07,728
It's dangerous
and counterproductive.

363
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:12,366
Jesse operates
the forklift, not me.

364
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,301
That's just one of the many,

365
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:15,536
many things
he does around the lab

366
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,104
that keeps us on schedule,

367
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:19,574
so I suggest that you
get him back down here

368
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:20,742
as soon as you p--

369
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:23,145
Are you listening to me?

370
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:24,413
Hello!

371
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,996
Where do you want it?

372
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:08,628
This is it, right?
Last stop?

373
00:32:08,662 --> 00:32:09,996
Last stop?

374
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:12,366
Hey, I've been counting, yo.

375
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,867
No more pickups after--

376
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,484
Fallacies...

377
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,385
fallacies.

378
00:32:59,347 --> 00:33:02,816
Fallacies, fallacies.

379
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:06,887
One for you, two for me.

380
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:10,757
Fallacies, fallacies...

381
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:33,880
Ohh!

382
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,256
Ohh.

383
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:24,067
Yeah. I'm gonna need
to be picked up.

384
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:25,402
Now.

385
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:29,373
Garcia's on Central.

386
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:32,142
Honk once. I'll meet you
in the parking lot.

387
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:39,317
Cancel that.

388
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:50,762
Hey, this dude--

389
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,031
This dude was coming
right at me

390
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:54,933
with a--
With a shotgun.

391
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,701
All right? They, like,
blocked the alley,

392
00:34:56,736 --> 00:34:58,570
and they were going
to rip us off, man.

393
00:34:58,605 --> 00:34:59,838
I didn't have a choice, okay?

394
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:02,608
I had to put it in reverse,
slam into the guy's car,

395
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,611
and just-- [sigh]

396
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,979
I saw.

397
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,916
Ah, Jesus.

398
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:13,452
I just--

399
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,087
I don't know.

400
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,764
Go ahead, kid.

401
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:28,768
Smoke up.

402
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:51,499
Hmm.

403
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:58,706
Mmm.

404
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,817
Good morning.

405
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,220
Hey. Good morning, son.

406
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,589
You want me
to pour you some juice?

407
00:36:15,623 --> 00:36:17,858
I'll take coffee.

408
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:21,661
Didn't know you started
drinking coffee.

409
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:26,066
Yeah. I also started tying
my own shoelaces, too,

410
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,901
all by myself.

411
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,903
Go grab a mug.

412
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:40,349
Milk? Sugar?

413
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:42,851
Just black.

414
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:45,121
Black. I like it.

415
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:49,958
Uh, hey, Dad, I, uh...

416
00:36:49,993 --> 00:36:53,195
I-- I just got to say, um...

417
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:54,796
I-- I just wanted to say

418
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:57,132
that it's really cool
to have you here.

419
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:00,869
Thank you, son.

420
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:02,971
It's cool to be back home.

421
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,574
It just feels--

422
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:10,046
Mom said you're moving
back in, uh, this Tuesday.

423
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,087
She-- She said that?

424
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:18,389
Yeah.

425
00:37:18,424 --> 00:37:21,359
Tuesday, is it? Huh.

426
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:24,395
How about that?

427
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:45,615
[pounding]

428
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:50,020
[pounding]

429
00:37:52,557 --> 00:37:53,490
Jesse.

430
00:37:53,525 --> 00:37:55,326
Jesse!

431
00:37:56,395 --> 00:37:57,762
Yo, what's up?

432
00:37:57,796 --> 00:37:59,664
What are you doing?

433
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:01,166
Uh, breaking ice.

434
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,367
I mean, what are you--

435
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,002
What are you doing here?

436
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:05,137
Where's your car?

437
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:07,339
Mike dropped me off.

438
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:20,518
Jesse.

439
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,854
Jesse!

440
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,958
What happened yesterday?
Where were you?

441
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:29,460
I was out with Mike
helping him make pickups.

442
00:38:29,494 --> 00:38:30,761
Picking up what?

443
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:32,730
Cash. Dead drops.

444
00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:36,634
Mike made the pickups,
and I guarded them.

445
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:38,503
You?

446
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:39,871
Guarded Mike?

447
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:42,607
What is this,
some kind of a joke?

448
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:44,675
Hey, you know what?
Two dudes tried to rob us,

449
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,911
and I saved the stash.
I took care of business,

450
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:50,014
just like I'm taking care
of business right now.

451
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:51,482
You want to stand there
dicking around,

452
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:54,152
or you want to suit up
and get to work?

453
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:56,789
Get in gear, yo,
if you want to do this

454
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:58,724
because I'm meeting up
with Mike this afternoon.

455
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:00,826
What, again? Why?

456
00:39:00,861 --> 00:39:03,429
Guess I have two jobs now.

457
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:07,833
[pounding]

458
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,981
<i>May I take your order?</i>

459
00:39:31,457 --> 00:39:32,824
Any injuries?

460
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:35,994
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

461
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:39,665
It all went like you
thought it would,

462
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,968
more or less.

463
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:43,937
I will, of course,
reimburse you

464
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:45,705
to the damage to your vehicles.

465
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:46,773
Hmm.

466
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:50,042
Questions?

467
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:53,612
Uh-huh.
More than a few, yeah.

468
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:55,647
But I know better than to ask.

469
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,053
Anyway, it was like you wanted.

470
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:03,888
The kid's a hero.

471
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:23,044
[Marie]
Poo-poo-poo-poo-poo--

472
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:24,712
[Skyler] Just the idea
of owning a car wash

473
00:40:24,746 --> 00:40:26,380
seems daunting,
but I had to warn myself--

474
00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:27,882
Who is just the most beautiful
little girl in the world?

475
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:29,016
I think it's you.

476
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,951
So coming into
a business like this

477
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:33,053
that's up and running,
fully operational,

478
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:35,323
puts us way ahead of the game.

479
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:36,791
You know, we're
still going to have

480
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,058
some change over time--

481
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:39,527
I think it's you.
Yeah, I do.

482
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:41,095
But we do have
a staff in place,

483
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:44,064
so, you know, luckily,
we'll be able to hold on

484
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,766
to most of Bogdan's employees.

485
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:49,703
We might lose a few to the Ultra
Wash across town, though.

486
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,371
They're making a grab, I hear.

487
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:52,840
You going to put
the kid to work?

488
00:40:52,874 --> 00:40:54,174
I got school.

489
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:55,309
I'm not talking about you.

490
00:40:55,343 --> 00:40:56,577
I'm talking about
your baby sister.

491
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:58,045
I wouldn't let you near my car.

492
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,881
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
you guys.

493
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:03,550
You should put Holly
on the sign.

494
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:05,618
Like a mascot?

495
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:07,620
Like the Gerber baby.

496
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:09,555
I would get my car
washed there every day

497
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:10,823
if I saw her face out front.

498
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:11,957
What about me?

499
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,658
The goal is to bring
customers in,

500
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:15,126
not scare them away, so--

501
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:16,194
[laughter]

502
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,665
Walt, there's another
bottle in the kitchen.

503
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:21,732
Just help yourself.

504
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:23,034
Ah. Good.

505
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:27,239
Uh, maybe we could
roll uncle Hank

506
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:28,407
through the car wash.

507
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:29,675
He could be the first customer.

508
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:30,976
[laughter]

509
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,345
The wipe-down crew
would clean you up good.

510
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,513
[laughter]

511
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:35,648
[Hank] See this, son?

512
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:37,116
I got your wipe-down
right here, pal.

513
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:39,552
[Skyler] Hank, can you just
maybe get through one meal

514
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:41,821
without you saying
something disgusting?

515
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:44,291
[Marie] So what are you going
to do with Holly all day?

516
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:45,692
You can't take her to work

517
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:49,395
with all those chemicals
and migrants hanging around.

518
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:50,396
[Skyler] Marie--

519
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,965
[Marie]
What? That can't be safe.

520
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,366
[Skyler] Fortunately, there is,

521
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,034
just five minutes away
from the car wash,

522
00:41:56,068 --> 00:41:59,237
there is the top child care
center in the city.

523
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:01,639
The National Child Care
Association

524
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:04,409
gives it really high ratings,
so that's quite a relief,

525
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:07,713
and, you know, it's just
a walk away if we need it.

526
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:08,981
[Hank] I got to tell you,

527
00:42:09,015 --> 00:42:11,984
I'm just-- I'm really,
really impressed.

528
00:42:12,018 --> 00:42:14,887
I mean,
you came together on this,

529
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:17,190
and I'm really happy
that it's working out for you.

530
00:42:17,225 --> 00:42:18,191
[Skyler] Thanks.

531
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:19,259
It was a little scary,

532
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:21,261
but it, uh, needed to be done.

533
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:24,231
And, uh, we get possession
of the keys tomorrow.

534
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:25,666
[Marie] Oh, that's awesome.

535
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,733
[Skyler] Yeah.

536
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:28,201
[Walt Junior]
I can't wait to see

537
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:30,069
what kind of car
I'll get for my birthday,

538
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:32,105
now with all this money
rolling in.

539
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:33,973
[Marie] I think you've been
spending too much time

540
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:35,241
around your uncle Hank.

541
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:37,042
[Walt Junior] The squeaky
wheel gets the grease.

542
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:38,310
Right, uncle Hank?

543
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:39,978
[Hank] Squeaky and greasy.
That's you, my friend.

544
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:41,780
[laughter]

545
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:43,815
[Hank] Hey, uh, Nick the Greek,

546
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,484
you going to share
that bottle or what?

547
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:47,253
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

548
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:48,587
[Walt Junior]
Who's Nick the Greek?

549
00:42:48,622 --> 00:42:50,823
Nick the Greek. He was
a famous big-time card player.

550
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:52,325
Hank, that's not funny.

551
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,660
What? It's a compliment.

552
00:42:53,694 --> 00:42:55,128
Well, that's even worse, then.

553
00:42:55,162 --> 00:42:58,599
You're giving positive
reinforcement to behavior

554
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:02,136
that Walt is working
very, very hard to change.

555
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:03,738
Right, Skyler?

556
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:05,440
Yeah.

557
00:43:05,474 --> 00:43:07,008
I don't see how it's bad, Dad,

558
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,244
just raking in
the beaucoup bucks now.

559
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:10,513
You know, I just, uh, think

560
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,515
maybe we could
change the subject?

561
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:15,619
Yeah. Sure. You know.

562
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:17,588
Absolutely.

563
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:20,725
Hey, uncle Hank, what about
that case you were looking at

564
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:23,361
with that crazy singing guy?

565
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:25,763
Ah, I'm off that.

566
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:28,332
I-- I gave my assessment
to the APD, and I'm done.

567
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:31,268
The case of the crazy
singing guy. Hmm.

568
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:33,471
Sounds like an Encyclopedia
Brown story, doesn't it?

569
00:43:33,505 --> 00:43:36,774
Crazy is-- Is-- Is, uh,
is the wrong word.

570
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,609
This guy Gale Boetticher,

571
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:40,645
he was, uh, he was eccentric.

572
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:43,147
I mean, a real character,
you know?

573
00:43:43,181 --> 00:43:46,283
He's, uh, he's dead now,
you know.

574
00:43:46,317 --> 00:43:47,952
[Skyler]
Huh. Who was he?

575
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:49,787
[Walt Junior]
He was a meth cook.

576
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:52,056
[Hank] Uh, he was a meth chef.

577
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,692
[chuckle] I mean,
we're talking five stars--

578
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:57,628
Candles and white tablecloths.

579
00:43:57,663 --> 00:43:59,530
Hey, I can't believe
these words

580
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:00,731
are gonna come out of my mouth,

581
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:05,736
but he was a genius,
plain and simple.

582
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,940
I mean, uh, boy, if you
applied that big brain of his

583
00:44:09,974 --> 00:44:11,475
to something good,
I don't know,

584
00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:13,377
who knows what could have
helped humanity

585
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:14,645
or something like that,
you know?

586
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:17,014
I mean, how many actual
geniuses are there

587
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:18,515
in the world, right?

588
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,185
If he'd kind of taken his life
in a different direction,

589
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:22,920
who knows?

590
00:44:22,954 --> 00:44:27,090
Hank, not to tell you
your business,

591
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:30,560
but I'm not sure I agree.

592
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:31,795
What do you mean?

593
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:32,829
Well, I mean,

594
00:44:32,864 --> 00:44:34,130
you showed me that notebook

595
00:44:34,165 --> 00:44:36,099
and from what
I saw--

596
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:38,702
And this is just
my humble opinion--

597
00:44:38,736 --> 00:44:42,371
From what I saw
on those papers...

598
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:44,106
genius?

599
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:47,710
Not so much.

600
00:44:47,744 --> 00:44:50,246
I mean, there was no reasoning,

601
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:52,048
no deductions in those pages.

602
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:55,317
To my eye, all this brilliance

603
00:44:55,352 --> 00:44:57,319
looks like nothing more

604
00:44:57,353 --> 00:45:01,724
than just simple
rote copying--

605
00:45:01,758 --> 00:45:04,860
Probably of
someone else's work.

606
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,966
Believe me, I've been around
enough students to know.

607
00:45:13,104 --> 00:45:17,708
Ah, this genius of yours...

608
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:21,279
maybe he's still out there.

609
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:34,658
Hank.

610
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:35,893
Hey, babe.

611
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:39,130
Uh, Tim stopped by.

612
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:41,099
He brought over some file boxes

613
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:42,500
on that case.

614
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:44,536
Thought I'd take another peek.

615
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,937
That's great.

616
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,941
Sorry about the mess.

617
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:50,643
No, no, no. Don't be.

618
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:54,380
You want me
to make some coffee?

619
00:45:54,414 --> 00:45:55,948
Yeah.

620
00:45:55,982 --> 00:45:58,284
Yeah, that would be good.

621
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:28,881
Hmm.

622
00:46:29,883 --> 00:46:31,184
You find something?

623
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:37,324
Oh, just this--
This guy I'm looking at.

624
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,861
You know, everything
he-- He-- He buys and eats

625
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:45,465
is organic, fair trade, vegan.

626
00:46:49,837 --> 00:46:52,505
Since when do vegans
eat fried chicken?

627
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:59,000
