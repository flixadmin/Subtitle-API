1
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:15,467
Well struck.

2
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,219
Well struck, dog.

3
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:23,060
Did you like that?

4
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,024
It was well struck, Your Grace.

5
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,566
I already said it was well struck.

6
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:30,530
Yes, Your Grace.

7
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:40,532
- Who's next?
Lothor Brune,

8
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:43,829
freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.

9
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:47,088
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

10
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,798
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

11
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:56,382
Here I am.

12
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:04,231
Sorry, Your Grace.

13
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,024
My deepest apologies.

14
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:08,735
Are you drunk?
- No.

15
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,528
No. No, Your Grace.

16
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:14,189
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

17
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:16,194
That's not much at all.

18
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,905
Please, have another cup.

19
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,457
Are you sure, Your Grace?

20
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,830
Yes. To celebrate my name day.

21
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:25,326
Have two. Have as much as you like.

22
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:28,250
I would be honoured, Your Grace.

23
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:32,962
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

24
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,090
See that he drinks his fill.

25
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,234
You can't.

26
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,451
What did you say?

27
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,614
Did you say I can't?

28
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,248
I only meant

29
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,203
it would be bad luck
to kill a man on your name day.

30
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:07,452
What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

31
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:09,380
The girl is right.

32
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:12,798
What a man sows on his name day,
he reaps all year.

33
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,716
Take him away.

34
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,883
I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

35
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,481
He is a fool. You're so clever to see it.

36
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,723
He'll make a much better fool than a knight.

37
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,819
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

38
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:37,319
Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos?

39
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:40,494
From this day, you'll be my new fool.

40
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,738
Thank you, Your Grace.

41
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:45,998
And you, my lady, thank you.

42
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,709
Beloved nephew.

43
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:57,757
We looked for you on the battlefield.

44
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,422
You were nowhere to be found.

45
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,017
I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.

46
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,726
What a fine job you've done.

47
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:10,890
Look at you.

48
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:14,520
More beautiful than ever.

49
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,357
And you!

50
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:18,690
You're going to be bigger than the Hound,

51
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:21,156
but much better looking.

52
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,154
This one doesn't like me.

53
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,074
Can't imagine why.

54
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,656
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

55
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:31,332
Me, too, dear. Death is so boring,

56
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:34,707
especially now,
with so much excitement in the world.

57
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:37,046
My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

58
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:40,210
Her loss?

59
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,215
Her father was a confessed traitor.

60
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,885
But still her father.

61
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,597
Surely, having so recently lost your own
beloved father, you can sympathise.

62
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,775
My father was a traitor.

63
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,735
My mother and brother are traitors, too.

64
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:58,361
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

65
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,323
Of course you are.

66
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:08,155
Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.

67
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,958
Wish I could stay and celebrate,

68
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:12,795
but there is work to be done.

69
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,872
What work?

70
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,922
Why are you here?

71
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:25,009
A raven arrived from the citadel
this morning, Your Grace.

72
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:27,971
The conclave has met,

73
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:31,478
considered reports from maesters
all over the Seven Kingdoms,

74
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:34,723
and declared this great summer

75
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,648
done at last.

76
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:40,490
The longest summer in living memory.

77
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:44,158
The peasants say, a long summer means
an even longer winter.

78
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:45,988
A common superstition.

79
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,452
We have enough wheat for a five-year winter.

80
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,866
If it lasts any longer,

81
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,375
we'll have fewer peasants.

82
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:56,831
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

83
00:06:56,924 --> 00:07:00,008
We have nowhere to house them.
And with winter coming, it'll only get worse.

84
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:03,379
You command the city watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

85
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,473
I do, Your Grace.

86
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,516
And are you not a lord at my command?

87
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:12,185
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

88
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:14,810
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

89
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,771
They belong in the field, not our capital.

90
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:19,439
Yes, Your Grace.

91
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:27,282
Don't get up.

92
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:32,288
More ravishing than ever, big sister.

93
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:36,250
War agrees with you.

94
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:38,876
Forgive the interruption. Carry on.

95
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:41,832
What are you doing here?

96
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:45,590
It's been a remarkable journey.

97
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:49,218
I pissed off the edge of the Wall,

98
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,143
I slept in a sky cell,

99
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:54,387
I fought with the hill tribes.

100
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:56,023
So many adventures,

101
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,897
so much to be thankful for.

102
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:03,854
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

103
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,658
Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King
is welcome at all small council meetings.

104
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:10,454
Our father is Hand of the King.

105
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:13,540
Yes, but in his absence...

106
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:23,250
Your father has named Lord Tyrion

107
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:25,834
to serve as hand in his stead while he fights.

108
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,337
Out! All of you out!

109
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,933
I would like to know
how you tricked Father into this.

110
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:39,558
If I were capable of tricking Father,
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

111
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:42,193
You brought this on yourself.

112
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,686
I've done nothing.

113
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:45,572
Quite right, you did nothing

114
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,864
when your son called for Ned Stark's head.

115
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,909
Now the entire North has risen up against us.

116
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,403
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

117
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,664
That bit of theatre
will haunt our family for a generation.

118
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:59,618
- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

119
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:02,088
Do you understand we're losing the war?

120
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,210
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

121
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:07,045
But I know people.

122
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:11,799
And I know that our enemies hate each other
almost as much as they hate us.

123
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:19,108
- Joffrey is king.
- Joffrey is king.

124
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,518
You are here to advise him.

125
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,270
I'm only here to advise him.

126
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,855
And if the king listens to what I say,

127
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:29,447
the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

128
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:32,697
How?

129
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,330
You love your children.

130
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:37,451
It's your one redeeming quality.
That and your cheekbones.

131
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:41,753
The Starks love their children as well.

132
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,080
- And we have two of them.
- One.

133
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:48,755
- One?
- Arya, little animal, she disappeared.

134
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:51,846
Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

135
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,893
We had three Starks to trade.

136
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:59,648
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

137
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:02,683
Father will be furious.

138
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:05,319
It must be odd for you

139
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:10,314
to be the disappointing child.

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,582
My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

141
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,339
and all our Northern sons.

142
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,255
The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.

143
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:32,423
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

144
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:37,141
and I'm afraid the masons today
are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

145
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,931
When I was a boy,

146
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:45,443
I remember seeing them put up a new tower
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.

147
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:47,436
Men worked back then.

148
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,820
Today, my holdfast looks like it was built
by drunk children.

149
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,038
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

150
00:10:57,706 --> 00:10:59,366
Gods forbid it rains.

151
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,293
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

152
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:07,253
Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.

153
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:08,835
Generally, yes,

154
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:12,377
but I've sent all the young men off
to fight Robb Stark's war.

155
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,591
King Robb. And it's not his war.

156
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,509
He didn't choose it.

157
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:21,136
Maybe not, my lord,
but he called in his banners and took the men.

158
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,889
Joffrey killed my father,

159
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:25,350
your liege lord.

160
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:27,850
Do you remember your vows, ser?

161
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:29,771
Of course I remember!

162
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:32,864
We can spare four masons
for a week, my lord.

163
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,950
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

164
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,076
I believe it will.

165
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:46,999
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

166
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:50,877
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

167
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:52,628
Nor did I.

168
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:57,967
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

169
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:01,925
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

170
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:07,273
Lord Portan.

171
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,230
My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

172
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,028
and all our Northern sons.

173
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:04,407
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

174
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,914
Makes all your pain go away.

175
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:09,497
Don't have any pain.

176
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,089
Lucky for you.

177
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:14,670
That way.

178
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:20,176
You've been having those dreams again.

179
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:21,925
I don't dream.

180
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,511
Everyone dreams.

181
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,179
I don't.

182
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:28,556
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

183
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,893
They say it's an omen.

184
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:34,400
They say it means Robb
will win a great victory in the South.

185
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:35,898
Did they?

186
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:41,532
I heard some other fools say
it's Lannister Red.

187
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,786
Means the Lannisters
will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.

188
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:48,324
Heard a stable boy say it's the colour of blood

189
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:50,577
to mark the death of your father.

190
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:57,716
The stars don't fall for men.

191
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,258
Red comet means one thing, boy.

192
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:02,967
Dragons.

193
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,723
The dragons are all dead.

194
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,138
They've been dead for centuries.

195
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,430
Mmm.

196
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,098
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

197
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:57,854
He said they ate meat.

198
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,519
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

199
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:04,612
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

200
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,704
He didn't know anything about anything.

201
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:13,825
Eh.

202
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,614
She was Drogo's first gift to me.

203
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,403
I remember.

204
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,153
I promised to protect them.

205
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:53,491
Promised them
their enemies would die screaming.

206
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,957
How do I make starvation scream?

207
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:58,745
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

208
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,084
Does it ever end?

209
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:05,005
This is further east than I've ever been.

210
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:08,181
But, yes, Khaleesi,
everything ends, even the Red Waste.

211
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,674
And you're sure there's no other way?

212
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,390
If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen,

213
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,971
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

214
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:17,857
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,

215
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,561
the first khalasar we meet
will kill us and take your dragons.

216
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:24,027
No one will take my dragons.

217
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:28,078
They are too weak to fight,

218
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,201
as are your people.

219
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:32,364
You must be their strength.

220
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,409
As you are mine.

221
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:52,058
Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.
Take our remaining horses.

222
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:56,562
You will ride east, you southeast,
and you northeast.

223
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:59,943
What do we seek, Khaleesi?

224
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,148
Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people.
Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.

225
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,827
Find how far the Red Waste extends
before us, and what lies on the other side.

226
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,133
Rakharo.

227
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:28,220
You are my last hope, blood of my blood.

228
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:31,759
I will not fail you, blood of my blood.

229
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,725
You never have.

230
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:43,151
This is bad time to start.

231
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,500
Having a rough time of it?

232
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:43,080
Nothing's killed me yet.

233
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:45,840
Your arse killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

234
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,841
I just wanted you to shut up
about your damn blisters.

235
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:05,943
I was born in a place like this.

236
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:08,898
Later, I fell on hard times.

237
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:12,442
Are those girls?

238
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,242
Craster's daughters.

239
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:17,990
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

240
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:20,116
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

241
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,290
What, he don't like people
messing with his daughters?

242
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,999
He don't like people messing with his wives.

243
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:31,800
He marries his daughters,
and they give him more daughters.

244
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:33,962
And on and on it goes.

245
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:36,970
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

246
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:40,842
All the other wildlings
for a hundred leagues have disappeared.

247
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:42,894
Craster's still here.

248
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,388
He must be doing something right.

249
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:48,943
What happens to the boys?

250
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:50,143
Hmm?

251
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:51,898
He marries his daughters.

252
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:54,899
What does he do with his sons?

253
00:19:57,704 --> 00:20:01,488
He said he planned to stop here
on his way to the Frostfangs.

254
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,160
People make all sorts of plans.

255
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:06,585
I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.

256
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:08,082
Haven't missed him.

257
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,746
Always treated me like scum.

258
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:14,839
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

259
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:17,764
You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

260
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,806
We're not Southerners.

261
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:21,470
Who's this little girl?

262
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:25,856
You're prettier than half my daughters.

263
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,190
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?

264
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:31,020
What's your name?

265
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:33,069
- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

266
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:36,074
Listen to me, bastard.

267
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,073
All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

268
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:43,828
But now you're in the North, the real North.

269
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,370
The lad meant no harm.

270
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,461
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters...

271
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:54,416
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

272
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:57,547
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

273
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,800
You bring any of that good wine with you?

274
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,472
We did.

275
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:07,219
We passed through
six villages on the way here.

276
00:21:07,315 --> 00:21:09,142
All six were abandoned.

277
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:12,102
Where have all the wildlings gone?

278
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:15,611
I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

279
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:18,072
There's a barrel of Dornish wine
on the sledge.

280
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,733
- Bring it in here.
Yes, Commander.

281
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:23,913
You want to know
where they've all gone?

282
00:21:23,998 --> 00:21:27,996
North, to join up with Mance Rayder.

283
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:31,087
Your old friend.

284
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,748
He's no friend of mine.

285
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:38,219
- He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.
- Aye.

286
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:41,389
But once he was just a poor black crow.

287
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:44,309
And now he's King-beyond-the-Wall.

288
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:46,801
He's been calling himself that for years.

289
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:50,479
What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

290
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:53,977
That's a good-looking axe.

291
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,063
Fresh forged?

292
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,658
Give it here.

293
00:22:00,743 --> 00:22:02,950
You'll have another one made at Castle Black.

294
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:04,947
Here.

295
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,539
That's some lovely steel.

296
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:15,417
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

297
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:16,837
Gathering an army.

298
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:21,253
What I hear, he's already got more men
than any of your Southern Kings.

299
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:24,597
And where does he plan marching this army?

300
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:27,601
When you're all the way north,
there's only one direction to go.

301
00:22:30,023 --> 00:22:34,234
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

302
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:36,734
The cold winds are rising.

303
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,440
Let them come. My roots are sunk deep.

304
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:44,993
Wife,

305
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,994
tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

306
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:51,416
This is our place.

307
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:53,329
Our husband keeps us safe.

308
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:56,422
Better to live free than die a slave.

309
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:01,886
Don't it make
you jealous, old man,

310
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:07,310
to see me with all these young wives
and you with no one to warm your bed?

311
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:09,386
We chose different paths.

312
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:13,642
Aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

313
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:18,689
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

314
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,856
and eat me out of pigs.

315
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:22,775
A roof would be welcome.

316
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,278
It's been hard riding.

317
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,619
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

318
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:32,954
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives,

319
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:35,663
he loses the hand.

320
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,589
And I see this one staring too long,

321
00:23:41,678 --> 00:23:44,678
I might just gouge his eyes out.

322
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:48,134
Your roof, your rules.

323
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:02,815
Who am I?

324
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:06,985
- Who am I?
- Lord Commander.

325
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:10,162
- And who are you?
- Jon Snow.

326
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,659
Who are you?

327
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:14,584
Your steward.

328
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,079
You want to lead one day?

329
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:22,381
Then learn how to follow.

330
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:43,609
Lord of Light,
come to us in our darkness.

331
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:47,777
We offer you these false gods.

332
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:51,538
Take them and cast your light upon us,

333
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:56,618
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

334
00:24:57,503 --> 00:25:00,670
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

335
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:04,960
After the long summer,

336
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:07,888
darkness will fall heavy on the world.

337
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:10,593
The stars will bleed.

338
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,258
We need to stop her.

339
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:17,101
The cold breath of winter
will freeze the seas...

340
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,318
- Not now.
- ...and the dead shall rise in the North.

341
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:26,689
All you men were named
in the light of the Seven!

342
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:29,819
Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers?

343
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:34,489
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

344
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,499
You smell of fear,

345
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:49,543
fear and piss and old bones.

346
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:52,634
Do you want to stop me?

347
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:59,015
Stop me.

348
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:13,696
In the ancient books, it's written

349
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:17,488
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

350
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,835
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

351
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,210
Stannis Baratheon,

352
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:32,795
Warrior of Light,

353
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,634
your sword awaits you.

354
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:08,383
Lord, cast your light upon us!

355
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:13,261
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

356
00:27:16,392 --> 00:27:19,512
For the night is dark and full of terror.

357
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,422
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

358
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,087
Stannis is our king.

359
00:27:52,178 --> 00:27:53,589
We follow where he leads,

360
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,170
- Even if we don't like the path.
- King.

361
00:27:56,265 --> 00:28:00,345
Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

362
00:28:00,436 --> 00:28:02,594
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

363
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,313
As do I,

364
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,017
but loyal service means telling hard truths.

365
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,107
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,

366
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:16,242
but he trusts you, Davos.

367
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,900
If you tell him the truth...

368
00:28:20,706 --> 00:28:22,366
What's the truth?

369
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,596
"And I declare upon the honour of
my house that my beloved brother Robert..."

370
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,221
He wasn't my beloved brother.

371
00:28:41,394 --> 00:28:43,386
I didn't love him. He didn't love me.

372
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:45,306
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

373
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:46,429
A lie. Take it out.

374
00:28:49,652 --> 00:28:51,526
"That my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

375
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:56,194
"the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen,
and the girl Myrcella being born of incest

376
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:59,320
"between Cersei Lannister
and her brother Jaime Lannister.

377
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:02,163
- "By right of birth..."
- Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

378
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:03,576
Call him what he is.

379
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:08,077
"And her brother Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer."

380
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,456
"By right of birth and blood,
I do this day lay claim..."

381
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,419
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

382
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,550
Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

383
00:29:16,637 --> 00:29:18,962
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

384
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:21,263
"By right of birth and blood,

385
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,387
"I do this day lay claim
to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

386
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,093
"Let all true men declare their loyalty."

387
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:29,478
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

388
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,773
I'll not make the same mistake.

389
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:33,853
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the realm,

390
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,855
from the Arbor to the Wall.

391
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:38,107
The time has come to choose.

392
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:41,282
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

393
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,861
Your Grace, the Lannisters are
the true enemy.

394
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:46,032
If, for the time being,
you could make peace with your brother...

395
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,201
I'll not make peace
with Renly while he calls himself king.

396
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:50,085
Well, many have already declared for him,

397
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,377
Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

398
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:55,668
Stannis does not need
to beg this lord or that lord for support.

399
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,254
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

400
00:29:57,345 --> 00:30:00,595
And how many ships
has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

401
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:03,137
- He has no need for ships.
I'm sure he doesn't,

402
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:04,768
but we do if we're going to war.

403
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:07,884
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

404
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,056
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

405
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:13,565
I've always served thieves according
to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos.

406
00:30:13,652 --> 00:30:16,689
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.

407
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,188
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

408
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:22,988
I owe you an apology, my king.

409
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,786
My duty is to serve.

410
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:30,001
You have chosen the new God
over the old gods.

411
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:33,455
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.

412
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:35,873
Shall we drink together?

413
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:37,425
Don't.

414
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:42,512
A cup of wine to honour the one true God.

415
00:31:28,936 --> 00:31:32,056
The night is dark and full of terrors, old man,

416
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:35,232
but the fire burns them all away.

417
00:32:10,352 --> 00:32:12,262
King in the North.

418
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:18,724
I keep expecting you to leave me
in one castle or another for safekeeping,

419
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:21,690
but you drag me along from camp to camp.

420
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:25,530
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?

421
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:27,409
Is that it?

422
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:29,286
I've never seen you with a girl.

423
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:32,905
If I left you with one of my bannermen,

424
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,954
your father would know within a fortnight

425
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:39,579
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message,

426
00:32:39,673 --> 00:32:43,208
"Release my son
and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

427
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:46,718
"Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

428
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:51,302
You don't trust the loyalty
of the men following you into battle?

429
00:32:51,393 --> 00:32:53,433
Oh, I trust them with my life,

430
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:55,970
just not with yours.

431
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,565
Smart boy.

432
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:00,567
What's wrong?

433
00:33:00,653 --> 00:33:02,230
Don't like being called "boy"?

434
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:05,155
Insulted?

435
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:15,208
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.

436
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:19,417
You've been defeated by a boy.

437
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:22,629
You're held captive by a boy.

438
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:27,344
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

439
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:37,977
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
to all the high lords of Westeros.

440
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:43,101
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king

441
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,817
nor a true Baratheon.

442
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:48,115
He's your bastard son.

443
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,525
If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king.

444
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:52,659
How convenient for him.

445
00:33:53,372 --> 00:33:56,990
My father learned the truth.

446
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:58,709
That's why you had him executed.

447
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:01,036
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

448
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,795
Your son killed him
so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.

449
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:06,128
And you,

450
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:10,511
you pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the queen.

451
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,725
You have proof?

452
00:34:19,064 --> 00:34:21,472
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

453
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:25,440
I'm sending one of your cousins down to
King's Landing with my peace terms.

454
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:27,937
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

455
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,858
You don't know him very well.

456
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:34,534
No, but he's starting to know me.

457
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:38,866
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

458
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:41,918
It's better than three defeats.

459
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:13,241
This city stinks.

460
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:18,074
Like dead bodies.

461
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:20,241
A bit corpsey, yes.

462
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:22,786
And shit.

463
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:24,503
I thought you wanted to come here.

464
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:29,502
I love it.

465
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:33,470
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

466
00:35:34,223 --> 00:35:37,093
And cum and garlic and rum.

467
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:39,675
You can smell cum from the balcony?

468
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:43,765
I love the stink. I love the noise.

469
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,850
Cities make me want to fuck.

470
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:49,025
And so did the country.

471
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:53,735
This is where I belong.

472
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:56,613
Yes, well, you need to be careful.

473
00:35:56,704 --> 00:35:58,246
No one can know you're here.

474
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,908
No one will know.

475
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:01,706
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

476
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,793
They're all liars, good liars, bad liars,

477
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:07,286
one or two great liars.

478
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:09,208
What about you?

479
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:12,051
Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.

480
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:14,800
Truth?

481
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:19,802
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

482
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:21,803
Why do you think I am so little?

483
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:26,225
I'm being crushed beneath
the weight of all that truth.

484
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:33,406
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

485
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:37,108
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

486
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,531
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

487
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,676
Lord Baelish.

488
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,008
Your Grace.

489
00:36:57,097 --> 00:36:59,505
I wonder if I might ask you for a favour.

490
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,142
Of course, Your Grace.

491
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:03,183
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,

492
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,428
we can't seem to locate her.

493
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:10,014
If she's escaped the capital,
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

494
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,518
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

495
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:14,522
Curious.

496
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:16,691
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,

497
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:18,741
the girl has some value. Whoever finds her...

498
00:37:18,827 --> 00:37:21,069
Well, you know what they say
about Lannisters and debts.

499
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:23,535
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

500
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:25,870
He'll have an answer for you.

501
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,370
Whether you believe it...

502
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:31,459
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

503
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:34,039
Who knows what they want?

504
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:36,008
A mockingbird.

505
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:40,091
- You created your own sigil, didn't you?
- Yes.

506
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:44,841
Appropriate, for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

507
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:46,514
I'm glad you like it.

508
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:50,056
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

509
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,606
Others have to find their own way.

510
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:56,194
I heard a song once

511
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:58,903
about a boy of modest means

512
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:01,483
who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

513
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,407
He loved the eldest daughter.

514
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:06,823
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

515
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:12,166
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

516
00:38:13,048 --> 00:38:17,544
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.

517
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,627
And when those affections
become common knowledge,

518
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:24,554
well, that is an awkward situation indeed,

519
00:38:24,643 --> 00:38:26,766
especially in a prominent family.

520
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:29,142
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

521
00:38:30,148 --> 00:38:31,607
I've found.

522
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:34,685
And which truth is that?

523
00:38:34,778 --> 00:38:37,103
Knowledge is power.

524
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:42,901
Seize him.

525
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:46,698
Cut his throat.

526
00:38:47,374 --> 00:38:49,532
Stop. Wait.

527
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,702
I've changed my mind. Let him go.

528
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:57,376
Step back three paces.

529
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:00,552
Turn around.

530
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:02,763
Close your eyes.

531
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,721
Power is power.

532
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:15,105
Do see if you can take some time away
from your coins and your whores

533
00:39:15,193 --> 00:39:17,020
to locate the Stark girl for me.

534
00:39:17,112 --> 00:39:19,781
I would very much appreciate it.

535
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,576
You're Ser Alton Lannister?

536
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:35,204
I am, Your Grace.

537
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:38,666
I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.

538
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,047
First, your family must release my sisters.

539
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,681
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

540
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:51,476
so he may rest beside his brother and sister
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

541
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:55,608
And the remains of all those who died
in his service must also be returned.

542
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:58,523
Their families can honour them
with proper funerals.

543
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:01,399
- An honourable request, Your Grace.
- Third...

544
00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:07,744
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce
all claim to dominion of the North.

545
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:13,075
From this time till the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

546
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:15,208
The King in the North.

547
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:17,667
- King in the North.
- King in the North.

548
00:40:17,756 --> 00:40:21,457
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

549
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:23,544
If he disregards this command,

550
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:26,507
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

551
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,387
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

552
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:34,812
These are... Your Grace, these are...

553
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:37,389
These are my terms.

554
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:40,568
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.

555
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:41,934
If not,

556
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,196
I will litter the South with Lannister dead.

557
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:48,989
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

558
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,657
Oh, is he?

559
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,573
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

560
00:40:55,502 --> 00:40:57,874
That will be all for tonight.

561
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,845
A word, Your Grace?

562
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:19,443
You don't have to call me "Your Grace"
when no one's around.

563
00:41:19,526 --> 00:41:22,099
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

564
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:24,194
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

565
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:27,315
The Lannisters are going
to reject your terms, you know?

566
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:29,283
Of course they are.

567
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:31,658
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

568
00:41:31,747 --> 00:41:34,997
but we won't beat them
until you take King's Landing.

569
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:40,043
And we can't take King's Landing
without ships.

570
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,586
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail them.

571
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,466
Men who fought my father.

572
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:46,793
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

573
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:50,505
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

574
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:53,891
I'm his only living son.

575
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,974
He'll listen to me. I know he will.

576
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:03,236
I'm not a Stark. I know that.

577
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:06,691
But your father raised me
to be an honourable man.

578
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:11,031
We can avenge him together.

579
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,369
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

580
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:17,699
I need his ships. They say he has 200.

581
00:42:17,793 --> 00:42:21,707
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

582
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:23,255
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

583
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,214
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

584
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,132
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

585
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:32,462
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

586
00:42:32,557 --> 00:42:36,341
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

587
00:42:36,436 --> 00:42:38,678
Before me, it was Father.

588
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:40,396
You married one rebel and mothered another.

589
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:43,395
I mothered more than just rebels,

590
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:45,727
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

591
00:42:45,821 --> 00:42:50,068
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

592
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:53,361
You want to leave Sansa
in the queen's hands?

593
00:42:53,453 --> 00:42:55,410
And Arya...

594
00:42:55,497 --> 00:43:00,242
I haven't heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not for them?

595
00:43:00,335 --> 00:43:03,870
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

596
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,975
It's time for me to go home.

597
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,977
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

598
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:28,227
You can't go to Winterfell.

599
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,567
I beg your pardon?

600
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:34,027
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys

601
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,496
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

602
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,621
Why in the name of all the gods...

603
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:44,457
Because I need you
to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

604
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:46,622
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

605
00:43:46,715 --> 00:43:48,458
You know him. You know his family.

606
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,957
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

607
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:52,297
You have a hundred other lords...

608
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:55,388
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

609
00:43:56,308 --> 00:43:59,143
If Renly sides with us,

610
00:43:59,227 --> 00:44:01,683
we'll outnumber them two to one.

611
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:04,607
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.

612
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:07,312
We'll get the girls back.

613
00:44:07,402 --> 00:44:10,320
Then we'll all go home, for good.

614
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:20,747
I will ride at first light.

615
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,752
We will all be together again soon, I promise.

616
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:40,757
You've done so well.

617
00:44:42,229 --> 00:44:44,933
Your father would be proud.

618
00:44:54,032 --> 00:44:56,784
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- King Renly.

619
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:00,610
There's a king in every corner now.

620
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:15,468
What is all this?

621
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,671
Returning this room to its proper appearance.

622
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:21,600
Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.

623
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,354
That is a seat for a conqueror.

624
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:28,020
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

625
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:30,480
We can't find Arya Stark.

626
00:45:30,568 --> 00:45:32,561
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

627
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:34,730
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

628
00:45:34,823 --> 00:45:37,065
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

629
00:45:37,158 --> 00:45:39,614
I think they might. They're weak.

630
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,660
They put too much value on their women.

631
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:45,367
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

632
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:47,416
Send out as many men as we can.

633
00:45:47,502 --> 00:45:49,329
I'm sure if you asked Grandfather...

634
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:52,172
The king does not ask, he commands.

635
00:45:53,258 --> 00:45:56,093
And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

636
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:58,965
is the reason Robb Stark
has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

637
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:00,929
His life is in danger.

638
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,474
We're at war.

639
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,683
All our lives are in danger.

640
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:12,360
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

641
00:46:13,194 --> 00:46:14,475
And you.

642
00:46:15,864 --> 00:46:19,446
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

643
00:46:19,534 --> 00:46:21,408
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

644
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:24,829
Of course it is.

645
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,914
No one believes this foul gossip.

646
00:46:29,002 --> 00:46:30,994
Someone believes it.

647
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:34,540
Father had other children?

648
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,375
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

649
00:46:39,846 --> 00:46:41,388
What are you asking?

650
00:46:41,723 --> 00:46:44,677
I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you.

651
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,093
How many bastards does he have running...

652
00:47:03,078 --> 00:47:07,158
What you just did is punishable by death.

653
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:12,743
You will never do it again.

654
00:47:13,421 --> 00:47:15,081
Never.

655
00:47:21,262 --> 00:47:23,255
That will be all, Mother.

656
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:32,062
No, no, no, no.

657
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:34,983
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

658
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:36,479
Ease into it.

659
00:47:36,569 --> 00:47:39,570
Slowly, with passion.

660
00:47:41,866 --> 00:47:43,195
Oh, yeah.

661
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:47,204
Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.

662
00:47:47,288 --> 00:47:49,779
Both of you are working tonight.

663
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:55,627
We do things differently here, Daisy.

664
00:47:55,713 --> 00:47:59,581
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

665
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,249
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

666
00:48:02,345 --> 00:48:06,841
Our establishment doesn't cater
to ploughmen and goat herders.

667
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:08,641
Lord Olsen.

668
00:48:08,726 --> 00:48:10,684
Taste is everything here.

669
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,679
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

670
00:48:12,772 --> 00:48:14,397
Don't call him Littlefinger.

671
00:48:14,482 --> 00:48:15,893
He doesn't like it.

672
00:48:15,984 --> 00:48:18,309
Lord Baelish.

673
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:26,116
She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue

674
00:48:26,202 --> 00:48:28,776
so that people will think she's exotic.

675
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,707
She grew up just down the road
in Flea Bottom.

676
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:34,247
She's beautiful.

677
00:48:34,335 --> 00:48:37,586
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

678
00:48:42,677 --> 00:48:44,966
Lord Commander.

679
00:48:45,054 --> 00:48:47,890
Good to see you again.

680
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:06,950
You do realise this establishment
is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish,

681
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:09,241
the King's Master of Coin.

682
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:11,120
Coin which goes in many pockets.

683
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:13,823
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

684
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,704
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

685
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:37,558
No, you can't. No! Please!

686
00:49:38,399 --> 00:49:40,807
No! Not my Barra!

687
00:49:40,902 --> 00:49:44,318
- Please. Please.
- Enough. Get it done.

688
00:49:44,405 --> 00:49:46,279
- Kill the bastard.
No, no!

689
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:48,738
- Please.
- Give it here.

690
00:49:48,826 --> 00:49:51,033
No, please.

691
00:50:01,422 --> 00:50:03,664
Spread out. Search every house.

692
00:50:03,758 --> 00:50:06,047
Every room. Look in every room.

693
00:50:30,702 --> 00:50:33,157
Gendry! His name is Gendry.

694
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:34,954
Where is the bastard?

695
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:37,613
The Night's Watch! Please, stop!

696
00:50:37,709 --> 00:50:39,119
Where?

697
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:42,164
They took him up the Kingsroad,
heading north.

698
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:45,790
- How will we know him?
- He's got a bull's head helmet.

699
00:50:45,925 --> 00:50:48,760
- He made it himself.
- Find him.
