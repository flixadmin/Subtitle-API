1
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,314
Master Kaecilius.

2
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,402
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

3
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,564
Hypocrite!

4
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,014
Challenge round, Billy.

5
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,229
Come on, Billy,
you've got to be messing with me.

6
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,772
No, doctor.

7
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,568
Feels So Good,
Chuck Mangione, 1977.

8
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,528
Honestly, Billy,
you said this one would be hard.

9
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,572
-Ha! It's 1978.
-No, Billy.

10
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,449
While Feels So Good may have charted
in 1978...

11
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,953
the album was released
in December of 1977.

12
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,914
-No. Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...
-Check again.

13
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,041
Where do you store
all this useless information?

14
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,084
Useless?

15
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,919
The man charted a top 10 hit
with a flugelhorn.

16
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,130
Status, Billy?

17
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,298
1977.

18
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,674
-Oh, please.
-I hate you.

19
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,844
Feels so good, doesn't it?

20
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,016
I got this, Stephen.

21
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,934
You've done your bit.
Go ahead. We'll close up.

22
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,187
What is it?

23
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,271
GSW.

24
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,773
It's amazing you kept him alive.

25
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,525
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

26
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,068
and the apnea reflex test.

27
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,696
I think I found the problem,
Doctor Palmer.

28
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,615
You left a bullet in his head.

29
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,116
Thanks.
It's impinging on the medulla.

30
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,785
I needed a specialist.
Nic diagnosed brain death.

31
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,537
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

32
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,622
We have to run.

33
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,208
Doctor West.

34
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,792
What are you doing? Hey.

35
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,419
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

36
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,795
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

37
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,464
I don't need you to.
We've already called brain death.

38
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,548
Prematurely.

39
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,217
We need to get him prepped
for sub-occipital craniotomy.

40
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,177
Not gonna let you operate
on a dead man.

41
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,637
What do you see?

42
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,722
-A bullet?
-A perfect bullet.

43
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,642
It's been hardened. You harden
a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

44
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,479
A toxic metal. And that's leeched
directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

45
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,272
Rapid onset
central nervous system shutdown.

46
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,315
We gotta go.

47
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,485
The patient's not dead, but he is dying.
Still want to harvest his organs?

48
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,862
-I'll assist you.
-No.

49
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,989
Doctor Palmer will assist me.

50
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,799
Thank you.

51
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,224
Image guidance, stat.

52
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,684
We don't have time for that.

53
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
You can't do it freehand.

54
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:16,895
I can and I will.

55
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,772
This isn't a time for showing off,
Strange.

56
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,190
How about 10 minutes ago

57
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,693
when you called
the wrong time of death?

58
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,245
Cranial nerves intact.

59
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,564
Doctor West, cover your watch.

60
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,984
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

61
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,653
I didn't have to save his patient,
either.

62
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,364
But I sometimes just can't help myself.

63
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,823
Nic is a great doctor.

64
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,116
You came to me.

65
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,535
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

66
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,204
You had a second opinion.
What you needed was a competent one.

67
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,498
Well, all the more reason why you
should be my neurosurgeon on call.

68
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,041
You could make such a difference.

69
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,918
I can't work in your butcher shop.

70
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,795
I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

71
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,297
I'm stimulating neurogenesis
in the central nervous system.

72
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,591
The work I'm doing is gonna save
thousands for years to come.

73
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,469
In ER, you get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

74
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,595
Yeah, you're right.

75
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,930
In ER, we're only saving lives.

76
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,058
There's no fame,
there's no CNN interviews.

77
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,435
I guess I'll just have to
stick with Nic.

78
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,896
Wait a minute. You're not...
You guys aren't...

79
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,231
What?

80
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,067
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought
that was implicit in my disgust.

81
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,694
Explicit, actually.

82
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,071
No, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

83
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,282
-Oh, really?
-I call it the "Strange Policy."

84
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,784
Good, I'm glad something's
named after me.

85
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,203
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

86
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,329
And yet, somehow

87
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,998
no one seems to want to call it
the "Strange Technique."

88
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,708
We invented that technique.

89
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,335
Regardless, I'm very flattered
by your policy.

90
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,841
I'm talking tonight
at a Neurological Society dinner.

91
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,259
Come with me.

92
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,927
Another speaking engagement?

93
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,012
So romantic.

94
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,389
You used to love coming to those things
with me.

95
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,515
We had fun together.

96
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,225
No! You had fun.

97
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,019
They weren't about us,
they were about you.

98
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,188
Not only about me.

99
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,274
Stephen. Everything is about you.

100
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,943
Maybe we could hyphenate.

101
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,112
Strange-Palmer Technique.

102
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,072
Palmer-Strange.

103
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,288
Billy.

104
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,581
What have you got for me?

105
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,999
I've got a 35-year-old
Air Force Colonel...

106
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,253
crushed his lower spine
in some kind of experimental armor.

107
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,671
Mid-thoracic burst fracture.

108
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,214
Yeah, well I could help...

109
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,465
but so could 50 other people.

110
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,175
Find me something worth my time.

111
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,096
I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.

112
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,431
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record?

113
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,100
Definitely not.

114
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,310
How about a 22-year-old female...

115
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,729
with an electronic implant in her brain
to control schizophrenia...

116
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,273
struck by lightning?

117
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,607
That does sound interesting.

118
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,861
Can you send me the...

119
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:34,987
Got it.

120
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,759
Hey.

121
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,471
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

122
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,570
What did they do?

123
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,949
They rushed you in a chopper.

124
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,201
But it took a little while to find you.

125
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:08,372
The golden hours for nerve damage
went by while you were in the car.

126
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,166
What did they do?

127
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,047
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

128
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,133
Multiple torn ligaments...

129
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,470
severe nerve damage in both hands.

130
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,723
You were on the table for 11 hours.

131
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,809
Look at these fixators.

132
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,229
No one could have done better.

133
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,988
I could have done better.

134
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,350
No.

135
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,103
Give your body time to heal.

136
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,523
You've ruined me.

137
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,943
-How long until I can take...
-Doctor Strange.

138
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,612
Those tissues are still healing.

139
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,863
So, speed it up.

140
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,782
Pass a stent down the brachial artery
into the radial artery.

141
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,784
It's possible.

142
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,955
Experimental and expensive,
but possible.

143
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,790
All I need is possible.

144
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,357
Up.

145
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,817
Up.

146
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,195
Show me your strength.

147
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,118
This is useless.

148
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,288
It's not useless, man. You can do this.

149
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,959
All right, answer me this,
bachelor's degree.

150
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,295
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage this severe

151
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,380
to do this...

152
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:22,548
and actually recover?

153
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,174
One guy, yeah.

154
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,718
Factory accident, broke his back...

155
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,304
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

156
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,765
He had pain in his shoulder,
from the wheelchair.

157
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,686
He came in three times a week.
Then one day he stopped coming.

158
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,646
I thought he was dead.

159
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,023
A few years later,
he walked past me on the street.

160
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,400
-Walked?
-Yeah, walked.

161
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,528
Bullshit. Show me his file.

162
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,197
It'll take me a while
to pull the files from the archive.

163
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,741
But if it proves
your arrogant ass wrong...

164
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,535
Worth it.

165
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,385
I looked at all your research...

166
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,721
I read all the papers you've sent.

167
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,598
It's not gonna work.

168
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,224
I don't think you realize...

169
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,226
how severe the damages are.

170
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,061
-Here's the thing...
-The best have tried and failed.

171
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,064
I understand. Here's the thing.

172
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,192
What you want from me is impossible,
Stephen.

173
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,568
Come on.

174
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,361
I've got my own reputation to consider.

175
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,238
-Etienne, wait. No.
-I can't help you.

176
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,449
No, no, wait!

177
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,788
Hey!

178
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,880
He won't do it.

179
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,759
He's a hack.

180
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,303
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

181
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,888
They culture donor stem cells...

182
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,766
and then harvesting them
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

183
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,017
If I could get a loan together...

184
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,143
Stephen.

185
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,895
A small loan, just $200,000.

186
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,022
You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it...

187
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,148
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

188
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,069
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

189
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,531
No, now is exactly the time
not to stop...

190
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:13,325
because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

191
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,327
But this isn't medicine anymore.

192
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,119
This is mania.

193
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,957
Some things just can't be fixed.

194
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,542
-Life without my work...
-Is still life.

195
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,961
This isn't the end.

196
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,755
There are other things
that can give your life meaning.

197
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,590
Like what? Like you?

198
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,303
This is the part where you apologize.

199
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,305
This is the part where you leave.

200
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,892
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

201
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,102
Too difficult for you, is it?

202
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,813
Yes, it is.

203
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,857
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

204
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,317
-No, don't pity me.
-I'm not pitying you.

205
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,443
Oh, yeah?
Then what are you doing here...

206
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,988
bringing cheese and wine like
we're old friends going for a picnic?

207
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,155
We are not friends, Christine.

208
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,532
We were barely lovers.

209
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,492
But you just love a sob story,
don't you?

210
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,952
Is that what I am to you now?

211
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,705
"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."

212
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,873
"He finally needs me."

213
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,583
Another dreg of humanity for you
to work on.

214
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,127
Patch him up
and send him back into the world...

215
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,670
heart's just humming.

216
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,215
You care so much, don't you?

217
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,679
Goodbye, Stephen.

218
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,230
All the way. Here we go.

219
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,398
Let's go! All day! All day!

220
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,568
Yeah! All day.

221
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,196
Come on, man!
Where's the competition?

222
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,074
Talk a lot.

223
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,701
Jonathan Pangborn...

224
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,704
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

225
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,624
-Who are you?
-Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

226
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,417
Partial paralysis in both hands.

227
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,586
-I don't know you.
-I'm Stephen Strange.

228
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,756
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Was a neurosurgeon.

229
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,426
Actually, you know what, man,
I do know you.

230
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,304
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

231
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,973
I never got past your assistant.

232
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,142
You were untreatable.

233
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,645
No glory for you in that, right?

234
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,858
You came back from a place
there's no way back from.

235
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,489
I'm trying to find my own way back.

236
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,494
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

237
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,211
All right.

238
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,382
I'd given up on my body.

239
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,759
I thought my mind's the only thing
I have left...

240
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,970
I should at least try to elevate that.

241
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,431
So, I sat with gurus...

242
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,224
and sacred women.

243
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,269
Strangers carried me to mountaintops
to see holy men.

244
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,562
And finally...

245
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,273
I found my teacher.

246
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,942
And my mind was elevated...

247
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,360
and my spirit deepened.

248
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,237
And somehow...

249
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,363
Your body healed.

250
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,615
Yes.

251
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,243
There were deeper secrets
to learn there...

252
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,995
but I didn't have the strength
to receive them.

253
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,081
I chose to settle for my miracle
and I came back home.

254
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,507
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

255
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,008
But the cost there is high.

256
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,968
How much?

257
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,803
I'm not talking about money.

258
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,140
Good luck.

259
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,520
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

260
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,708
Kamar-Taj?

261
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,503
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

262
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,736
Kamar-Taj?

263
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,739
Kamar-Taj.

264
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,269
Okay.

265
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,982
Look, guys, I don't have any money.

266
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:38,775
Your watch.

267
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:41,987
No, please. It's all I have left.

268
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,197
Your watch.

269
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,784
All right.

270
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,160
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

271
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,025
Really?

272
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:03,944
Sure we got the right place?

273
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:08,615
That one
looks a little more Kamar-Tajey.

274
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:12,870
I once stood in your place.

275
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:17,541
And I, too, was disrespectful.

276
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,878
So, might I offer you some advice?

277
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:24,173
Forget everything you think you know.

278
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,260
All right.

279
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,813
The sanctuary of our teacher.

280
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,064
The Ancient One.

281
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,234
The Ancient One?
What's his real name?

282
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:46,904
Right.

283
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,573
Forget everything I think I know.
Sorry.

284
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,085
Thank you for...

285
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,465
Okay, that's a thing.

286
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,717
Thank you for...

287
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:09,927
Hello.

288
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,262
Thank you.

289
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,264
And thank you.

290
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,350
Thank you...

291
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:19,228
Ancient One, for seeing me.

292
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,480
You're very welcome.

293
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:25,108
The Ancient One.

294
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,111
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir.

295
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,905
Mr. Strange.

296
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,241
Doctor, actually.

297
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,826
No, not anymore, surely.

298
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,078
Isn't that why you're here?

299
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,622
You've undergone many procedures.

300
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:39,957
Seven, right?

301
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,041
Yeah.

302
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,794
It's good tea.

303
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,128
Yes.

304
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:52,135
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

305
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,303
A paralyzed man?

306
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,471
In a way.

307
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,682
You helped him to walk again.

308
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:57,766
Yes.

309
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,562
How did you correct
a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

310
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,397
I didn't correct it.

311
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:04,898
He couldn't walk.

312
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,483
I convinced him that he could.

313
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,402
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

314
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,571
When you reattach a severed nerve...

315
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:13,115
is it you who heals it back together
or the body?

316
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,283
It's the cells.

317
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,826
The cells are only programmed...

318
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,995
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

319
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,121
Right.

320
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,665
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

321
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:25,043
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

322
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:29,131
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

323
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,508
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

324
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,510
Is that why you're working here?

325
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,679
Without a governing medical board?

326
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:37,973
Just how experimental
is your treatment?

327
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:39,975
Quite.

328
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,686
So, you've figured out a way...

329
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:45,230
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

330
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,691
No, Mr. Strange.

331
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,195
I know how to reorient the spirit...

332
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,071
to better heal the body.

333
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,576
-The spirit to heal the body?
-That's right.

334
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,622
No. All right.

335
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:02,831
How do we do that?

336
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,458
Where do we start?

337
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,049
-Don't like that map?
-Oh, no.

338
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:15,177
It's really good.
It's just, I've seen it before...

339
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:16,637
in gift shops.

340
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:19,765
And what about this one?

341
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,392
-Acupuncture, great.
-Yeah?

342
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:25,437
What about that one?

343
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,440
Showing me an MRI scan.
I do not believe this.

344
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,068
Each of those maps was drawn up
by someone...

345
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:34,196
who could see in part,
but not the whole.

346
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,240
I spent my last dollar getting here,
one-way ticket...

347
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:39,701
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

348
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:42,246
You're a man looking at the world
through a keyhole.

349
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:45,082
You've spent your whole life
trying to widen that keyhole...

350
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:46,917
to see more, to know more.

351
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:50,128
Now, on hearing that
it can be widened...

352
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,130
in ways you can't imagine...

353
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,091
you reject the possibility.

354
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,260
No, I reject it because I do not believe
in fairy tales...

355
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,136
about chakras or energy...

356
00:27:58,262 --> 00:27:59,888
or the power of belief.

357
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,057
There is no such thing as spirit!

358
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,601
We are made of matter...

359
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:05,727
and nothing more.

360
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,814
You're just another
tiny, momentary speck

361
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,440
within an indifferent universe.

362
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:12,109
You think too little of yourself.

363
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:15,445
You think you see through me, do you?
Well, you don't.

364
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,448
But I see through you!

365
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,509
What did you just do to me?

366
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,803
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

367
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,388
What's in that tea?

368
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,307
Psilocybin? LSD?

369
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,058
It's just tea...

370
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,226
with a little honey.

371
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,978
What just happened?

372
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,480
For a moment,
you entered the astral dimension.

373
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:51,565
The what?

374
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,776
A place where the soul exists
apart from the body.

375
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,737
Why are you doing this to me?

376
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:59,323
To show you
just how much you don't know.

377
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:01,491
Open your eye.

378
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:08,749
Oh, shit!

379
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,293
Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

380
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,836
No, no, no!

381
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,004
What's happening?

382
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,256
This isn't real!

383
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,853
His heart rate
is getting dangerously high.

384
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,443
He looks all right to me.

385
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:41,532
You think you know
how the world works?

386
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,868
You think that this material universe
is all there is?

387
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,667
What is real?

388
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,421
What mysteries lie beyond the reach
of your senses?

389
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:00,884
At the root of existence...

390
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:04,137
mind and matter meet.

391
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:07,224
Thoughts shape reality.

392
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,907
This universe is only one of
an infinite number.

393
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,537
Worlds without end.

394
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:31,748
Some benevolent and life giving.

395
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,422
Others filled with malice and hunger.

396
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:42,259
Dark places...

397
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:47,389
where powers older than time
lie ravenous...

398
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,058
and waiting.

399
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:04,031
Who are you in this vast Multiverse,
Mr. Strange?

400
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:27,221
Have you seen that before
in a gift shop?

401
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,437
Teach me.

402
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,191
No.

403
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,031
No.

404
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,115
No!

405
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,368
No, no, no!

406
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:52,496
No!

407
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,998
Open the door! Please!

408
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,504
Thank you, Masters.

409
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:06,969
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

410
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,513
5 hours later, he's still
on your doorstep.

411
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:12,224
There's a strength to him.

412
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:17,104
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.
I've seen it all before.

413
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,898
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

414
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,818
I cannot lead
another gifted student to power...

415
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:25,237
only to lose him to the darkness.

416
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:28,782
You didn't lose me.

417
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,285
I wanted the power
to defeat my enemies.

418
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:35,080
You gave me the power to defeat
my demons.

419
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:38,208
And to live within the natural law.

420
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,336
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

421
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,672
We only learn to live above them.

422
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:49,052
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

423
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,388
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin...

424
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:53,056
upon us all.

425
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,809
There may be dark days ahead.

426
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,730
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use
a man like Strange.

427
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:11,617
Don't shut me out.

428
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:17,497
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

429
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:22,419
Thank you.

430
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:28,800
Bathe.

431
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:31,136
Rest.

432
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,472
Meditate...

433
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:35,474
if you can.

434
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:37,684
The Ancient One will send for you.

435
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,110
What's this? My mantra?

436
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,406
The Wi-Fi password.

437
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,785
We're not savages.

438
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,818
The language of the mystic arts...

439
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:30,737
is as old as civilization.

440
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,989
The sorcerers of antiquity...

441
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,993
called the use of this language "spells."

442
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,245
But if that word
offends your modern sensibilities...

443
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,746
you can call it a "program."

444
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,001
The source code that shapes reality.

445
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:45,918
We harness energy...

446
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:51,507
drawn from other dimensions
of the Multiverse...

447
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:54,594
to cast spells...

448
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:58,849
to conjure shields...

449
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,851
and weapons...

450
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,103
to make magic.

451
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:20,913
But even if my fingers could do that...

452
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:24,708
my hands would just be
waving in the air.

453
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,960
How do I get from here to there?

454
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:30,464
How did you get
to reattach severed nerves...

455
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:33,342
and put a human spine back together
bone by bone?

456
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,844
Study and practice, years of it.

457
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:45,354
Hey.

458
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,776
Mr. Strange.

459
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:52,402
Stephen, please.

460
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:53,820
And you are?

461
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:54,905
Wong.

462
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,114
Wong.

463
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,991
Just Wong?

464
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,118
Like Adele?

465
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,413
Or Aristotle.

466
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,166
Drake.

467
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:07,709
Bono.

468
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:11,129
Eminem.

469
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,386
The Book of the Invisible Sun.

470
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,847
Astronomia Nova.

471
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,598
Codex Imperium.

472
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:23,475
Key of Solomon.

473
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,187
You finished all of these?

474
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:28,397
Yup.

475
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:30,107
Come with me.

476
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,525
All right.

477
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:34,319
This section is for masters only...

478
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,864
but at my discretion, others may use it.

479
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:40,450
You should start with Maxim's Primer.

480
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,872
How's your Sanskrit?

481
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:49,084
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

482
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,837
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

483
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:56,967
What are those?

484
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:00,596
The Ancient One's private collection.

485
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:02,055
So, they're forbidden?

486
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:04,683
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj
is forbidden.

487
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:06,602
Only certain practices.

488
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,313
Those books are far too advanced

489
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,607
for anyone
other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

490
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,746
This one's got pages missing.

491
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:28,123
That's The Book of Cagliostro.

492
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,958
A study of time.

493
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:33,003
One of the rituals was stolen
by a former master.

494
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,840
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

495
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,844
Just after he strung up
the former librarian...

496
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,347
and relieved him of his head.

497
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:48,018
I am now the guardian of these books.

498
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,855
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again...

499
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,315
I'd know it...

500
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,693
and you'd be dead
before you ever left the compound.

501
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,366
What if it's just overdue?

502
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,868
Any late fees I should know about?
Maiming, perhaps?

503
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,500
People used to think that I was funny.

504
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,709
Did they work for you?

505
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,128
All right.
It's been lovely talking to you.

506
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:16,880
Thank you for the books...

507
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,132
and for the horrifying story...

508
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,134
and for the threat upon my life.

509
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,253
We will now receive the power
to destroy the one who betrayed us.

510
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,883
The one who betrays the world.

511
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:04,154
Mastery of the sling ring
is essential to the mystic arts.

512
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,698
They allow us to travel
throughout the Multiverse.

513
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,409
All you need to do is focus.

514
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,453
Visualize.

515
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:14,831
See the destination in your mind.

516
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:17,918
Look beyond the world in front of you.

517
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,004
Imagine every detail.

518
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:26,218
The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

519
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:28,679
the gateway will come.

520
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:33,350
And stop.

521
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:36,186
I would like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

522
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:37,980
Of course.

523
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:43,235
My hands.

524
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:44,653
It's not about your hands.

525
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:46,697
How is this not about my hands?

526
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,448
Master Hamir.

527
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,256
Thank you, Master Hamir.

528
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,343
You cannot beat a river
into submission.

529
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,470
You have to surrender to its current...

530
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:12,848
and use its power as your own.

531
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:16,768
I control it by surrendering control?
That doesn't make any sense.

532
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:19,313
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

533
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,482
Your intellect has taken you
far in life...

534
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,193
but it will take you no further.

535
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,904
Surrender, Stephen.

536
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:28,739
Silence your ego...

537
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,991
and your power will rise.

538
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,035
Come with me.

539
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:39,166
Wait.

540
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,293
-Is this...
-Everest.

541
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:43,837
Beautiful.

542
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:46,590
Yeah, right, beautiful.

543
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:49,134
Freezing but beautiful.

544
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:50,469
At this temperature...

545
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:52,763
a person can last for 30 minutes...

546
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,557
before suffering permanent
loss of function.

547
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,642
Great.

548
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:59,269
But you'll likely go into shock
within the first two.

549
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,271
What?

550
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,773
Surrender, Stephen.

551
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:03,941
No!

552
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:14,785
How's our new recruit?

553
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,037
We shall see.

554
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,540
Any second now.

555
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,043
No, not again.

556
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:29,299
Maybe I should...

557
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,541
Stephen.

558
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:45,709
Wong.

559
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:46,877
What do you want, Strange?

560
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:48,378
Books on astral projection.

561
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,506
You're not ready for that.

562
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:52,883
Try me, BeyoncĂ©.

563
00:43:55,594 --> 00:43:57,346
Oh, come on.
You've heard of her.

564
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:58,805
She's a huge star, right?

565
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,684
Do you ever laugh?

566
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:05,604
Come on, just give me the book.

567
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:07,773
No.

568
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:39,263
Once, in this room,
you begged me to let you learn.

569
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:42,140
Now, I'm told
you question every lesson...

570
00:44:42,307 --> 00:44:44,017
preferring to teach yourself.

571
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:45,811
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eye.

572
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:47,938
Now, I'm being told
to blindly accept rules...

573
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:49,523
that make no sense.

574
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:52,609
Like the rule against
conjuring a gateway in the library?

575
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,236
Wong told on me?

576
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,738
You're advancing quickly
with your sorcery skills.

577
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,658
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

578
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:20,137
You are now inside
the Mirror Dimension...

579
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,973
ever present but undetected.

580
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,142
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

581
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:30,189
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil...

582
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:33,317
and sometimes to contain threats.

583
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,611
You don't wanna be stuck in here
without your sling ring.

584
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:38,614
Hold on. Sorry.
What do you mean, "threats?"

585
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,211
Learning of an infinite Multiverse
includes learning of infinite dangers.

586
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,589
If I told you everything else
that you don't already know...

587
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,216
you'd run from here in terror.

588
00:46:03,222 --> 00:46:05,682
So just how ancient is she?

589
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:10,437
No one knows the age
of the Sorcerer Supreme.

590
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:14,358
Only that she's Celtic and
never talks about her past.

591
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:16,235
You follow her, even though
you don't know?

592
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:17,444
I know she's steadfast...

593
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:19,071
but unpredictable.

594
00:46:19,238 --> 00:46:20,614
Merciless, yet kind.

595
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,117
She made me what I am.

596
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:27,079
Trust your teacher...

597
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:29,081
and don't lose your way.

598
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,374
Like Kaecilius?

599
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,750
That's right.

600
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,090
You knew him.

601
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:40,050
When he first came to us...

602
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:42,469
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

603
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,346
He was a grieving, broken man

604
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,265
searching for answers
in the mystic arts.

605
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:50,269
A brilliant student, but he was proud,
headstrong.

606
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:52,521
He questioned the Ancient One,
rejected her teaching.

607
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:01,864
He left Kamar-Taj.

608
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:06,577
His disciples followed him like sheep.
Seduced by false doctrine.

609
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:09,121
And he stole
the forbidden ritual, right?

610
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:10,205
Yes.

611
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,582
What did it do?

612
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:15,252
No more questions.

613
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:17,754
What's that?

614
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:19,131
That's a question.

615
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:22,718
This is a relic.

616
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:24,720
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

617
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:25,929
so we imbue objects with it...

618
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:29,391
allowing them to take the strain
we cannot.

619
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:32,477
This is the staff...

620
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:34,271
of the Living Tribunal.

621
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:39,193
There are many relics.

622
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:41,153
The Wand of Watoomb.

623
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:43,780
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

624
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:45,741
Really just roll off the tongue,
don't they?

625
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,451
When do I get my relic?

626
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:48,493
When you're ready.

627
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:49,953
I think I'm ready.

628
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:52,623
You're ready
when the relic decides you're ready.

629
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:54,666
For now...

630
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:56,752
conjure a weapon.

631
00:47:58,462 --> 00:47:59,463
All right.

632
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:07,054
Fight!

633
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:09,598
Fight like your life
depended on it.

634
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:17,272
Because one day...

635
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:18,732
it may.

636
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:30,053
Wong?

637
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:43,734
Okay.

638
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,071
"First, open the Eye of Agamotto."

639
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:09,301
All right.

640
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:33,951
Oh, my.

641
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:49,633
What if...

642
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:12,865
"Dormammu."

643
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:15,909
"The Dark Dimension."

644
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:18,203
Eternal life?

645
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:24,668
What the...

646
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:25,836
Stop!

647
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:32,050
Tampering with continuum probabilities
is forbidden.

648
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:34,678
I was just doing exactly what it said
in the book.

649
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:37,514
What did the book say about
the dangers of performing that ritual?

650
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,183
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

651
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:42,352
Temporal manipulations
can create branches in time.

652
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,771
Unstable dimensional openings.

653
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:47,191
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

654
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:49,359
You wanna get stuck reliving
the same moment

655
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:50,569
over and over forever...

656
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:52,154
or never having existed at all?

657
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,699
Really should put the warnings
before the spell.

658
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:57,868
Your curiosity could have
gotten you killed.

659
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,204
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum...

660
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:01,330
you were breaking it.

661
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:05,876
We do not tamper with natural law.
We defend it.

662
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:07,336
How did you even do that?

663
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:11,924
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

664
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:13,091
I've got a photographic memory.

665
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,052
That's how I got my M.D. and Ph.D.
at the same time.

666
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,678
What you just did...

667
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,223
takes more than a good memory.

668
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:21,058
You were born for the mystic arts.

669
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:23,435
And yet my hands still shake.

670
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,645
For now, yes.

671
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,063
Not forever?

672
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,314
We're not prophets.

673
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,358
When are you gonna start telling me
what we are?

674
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:36,240
While heroes like the Avengers

675
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:38,575
protect the world
from physical dangers...

676
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:42,246
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

677
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:47,084
The Ancient One is the latest in
a long line of Sorcerers Supreme...

678
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:50,879
going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts...

679
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:52,256
the mighty Agamotto.

680
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:57,427
Same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

681
00:52:58,762 --> 00:53:02,266
Agamotto built three Sanctums
in places of power...

682
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:04,434
where great cities now stand.

683
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:06,728
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum.

684
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:09,439
That door to the New York Sanctum.

685
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:11,358
That one to the London Sanctum.

686
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:13,569
Together...

687
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:17,072
the Sanctums generate
a protective shield around our world.

688
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:19,283
The Sanctums protect the world...

689
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:20,742
and we sorcerers...

690
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,744
protect the Sanctums.

691
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,913
From what?

692
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:27,666
Other dimensional beings that
threaten our universe.

693
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,543
Like Dormammu.

694
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:32,421
Where did you learn that name?

695
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:36,300
I just read it
in The Book of Cagliostro. Why?

696
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:43,974
Dormammu dwells
in the Dark Dimension.

697
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:46,143
Beyond time.

698
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:48,854
He is the cosmic conqueror...

699
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,981
the destroyer of worlds.

700
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:54,693
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

701
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,196
on a quest to invade every universe...

702
00:53:57,362 --> 00:54:01,408
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

703
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:03,994
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

704
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:07,331
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

705
00:54:07,998 --> 00:54:09,541
A ritual to contact Dormammu

706
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,502
and draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

707
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:17,633
Okay...

708
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:20,177
I'm out.

709
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,472
I came here to heal my hands.

710
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:27,559
Not to fight in some mystical war.

711
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:30,854
London.

712
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:36,693
Kaecilius!

713
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:38,111
No!

714
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:46,036
Wong? Mordo?

715
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:38,088
Hello?

716
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:08,452
Hello?

717
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:50,869
Daniel, I see they made you
master of this Sanctum.

718
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,997
You know what that means?

719
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,166
That you'll die protecting it.

720
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,141
Stop!

721
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:27,114
How long have you been at Kamar-Taj,
Mister...

722
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:28,532
Doctor.

723
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:31,118
Mister Doctor?

724
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,120
It's Strange.

725
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:37,082
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

726
01:00:02,186 --> 01:00:04,271
You don't know how to use that,
do you?

727
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,294
What?

728
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:57,134
Stop it.

729
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:58,260
I said stop it.

730
01:01:58,343 --> 01:01:59,803
You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor.

731
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:02,389
I don't even know what "this" is.

732
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:03,682
It's the end...

733
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,642
and the beginning.

734
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:08,645
The many becoming the few
becoming the One.

735
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,690
If you're not gonna start making sense...

736
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,525
I'm just gonna have to
put this thing back on.

737
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,194
Tell me, Mister Doctor...

738
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:18,155
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange.

739
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:19,948
-You are a doctor?
-Yeah.

740
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:21,116
A scientist.

741
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:23,327
You understand the laws of nature.

742
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:26,663
All things age. All things die.

743
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,290
In the end, our sun burns out.

744
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:30,834
Our universe grows cold and perishes.

745
01:02:31,376 --> 01:02:32,586
But the Dark Dimension...

746
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:35,506
it's a place beyond time.

747
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:37,090
That's it.
I'm putting this thing back on.

748
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:38,675
This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

749
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:41,512
This world can take its rightful place
alongside so many others...

750
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:42,930
as part of the One.

751
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,474
The great and beautiful One.

752
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:48,101
We can all live forever.

753
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:49,520
Really?

754
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:54,816
What do you have to gain out of
this New Age dimensional utopia?

755
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:56,944
The same as you.

756
01:02:57,069 --> 01:02:59,738
The same as everyone.
Life. Eternal life.

757
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:02,449
People think in terms of
good and evil...

758
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:04,243
when really time is the true enemy
of us all.

759
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:06,203
Time kills everything.

760
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:08,038
What about the people you killed?

761
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:09,331
Tiny.

762
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:12,000
Momentary specks
within an indifferent universe.

763
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:15,879
Yes. You see.

764
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:18,882
You see what we're doing.

765
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:21,051
The world is not what it ought to be.

766
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:23,595
Humanity longs for the eternal...

767
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:26,390
for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

768
01:03:26,557 --> 01:03:28,725
Time is an insult.

769
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,561
Death is an insult.

770
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:33,230
Doctor...

771
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:36,567
we don't seek to rule this world.

772
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:37,901
We seek to save it...

773
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:41,572
to hand it over to Dormammu,
who is the intent of all evolution...

774
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:44,449
the why of all existence.

775
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:48,412
The Sorcerer Supreme
defends existence.

776
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:52,249
What was it that brought you
to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

777
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:53,542
Was it enlightenment?

778
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:55,586
Power?

779
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:59,923
You came to be healed,
as did we all.

780
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:04,136
Kamar-Taj is a place
that collects broken things.

781
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:06,263
We all come
with the promise of being healed...

782
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:09,224
and instead The Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

783
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:12,978
The real magic she keeps for herself.

784
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:16,607
You ever wonder
how she managed to live this long?

785
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:24,198
I saw the rituals
in The Book of Cagliostro.

786
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:26,742
So, you know.

787
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,828
The ritual gives me the power
to overthrow The Ancient One...

788
01:04:29,995 --> 01:04:31,663
and tear her Sanctums down.

789
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,416
To let the Dark Dimension in.

790
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:38,253
Because what The Ancient One hoards,
Dormammu gives freely.

791
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:40,714
Life everlasting.

792
01:04:41,632 --> 01:04:43,675
He's not the destroyer of worlds,
doctor.

793
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:45,802
He's the savior of worlds.

794
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:47,971
No. I mean, come on.

795
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:50,224
Look at your face.

796
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:52,476
Dormammu made you a murderer.

797
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:54,811
Just how good can his kingdom be?

798
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:58,482
You think that's funny?

799
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:00,526
No, not that.

800
01:05:00,651 --> 01:05:03,070
What's funny is that
you've lost your sling ring.

801
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:12,389
Sir, can I help you?

802
01:06:12,556 --> 01:06:13,765
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

803
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:15,392
-Sir. We need to get...
-Where is she?

804
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:16,935
The nurse's station.

805
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:18,228
Christine!

806
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,273
Stephen?

807
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,441
Oh, my God.

808
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:25,110
Get me in an operating theater now.
Just you.

809
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:26,445
Now! I haven't any time.

810
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,071
What happened?

811
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:31,158
I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

812
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:33,744
What are you wearing?

813
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:41,376
Chest cavity is clear.

814
01:06:41,418 --> 01:06:45,422
No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.

815
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:48,383
No, no, no.

816
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:49,426
Stephen?

817
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:52,221
Come on, come on.

818
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:18,914
Just a little higher.

819
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,668
Please be careful with the needle.

820
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:25,754
Stephen?

821
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:29,508
What am I seeing?

822
01:07:29,633 --> 01:07:31,468
My astral body.

823
01:07:32,511 --> 01:07:33,887
Are you dead?

824
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:35,722
No, Christine. But I am dying.

825
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:39,893
Right.

826
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:42,229
Yeah. All right.

827
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:43,981
Okay.

828
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,278
Oh, wow.

829
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:55,826
I've never seen a wound like this.

830
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:57,703
What were you stabbed with?

831
01:07:58,287 --> 01:07:59,454
I don't know.

832
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:20,975
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

833
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,144
What?

834
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:24,020
Keep me alive, will you?

835
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:29,109
Okay.

836
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,635
Oh, shit.

837
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,006
Come on, come on.

838
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:39,763
Stephen, come on.

839
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:43,392
Hit me again.

840
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,560
Stop doing that!

841
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:47,437
Up the voltage and hit me again.

842
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,564
No, your heart's beating!

843
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:49,939
Just do it!

844
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:52,568
Oh, my God.

845
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:23,515
Oh, God! Oh, God!

846
01:10:23,682 --> 01:10:24,683
Are you okay?

847
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:25,851
Yeah.

848
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,186
Okay.

849
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:35,611
After all this time...

850
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:37,654
you just show up here...

851
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:41,200
flying out of your body.

852
01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:43,076
Yeah, I know.

853
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:44,828
I missed you, too, by the way.

854
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:46,663
Ha ha.

855
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:49,374
I wrote you emails,
but you never responded.

856
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,792
Why would I?

857
01:10:51,668 --> 01:10:54,046
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

858
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:57,007
For all of it. You were right.

859
01:10:57,174 --> 01:11:00,636
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly.

860
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,347
And you deserved so much more.

861
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:04,973
Stop. You're clearly in shock.

862
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:09,144
What the hell is happening?

863
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:10,646
Where have you been?

864
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,566
After Western medicine failed me...

865
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:17,778
I headed east,
and I ended up in Kathmandu.

866
01:11:17,903 --> 01:11:18,946
Kathmandu?

867
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:20,322
Yeah.

868
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:22,658
Like the Bob Seger song?

869
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:24,660
1975, Beautiful Loser, side A.
Yeah.

870
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:28,455
I went to a place
called Kamar-Taj...

871
01:11:28,622 --> 01:11:32,376
and I talked to someone
called "The Ancient One."

872
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:34,336
So you joined a cult.

873
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:37,172
No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No.

874
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:40,050
They did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

875
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:41,510
Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

876
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:42,886
It's not a cult.

877
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:44,429
That's what a cultist would say.

878
01:11:44,555 --> 01:11:45,556
Oh, no.

879
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:48,725
Wait. Stephen, wait.
What do you think you're doing?

880
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:50,519
I'm late for a cult meeting.

881
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:55,315
This is insane.

882
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:56,483
Yeah.

883
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,110
Where are you going?

884
01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:00,612
Can you tell me the truth?

885
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:04,992
A powerful sorcerer who gave himself
over to an ancient entity...

886
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:07,703
can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me.

887
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:09,580
But I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village...

888
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:12,207
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway...

889
01:12:12,332 --> 01:12:13,417
that I opened up in the mop closet.

890
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,502
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

891
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:27,514
Really do have to go.

892
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:29,641
Yeah.

893
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:16,522
Strange!

894
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:20,400
You're okay.

895
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,653
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.

896
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:25,280
The Cloak of Levitation.

897
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,699
It came to you.

898
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:29,993
No minor feat.

899
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:32,329
It's a fickle thing.

900
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:33,539
He's escaped.

901
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:34,665
Kaecilius?

902
01:13:34,706 --> 01:13:35,791
Yeah.

903
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,627
He can fold space and matter at will.

904
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:42,172
He folds matter
outside the Mirror Dimension...

905
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:43,507
in the real world?

906
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:44,675
Yeah.

907
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:45,843
How many more?

908
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:47,386
Two.

909
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:49,596
I stranded one in the desert.

910
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:50,764
And the other?

911
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:52,307
His body's in the hall.

912
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:54,393
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

913
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:56,061
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

914
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:57,688
The London Sanctum has fallen.

915
01:13:57,855 --> 01:14:00,190
Only New York and Hong Kong
remain now...

916
01:14:00,357 --> 01:14:02,401
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

917
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:06,154
You defended the New York Sanctum
from attack.

918
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,115
With its master gone, it needs another.

919
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,575
Master Strange.

920
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:13,579
No.

921
01:14:14,788 --> 01:14:16,707
It is Doctor Strange.

922
01:14:16,874 --> 01:14:19,501
Not Master Strange.
Not Mister Strange.

923
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:20,878
Doctor Strange.

924
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:25,632
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

925
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:27,384
And I have just killed a man!

926
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:28,969
I'm not doing that again.

927
01:14:29,136 --> 01:14:31,680
I became a doctor to save lives,
not take them.

928
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:35,058
You became a doctor to save one life
above all others.

929
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:36,143
Your own.

930
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:39,396
Still seeing through me, are you?

931
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:43,233
I see what I've always seen:
your over-inflated ego.

932
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:46,904
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything...

933
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,405
even death...

934
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:50,199
which no one can control.

935
01:14:50,365 --> 01:14:53,160
Not even
the great Doctor Stephen Strange.

936
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,412
Not even Dormammu?

937
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:58,957
He offers immortality.

938
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:01,168
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

939
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:02,419
He feeds off it.

940
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:04,755
Like you feed off him?

941
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,673
You talk to me about controlling death?

942
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,841
I know how you do it.

943
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:10,886
I've seen the missing rituals
from The Book of Cagliostro.

944
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:14,765
Measure your next words very carefully,
doctor.

945
01:15:14,932 --> 01:15:16,767
Because you might not like them?

946
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:19,895
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

947
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,647
What is he talking about?

948
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:24,942
I'm talking about her long life,
the source of her immortality.

949
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:30,030
She draws power
from the Dark Dimension to stay alive.

950
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:33,242
That's not true.

951
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:35,619
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

952
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:37,829
I know how you do it.

953
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,041
Once they regroup...

954
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,584
the Zealots will be back.

955
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:45,254
You'll need reinforcements.

956
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:54,304
She's not who you think she is.

957
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,306
You don't have the right to say that.

958
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:59,184
You've no idea the responsibility
that rests upon her shoulders.

959
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:01,061
No, and I don't want to know.

960
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:02,646
You're a coward.

961
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:04,064
Because I'm not a killer?

962
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:05,732
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

963
01:16:05,816 --> 01:16:08,485
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

964
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:09,945
What do you think I just did?

965
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:11,363
You saved your own life!

966
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:15,325
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

967
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:16,743
You would have done it so easily?

968
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:19,663
You've no idea the things I've done.

969
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:23,584
And the answer is yes.

970
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,586
Without hesitation.

971
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:26,837
Even if there's another way?

972
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:28,839
There is no other way.

973
01:16:28,964 --> 01:16:30,257
You lack imagination.

974
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,508
No, Stephen.

975
01:16:31,675 --> 01:16:35,012
You lack a spine.

976
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:41,476
They're back.

977
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,568
We have to end this.

978
01:16:49,693 --> 01:16:50,861
Now!

979
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:57,242
Strange!

980
01:16:57,367 --> 01:16:59,119
Get down here and fight!

981
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:00,454
No!

982
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,251
The Mirror Dimension.

983
01:17:06,877 --> 01:17:09,213
You can't affect the real world in here.

984
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:11,006
Who's laughing now?

985
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:12,299
Asshole.

986
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:15,594
I am.

987
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:31,568
I've got his sling ring.
They can't escape, right?

988
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:34,112
Run!

989
01:17:51,255 --> 01:17:52,798
Their connection to the Dark Dimension

990
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,925
makes them more powerful
in the Mirror Dimension.

991
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:57,219
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

992
01:17:57,386 --> 01:18:00,305
This wasn't cleverness.
It was suicide!

993
01:18:17,197 --> 01:18:19,449
That is hilarious.

994
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:06,914
This was a mistake.

995
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:40,591
It's true.

996
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:44,928
She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

997
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:49,516
Kaecilius.

998
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:55,230
I came to you broken...

999
01:20:55,355 --> 01:20:58,192
lost, in need.

1000
01:20:58,317 --> 01:21:01,195
Trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

1001
01:21:01,737 --> 01:21:03,071
I tried to protect you.

1002
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:04,156
From the truth?

1003
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,741
From yourself.

1004
01:21:05,782 --> 01:21:08,118
I have a new teacher now.

1005
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:09,369
Dormammu deceives you.

1006
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:12,748
You have no idea what he truly is.

1007
01:21:12,873 --> 01:21:16,793
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

1008
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:18,128
Liar.

1009
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:15,102
Christine!

1010
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:17,396
Are you kidding me?

1011
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:19,606
Oh, my God.

1012
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:24,194
It's not fibrillation.
She has a stunned myocardium.

1013
01:22:24,278 --> 01:22:25,529
-Neurogenic?
-Yes.

1014
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:31,785
Someone get the swabs.

1015
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,622
Nic?

1016
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,377
We need to relieve the pressure
on her brain.

1017
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:45,090
She's still dropping.

1018
01:22:45,257 --> 01:22:47,676
-We're losing her!
-We need to increase her oxygen!

1019
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:49,845
-I need a crash cart!
-Her pupils have dilated!

1020
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:53,223
No reflexes.
We're not reading any brain activity.

1021
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,403
What are you doing?

1022
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:09,072
Come on, you're dying!

1023
01:23:17,664 --> 01:23:20,167
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

1024
01:23:20,334 --> 01:23:21,919
Time is relative.

1025
01:23:22,085 --> 01:23:24,421
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1026
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:28,008
I've spent so many years...

1027
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:29,927
peering through time...

1028
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:32,471
looking at this exact moment.

1029
01:23:32,638 --> 01:23:34,348
But I can't see past it.

1030
01:23:34,932 --> 01:23:38,393
I've prevented countless,
terrible futures.

1031
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,063
And after each one,
there's always another.

1032
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:43,607
And they all lead here...

1033
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:44,775
but never further.

1034
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,902
You think this is where you die.

1035
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:50,197
You wonder what I see in your future?

1036
01:23:50,364 --> 01:23:51,448
No.

1037
01:23:53,492 --> 01:23:54,701
Yes.

1038
01:23:54,868 --> 01:23:56,495
I never saw your future.

1039
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,956
Only its possibilities.

1040
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:01,917
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1041
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:03,836
You always excelled...

1042
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:06,421
but not because you craved success...

1043
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:08,966
but because of your fear of failure.

1044
01:24:09,132 --> 01:24:10,926
That's what made me a great doctor.

1045
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:13,762
It's precisely what kept you
from greatness.

1046
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:16,765
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

1047
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:20,435
from learning the simplest
and most significant lesson of all.

1048
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:21,603
Which is?

1049
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:26,024
It's not about you.

1050
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:30,988
When you first came to me...

1051
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:34,324
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1052
01:24:35,325 --> 01:24:36,577
I didn't.

1053
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:42,791
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

1054
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:44,751
He uses magic to walk?

1055
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:46,044
Constantly.

1056
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:48,380
He had a choice...

1057
01:24:49,173 --> 01:24:51,258
to return to his own life...

1058
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:53,927
or to serve something
greater than himself.

1059
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:56,680
So I could have my hands back again?

1060
01:24:56,847 --> 01:24:58,265
My old life?

1061
01:24:59,016 --> 01:25:00,309
You could.

1062
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:04,062
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

1063
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:08,859
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

1064
01:25:09,026 --> 01:25:10,110
But as you well know...

1065
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:12,571
sometimes one must break the rules...

1066
01:25:12,738 --> 01:25:14,573
in order to serve the greater good.

1067
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:16,617
Mordo won't see it that way.

1068
01:25:16,783 --> 01:25:19,328
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

1069
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:21,747
forged by the fires of his youth.

1070
01:25:21,872 --> 01:25:23,624
He needs your flexibility...

1071
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:25,834
just as you need his strength.

1072
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,714
Only together do you stand a chance
of stopping Dormammu.

1073
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:32,341
I'm not ready.

1074
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:35,844
No one ever is.

1075
01:25:37,513 --> 01:25:39,806
We don't get to choose our time.

1076
01:25:43,977 --> 01:25:46,063
Death is what gives life meaning.

1077
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:49,650
To know your days are numbered.

1078
01:25:49,816 --> 01:25:51,902
Your time is short.

1079
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,240
You'd think after all this time,
I'd be ready.

1080
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:58,742
But look at me.

1081
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:01,995
Stretching one moment out
into a thousand...

1082
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,540
just so that I can watch the snow.

1083
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:44,621
Are you okay?

1084
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:54,548
I don't understand what's happening.

1085
01:26:54,715 --> 01:26:55,799
I know.

1086
01:26:56,592 --> 01:26:59,553
But I have to go away now.

1087
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:07,186
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

1088
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:09,062
That it could be a beginning.

1089
01:27:09,188 --> 01:27:10,189
Yeah.

1090
01:27:11,815 --> 01:27:14,484
Because there are other ways
to save lives.

1091
01:27:17,613 --> 01:27:19,031
A harder way.

1092
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:22,659
A weirder way.

1093
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:27,331
Doctor Palmer to the ER, please.
Doctor Palmer to the ER.

1094
01:27:31,668 --> 01:27:33,504
I don't want you to go.

1095
01:28:21,552 --> 01:28:22,719
Stop!

1096
01:28:52,624 --> 01:28:54,626
Choose your weapon wisely.

1097
01:28:57,963 --> 01:29:00,090
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1098
01:29:02,426 --> 01:29:03,468
No one.

1099
01:29:19,443 --> 01:29:20,611
Kaecilius.

1100
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:23,280
You're on the wrong side of history,
Wong.

1101
01:29:35,959 --> 01:29:37,377
She's dead.

1102
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:38,795
You were right.

1103
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:42,007
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1104
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:45,010
She was complicated.

1105
01:29:49,515 --> 01:29:50,974
Complicated?

1106
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:56,647
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1107
01:29:56,772 --> 01:29:57,898
Dangerous.

1108
01:29:58,815 --> 01:30:00,025
What if it overtook her?

1109
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:04,238
She taught us it was forbidden...

1110
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:08,992
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

1111
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:10,869
She did what she thought was right.

1112
01:30:11,036 --> 01:30:12,788
The bill comes due.

1113
01:30:13,872 --> 01:30:15,082
Don't you see?

1114
01:30:16,667 --> 01:30:20,003
Her transgressions
led the Zealots to Dormammu.

1115
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:23,674
Kaecilius was her fault!

1116
01:30:24,383 --> 01:30:25,425
And here we are...

1117
01:30:25,592 --> 01:30:27,845
in the consequence of her deception.

1118
01:30:31,265 --> 01:30:32,683
A world on fire.

1119
01:30:32,808 --> 01:30:35,018
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

1120
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,145
The New York one
has been attacked twice.

1121
01:30:37,187 --> 01:30:38,814
You know where they're going next.

1122
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:40,357
Hong Kong.

1123
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,693
You told me once to fight
like my life depended on it...

1124
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:43,735
because one day, it might.

1125
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:45,529
Well, today is that day.

1126
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,699
I cannot defeat them alone.

1127
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:07,634
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1128
01:31:15,392 --> 01:31:17,227
The Dark Dimension.

1129
01:31:19,146 --> 01:31:20,689
Dormammu is coming.

1130
01:31:23,025 --> 01:31:24,276
It's too late.

1131
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:26,069
Nothing can stop him.

1132
01:31:28,322 --> 01:31:29,740
Not necessarily.

1133
01:31:34,203 --> 01:31:35,204
No.

1134
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:18,121
The spell's working.

1135
01:32:19,456 --> 01:32:21,583
We've got a second chance.

1136
01:34:00,098 --> 01:34:02,059
No!

1137
01:34:12,194 --> 01:34:13,237
Wong.

1138
01:34:22,204 --> 01:34:23,872
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

1139
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:27,543
Well, don't stop now.

1140
01:34:29,127 --> 01:34:31,630
When the Sanctum's restored,
they'll attack it again.

1141
01:34:31,797 --> 01:34:33,090
We've got to defend it.

1142
01:34:33,215 --> 01:34:34,258
Come on!

1143
01:35:02,786 --> 01:35:03,871
Get up, Strange.

1144
01:35:03,996 --> 01:35:05,330
Get up and fight.

1145
01:35:05,914 --> 01:35:07,291
We can finish this.

1146
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,460
You can't fight the inevitable.

1147
01:35:13,797 --> 01:35:15,549
Isn't it beautiful?

1148
01:35:17,134 --> 01:35:19,511
A world beyond time.

1149
01:35:22,055 --> 01:35:23,473
Beyond death.

1150
01:35:27,644 --> 01:35:29,438
Beyond time...

1151
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:30,606
Strange.

1152
01:36:03,096 --> 01:36:04,348
He's gone.

1153
01:36:05,724 --> 01:36:09,019
Even Strange has left you
and surrendered to his power.

1154
01:36:40,884 --> 01:36:44,263
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1155
01:36:44,388 --> 01:36:46,849
You've come to die.

1156
01:36:46,974 --> 01:36:51,228
Your world is now my world...

1157
01:36:51,353 --> 01:36:53,981
like all worlds.

1158
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,264
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1159
01:37:27,431 --> 01:37:30,100
You've come to die.

1160
01:37:30,267 --> 01:37:33,270
Your world is now my...

1161
01:37:34,438 --> 01:37:36,106
What is this?

1162
01:37:36,648 --> 01:37:37,941
Illusion?

1163
01:37:38,108 --> 01:37:39,484
No. This is real.

1164
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:41,028
Good.

1165
01:37:51,288 --> 01:37:54,458
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1166
01:37:54,583 --> 01:37:57,878
You've... What is happening?

1167
01:37:58,462 --> 01:38:01,131
Just as you gave Kaecilius powers
from your dimension...

1168
01:38:01,298 --> 01:38:03,842
I brought a little power from mine.

1169
01:38:04,426 --> 01:38:06,386
This is time.

1170
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:09,932
Endless looped time.

1171
01:38:10,516 --> 01:38:12,392
You dare!

1172
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:18,565
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1173
01:38:19,274 --> 01:38:21,777
You cannot do this forever.

1174
01:38:21,944 --> 01:38:23,570
Actually, I can.

1175
01:38:23,695 --> 01:38:26,031
This is how things are now.

1176
01:38:26,198 --> 01:38:29,326
You and me, trapped in this moment...

1177
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:30,536
endlessly.

1178
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:34,498
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1179
01:38:34,623 --> 01:38:38,669
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1180
01:38:38,794 --> 01:38:40,420
But you will suffer.

1181
01:38:40,546 --> 01:38:42,631
Pain's an old friend.

1182
01:38:44,675 --> 01:38:45,843
Dormammu...

1183
01:38:46,718 --> 01:38:47,845
I've come to bargain.

1184
01:38:48,011 --> 01:38:49,012
End this!

1185
01:38:49,596 --> 01:38:51,056
Dormammu... Dormammu...

1186
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:52,224
Dormammu...

1187
01:39:08,073 --> 01:39:11,034
You will never win.

1188
01:39:12,411 --> 01:39:13,537
No...

1189
01:39:14,246 --> 01:39:15,706
but I can lose...

1190
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:19,168
again and again...

1191
01:39:19,877 --> 01:39:20,919
and again...

1192
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:23,714
and again, forever.

1193
01:39:25,215 --> 01:39:26,758
And that makes you my prisoner.

1194
01:39:26,884 --> 01:39:27,926
No!

1195
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:29,553
Stop!

1196
01:39:30,012 --> 01:39:32,556
Make this stop!

1197
01:39:32,681 --> 01:39:34,725
Set me free!

1198
01:39:35,726 --> 01:39:36,810
No.

1199
01:39:37,352 --> 01:39:39,188
I've come to bargain.

1200
01:39:40,856 --> 01:39:43,233
What do you want?

1201
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:47,070
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

1202
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:49,740
End your assault on my world.

1203
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:51,783
Never come back.

1204
01:39:52,534 --> 01:39:53,577
Do it...

1205
01:39:53,952 --> 01:39:56,163
and I'll break the loop.

1206
01:40:05,672 --> 01:40:06,798
Get up, Strange!

1207
01:40:06,924 --> 01:40:08,258
Get up and fight.

1208
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,427
We can finish this.

1209
01:40:11,011 --> 01:40:12,095
Isn't it beautiful?

1210
01:40:14,389 --> 01:40:16,725
A world beyond time.

1211
01:40:19,353 --> 01:40:20,896
Beyond death.

1212
01:40:32,783 --> 01:40:34,117
What have you done?

1213
01:40:34,284 --> 01:40:35,827
I made a bargain.

1214
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:39,831
What is this?

1215
01:40:40,874 --> 01:40:43,627
Well, it's everything
you've ever wanted.

1216
01:40:44,795 --> 01:40:47,089
Eternal life as part of the One.

1217
01:40:49,591 --> 01:40:51,343
You're not gonna like it.

1218
01:41:11,154 --> 01:41:12,990
Yeah, you know,
you really should have stolen

1219
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:15,492
the whole book because the warnings...

1220
01:41:15,659 --> 01:41:17,911
The warnings come after the spells.

1221
01:41:28,005 --> 01:41:29,173
That's funny.

1222
01:41:56,617 --> 01:41:57,868
We did it.

1223
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,872
Yes.

1224
01:42:02,497 --> 01:42:04,374
Yes, we did it.

1225
01:42:05,375 --> 01:42:06,793
By also violating...

1226
01:42:06,919 --> 01:42:08,587
the natural law.

1227
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:12,090
Look around you. It's over.

1228
01:42:12,216 --> 01:42:14,885
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

1229
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:18,222
No price to pay?

1230
01:42:18,805 --> 01:42:21,725
We broke our rules, just like her.

1231
01:42:22,726 --> 01:42:26,188
The bill comes due.

1232
01:42:27,022 --> 01:42:28,023
Always!

1233
01:42:29,233 --> 01:42:30,400
A reckoning.

1234
01:42:33,487 --> 01:42:36,323
I will follow this path no longer.

1235
01:43:10,232 --> 01:43:11,692
Yeah, okay.

1236
01:43:21,076 --> 01:43:22,452
Wise choice.

1237
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:25,080
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

1238
01:43:25,247 --> 01:43:27,457
once you've mastered its powers.

1239
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:28,792
Until then...

1240
01:43:29,918 --> 01:43:32,629
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

1241
01:43:32,713 --> 01:43:33,714
A what?

1242
01:43:35,048 --> 01:43:36,884
You might have a gift
for the mystic arts,

1243
01:43:36,967 --> 01:43:39,052
but you still have much to learn.

1244
01:43:40,429 --> 01:43:44,099
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

1245
01:43:44,266 --> 01:43:46,852
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

1246
01:43:47,436 --> 01:43:48,437
We must be ready.

1247
01:43:48,478 --> 01:43:49,479
We'll be ready.

1248
01:46:36,313 --> 01:46:39,775
So Earth has wizards now, huh?

1249
01:46:41,318 --> 01:46:42,319
Tea?

1250
01:46:42,945 --> 01:46:44,321
I don't drink tea.

1251
01:46:44,488 --> 01:46:45,489
What do you drink?

1252
01:46:46,782 --> 01:46:48,116
Not tea.

1253
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:53,163
So, I keep a watch list...

1254
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:55,165
of individuals and beings
from other realms

1255
01:46:55,249 --> 01:46:56,625
that may be a threat to this world.

1256
01:46:56,750 --> 01:47:00,504
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1257
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:04,424
Worthy inclusion.

1258
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:05,759
Yeah.

1259
01:47:06,969 --> 01:47:11,014
So why bring him here to New York?

1260
01:47:11,139 --> 01:47:12,516
It's a bit of a long story.

1261
01:47:12,683 --> 01:47:14,601
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1262
01:47:14,768 --> 01:47:16,520
But we're looking for my father.

1263
01:47:17,104 --> 01:47:20,148
Oh, okay.
So if you found Odin...

1264
01:47:20,315 --> 01:47:23,360
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

1265
01:47:23,527 --> 01:47:24,903
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1266
01:47:25,028 --> 01:47:26,363
Great!

1267
01:47:27,698 --> 01:47:29,449
Allow me to help you.

1268
01:53:30,561 --> 01:53:31,645
Can I help you?

1269
01:53:32,896 --> 01:53:36,024
They carried you into Kamar-Taj
on a stretcher.

1270
01:53:37,317 --> 01:53:39,570
Look at you now, Pangborn.

1271
01:53:40,571 --> 01:53:41,905
Mordo.

1272
01:53:44,741 --> 01:53:46,493
So what can I do for you, man?

1273
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:50,414
I've been away for many months now,
and I've had a revelation.

1274
01:53:51,248 --> 01:53:53,876
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

1275
01:53:54,001 --> 01:53:56,753
is to twist things out of
their proper shape...

1276
01:53:57,588 --> 01:53:59,131
stealing power...

1277
01:53:59,923 --> 01:54:01,508
perverting nature.

1278
01:54:02,092 --> 01:54:03,510
Like you.

1279
01:54:04,386 --> 01:54:06,763
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1280
01:54:07,431 --> 01:54:08,432
Mine.

1281
01:54:08,557 --> 01:54:09,600
Power...

1282
01:54:10,767 --> 01:54:12,519
has a purpose.

1283
01:54:26,283 --> 01:54:28,660
Why are you doing this?

1284
01:54:28,785 --> 01:54:31,997
Because I see, at long last,
what's wrong with the world.

1285
01:54:37,294 --> 01:54:39,463
Too many sorcerers.
