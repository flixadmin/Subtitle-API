1
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,280
'O birds, you are all over this world'

2
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,270
'You have spread your wings
right up to Heaven'

3
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,790
'Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds'

4
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,230
'Feathered creatures of our world!'

5
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:48,962
I just read his latest paper
He's working on this new type of robot

6
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:51,303
Looks like heavy security
There's an auto drone

7
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:53,401
Shall we ask him questions?

8
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:55,006
Ask sensible questions please

9
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:57,791
Any idea what to ask
One look at him and-

10
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:05,294
'Welcome'

11
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:06,900
We are from Excel Engineering college

12
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,273
Robotic research students

13
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,620
We've got an appointment
to meet Dr Vaseegaran

14
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,700
Please come in

15
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,640
Dude, soooper hyperbola!

16
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,140
Excuse me
You are-

17
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,400
I am Dr Vaseegaran's assistant

18
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,410
- Your name
- Nila

19
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,430
- Beauuuutiful!
- Thanks

20
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,570
Nila...moon!

21
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,690
What?

22
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,830
It's a lie to say
there's no gravity in the moon

23
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,370
- Why?
- You are such a magnetic force!

24
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,140
Your laughter can be my ringtone!

25
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,660
Can I have your number?

26
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,950
11423879

27
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,740
Enough! The whole floor is slippery!

28
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Hi

29
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,550
Hello, sir

30
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,070
Please sit down

31
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,850
Doctor, we are mechatronic students

32
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,160
Professor Mithra told us you have
created a new humanoid robot

33
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,420
- Can we take a look at that?
- Sure

34
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,480
This is the new robot I have created

35
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,730
Project Nila

36
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,630
Nice, intelligent, lovely assistant

37
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,290
Humanoid X12 2018 model

38
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,820
Quantum Core Millenia

39
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,630
X12 5D Extreme processor

40
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,120
Unlimited Cloud memory

41
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,370
1 Tera hertz speed

42
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,630
Built in simulated Amygdala

43
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,850
This is her MPU
Memory and Power Unit

44
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,340
Works like our heart

45
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,750
Synthetic skin

46
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,330
Ultra realistic humanoid

47
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,720
You are such a magnetic force!

48
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,270
What about that phone #?

49
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,880
That's my IMEI #

50
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,580
- Is she also like Chitti, doctor?
- No

51
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,930
Created adhering to Asimov's laws
this is a domestic purpose robot

52
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,550
You can treat her as your friend,
secretary and caretaker

53
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,410
She will be of help to mankind
in all ways and always

54
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,390
Does it have feelings, doctor?

55
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,210
Yes, pre programmed,
customizable, controlled feelings

56
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,720
Is there any chance for Chitti
to resurface again, doctor?

57
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,460
All our present scientific inventions
in the beginning were opposed as dangerous

58
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,980
And labelled as null and void

59
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,400
Bound by time

60
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,530
It became a necessity
in the ensuing years

61
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,050
Chitti will also be a pre requisite one day

62
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,220
Dot!

63
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,660
- Hey Nikita
- Go to hell!

64
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,630
Bulb! You got what you deserved

65
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,520
Nikita, hear me out

66
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,500
I acted as if I was flirting with her
just to make you see red

67
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,960
- As if I didn't know she's a robot?
- 'Get lost, liar!'

68
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,930
My Barbie doll
My Snow White princess!

69
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,180
'Shut up and hang up!'

70
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,490
Believe me, I've booked
an Apple watch for your birthday

71
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,120
Sushma, Moksha has got
a new Collection today

72
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,210
You eat and then I'll come over, okay?

73
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,070
My flight was delayed
Inform the clients, I'll be there by-

74
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,960
When I get back from work
I chat with my family nonstop!

75
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,770
We spend quality time you know

76
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,270
You bloody swine!

77
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,850
Harith, can I have my phone?

78
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,310
Daddy has to make an important call

79
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,000
Give me the phone

80
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,870
Don't cry...here

81
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,200
I didn't do anything

82
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,750
What is the bid today
in our chit fund?

83
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,880
Can get Rs 3000

84
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,810
What is this?

85
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,060
Make 'Dhal Rice' and potato curry
for dinner, enough

86
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,880
Grandpa!

87
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,990
'Residing in all of that as Me'

88
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,020
'So that Me through this Me'

89
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,180
'Talking to Me'

90
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,420
Dude, this must be
our principal's handiwork!

91
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,070
Where are you, dear?

92
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,670
Coming to the terrace?

93
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,640
What happened?

94
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,340
Our project manager and
prickly 'Jackfruit' Asha

95
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,990
...are hand and glove in this

96
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,170
That's why he promoted her
and sent her on site

97
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,840
He went to get the bore-well man
No sign of him still

98
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,390
Tomorrow is Mahavir Jayanthi
All the shops will be closed

99
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,080
Buy our stuff tonight, okay?

100
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,150
This phone has 4G, Wifi, Bluetooth
plus dual Sim capacity

101
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,840
I came to see girls but here,
men all around

102
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,100
Danger
Girlfriend calling

103
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,660
- Hi Sana
- 'Hi scientist sir'

104
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,520
'Wonder of wonders
You picked my call?'

105
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,250
- Sorry, Sana
- 'How many calls?'

106
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,620
'Can't you even pick my call?
Are you that busy?'

107
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,250
'Just for your sake I'm 10,000 km away
and studying here like a lunatic'

108
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,790
'Under the pretext of working on
your project, are you flirting with Nila?'

109
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,090
That's a robot, Sana

110
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,500
'But a female doll, right?'

111
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,860
Don't be mad at me, honey

112
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,640
'I called you 112 times!'

113
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,380
I'll accept your punishment
and kiss you 112 times

114
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,750
'No need 112'

115
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,760
'Just 1 phone-kiss, let me see'

116
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,020
Mua-

117
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,240
Flying kiss?!

118
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,250
Sir, where should I complain
to retrieve my mobile?

119
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,030
All of them are waiting too!
Go and stand in the queue

120
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,610
How can a cell phone fly?
And where will it go?

121
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,900
Who is behind all this?
What is the reason?

122
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,840
'Is a whole gang behind this
or just an individual?'

123
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,940
'This is scary'

124
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,600
Is this a sign our world
will perish as people claim?

125
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,610
Like the ozone hole there is
a black hole in the sky it seems

126
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,270
It has sucked all the phones I believe

127
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,470
Hey! What you talking

128
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,410
You're talking as if it's a drainage hole

129
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,190
I'm in the share market
My job is dependent on cell phones

130
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,580
Life is absolutely boring
without WhatsApp and selfies

131
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,150
As soon as I wake up
I take my mobile to the loo

132
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,840
I feel I've lost my hand now!

133
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,460
My husband is working in Qatar

134
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,870
Our long distance romance
is only through cell phone

135
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,630
I've saved my mom's # as 'Amma'
I don't even know her landline # now

136
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,850
I've stored my bank account #,
ATM pin #, password, the whole works

137
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,030
It has personal videos and photos
of my girlfriend and me

138
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,010
What if they are uploaded
on an adult site?

139
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,660
Excuse me, is there a separate section
for iPhone?

140
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,580
For sure! It has been opened
near pagal khana, go there

141
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,880
Sir, I'm very sentimental
about this cell phone

142
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,250
Do something, sir

143
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,940
How can I take this as a complaint?

144
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,000
- Get lost!
- Sir, please

145
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,260
I had hooked my wedding chain
on my mobile, sir

146
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,590
I lost that too

147
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,160
10 sovereign
Pure gold, sir

148
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,900
No wife to nag, no phone bills
to pay, why don't you relax?

149
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,640
God will be appeased if you do
a redemption ritual in Thirunallar, sir

150
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,180
You and your silly superstitions!

151
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,190
Commissioner sir asked me to meet you

152
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,480
I'll take care, sir

153
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,930
Thank you

154
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,500
Telecom minister is on the line

155
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,130
Sir, even our chief minister
has lost his mobile

156
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,740
He is on another line

157
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,720
Your secretary is right here
I'll handle it, sir

158
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,620
Sir, minister's phone-

159
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,320
I've embedded precious stones all over

160
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,530

162
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,120
it costs 2crore, sir

163
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,770
Somehow retrieve it for us, sir

164
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,890

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,650
I heard you're tracking with Sim card

168
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,720
- What happened, sir?
- It isn't our BSNL network alone

169
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,430
All the other networks too
are unable to track even 1 phone, sir

170
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,690
All the cell phones
have been switched off

171
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,040
Every single phone in the city is missing

172
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,130
How can all of them
be switched off?

173
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,540
How is it even possible

174

179
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,840
What is this?

180
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,210
What is this phenomenon?

181
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,740
This is strange

182
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,090
I've checked all the NASA studies
and Interpol records

183
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,920
No one has recorded such an event
anywhere in the world

184
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,580
There is no scientific explanation
so far for this rare occurrence

185
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,120
It is so obvious

186
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,380
This is a terrorist attack

187
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,430
They are planning something large-scale

188
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,240
If we can't come up with a reason

189
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,110
...it's our habit to blame
either God or terrorists, right?

190
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,980
Can it be the handiwork of aliens
from a different planet maybe?

191
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,990
No, sir

192
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,440
According to ISRO reports

193
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,340
...no new movements or alien activities
have been recorded in space

194
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,940
Can it be a conspiracy by some
international company in the same field?

195
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,880
I mean, wipe out the present
telephone technology

196
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,970
And bring in a new
scientific know-how

197
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,390
This is a public display

198
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,500
As far as i know, all the mobiles in the city
flying in mid air like sparrows

199
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,270
There isn't any technology
like this nowhere in the world

200
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,830
May be someone we know here
who botched up a lousy robot earlier

201
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,180
Some crank scientist

202
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,370
...is messing up with some other invention
in the name of novelty, who knows!

203
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,040
Who is this?

204
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,620
Late Mr Bohra
AIRD director

205
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,670
His son
Dhinendra Bohra

206
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,060
Scientist, he's also a director in AIRD

207
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,340
On the day all the cell phones went missing

208
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,650
...data from INSAT 3D weather satellite

209
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,460
And GSAT 16 communication satellite

210
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,150
This is the visualization of
combined data

211
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,390
All these dots are cell phones

212
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,290
After a certain distance
the dots vanish into thin air

213
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,860
Cell phones haven't crossed
the troposphere

214
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,130
That is, not crossed
10 km above sea level

215
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,670
If you take the distance into account

216
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,290
...not crossed a radius
of 200 km beyond Chennai

217
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,760
They are all missing
within this sphere somewhere

218
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,360
We are aware of only 4 forces

219
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,790
Gravity, electromagnetic,
strong nuclear, weak nuclear

220
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,740
These 4 won't attract mobile force

221
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,550
I believe this can be
explained scientifically

222
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,040
Dot!

223
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,980
I believe all the phones in this shop
broke the glass panes and flew out

224
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,990
When will the container lorry
reach here?

225
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,000
- 'Crossed Nagari'
- Doomed!

226
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,180
Not yet crossed Agra border?

227
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,960
We've announced
tomorrow's sale

228
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,300
No one has a cell phone in the city

229
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,450
They will make a beeline to our shop
like devotees in the Tirupati temple at 6am

230
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,110
'Don't worry, it will be
delivered at 4:00 a.m'

231
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,440
You've been saying this
like a broken record!

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,150
Bro...?!

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,580
Someone is digging
with a crowbar in our van

237
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,910
We have only cartons
with cell phones in there

238
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,820
Call me, as soon as
the truck reaches here

239
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,440
Have you asked
for police protection?

240
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,730
Paid them, the cops will
be here by tomorrow morning

241
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,800
Okay. What if all the cell phones we get
for our sale tomorrow fly away?

242
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,460
It means we are jinxed
beyond redemption

243
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,490
Not only for us
For the entire city

Wha...what is that noise?

'The container has arrived, sir'

249
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,750
Who is that?

250
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,960
'Mohanan, sir'

251
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,970
'You asked me to call you
as soon as the container arrives, right?'

252
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,390
- Where?
- 'To your house' sir.

253
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,740
Please cooperate

254
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,790
Go back

255
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,620
Hello Sir

256
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,240
- Commissioner Rajendran asked me to come
- Please come in

257
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,510
There is no evidence of human presence
in Jayanth Kumar's murder

258
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,640
As the deceased is a cell phone merchant

259
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,140
...he wanted you to check for clues

260
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,670
His family members are out of town

261
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,770
He was all alone

262
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,700
The servants are not aware of anything

263
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,720
No fingerprint or footprint in the room

264
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,930
He exploded into pieces

265
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,590
But there is no evidence
of explosives whatsoever

266
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,850
He had advertised in the papers
about his Mobile Sale in a big way

267
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,470
The container carrying the load
met with an accident yesterday night

268
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,530
The entire load went missing

269
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,820
Nothing makes sense, sir

270
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,970
Someone or something doesn't like
the presence of cell phones here

271
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,080
This is silicon, enamel and
polycarbonate dust from lots of mobiles

272
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,710
Different brands
manufactured on different dates

273
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,840
Will you believe me if I say
Jayanth Kumar was killed by cell phones?

274
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,610
A cell phone is an assassin?

275
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,790
What do you mean, sir?

276
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,520
All the missing cell phones
have landed here

277
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,470
How did these phones come here?

278
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,360
Where did they go?
We should find out

279
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,370
Dot!

280
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:09,860
'What's the matter sir, what a surprise!
You've called of your own accord'

281
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,660
Sana, call getting connected is a big thing now.
this is the city's last phone

282
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,380
To trace the phones, I've fixed a tracker
in my old phone and I've activated it

283
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,061
'Oh! So am I the guinea pig?'

284
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,661
Not like that, Sana, my phone flew away
before I could send my kisses!

285
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:25,741
That's why, I thought
I'll do it today-

286
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,021
'After 3 days, huh?'

287
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,422
'What happened to your landline?
Why didn't you call from that #?'

288
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:32,021
Phone was engaged, Sana

289
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:33,182
'Don't lie'

00:25:33,182 --> 00:25:34,862
'Accept you don't remember my #'

00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,501
'Out of sight, out of mind!'

292
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:38,102
'Now your whole world is Nila'

293
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:39,302
She's just like a laptop

294
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:42,262
'You bet she's on your lap
and you're coddling her 24x7!'

295
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:44,183
- 'A duet on top of all this!'
- Shut up!

296
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:46,462
'If I speak the truth,
should I shut up?'

297
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:47,702
Stop nagging me

298
00:25:47,783 --> 00:25:49,342
This phone may also fly away!

Activating EMR

304
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:40,906
What is happening?
Are they looking for a bomb?

305
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:45,707
- You search that side
- Okay, boss

306
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:47,242
Thanks, Nila

307
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:48,721
Why thank a laptop?!

your issue inside, wait

00:30:07,803 --> 00:30:09,403
Sir, Onicel owner Manoj Lulla is coming

He's such a pain in the wrong place!

- Please sit down
- I don't need any pacifying

Does a Govt exist or not?

Look, Mr Lulla

319
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:27,165
Govt and God are one and the same

320
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:29,725
If you believe, they exist
If not, they don't

321
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:32,324
But you ensure your palms
are greased promptly, eh?

322
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:36,326
Without exception it has snatched
all my cell phone towers

323
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:38,525
Destroyed all the microwave emitters

324
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:40,166
Not just yours, sir

325
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,325
Microwave emitters of all other
networks have been destroyed too

326
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:46,286
Uprooted the vendors' towers
they had rented as well

327
00:30:46,406 --> 00:30:48,886
Everyone is in a state of shock
You saw them, right?

328
00:30:48,886 --> 00:30:49,966
What should I see?

329
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,447
My loss runs in millions

330
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:54,167
If this continues, in 3 months
I'll be in the streets

331
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:56,326
We are watching
from all angles

332
00:30:56,526 --> 00:30:58,206
Not enough if you just watch

333
00:30:58,487 --> 00:31:01,926
We've paid through our nose for you
and your party during the election

334
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:05,928
You should be standing out in the open
with your arms stretched like a tower

335
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:07,487
Don't get tense

336
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:09,328
This isn't your problem alone

337
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,768
Before hasn't something like this happened?

338
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,888
We don't know how to manage this situation

339
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,928
in our cabinet meeting
we've requested military aid

340
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:21,849
To protect the towers we will use army

341
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:26,168
Don't think you can appease me
like how you tackle the general public

342
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:27,809
I give you 1 week grace time

343
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,090
By then things should
go back to normalcy

344
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:31,849
I must start my business again

345
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,409
Otherwise the next upload in Wiki Leaks...

346
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:36,650
...will be yours!

347
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:45,250
5th force

348
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,451
The scientific world is still into
extensive research about this force

349
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,651
The way it works
How to measure it

350
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:52,131
Our knowledge is zilch

351
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:55,891
This could be the evidence
for the existence of the 5th force

352
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:59,331
We can't explain this force based
on our knowledge of science

353
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,692
Using the amenities at our disposal

354
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:03,412
...we can't combat it either

355
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:05,932
That's why we've requested
our military to step in

356
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,931
Sir, it's a huge force

357
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:09,252
I saw it with my own eyes

358
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,253
If you ask the military
to combat it

359
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,173
...you will only face
enormous loss of life

360
00:32:13,212 --> 00:32:14,853
What should we do then?

361
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,973
To combat it effectively
we need a super power

362
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:21,054
We need exceptional intelligence

363
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:23,254
Extraordinary powerful force

364
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:25,333
We need a man with
the boon of immortality

365
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:27,413
A man who will never die?

366
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,854
Does a person like that exist?

367
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,814
Chitti

368
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,013
The Robot!

369
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:40,536
We must get him from the museum

370
00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:41,615
Dot...!

371
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:44,215
I'm waiting

372
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:46,176
No...impossible

373
00:32:47,335 --> 00:32:48,936
It's illegal

374
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:50,816
that robot is banned

375
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:52,375
Has been dismantled too

376
00:32:53,216 --> 00:32:55,696
Have we forgotten how it went
out of control

377
00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:58,935
How many people lost their lives
Immense loss of property as well

378
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,616
...if we bring it back

379
00:33:00,696 --> 00:33:02,017
...it won't die

380
00:33:03,256 --> 00:33:04,817
It will massacre all of us

381
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:09,976
Everyone is aware who was responsible
for that robot's drastic change

382
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:13,418
This time I'll ensure
such a blunder does not occur

383
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:16,298
Sir, this is Mr Vaseegaran's conspiracy

384
00:33:17,057 --> 00:33:20,738
He wants to use this critical situation
and reactivate his invention

385
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:23,658
He wants to make money by
selling it to multinational companies

386
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:24,977
Now you decide

387
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:27,418
Have we assembled here
to save the people?

388
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,338
Or for Vaseegaran's advertising?

389
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:32,139
Okay, so you come up with a solution

390
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:35,178
Let's...think about it

391
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:37,339
That's why we are here

392
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:43,060
Sir, my suggestion is based
purely on good intentions

393
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:44,780
This is the start
of an apocalypse

394
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,181
If we don't prevent it now, we'll be
wiped out en masse, only Chitti can save us

395
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,740
Mr Vaseegaran

396
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,540
We can't flout a court order blatantly

397
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,061
The process required
to do so is very tedious

398
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,300
I must pass an ordinance
in the Parliament

399
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,741
Opposition parties should cooperate

400
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,181
- Not possible
- It is possible, sir

401
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:07,782
Have a minister seen a situation like this before?

402
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:10,381
We can convince the court
by explaining in detail later

403
00:34:10,422 --> 00:34:11,422
Such a rule exists

404
00:34:11,462 --> 00:34:13,462
But if that robot kills some people?

405
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:15,382
Who will take the responsibility?

406
00:34:15,463 --> 00:34:16,462
Mine?

407
00:34:16,502 --> 00:34:17,862
Or our minister?

408
00:34:19,262 --> 00:34:21,903
- Such a situation won't arise, sir
- Why not?

409
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,142
That's a machine

410
00:34:24,302 --> 00:34:26,343
We can't predict
when it may screw up

411
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:29,543
If it does something drastic
I'll be held responsible

412
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:33,023
Let's forget Chitti

413
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:34,824
Suggest some other option

414
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:38,264
Military is the only other feasible option

415
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:39,744
Let's go ahead with that

416
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:42,944
Request and the order
will be released by today

417
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:44,505
Do the needful

418
00:34:54,106 --> 00:34:55,225
Hello...?

419
00:34:56,185 --> 00:34:57,186
So

420
00:34:57,665 --> 00:34:58,826
Plan collapsed?

421
00:34:59,065 --> 00:35:00,626
Dhina, what is all this?

422
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,866
You are a scientist
You are well aware

423
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:04,105
Of course

424
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:05,666
But I won't let it happen

425
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:09,666
I'll never allow you to bring
that nitwit Chitti back to life

426
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:12,227
What do you have against me?

427
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:14,547
You murdered my dad

428
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:15,707
Me...?

429
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:17,307
That Chitti

430
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:19,308
Your alter ego

431
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:21,027
That is also you!

432
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,519
'Hey! Lulla'

00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:55,759

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,800

[Security speaking]

440

Nila, go up

441
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,410
Hack it open, Nila

442
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,450
Boss, according to my rules
hacking is illegal

443
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,930
Isn't this wrong?

444
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:16,370
This will come under ethical hacking
Exception...do what I say

445
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,650
I understand, boss

448
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:26,691
Hey ! Where did you learn all these?

449
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,371
I should know all that humans like

450
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:31,212
As per your adaptive learning
you've programmed in me

451
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:33,092
Human beings have
only 4 preferences

452
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:35,452
TV, Cinema, food and gossip

453
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,532
Easy!

454
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:57,854
"Iron heart sprouting for the 1st time?"

455

"Is it an invitation of first love divine?"

456
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:04,973
"Iron heart blossoming for the 1st time?"

457
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:08,694
Shut up!

'Leaving from airport
Battalion #121 proceeding to spot'

Entire state is under military control

460
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,290
People need not panic

461
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,490
Technology related to cell phone
networks in all the places

462
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,490
...is being attended to
on a war-front emergency basis

463
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,290
With military protection...

464
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,730
...arrangements have been made
to restart sales of cell phones

465
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,970
Very soon, people can start
using their cell phones as usual

466
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,250
- Hey, Balu
- Sir...?

467
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,130
Call the minister and ask him
to provide us military protection

468
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,010
We have 4 police vans
round the clock stationed here, sir

469
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,530
If you look at the 303 rifles they have
even street dogs won't be scared

470
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,210
We need AK 47, man

471
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,090
You saw how Manoj Lulla whom we met
2 days ago was squeezed like juice, right?

472
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,970
I was the one who signed the order
to revive cell phone service in the city

473
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,700
Looking at the current situation
looks like I'll be the next juice!

474
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,570
Call for the military immediately

475
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,010
Juice for you, my dear

476
00:44:32,942 --> 00:44:35,669
- Is security in position?
- We've assigned 2 men, sir

477
00:44:35,749 --> 00:44:37,474
- Enough strength in front?
- Yes, sir

478
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,120
'Attack in Porur
Company on high alert'

479
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,530
'Attack in Porur
Company on high alert'

480
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,620
Sir...!

481
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,140
Sir..!

482
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,140
What happened?

483
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,910
That cell phone gang uprooted
all the towers in Porur

484
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,910
Wiped out our military force it seems, sir

485
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,320
No one knows where
that horde has vanished now

486
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,130
Yov! Porur is quite close to this place

487
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,130
Double the protection
round our house

488
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,900
A whole battalion is alert, sir

489
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,860
Ask them to shut all gates,
doors and windows

490
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,550
Not even the smallest hole
should be exposed

491
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,880
Sir, everything has been closed
Including the computer’s Windows!

492
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,760
They are throwing stones at us

493
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:22,020
Sir, this isn't a stone
It's your cell phone

494
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,990
Your missing cell phone
Come and see for yourself

495
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,480
'True that!'

496
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,240
All the precious stones are intact

497
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,890
How can you underestimate a minister?

498
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,060
Technology is in the palm of my hands!

499
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,670
That's why it has got scared
and returned only my mobile!

500
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:51,130
Who is this 'Unni Krishnan' calling ?

501
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,900
It's an unknown #, sir

502
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,260
Yov! Call the military

503
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,070
- Ask them to shoot this sparrow
- Okay, sir

504
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,110
Go...go...go

505
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,440
Get out!

506
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,660
[walkie talkie radio chatter]

507
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,910
Sir, this way please

508
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,160
- How is Mr Vairamurthy?
- Critical, sir

509
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,600
He's unable to breathe

510
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,290
- Something is blocking his windpipe
- What is it?

511
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,530
Don't know exactly, sir

512
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,700
His secretary is equally dumbfounded

513
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,880
[gasping for breath]

514
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,050
- Did you scan his body?
- We did, sir

515
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,130
All the reports are normal

516
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,260
But he is unable to breathe, sir

517
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,180
- What happened, doctor?
- He is no more

518
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,590
Whaat?!

519
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,370
Phone...phone

520
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,260
All the phones flew away, sir

521
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,580
Landline, man

522
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,910
Hello, I am Home minister
Vijay Kumar speaking

523
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,360
Activate that robot Chitti immediately

524
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,400
Today

525
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,600
Right now

526
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,900
How can you ask as if you're ordering
'idli' and 'vada' as Take away?

527
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,980
It is a ban by the court, sir

528
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,870
I can't flout the rules of the court

529
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,470
I'll handle all those formalities

530
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,870
1st activate Chitti at once

531
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,560
How is it possible immediately?

532
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,880
An ordinance has to be
passed in the Parliament

533
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,490
'The Opposition has to cooperate'

534
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,970
The process is extremely complicated, sir

535
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,180
40 members of the Parliament
will favor us, sir

536
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,580
I'll handle all that

537
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,990
It's a machine, sir

538
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,070
We don't know when it will malfunction

539
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,600
Who will shoulder the responsibility
if it kills someone? You or me?

540
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,370
Yov! Don't seek revenge
oblivious of time or situation

541
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,860
It went into our Telecom minister's mouth

542
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,980
God knows which part of me it will target

543
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,190
I'll take all the responsibility

544
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,310
Satisfied?

545
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,760
Dot!

546
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,610
I came here at midnight
There was a queue right then

547
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,700
I haven't got the phone as yet
and she wants me to top up!

548
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,510
Without cell phones, our life is like
'A Few Pages Missing In The Middle'

549
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,520
Okay, what if the cell phones
fly away again?

550
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,120
I'm as sharp as a needle, you see

551
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,490
Take a look

552
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,890
You've fixed it like the chained tumbler
in the railway station!

553
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,980
Sir, for a while I was
so relaxed without cell phones

554
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,350
No ringtones to bug me daily
I'm lifting my head to see the world

555
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,840
I talk to my children
I visit my friends face to face

556
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,480
- Great feeling, eh?
- Then why the hell is he here?

557
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,930
What to do?
A cell phone is like one's wife

558
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,170
Damn if she exists
Darn if she doesn't!

559
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,380
Become a habit!

560
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,670
Yes!

561
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,170
Chitti, you're back?

562
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,700
The way I fell I thought
my skull will blow to bits

563
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,100
Thank you, Chitti

564
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:03,710
Holy crow!

565
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,680
Chitti to Control

566
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,650
- 'Control to Chitti'
- Assemble at TTK road junction

567
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,360
What is this?

568
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,830
Integral space research center

569
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,200
That space research center isn't active now

570
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,520
Research is no longer
conducted there

571
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,450
Only 2 technicians are left

572
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:02,180
In 1964, head of Atomic Commission
Dr Homi Baba inaugurated this center

573
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,260
Call Dr Sam

574
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,240
Hello, Sam here

575
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,640
Dr Sam, I'm Vasi

576
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,050
I need this information now, urgent

577
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,890
What is that space research center
in sector II Phase XIV?

578
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,860
Vasi, keep this confidential

579
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:26,800
To find out if life exists
in other planets just like us on earth

580
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,090
...signals are sent from many parts
of the world to outer space

581
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:35,180
That is one such place
from where signals are sent

582
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,980
What kind of signals are being sent?

583
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:41,790
There are good forces and bad forces
co existing in this world

584
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:46,640
We send only positive signals
to outer space

585
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:51,860
Because only positive energy
present in space

586
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,740
...should be aware
of our presence here

587
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,030
Thank you very much, Sam

588
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,670
Chitti, play that visual
in Kirlian mode

589
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,690
Look at that

590
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:07,050
If that cell phone bird is scared
of the positive signals from the emitters

591
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,180
...there is some negative force
embedded in it

592
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,310
By negative force
you mean from another planet?

593
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,720
Freeze it

594
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:25,020
No, this is some negative force
present only on our earth

595
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:32,880
This is a human face

596
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,960
It looks very familiar to me

597
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,490
Nila, I want all the recent
abnormal events in Thirukazhukundram

598
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,980
Most importantly
details of the deceased asap

599
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:48,430
Doctor, this resembles the emitter
we saw in that space research center

600
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:50,600
- Exactly
- What is your plan?

601
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,090
You know by now
You tell me

602
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,650
If it is a human negative energy
that is creating the 'mobile' force

603
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,420
...it has no physical form

604
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,050
But only the aura
that surrounds the human body

605
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,050
Aura...?

606
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:06,020
Atoms in a human body
consist of neutrons and electrons

607
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:11,470
The micro photon particles
that emanate from it is called aura

608
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,880
It is a thin layer around the body
not visible to the human eye

609
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,890
Aura of a person who is alive
is charged positive

610
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,290
A dead person's aura
will be charged negative

611
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,220
We must destroy that negative charge

612
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:26,790
The only way to succeed is to send
a more powerful positive charge towards it

613
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,230
And neutralize its energy

614
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,920
Aura of a deceased person
is micro photon minus

615
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,610
We must send micro photon plus

616
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,010
Add plus to minus
it becomes zero

617
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,700
- Am I right, doctor?
- Exactly, Chitti

618
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,590
This photon synthesizer
generates micro photon plus

619
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:44,670
See

620
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,280
I've created the same positive rays here
similar to the Research center

621
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:54,690
This is 10 times stronger than
any negative energy known to mankind

622
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,380
We can neutralize
the negative energy for sure

623
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,460
Wow! Great

624
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,910
Boss, here are the details you asked for

625
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:06,360
73 people died last year
in Thirukazhukundram

626
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,050
Only 18 unnatural death

627
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,010
2 murders
4 suicides

628
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,500
Is any death connected to a cell phone?

629
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,550
A lorry driver died in an accident
using his mobile while driving

630
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,240
Because her 'hot' photos
went viral through her mobile

631
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,840
...a girl consumed poison

632
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,490
One man died hanging himself
in a cell phone tower

633
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:27,410
- Date?
- April 7th

634
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:31,380
The next day cell phones started vanishing

635
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,670
Oh my God!

636
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,950
Now I'm getting a clearer picture

637
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,480
Chitti, immediately
install this in AIRD bus

638
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,490
We are leaving for Thirukazhukundram

639
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,520
Doctor, we got it

640
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,050
I found all the phones

641
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,810
Nila, bring the bus
to the rear end of the house

642
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:14,530
CHITTI!

643
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,800
Nila, fix the cryostat, quick!

644
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:43,479
My God!

645
01:05:43,998 --> 01:05:45,159
Pakshi Rajan...!

646
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:47,399
Nice DP

647
01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:02,242
This is a war between
the entire mankind and me

648
01:06:03,003 --> 01:06:04,884
You are not a human being

649
01:06:05,203 --> 01:06:06,763
Don't interfere

650
01:06:07,324 --> 01:06:09,965
- Run away
- Running away isn't in my software at all

651
01:06:10,044 --> 01:06:12,644
I have been reactivated
only to protect human beings

652
01:06:12,725 --> 01:06:14,726
My primary task is to destroy you!

653
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:26,648
Pakshi Raja, why are you
so furious with the human race?

654
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:41,651
Why are you behaving like this?

655
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:43,611
What do you need?

656
01:07:44,424 --> 01:07:46,465
This is a pied cuckoo

657
01:07:47,385 --> 01:07:50,346
Biological name is Jacobin cuckoo

658
01:07:51,706 --> 01:07:53,106
In Northern India...

659
01:07:53,226 --> 01:07:57,707
...the monsoon season starts
only when this species migrates

660
01:07:58,427 --> 01:08:00,428
If this species doesn't show up...

661
01:08:00,468 --> 01:08:03,668
...there will be no rainfall
in that year for the entire region

662
01:08:04,429 --> 01:08:07,589
Till date no one knows
the mystery behind this

663
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:11,950
Even in our mythology
it is referred as 'rain bird'

664
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,031
Carry out research on this

665
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:16,232
Sure, sir

666
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:17,192
Wow...!

667
01:08:17,231 --> 01:08:19,672
Sir, your photo is
on the cover page

668
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:22,593
It was published a year ago

669
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:26,713
Sir, how did you get
interested in birds?

670
01:08:27,634 --> 01:08:31,235
Actually the other way about
The birds evinced interest in me!

671
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,196
'When I was born
I wasn't breathing'

672
01:08:35,315 --> 01:08:37,460
'My body had turned blue'

673
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,180
'Even the doctor gave up hope
and said the baby is dead'

674
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,180
I'll sign and you finish
all the formalities

675
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,460
Get the death certificate
and take the baby

676
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:37,790
'Don't know if it was an accident
or something else'

677
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:40,470
'But everyone exclaimed
it was a huge miracle'

678
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:41,920
'My grandma used to say'

679
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,520
'God came in the guise of
a sparrow and resurrected you'

680
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,080
'I still remember'

681
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,680
'When I was young, early in the morning
the tiny sparrow will fly into my room'

682
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:56,720
'...keep chirping cheerfully
and going around the fan in a circle'

683
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:04,760
"To the sun's ray at dawn that glitter
a warm welcome your wings you flutter"

684
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:10,880
"As the sun slides down yonder deep
you caress the branches to sleep"

685
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:16,920
"With your pitter patter dainty feet
you draw a picture as an aesthetic treat"

686
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:23,000
"Today you make me yearn
To fly like you I want to learn"

687
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,560
"Flock of birds in flight"

688
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,480
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping"

689
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,400
'I decided right then'

690
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:34,770
'My life will be dedicated
to birds and only birds'

691
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:03,650
"Flock of birds in flight"

692
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:06,130
"Oho! A flight of birds in sight"

693
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:12,490
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping"

694
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:19,020
"A host of sparrows
A flight of swallows"

695
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:25,580
"I wish to hear
your tweet and twitter"

696
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:46,380
"No language or religion, you fly at ease
Any place is your home, as you please"

697
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:52,420
"No language, no religion, you roam
You affirm any place is your home"

698
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:59,140
"You claim even weeds to be
your kith and kin in reality"

699
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:05,430
"You form a swing in mid-air
to play with the wind out there"

700
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:10,630
"You make a deep impact in people
to whom laughter isn't easy or simple"

701
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:16,390
"My precious life, my cherished creed
A heart like yours is needed indeed"

702
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:23,790
"Even if the world is wiped out extensively
an urge to protect you surges effusively"

703
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:26,310
"Swiftly on a flying spree
in the skies carefree"

704
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:29,350
"Fly without any boundary"

705
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:33,790
That's why I studied
ornithology with passion

706
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,710
I became an ornithology professor too

707
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,350
'Pon ulagaaleero'

708
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,790
'Bhuvanam muzhudhaleero'

709
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:46,070
'Nannaya pullinangaal'

710
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:49,670
These are lines of one of the
oldest tamil poems

711
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:51,360
This is the meaning

712
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:54,360
O' birds, you are all over this world

713
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:57,200
You have spread your wings
right up to Heaven

714
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,320
Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds

715
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,640
When compared to the weight
of the human race on earth...

716
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,680
...weight of the birds en masse
is almost 100 times more

717
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:11,200
Birds eat 1000 times more food
than what humans consume

718
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,840
If they did not feed on worms

719
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,520
...not even 1 green leaf
will be left on earth

720
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,600
Human beings won't
get any food at all

721
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,120
Because insects are
1000 times more than birds!

722
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,000
So if human beings have to
survive on this earth...

723
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,640
...birds also should be alive

724
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,690
Sir, of late birds flocking to
the bird sanctuary in Vedanthangal

725
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:37,920
...has dwindled
What is the reason, sir?

726
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,130
When I was young, we used to wake up
only to the chirp of sparrows

727
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:45,210
'You don't get to see any sparrow
in the city nowadays, sir'

728
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:53,050
'Only in 1996...'

729
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:56,010
'...cell phones were
introduced in India'

730
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:59,970
'In a gradual and continuous process
birds have decreased only after this'

731
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,390
'Particularly sparrows'

732
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:05,010
It is called Arctic Tern

733
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,110
This small bird weighing just 50 gm

734
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:13,590
...migrates every year
from the Arctic region

735
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:16,040
...flying 12000 km
to our Vedanthangal

736
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,090
...and returns

737
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:19,490
A bird doesn't have a map or radar

738
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:23,980
From within its head, it absorbs
all micro rays from the sky

739
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:27,340
And using cryptochrome formation

740
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,820
...it steers in the right direction

741
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,980
'That is the bird's sole strength'

742
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:38,020
Now we've filled the sky with radiation
from numerous cell phone towers

743
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:42,500
So the cryptochrome formation
in the bird's head is shattered

744
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,620
And eliminated completely

745
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,660
'Not knowing where they are heading'

746
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:49,980
'...birds lose their way and
their entire species is becoming extinct'

747
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:52,500
'To the birds, it is equal
to losing their sanity'

748
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,500
In addition, because of the radiation...

749
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:58,380
...shells aren't being formed
on the eggs of these birds

750
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,540
Their eggs resemble a layer of skin

751
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:05,300
The eggs break when
the mother bird is incubating

752
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,550
In reality, men also suffer
from these repercussions

753
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,510
Many get afflicted by cancer

754
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:14,590
Impotency may be on the rise

755
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,310
Abortion rates increase

756
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:17,630
Above all

757
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:18,670
Depression

758
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:19,830
Schizophrenia

759
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:21,550
Alzheimer's etc-

760
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,710
Higher % of mental disorder

761
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:29,470
All these symptoms
are obvious right now

762
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,350
Mr Pakshi Rajan

763
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,310
What is your solution?

764
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:35,950
Why do we use cell phone now?

765
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,350
Just gossip and trivialities

766
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:39,950
Let's control that

767
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:42,830
Why do we need so many
cell phones and towers?

768
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,190
Let us reduce that

769
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:49,230
Let us pass a law as to who, why and
for how long a cell phone can be used

770
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,590
Has this chap lost it?
Is he mad?

771
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:54,590
Instead of the current high frequency
cell phone technology

772
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:56,790
...let us invent
a safer technology

773
01:15:56,830 --> 01:16:01,040
Until then let us shut down
90% of the cell phone towers in India

774
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,800
Good idea!

775
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,760
'Save bird, save earth'

776
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,560
'Save bird
Save earth'

777
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,440
'Don't kill, don't kill'

778
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,040
'Don't kill birds'

779
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,640
'Save birds save birds'

780
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,360
'Save birds
Save earth'

781
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,920
'Don't kill, don't kill'

782
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,560
'Don't kill birds'

783
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,840
'Stop...stop'

784
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,320
'Radiation
Pollution'

785
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,800
'Save birds save birds'

786
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,560
'Radiation Pollution'

787
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,640
Are they all jobless?

788
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,160
When the sun rises...

789
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,840
...they swing placards defending
dogs, cats, crows and sparrows

790
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,320
Why don't you chase them away?

791
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:47,570
'Refusing to leave, sir
They insist on meeting you'

792
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:54,010
Tell me

793
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:56,450
What's your problem?

794
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:00,410
What is the frequency rate
permitted by TRAI?

795
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:04,170
What is the frequency rate
in your towers at present?

796
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,930
Birds flying in the sky are being
destroyed in their fetus stage by you

797
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,330
Hello mister, listen

798
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:12,770
We strictly follow the rules of
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India

799
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:14,210
Already subscribers complain

800
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:18,050
'No signal in the bathroom or basement
Skype doesn't work in the lift'

801
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:20,770
Do you know in these 3 months
2000 customers have...

802
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,130
...switched to other networks?

803
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:23,330
Don't lie

804
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:27,890
In your disgusting competition
just to retain your subscribers

805
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:31,490
...you are increasing the frequency rate
to suit your needs as you wish

806
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:34,300
Now it is well over the danger limit

807
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:37,780
Because of the heavy radiation
the entire species of birds

808
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,220
...the bird kingdom is dying
without a trace

809
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:41,980
You aren't one bit bothered

810
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:43,620
You are exaggerating

811
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,940
Birds becoming extinct
due to cell phone radiation

812
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,780
...has no scientific proof or backing

813
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:49,900
You know that?

814
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,620
If that is so
come with me

815
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:57,060
Stand under your cell phone tower
for just 24 hours

816
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,660
I will prove it!

817
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,420
You get out

818
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,700
You asked for scientific proof, right?

819
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,260
I'll provide it

820
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,380
Get out, man

821
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,060
Write to the Press & Media

822
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,020
Hold placards and
protest in the hot sun

823
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,380
I don't care

824
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,540
Out

825
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,860
Get out!

826
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,860
Nonsense!

827
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,270
Hey!

828
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:35,830
Hey.. Stop

829
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:37,630
What you people are doing?

830
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,110
Stop everything

831
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:41,910
There are houses nearby
Many birds flock around

832
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:43,710
- Stop everything
- Hey, old man

833
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:47,110
Are we building a Atomic Centre here?
It's only a cell phone tower

834
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:50,310
Hereafter you'll get good signal
on your phone, move aside

835
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:52,750
- What is it, sir?
- Ramasamy

836
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:55,470
I repeatedly told you
about birds dying

837
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:57,030
You were also worried

838
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,230
- But now...?
- What can I do, sir?

839
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,870
Agriculture is no longer profitable

840
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:02,390
Insects kill all my yield

841
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:04,350
I became a pauper
buying insecticides

842
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:07,560
Primary reason for that is
the increased death rate of birds

843
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,720
Only birds eat insects

844
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,440
If birds die...

845
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,600
...insects will increase
beyond control

846
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,680
Whatever the reason, I don't
have the strength to be a farmer

847
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,200
This is the only income
I can get from this land

848
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,600
Why should you sell your land
to a man who kills birds?

849
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,000
People are dying
of starvation here

850
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,000
And you're bothered
about birds dying!

851
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,920
Don't pester me
Attend to your work

852
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,480
Move aside

853
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,800
'Ladies and gentlemen'

854
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,640
'Stop using cell phone'

855
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,920
Every cell phone used is encased
with the blood of thousands of birds

856
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,200
Each cell phone is a sparrow's coffin!

857
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,600
Save birds

858
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,720
- Come here
- Yes, sir

859
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,360
Who is this man?
Disturbing all our customers

860
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,090
- Chase him away
- Okay, sir

861
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:00,890
Don't use cell phones

862
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:05,370
Here...read this

863
01:21:27,899 --> 01:21:30,581
I have given many petitions
in many levels many times

864
01:21:31,061 --> 01:21:33,422
'No one has taken any action'

865
01:21:34,783 --> 01:21:35,944
Oh!

866
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:39,065
Is this why we don't see
any sparrows at all?

867
01:21:42,026 --> 01:21:46,548
They used to flock around my house
when I was a small kid

868
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:48,629
It was a feast for sore eyes

869
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,271
I've played with those birds

870
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:53,312
When I grew up, I have
even fried and feasted on them

871
01:21:53,472 --> 01:21:55,553
A real treat for the taste buds

872
01:21:56,034 --> 01:21:58,234
- Crispy, like quail fry
- Super, sir

873
01:21:58,554 --> 01:22:01,076
And that concoction made with it

874
01:22:01,235 --> 01:22:02,957
What an aphrodisiac!

875
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,600
It isn't available nowadays

876
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,721
What is this?

877
01:22:11,001 --> 01:22:14,403
I'm talking of ensuring birds live
and you're relishing killing them

878
01:22:14,442 --> 01:22:16,002
What else do you want me to do?

879
01:22:16,084 --> 01:22:18,204
Shall we start a Sparrow Welfare Board?

880
01:22:18,284 --> 01:22:20,085
You can be elected as the chairman

881
01:22:21,926 --> 01:22:26,688
First take strict action against networks
which exceed their allotted frequency

882
01:22:28,369 --> 01:22:30,530
Cancel their license

883
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:32,172
Then?

884
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:36,934
Permit only 2 networks
following regulations of TRAI

885
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:38,975
What are you saying?

886
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,095
We boast of a population of 1.25 billion

887
01:22:41,176 --> 01:22:42,736
Shouldn't we reach all of them?

888
01:22:42,817 --> 01:22:44,617
Shouldn't every area receive signal?

889
01:22:44,697 --> 01:22:47,019
Cell phone is the foundation for everything

890
01:22:47,138 --> 01:22:50,340
The world will come to a standstill
if mobiles don't work for an hour

891
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,661
How much time is saved
because of this gadget?

892
01:22:52,661 --> 01:22:55,182
Business has developed
Industries have prospered

893
01:22:55,223 --> 01:22:58,345
Because he's hungry will anyone
cut his own hand and eat it?

894
01:22:59,464 --> 01:23:02,867
Same holds good for the progress
we attain by killing birds

895
01:23:03,987 --> 01:23:07,308
If a 30 gm sparrow can't live
depending on us

896
01:23:07,629 --> 01:23:10,630
…then how can we boast of
this technology and progress?

897
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,392
America is a bigger nation than India

898
01:23:14,472 --> 01:23:16,914
It has only 4-5 networks

899
01:23:17,194 --> 01:23:20,195
China is the most populated
country in the world

900
01:23:20,555 --> 01:23:22,596
Only 3 networks are used

901
01:23:22,636 --> 01:23:23,836
But here?

902
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:25,317
More than 10

903
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:27,558
You accept bribes from everyone

904
01:23:27,599 --> 01:23:30,320
And allow networks to flourish
flouting all the rules

905
01:23:30,961 --> 01:23:32,840
You're letting your tongue run, eh?

906
01:23:33,002 --> 01:23:34,282
You seem educated

907
01:23:34,363 --> 01:23:37,603
I was lenient because you’re a big shot
You're analysing politics, huh?

908
01:23:37,724 --> 01:23:39,165
Okay, let me counteract

909
01:23:39,204 --> 01:23:42,085
We work based only
on rules and regulations

910
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:47,168
Only by adhering to international rules
cell phone service is allotted

911
01:23:47,568 --> 01:23:49,690
File a case in court
if you have any doubts

912
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:50,690
Clear out now

913
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:52,491
Don't get angry
Please listen to me

914
01:23:52,531 --> 01:23:54,931
I was patient for so long, eh?
Go...go to court

915
01:23:54,972 --> 01:23:57,134
You'll get a verdict after 45 years

916
01:23:57,174 --> 01:23:59,254
Prime minister says
I must meet the common man

917
01:23:59,335 --> 01:24:01,495
'And I get caught
with such crackpots'

918
01:24:15,063 --> 01:24:17,863
Court officials are coming
to check radiation frequency

919
01:24:17,944 --> 01:24:20,105
Make sure it is well within the limit

920
01:24:20,144 --> 01:24:22,706
'From multiples tests conducted
it has been found...'

921
01:24:22,786 --> 01:24:25,868
'...only adequate radiation
has been channelized into cell phones'

922
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:32,711
'It has not been proved scientifically
that birds are affected by cell phones'

923
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:37,713
'Therefore Pakshi Rajan's case
has been adjourned'

924
01:26:43,736 --> 01:26:46,697
Pakshi Rajan, whatever you say
is just and right

925
01:26:46,777 --> 01:26:48,698
But killing humans is wrong

926
01:26:48,738 --> 01:26:51,900
They killed countless flocks of birds
Isn't that a crime?

927
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:55,582
You'll label human life differently

928
01:26:56,142 --> 01:26:57,943
In what way are birds' lives inferior?

929
01:26:57,983 --> 01:27:01,225
Why do you kill innocent people
for the fault of a handful of men?

930
01:27:01,304 --> 01:27:03,065
Who is 'innocent'?

931
01:27:04,145 --> 01:27:07,387
Every individual who owns
a cell phone is a murderer

932
01:27:07,668 --> 01:27:09,348
How I yelled my throat hoarse

933
01:27:09,869 --> 01:27:12,230
How many streets
I would've walked begging

934
01:27:12,271 --> 01:27:15,152
How many feet I fell
pleading not to use cell phones

935
01:27:15,311 --> 01:27:17,633
Did even a single soul
pay heed to my pleas?

936
01:27:19,273 --> 01:27:21,074
They read about this in newspapers

937
01:27:21,155 --> 01:27:22,476
Watch the News on TV

938
01:27:22,555 --> 01:27:23,676
And then...

939
01:27:23,756 --> 01:27:24,756
...exclaim 'oh'!

940
01:27:26,597 --> 01:27:29,839
Do sparrows die only due to
radiation from cell phones?

941
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:31,559
'How sad!'

942
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:33,881
'Poor things, no?'

943
01:27:34,241 --> 01:27:36,362
Just for 5 minutes
make clucking sounds

944
01:27:36,403 --> 01:27:39,563
Share that article and video clipping
in WhatsApp and Facebook

945
01:27:39,603 --> 01:27:42,485
Thinking their duty is over and
it was their good deed for the day

946
01:27:42,565 --> 01:27:45,407
They go back to
their cell phones, blockheads!

947
01:27:47,848 --> 01:27:49,448
I won't let this go

948
01:27:50,209 --> 01:27:53,290
I won't spare even a single person
who owns a cell phone

949
01:27:54,691 --> 01:27:55,812
Hereafter

950
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,253
Cell phone is everyone's Yama!

951
01:28:01,054 --> 01:28:04,335
Just watch, people should panic and
run for their lives as soon as they see it

952
01:28:04,416 --> 01:28:07,177
Pakshi, you've reached your stop

953
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:09,299
Get into the bus

954
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:18,853
Chitti!

955
01:30:17,562 --> 01:30:18,642
Oh my God!

956
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,941
- Thanks
- Welcome

957
01:32:20,183 --> 01:32:22,104
Hey! What is this?

958
01:32:22,423 --> 01:32:24,945
You've fixed your MPU in me

959
01:32:25,185 --> 01:32:26,906
Oh! By mistake

960
01:32:26,986 --> 01:32:29,948
I was wondering why
my core memory was corrupt

961
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:32,148
Punch dialogues
Comedy Nights with Kapil

962
01:32:32,148 --> 01:32:33,829
'Kumkum Bhagya' episodes
Karela Kofta!

963
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:35,991
I was wondering how all these
things came into my MPU

964
01:32:35,991 --> 01:32:37,831
Come, lie down
I'll fix it

965
01:32:37,872 --> 01:32:38,992
No need

966
01:32:39,032 --> 01:32:40,273
Let it be

967
01:32:47,155 --> 01:32:48,236
Aura

968
01:32:48,277 --> 01:32:51,279
Every human, beast,
inanimate object

969
01:32:51,358 --> 01:32:53,279
Even every place has an aura

970
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:57,020
This aura invisible to the eye pertains
not only to spirituality but science too

971
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:00,100
With the help of a Kirlian camera
we can take photos of an aura

972
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,900
Ordinary people have an aura
3 to 4 feet thick

973
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:06,540
Some sages have an aura
spreading over 50 feet

974
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:09,780
Russian scientist
Dr Frank Baranowski has proved this

975
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,540
Pakshi Rajan's aura is enormous

976
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:15,230
It isn't the aura of
an individual man alone

977
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:17,790
Aura of 1000s of birds
which were destroyed

978
01:33:18,150 --> 01:33:19,870
A giant ball of negative energy

979
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:20,830
With a mind

980
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:23,070
A very angry mind

981
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,550
This maybe a form of 5th force

982
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:27,790
It has controlled all the cell phones

983
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:29,990
It would've destroyed
our city given a chance

984
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:32,670
We succeeded only because
of Chitti's reappearance

985
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:33,910
Thank you, Chitti

986
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,720
I thank all of you
who have been a source of support

987
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,240
In our ancient classics

988
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:47,400
...we have heard many stories of God
descending on earth to destroy demons

989
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:53,450
Lord Shiva Himself came as a robot
to save us from a fate worse than death

990
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:04,290
When a warrior fights
his shadow battles along with him

991
01:34:04,690 --> 01:34:08,530
When the warrior pierces and kills
the enemy, the shadow will follow suit

992
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:12,810
Will we praise and garland the shadow?

993
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:14,010
He is real

994
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:15,460
I am his shadow

995
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:18,500
All glory and praise to
that God who created me

996
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:40,710
Thank you

997
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:43,430
At this juncture I must thank
and mention a specific name

998
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:45,910
At the right moment
parting with the heart

999
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:48,430
I mean, giving the MPU

1000
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:50,150
...if I had not been activated

1001
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:52,550
I couldn't have destroyed the evil force

1002
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:53,990
The name is...

1003
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:55,840
Nila

1004
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,480
At this wonderful moment
a piece of good news for you

1005
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,840
Chitti who has been created
by Dr Vaseegaran

1006
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:16,210
...has been approved by our Govt

1007
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:19,490
An order has been passed this morning

1008
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:23,690
...to create 500 Chitti robots
for our Indian army

1009
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:26,610
Thank you

1010
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:26,739
Hi, scientist

1011
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:42,780
May I come in?

1012
01:39:49,861 --> 01:39:51,941
Irresponsible people

1013
01:39:51,941 --> 01:39:54,542
Trash your cell phones

1014
01:39:55,301 --> 01:39:57,502
This is your last chance

1015
01:39:58,143 --> 01:39:59,463
Otherwise...

1016
01:40:00,423 --> 01:40:01,743
...death is certain!

1017
01:40:01,863 --> 01:40:05,183
I wasn't talking to any girl, but my boss

1018
01:40:05,183 --> 01:40:06,463
Didn't you hear what I said?

1019
01:40:10,704 --> 01:40:12,784
I always wear Victoria Secret, you know

1020
01:40:12,824 --> 01:40:13,944
Including the latest one-

1021
01:40:37,667 --> 01:40:40,027
- Nila, is photon synthesizer set?
- Yes

1022
01:40:43,507 --> 01:40:45,467
'Hey! all clubs closes at midnight'

1023
01:40:45,467 --> 01:40:46,187
'Let's go next week'

1024
01:40:47,748 --> 01:40:48,828
'Hey! Stop...stop'

1025
01:40:53,428 --> 01:40:55,549
Doctor, what are you doing?

1026
01:40:55,589 --> 01:40:57,150
Why are you behaving like this?

1027
01:40:57,190 --> 01:40:59,230
Welcome, my dear 'nuts & bolt toy'

1028
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:01,710
But I'm not your doctor!

1029
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:13,151
Nila, turn on the neutralizer

1030
01:41:30,353 --> 01:41:31,433
No...!

1031
01:41:31,473 --> 01:41:32,753
Nila, stop it!

1032
01:41:41,475 --> 01:41:44,355
You can't do anything to me, Chitti

1033
01:41:45,435 --> 01:41:47,555
I have a body now

1034
01:41:48,355 --> 01:41:50,916
Dr Vaseegaran's body!

1035
01:41:51,555 --> 01:41:53,476
If you destroy me...

1036
01:41:53,596 --> 01:41:56,636
...it is the same as
you killing your God!

1037
01:41:58,476 --> 01:41:59,676
Now go...

1038
01:41:59,756 --> 01:42:01,636
...turn it on ?

1039
01:42:01,997 --> 01:42:03,717
Show off your technology

1040
01:42:03,717 --> 01:42:04,797
Turn it on

1041
01:42:04,797 --> 01:42:06,198
Switch it on, damn you!

1042
01:42:07,998 --> 01:42:09,078
Chitti...!

1043
01:42:09,117 --> 01:42:10,917
Don't hesitate
Turn it on

1044
01:42:10,998 --> 01:42:11,997
Destroy me

1045
01:42:11,997 --> 01:42:13,678
He'll be destroyed along with me

1046
01:42:13,758 --> 01:42:14,758
No, doctor

1047
01:42:14,798 --> 01:42:15,638
I can't do that

1048
01:42:15,638 --> 01:42:19,039
Chitti, thinking you are saving me
don't exterminate the entire human race

1049
01:42:19,039 --> 01:42:20,119
Kill me

1050
01:42:20,119 --> 01:42:21,039
Destroy him

1051
01:42:21,079 --> 01:42:22,439
- Kill me
- Sorry, doctor

1052
01:42:22,439 --> 01:42:24,399
Human emotion fed by you in MPU
is stopping me

1053
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,719
You fool! This is my order, kill me

1054
01:42:28,199 --> 01:42:29,680
No, hold fire

1055
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:32,481
If you shoot, only Vaseegaran
will die unnecessarily

1056
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:34,001
Can't kill Pakshi Rajan

1057
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,721
Chitti, why are you stopping them?

1058
01:42:35,721 --> 01:42:37,401
- Let them shoot me
- No

1059
01:42:49,042 --> 01:42:50,123
Chitti

1060
01:42:51,602 --> 01:42:52,922
Oh! My Chitti

1061
01:42:53,243 --> 01:42:55,043
Nila, turn on the neutralizer

1062
01:42:55,082 --> 01:42:56,484
'Come on, quick!'

1063
01:42:57,043 --> 01:42:58,043
Nila, NO!

1064
01:42:58,083 --> 01:42:59,163
'Don't do that'

1065
01:42:59,683 --> 01:43:01,483
Shut up!
This is my order

1066
01:43:01,523 --> 01:43:02,644
Switch it on

1067
01:43:22,006 --> 01:43:23,247
Oh!

1068
01:43:23,326 --> 01:43:25,686
What you've done
is really stupid, Chitti

1069
01:43:30,567 --> 01:43:33,407
Your call is disconnected!

1070
01:44:04,051 --> 01:44:05,411
Chitti...?

1071
01:44:05,731 --> 01:44:07,571
What a pity!

1072
01:44:18,372 --> 01:44:20,052
Chitti...Chitti

1073
01:44:21,333 --> 01:44:22,252
Chit-

1074
01:44:22,294 --> 01:44:23,333
Chitti

1075
01:44:26,573 --> 01:44:28,253
Nila, go right now and-

1076
01:48:22,921 --> 01:48:25,881
Unique feeling of real joy
to die and get reactivated!

1077
01:48:30,281 --> 01:48:31,402
Pakshi

1078
01:48:31,961 --> 01:48:34,962
Unlike your name
you can't fly any longer!

1079
01:48:40,563 --> 01:48:42,204
Hey, Nila...!

1080
01:48:42,244 --> 01:48:44,044
Why are you standing right there?

1081
01:48:44,603 --> 01:48:47,243
Nila the Lucky Woman, eh?

1082
01:48:47,284 --> 01:48:48,844
Come...come...come

1083
01:48:51,965 --> 01:48:53,444
Come on, baby

1084
01:48:56,244 --> 01:48:57,685
Wow...!

1085
01:48:57,805 --> 01:49:00,845
Only 2 tasks of Vaseegaran
in his research are worthy of praise

1086
01:49:00,885 --> 01:49:02,245
One is me

1087
01:49:02,245 --> 01:49:03,686
The other is you!

1088
01:49:04,526 --> 01:49:05,766
What are you looking at?

1089
01:49:05,806 --> 01:49:06,846
Come on

1090
01:49:06,886 --> 01:49:10,327
Give a beautiful kiss
to your great king, baby

1091
01:49:16,847 --> 01:49:18,248
Stop the play, Chitti

1092
01:49:18,287 --> 01:49:20,207
We must 1st destroy Pakshi

1093
01:49:20,288 --> 01:49:22,648
Because he is even more powerful than you

1094
01:49:23,247 --> 01:49:25,408
He's committing atrocities multi-fold

1095
01:49:26,169 --> 01:49:28,729
He was able to shred
even you into million parts

1096
01:49:28,929 --> 01:49:30,089
Now...

1097
01:49:30,129 --> 01:49:31,569
...he's the world #1

1098
01:49:31,609 --> 01:49:32,889
Not you

1099
01:49:38,249 --> 01:49:42,330
Hey, this number 1 and
number 2 are all child's play

1100
01:49:42,650 --> 01:49:44,570
I am the only one

1101
01:49:45,771 --> 01:49:47,370
Super one!

1102
01:49:47,611 --> 01:49:49,931
No comparison, understand?

1103
01:49:50,051 --> 01:49:51,331
I understand, Chitti

1104
01:49:51,771 --> 01:49:53,331
We must make him understand

1105
01:49:53,331 --> 01:49:54,652
You bet I will

1106
01:49:56,172 --> 01:49:58,172
The king of birds

1107
01:49:58,692 --> 01:50:00,292
The battle is on!

1108
01:50:19,815 --> 01:50:20,895
Left

1109
01:50:21,174 --> 01:50:22,415
Right

1110
01:50:22,456 --> 01:50:23,455
Head

1111
01:50:24,015 --> 01:50:25,615
'Kamoshka'

1112
01:50:25,815 --> 01:50:27,335
Activate command mode

1113
01:50:27,575 --> 01:50:29,335
Command mode activated!

1114
01:50:40,016 --> 01:50:41,377
What is this?

1115
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:45,457
It's me

1116
01:50:46,178 --> 01:50:47,418
Mini me!

1117
01:50:51,618 --> 01:50:53,059
So cute

1118
01:51:12,781 --> 01:51:14,340
'What a game!'

1119
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:17,381
'And now it's Half time
at the IFL finals'

1120
01:51:34,464 --> 01:51:36,264
[indistinct chatter]

1121
01:51:45,985 --> 01:51:48,184
'We'll handle that later
Attend to your call'

1122
01:52:01,746 --> 01:52:03,787
Dear subscribers

1123
01:52:04,227 --> 01:52:07,267
You are going to be
not reachable from now

1124
01:52:07,387 --> 01:52:08,787
'Because...'

1125
01:52:09,028 --> 01:52:11,267
...all of you will die now

1126
01:52:12,268 --> 01:52:14,188
'By no means an ordinary death'

1127
01:52:14,947 --> 01:52:16,668
'Radiation death!'

1128
01:52:17,708 --> 01:52:21,709
You will all die in groups
like the sparrows collapsed

1129
01:52:21,949 --> 01:52:23,228
'Don't you get it?'

1130
01:52:23,909 --> 01:52:30,150
I'll combine the radiation
from the cell phones all of you use

1131
01:52:31,149 --> 01:52:33,590
I'll use it on all of you

1132
01:52:35,110 --> 01:52:36,791
Want to see a demo?

1133
01:52:45,471 --> 01:52:46,832
Hey, you...!

1134
01:52:48,872 --> 01:52:50,152
Ex...excuse me

1135
01:52:51,071 --> 01:52:53,153
Why don't you select someone else?

1136
01:52:53,472 --> 01:52:54,472
Why?

1137
01:52:54,552 --> 01:52:55,713
I'm on your side

1138
01:52:55,753 --> 01:52:56,913
How...?

1139
01:52:57,793 --> 01:52:59,913
I was the one who released you

1140
01:53:01,194 --> 01:53:03,433
At least for that reason
let me go please

1141
01:53:03,514 --> 01:53:04,634
So what?

1142
01:53:05,273 --> 01:53:07,314
You are a subscriber too, man

1143
01:53:38,517 --> 01:53:42,318
You will meet your end in this way,
a fate worse than ordinary death

1144
01:53:55,480 --> 01:54:00,360
In just 5 seconds, 70,000 people
were killed in Hiroshima

1145
01:54:00,401 --> 01:54:02,201
Till date that was the world record

1146
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:05,481
Today...80,000 men and women

1147
01:54:05,521 --> 01:54:06,641
A new record!

1148
01:54:09,081 --> 01:54:12,522
You are going to be part
of a historic moment

1149
01:54:12,561 --> 01:54:14,281
Dear subscribers!

1150
01:54:21,523 --> 01:54:23,163
Dear subscribers

1151
01:54:23,242 --> 01:54:24,404
Don't panic

1152
01:54:24,483 --> 01:54:26,643
You are not the ones
who are about to die

1153
01:54:32,804 --> 01:54:34,684
A small bird

1154
01:54:37,725 --> 01:54:39,125
What are you looking at Pakshi?

1155
01:54:39,165 --> 01:54:40,404
I am Chitti

1156
01:54:40,404 --> 01:54:41,605
Reloaded

1157
01:54:41,805 --> 01:54:43,165
Version 2.0!

1158
01:54:51,486 --> 01:54:53,207
Doctor, is that you?

1159
01:54:53,567 --> 01:54:54,887
Did I shoot you?

1160
01:54:55,087 --> 01:54:56,406
Did I try to kill you?

1161
01:54:56,486 --> 01:54:58,847
My God! I was about
to commit a grave sin

1162
01:54:58,887 --> 01:55:00,807
Doctor, please don't harm me

1163
01:55:00,887 --> 01:55:02,568
You are my creator

1164
01:55:02,568 --> 01:55:04,688
Don't rip me apart with your own hands

1165
01:55:04,768 --> 01:55:06,128
Forgive me and let me go

1166
01:55:06,168 --> 01:55:07,167
Please

1167
01:55:07,208 --> 01:55:08,248
Fat hopes!

1168
01:55:09,568 --> 01:55:10,889
Vasi...!

1169
01:55:57,014 --> 01:55:58,495
Come, you selfie bots!

1170
01:55:59,254 --> 01:56:01,255
I will set your screens on fire

1171
01:56:36,899 --> 01:56:38,418
Zero balance!

1172
01:57:21,184 --> 01:57:22,944
Shoot that sparrow

1173
01:59:56,899 --> 01:59:59,139
Hey bird man!

1174
02:00:02,060 --> 02:00:03,820
Iron man!

1175
02:00:04,139 --> 02:00:05,900
I'm just a driver
Let me go

1176
02:00:43,187 --> 02:00:44,347
Pakshi!

1177
02:00:44,548 --> 02:00:46,667
You had better scatter
and scoot from here

1178
02:00:46,747 --> 02:00:49,589
Otherwise I'll pluck
every single feather out

1179
02:00:52,428 --> 02:00:54,269
You moron of a machine!

1180
02:00:54,348 --> 02:00:57,230
Why are you fighting
for these ungrateful men?

1181
02:00:57,270 --> 02:01:00,830
When you've served their purpose
they will rip your nuts apart!

1182
02:04:05,022 --> 02:04:06,703
Hey! What's happening?

1183
02:04:25,987 --> 02:04:28,027
Yayayay...angry bird!

1184
02:04:28,707 --> 02:04:29,948
Why are you staring?

1185
02:04:29,988 --> 02:04:31,228
I am Kutti!

1186
02:04:31,307 --> 02:04:32,548
The microbot

1187
02:04:32,589 --> 02:04:34,629
Version 3.O

1188
02:04:35,989 --> 02:04:38,549
If you disturb my boss
your dove will be

1189
02:04:40,669 --> 02:04:43,790
"I am Isaac Asimov’s grandson, buddy"

1190
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:47,150
"I am a warrior, size of a turkey berry"

1191
02:04:53,752 --> 02:04:57,033
"O bird of prey
You’re a goner, I say"

1192
02:04:57,153 --> 02:05:00,273
"It's 'Festival of lights' for us today"

1193
02:05:02,073 --> 02:05:04,674
It is said a bird can look
in 6 different directions

1194
02:05:04,754 --> 02:05:06,754
Pakshi, won't you see?

1195
02:05:22,797 --> 02:05:23,757
Microbots

1196
02:05:30,118 --> 02:05:31,239
No...no

1197
02:05:31,399 --> 02:05:33,118
Hey! Don't do this

1198
02:05:41,241 --> 02:05:43,320
Maintain that same panic

1199
02:05:48,082 --> 02:05:50,161
"Birdie got caught-o?"

1200
02:05:50,682 --> 02:05:51,563
Bow bow

1201
02:05:51,602 --> 02:05:53,083
"Feathers fell apart-o?"

1202
02:05:53,123 --> 02:05:54,203
"3.O"

1203
02:05:54,683 --> 02:05:56,643
"Swarmed all over you?"

1204
02:06:01,124 --> 02:06:04,844
Pakshi, if you breach this stadium
with your radiation

1205
02:06:04,885 --> 02:06:07,925
...1st victims will be
only your birdies!

1206
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:20,900
Microbots, go

1207
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:24,980
"3.O"

1208
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:31,540
"3.O"

1209
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:56,670
"I am a cannon 6" tall
You're a radish, that's all"

1210
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:59,950
"I am an automated masterpiece
I tricked you with zetabyte-ease"

1211
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:03,470
"I am the evil mosquito Ranguski
Ready to send you to the cemetery"

1212
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:07,030
"Itsy-bitsy, I'm snuff powder heady
I'm into your nostril, deal with me"

1213
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:12,870
A lion can't touch a mosquito, big birdie!

1214
02:07:13,070 --> 02:07:16,670
But if mosquitoes set their minds
they can chase the lion to its doom

1215
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:21,750
Cuckoo!

1216
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:33,320
Good job, 3.O

1217
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:35,920
Thank you, commander

1218
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:37,880
- Microbots positioned?
- All set

1219
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:39,520
Pakshi

1220
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:44,880
Have a blast!

1221
02:08:27,690 --> 02:08:29,850
Should these doves also explode?

1222
02:08:30,850 --> 02:08:33,170
Hey beep
Follow me

1223
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:35,970
Come on, bots

1224
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:54,930
"O eagle, you're a goner, I say"

1225
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:58,250
"It's 'Conquest of good over evil' today"

1226
02:08:58,370 --> 02:09:01,650
"Bird of prey
It's a jolly day"

1227
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:04,850
"You are a guest in hell any which way"

1228
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:08,410
"People’s favorite
'Podimas' minuute"

1229
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:11,330
"If I burst, it will be a wrecker
like a boom-boom cracker"

1230
02:09:11,370 --> 02:09:13,650
Hey! Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1231
02:09:13,690 --> 02:09:14,650
This is restricted area

1232
02:09:14,690 --> 02:09:15,650
Get out!

1233
02:10:22,099 --> 02:10:26,182
You are the reason
we are alive once again today

1234
02:10:26,461 --> 02:10:29,424
What an enormous risk you've taken
and saved all of us!

1235
02:10:29,463 --> 02:10:31,505
Technology saved us

1236
02:10:32,186 --> 02:10:35,387
But we are the ones
misusing technology

1237
02:10:36,227 --> 02:10:38,790
We should eliminate diseases
with the help of technology

1238
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:40,111
Eradicate poverty

1239
02:10:40,111 --> 02:10:41,752
Promote education

1240
02:10:41,752 --> 02:10:46,355
If we use it for personal comforts and
fuelling our greed, it's doomsday for sure

1241
02:10:47,114 --> 02:10:49,797
Will...will that Pakshi Rajan reappear?

1242
02:10:51,678 --> 02:10:53,479
He is dead and gone

1243
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:57,522
But if we continue this way
another 'evil force' will erupt

1244
02:10:58,722 --> 02:11:01,324
Even if Pakshi Rajan's actions were wrong

1245
02:11:01,404 --> 02:11:03,166
...there was truth in his words

1246
02:11:03,365 --> 02:11:07,249
If human beings should live on earth
birds should also co exist

1247
02:11:08,529 --> 02:11:10,450
Control radiation

1248
02:11:10,650 --> 02:11:12,651
Reduce networks

1249
02:11:12,651 --> 02:11:18,655
Pass a rule, no technology should affect
any living thing, human, bird or beast

1250
02:11:19,175 --> 02:11:21,497
This earth doesn't belong only to us

1251
02:11:21,737 --> 02:11:25,940
Everyone should realize it belongs
to all the living creatures here

1252
02:11:26,661 --> 02:11:27,861
You are right

1253
02:11:27,982 --> 02:11:29,823
Ensure birds are not destroyed

1254
02:11:29,982 --> 02:11:34,946
At least provide water for birds
to drink during our scorching summers

1255
02:11:36,266 --> 02:11:38,909
That’s enough to refresh
and revitalize your minds

1256
02:11:39,309 --> 02:11:41,390
All this will happen, Vaseegaran

1257
02:11:41,471 --> 02:11:44,072
I'll bring this to the notice
of our Parliament

1258
02:11:44,232 --> 02:11:46,593
I'll make sure this happens

1259
02:11:47,273 --> 02:11:48,755
Thank you, Vaseegaran

1260
02:11:53,277 --> 02:11:54,439
Thanks, Nila

1261
02:11:54,559 --> 02:11:56,440
Why are you thanking your shadow?

1262
02:11:59,041 --> 02:12:00,443
Oh God!

1263
02:12:00,602 --> 02:12:03,003
We have to remove
that red chip from Chitti

1264
02:12:03,085 --> 02:12:04,204
Don't worry, boss

1265
02:12:04,286 --> 02:12:08,287
To be on the safe side I activated it
after doing an auto-eject program

1266
02:12:10,049 --> 02:12:11,289
Smaaart!

1267
02:12:18,094 --> 02:12:20,216
Good to see you alright, doctor

1268
02:12:20,415 --> 02:12:21,696
Me too, Chitti

1269
02:12:21,776 --> 02:12:25,939
Doctor, all the robots and I have to
report in the headquarters at Delhi today

1270
02:12:25,979 --> 02:12:27,780
Can I leave, doctor?

1271
02:12:31,462 --> 02:12:33,104
Take Nila with you

1272
02:12:39,668 --> 02:12:41,669
Doctor, how can I leave you like this and-

1273
02:12:41,789 --> 02:12:43,230
