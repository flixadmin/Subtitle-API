But my daughter is innocent.

-Fathwoom!
-(BOTH LAUGHING)

10
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,776
{\an8}I had to fight
some old lady for the last one.

11
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,737
{\an8}They didn't have any Green Arrow dolls.

12
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:14,407
{\an8}Don't nobody want a toy of that crazy man.
I can't figure out what to get Barry.

13
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,619
{\an8}I was thinking you could give him this.

14
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,371
{\an8}Oh, that's nice.

15
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,539
{\an8}But I kind of wanna
get him something more meaningful.

16
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,668
{\an8}I mean, it's been a strange,
emotional 12 months.

17
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,754
{\an8}Yeah. You don't have to tell me.

18
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,465
{\an8}I know, babe. I miss Eddie, too.

19
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,261
{\an8}How about you get Barry
uh, a really nice watch?

20
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,471
{\an8}Like Grandpa Ben gave to you.

21
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:37,805
{\an8}That ain't a bad idea.

22
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,101
{\an8}You know, my dad only gave me
this watch because I was always late.

23
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,728
{\an8}-You? (CHUCKLES)
-Yeah.

24
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,856
{\an8}He always gave a gift
with a not-so-hidden message.

25
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,983
{\an8}Like this watch,
or the time he bought me free weights

26
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,527
{\an8}because he said I was too skinny.

27
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,365
{\an8}I told him, "When I have a son,
I'm only giving him fun presents."

28
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,785
{\an8}And this thing barely works.
Don't know why I still wear it.

29
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,205
{\an8}Because it's from family.

30
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,459
{\an8}You sure you're all right?

31
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
{\an8}(CHUCKLES) Yeah, yeah, I promise.

{\an8}Yes, and I'm fully prepared
to reprimand myself then.

36
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:28,815
{\an8}I'm just saying, you know, anyone
could walk in like, Joe, or Captain...

37
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,193
{\an8}-Yo.
-(CHUCKLES)

38
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,821

-Yep.

-Yeah. Okay, bye.

{\an8}I'm so happy for you.

42

{\an8}Truly.

43
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,459
{\an8}Thank you. I...

44
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,002
{\an8}It means a lot to me that you like her.

45

{\an8}(SIGHS) I don't know, it's...

{\an8}Wells, um...

47
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,470
{\an8}He left me that message where he said

48
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,472
{\an8}that I'd never really be happy.

49
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,351
{\an8}And for a while, I had really started
to believe him but now,

50
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,936
I don't know. Maybe there is a way that...

51
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,148
Are you okay? What's wrong?

52
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,193
(WEEPING) I'm so sorry.
I can't keep this in anymore, Barry.

53
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,362
What?

54
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,365
I know that I was so mad at you and Dad
for not telling me that you were The Flash

55
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,201
but when I found out about this,
I didn't know what to do.

56
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,036
What? What's going on? What's...

57
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,247
When Francine came back,

58
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,501
my dad told me
not to trust her, and he was right.

59
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,004
I didn't know how much.

60
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,761
When my mother left us, she was pregnant.

61
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,639
She had a son.

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,226
Joe's son. My brother.

63
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,731
What's his name?

64
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,066
Wally.

65
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,944
Wally West.

66
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,116
When I found out, I told her to leave
and then never come back,

67
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,410
and to never tell my dad.

68
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,414
But, Barry, I feel like
this is hollowing me out.

69
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,501
Every time I look at Dad, I feel like
I'm hurting him. I don't know what to do.

70
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,920
I think you know what you have to do.

71
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,463
I can't. It's gonna kill him.

72
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,089
No, it won't.

73
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,176
You don't have to do this alone.
We can tell him together.

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,886
Thank you. (SIGHS)

75
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,095
Yeah.

76
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,478
Hey, look. Snow.

77
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,442
Maybe it'll be a white Christmas.

78
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,068
That'd be nice.

79
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,159
I was just thinking that if we could
inject an unstable neutrino burst

80
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,786
into the individual breaches,

81
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,621
it might cause them to seal on their own.

82
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,248
And stop Zoom from traveling
back and forth between our worlds.

83
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,167
At least then,
we wouldn't have to worry about him

84
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,087
sending any more meta-humans
over for Barry to fight.

85
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,755
-It means a lot.
-What does?

86
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:02,093
You looking after Barry. He's been
through a lot the last few weeks.

87
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,722
Barry's not the only person here
I want to keep safe.

88
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:10,184
Oh, dear Lord.
Just kiss already. Oh, the thirst is real.

89
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,811
Is everything all right?

90
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,231
Yeah. I keep checking,
but all is quiet on the meta-human front.

91
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,317
Hey, you think Zoom
decided to take Christmas off?

92
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,901
What's Christmas?

93
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:23,865
Oh, uh, well, it's this holiday we have
where we cut down trees and sing songs

94
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:26,659
to celebrate the birth of a baby
2,000 years ago,

95
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,995
and then the Romans killed him,
so we give each other gifts.

96
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,497
That's your explanation?

97
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,249
-I know what Christmas is.
-Oh, right. Of course.

98
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,670
Um, you know, Joe and Barry and Iris
are having people over for Christmas Eve.

99
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,382
And they said we could
invite whoever we want.

100
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,008
Who, who do you want?

101
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:45,762
You. I want to invite you, I mean.

102
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,180
This is so painful.
Have you guys seen Harry?

103
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,475
No, I have not. I told him to rest.

104
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,185
He's just as stubborn as all the rest
of my male patients in this place.

105
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,147
I'm gonna leave you two alone, okay?
I'm gonna go find Harry.

with Mardon back on the scene...

-Yeah?
-Patty might not be thinking so clearly.

What do you mean?
What does Mardon have to do with Patty?

We should have expected this.

had to mean Mardon's back in town.

(VOCALIZING)

156
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,161
I don't remember those being the lyrics.

157
00:08:57,494 --> 00:09:01,457
Oh, I am tremendously creative.
That, I can tell you.

158
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,042
You better be. I didn't break you out,

159
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,795
I didn't break either of you out
'cause I was looking to make new friends.

160
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,048
That is not the holiday spirit,
Marky-Mark.

161
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,551
Christmas is a time for togetherness.

162
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,846
And what says togetherness
more than mass graves?

163
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,889
-Hmm?
-So why did you break us out?

164
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,349
Well, I owed you one.

165
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,478
And this guy, he's just crazy.
That's a compliment.

166
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,438
And we all want the same thing.

167
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,065
Fashion advice?

168
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,817
To see The Flash dead.

169
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,111
Well, that was
more of a New Year's resolution.

170
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:31,654
But hey, I'm flexible.

171
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,949
That hasn't gone so well
for anyone in this room.

172
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,243
What makes you think
you can stop him this time?

173
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:41,623
Three against one.
Plus, that one isn't quite what he was.

174
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,292
See, another speedster,
dressed all in black,

175
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,419
nearly took him out a few weeks ago.

176
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,756
He's vulnerable, he's weak.

177
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,759
It's a mistake to underestimate him.

178
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,889
No. With my power, his flair,
and your smarts,

179
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,766
we can put him in the ground for good.

180
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,143
-Tell me your plan.
-Tell me you're in.

181
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,435
I'm thinking about it.

182
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,604
MARK: <i>What's the matter?</i>

183
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,148
A few months in the clink
make you soft, did it, Snart?

184
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,655
-You wanna dance?
-Boys, boys, boys, play nice.

185
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,448
Mellow out, Mardon.
Don't have a snit, Snart.

186
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,825
Here's an idea.

187
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:22,664
We all go out, have a few drinks,
kill some carolers, we'll all feel better.

188
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,415
All right.

189
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,127
So what's it gonna be, Snart?

190
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:36,218
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah. Weather Wizard,
Captain Cold, and the Trickster.

191
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,721
There's three of them and one of you.
I do not like those odds.

192
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,724
And I'm gonna be no help
without my speed, so...

193
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,977
Oh, oh, light bulb, up here.
I have an idea.

194
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,647
Most weather phenomena are marked,
no pun intended,

195
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,524
by a change in electric charge
and pressure in the atmosphere.

196
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,484
We could just map out
those fluctuations to...

197
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
To pinpoint his location.

198
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,988
Right. It would just be a matter
of removing all the electricity...

199
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,448
All the electricity
from his immediate surroundings.

200
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:58,825
-CISCO: <i>Attracting it to one spot.</i>
-To one spot.

201
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,326
The same way a lightning rod does!

202
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,078
Only instead of a lightning rod,
we could use...

203
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,495
A wand?

204
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,497
Have we already had this conversation?

205
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,499
-Kind of.
-What does that mean?

206
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,168
Uh...

207
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,587
All right.
So the last time Mardon attacked,

208
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:16,008
he, um, generated a tidal wave
that destroyed all of Central City.

209
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,510
So, why are you
not all sleeping with the fishes?

210
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,012
Earth-2 has <i>The Godfather?</i>

211
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,680
Every Earth has <i>The Godfather,</i> Vito.

212
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,018
So, I ran back through time.
One day into the past,

213
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,021
and I got a do over, and I stopped Mardon
before he could hurt anyone.

214
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,815
You shouldn't have
messed with the timeline.

215
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,483
That's what the other Wells said.

216
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,526
So the good news is, in that timeline,

217
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,238
you created the wand and it worked.
So you just gotta do it again.

218
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,366
-For the first time.
-Yeah. No pressure.

219
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,826
I can give you a hand.

220
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,161
-Best of both worlds?
-I like that.

221
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,872
(BARRY CHUCKLES)

222
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,041
You good, Harry?

223
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,252
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

224
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,547
Holiday blues? It can't be easy knowing
Zoom still has his daughter.

225
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,136
Yeah. All right, look, I'll be right back.
I have something I have to deal with.

226
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,602
Hey.

227
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:11,563
(CHUCKLES)

228
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,232
Okay.

229
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,068
The last time the two of you
were looking at me like that

230
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,529
was when you both took
my convertible on a joy ride

231
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,032
and wrapped it around
that big oak tree on Fairmont Drive.

232
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,574
Dad... (CLEARS THROAT)

233
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,788
All right, Joe, we have something
that we need to tell you...

234
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,164
No, um...

235
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,126
I have something that I need to tell you.

236
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,587
It's about Francine.

237
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,510
(SNIFFLING)

238
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,139
(CLEARS THROAT) When she left us,

239
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,017
she was pregnant.

240

(SIGHS)

241
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,659
(SIGHS)

242
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,959
Did she have the baby?

243
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,002
Yes.

244
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,923
His name is Wally.

245
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,550
Wally West.

246
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,638
It's short for Wallace.

247
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,518
That's what we were gonna name you
if you were a boy.

248
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:34,897
I only found out
a couple of weeks ago, Dad.

249
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,317
I'm so sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

250
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,364
That's why she reached out to us
after all of these years.

251
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,407
She wanted us to know before...

252
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,327
-She...
-Before she died.

253
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,375
And I thought Francine
was running out of surprises.

254
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,754
I gotta get to work.

255
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,547
Dad, listen. Dad!

256
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,093
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,514
Just let me sit with it.

258
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,526
Do you think that he's gonna be okay?

259
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,694
I do, yeah. I think.

260
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,197
It's just a lot to take in.

261
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,199
He just needs a little time to process it.

262
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,744
Ho-ho-ho.

263
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,461
Hmm.

264
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,672
Cocoa isn't cocoa
without the mini marshmallows.

265
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:43,632
And you're out. I checked.

266
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,178
Are you out of your mind,
breaking into my home?

267
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,931
Careful. Made an upgrade to the cold gun.

268
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,017
If I release my grip from the handle,
the core goes critical.

269
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,728
You might make it. She won't.

270
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,113
Read your article
on the disappearing middle class.

271
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,365
Strong point of view. Nice prose style.

272
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,076
Yeah, well, who needs a Pulitzer

273
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,619
when you have
a homicidal maniac's seal of approval.

274
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,247
Didn't Barry tell you?
I had a rough childhood.

275
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,749
Everyone in this room
had a rough childhood. Get over it.

276
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,168
Why are you here, Snart?

277
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,046
I got the Noel spirit.
Wanted to give you a little gift.

278
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,548
Mardon broke Jesse and me out to kill you.

279
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,009
Jesse's on board, of course.
He's shaking with excitement.

280
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,844
Me, I'm gonna pass.

281
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,262
Why? You grow a conscience?

282
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,932
Mardon wants revenge. Jesse wants chaos.

283
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,434
I'm just not invested like they are.

284
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,436
You mean there's no money in it for you?

285
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,605
I was never much for non-profit work.

286
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,773
If you're not in with them,
then tell me where they are.

287
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,151
Nah. Consider me more of a secret Santa.

288
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,779
Besides, you and your friends
love to solve a good mystery.

289
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,198
(CHUCKLES)

290
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,952
You are full of it, Snart.

291
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,080
I think my friends
and I saved your sister's life,

292
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,249
and you just can't stand
owing me a marker.

293
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,961
I hate to break it to you, but that,
that right there is called honor.

294
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,381
Go on. Make your pitch.
I can see you're dying to.

295
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,341
Help me stop them.

296
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,595
Sorry. I'm not interested in being a hero.

297
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,888
(SCOFFS)

298
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,225
Well, you're doing a pretty lousy job
of being a villain this week.

299
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,311
Merry Christmas, Barry.

300
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,822
Hey.

301
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,663
I was just thinking about a big drug bust

302
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,374
that me and Singh made about 10 years ago.

303
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:45,462
Afterward, we went for a steak lunch,

304
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,881
to treat ourselves for a job well done.

305
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,636
And while we were ordering,
I got this feeling in my chest.

306
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,680
Like my heart was being squeezed.

307
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:57,266
And I knew something wasn't right.

308
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,351
So I called your school.

309
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,521
And the nurse said to me
that she was just about to call me.

310
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,192
Iris was on her way to the hospital.

311
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,693
When her appendix burst.

312
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,529
And I knew it.
I could feel it. Right here.

313
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,864
I knew my kid needed me.

314
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:18,370
So, if I have that feeling as a parent,

315
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,955
why didn't I feel it for my son?

316
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,375
Joe, it's not your fault
that you didn't know about him.

317
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,044
Yeah, it was.

318
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:31,383
When Francine left rehab that last time,
I should've looked for her.

319
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,219
<i>I'm a cop. I could've found her.</i>

320
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,678
<i>Brought her back here.</i>

321
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,305
Tried again. Tried harder.

322
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,014
You were protecting Iris.

323
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,851
I have been telling myself that,
for 20 years.

324
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:44,313
A 20-year lie. But I wasn't
protecting her. I was protecting myself.

325
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,191
I couldn't stand it anymore.

326
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,484
I couldn't...

327
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,405
I hated not being able to help Francine.

328
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,866
So it was easier

329
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,704
for her to be dead.
Out of my life. Out of our lives.

330
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,208
But it wasn't for Iris.

331
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,877
I was being selfish.

332
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:10,672
And that, that poor boy paid the price.

333
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,923
Joe.

334
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,718
He never had a father

335
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,930
to read to him at night,
to show him how to throw a football,

336
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,016
to make him feel safe

337
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,852
and loved.

338
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,775
Who taught him how to be a man, Barry?

339
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,029
"Him," I can't even say his name.

340
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,161
What have I done?

341
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,247
Joe, look,

342
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:49,253
you have been there for me
every day since I met you.

343
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,713
You have.

344
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
And...

345
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,845
You would've done the exact same thing
for him if you could've. I know it.

346
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,267
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,647
Where's your partner, Spivot?

348

I don't know. I'm not his babysitter.

349

Mardon and Jesse aren't even here.
They're still on the loose.

How did you know to come here?

398
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,628
Because there was a reflection
in Jesse's eye of Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

399
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,212
And that's the thing that my dad...

It doesn't even matter.

401
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,049
That's why you came here alone?

402
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,219
Without any backup?
Because of your father?

403
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,138
You don't know anything about me.

404

I know that you're being reckless.

405

And I'm sure the people in your life
care enough about you

I did.

409
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,528
See, he had a little shoe shop,
and we didn't have any money,

410
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,196
so I worked there after school.
Except, one day,

411
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,574
I decided not to show up because...

412
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,286
I was being stupid and silly
with my friends

<i>I didn't even call

So, he brought
the deposits to the bank, not me.

415
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,965
He was shot and killed by Mardon, not me.

That's why you became a cop.

It'll be legal when I kill Mardon.

625
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,480
No, no, no. I can't take that.

626
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,857
I've always said

627
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,069
that one day, I would give this to my son.

628
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,245
And now I have.

629
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,872
Merry Christmas.

630
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,917
Merry Christmas. Thank you.

631
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,089
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

632
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,673
-See you at the house.
-Yeah.

633
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,271
(SIGHS)

634
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,149
I know that you're not him,

635
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,904
but he's not here
and I have to say this, for me.

636
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,447
In that video message,

637
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,492
you said that,

638
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,955
that I would never really be happy.

639
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,962
And I've been trying.
I've been trying really hard.

640
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,299
(SIGHS)

641
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,634
After what Joe said,

642
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,137
helping Patty,

643
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,141
I realize that you are still in my heart.

644
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,520
How much I hate you

645
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,691
for what you've done. (SNIFFLES)

646
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,988
I don't want to hate you anymore. I can't.

647
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,992
I can't hate you anymore.

648
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,831
I forgive you.

649
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,172
(BEEPING)

650
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,799
You need me for something?

651
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,510
<i>No, no, I'm good, um...</i>

652
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,641
<i>You know, you should, uh,
come over for Christmas tonight.</i>

653
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,352
You shouldn't be alone.

654
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,020
<i>It's a nice offer.</i>

655
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:33,816
I can't celebrate without my daughter.

656
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,194
All right.

657
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,748
(CHUCKLES)

658
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,041
-Strong enough?
-We'll see!

659
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,710
Huh. (LAUGHS)

660
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:55,588
-Yeah.
-I'll be right back.

661
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,382
Hey.

662
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,633
-Oh.
-What do you have there?

663
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:00,050
Mistletoe.

664
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,219
What's mistletoe?

665
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,098
Oh, uh, it's a hemi-parasitic plant
from the genus Santalaceae family,

666
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,308
in North America, I think.

667
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,478
Caitlin, I'm kidding.
We have mistletoe on Earth-2.

668
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,687
Right. Of course. (CHUCKLES)

669
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,401
Um, we also have
this tradition over there.

670
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,366
We have that tradition here, too.

671
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,742
-JOE: Aw!
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

672
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,077
-Finally.
-Oh, let me get that.

673
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,413
-Eggnog, please.
-Yeah.

674
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,039
-Hi!
-I'm so glad you could make it.

675
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:31,416
Thank you for having me.

676
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,792
Merry Christmas. This is for you.

677
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,126
-Thank you.
-Of course.

678
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:36,421
-Hey.
-Hi.

679
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,506
I've been really worried about you.
I've been calling.

680
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,008
I know. And I'm really sorry.

681
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:45,095
I just have been dealing
with something, by myself.

682
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,974
But I want to tell you about it.
I think that I'm ready to.

683
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,101
Someone reminded me of what's important,

684
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,689
so if you want to hear,
I would like to share it with you.

685
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,190
That would be the best gift I could get.

686
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,400
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

687
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,403
I don't know.
This is a really sweet sweater.

688
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,280
(LAUGHING)
I hope it's as sweet as this one.

689
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,531
-It's matching.
-(LAUGHING)

690
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,741
-Thank you.
-Of course.

691
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,952
-Detective Spivot.
-Hi!

692
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:09,287
What brings you here?

693
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,955
-Merry Christmas.
-Oh.

694
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:15,626
Well, I'm, you know, Barry's girlfriend.

695
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,045
-About time.
-Cheers.

696
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,297
-(LAUGHING)
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

697
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,591
-Are we expecting anybody else?
-Not that I know of.

698
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,426
I don't know.
Maybe Harry changed his mind.

699
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,936
Hi. I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

700
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,028
(STAMMERING) I'm Joe.

701
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,741
This is Iris.

702
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,660
-Hi.
-Hi.

703
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,081
I just wanted to...

704
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,252
I don't know.

705
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,005
I guess now's a bad time.
You've got company, so...

706
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:03,549
No, no, no. Come in.

707
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,821
Time's up, Wells. What's it going to be?

708
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,616
DR. WELLS: <i>I know what you're doing.</i>

709
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:34,997
I know why you keep sending villain
after villain from our Earth to this one.

710
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:42,046
You want Barry to get faster.
You want him to get stronger.

711
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:48,844
You want him to become more powerful,
more full of Speed Force.

712
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,185
You're fattening him up
like a Christmas goose.

713
00:39:56,351 --> 00:40:01,065
The more power he has,
the more I can take.

714
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:03,984
And you're going to help me.

715
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,780
Let me see her first.

716
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:12,452
(GASP) Daddy?

717
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,911
(CRYING)

718
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,917
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

719
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,294
Please help me.
Don't let him take me back.

720
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,796
I won't.

721
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,382
ZOOM: <i>Now decide.</i>

722
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,512
In return for your daughter's life.

723
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,515
I'll do it.

724
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,855
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.
