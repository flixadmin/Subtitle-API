00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:00,943
I'm stuck
in this stupid chair.

661
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,486
-Where's your chair?
-I didn't get a chair.

662
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:03,904
-Get me out of this one.
-I can't.

663
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,322
-Get me out. What?
-I can't.

664
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:06,406
I've made friends
with this man.

665
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,491
He's called the Grandmaster.

666
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:08,909
-Oh, he's crazy!
-I've gained his favor.

667
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,577
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

668
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,870
-Weeks ago?
-Yes.

669
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:13,038
I just got here.

670
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:14,289
(WHISPERS) What are you
whispering about?

671
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:15,415
(YELPS)

672
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,251
Time works real different
around these parts.

673
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,462
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

674
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:22,256
But here on Sakaar...

675
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,174
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

676
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:30,347
In any case,
you know this, uh...

677
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:31,765
You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

678
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,268
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

679
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,103
I've never met this man
in my life.

680
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,896
-He's my brother.
-Adopted.

681
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:39,231
Is he any kind of a fighter?

682
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:40,357
(LAUGHS) You take this thing

683
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,483
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

684
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,360
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

685
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,487
Hey, Sparkles,
here's the deal.

686
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:47,865
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

687
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:49,116
Asgard.

688
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,160
Any contender who defeats
my champion...

689
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:54,079
their freedom they shall win.

690
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:55,789
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

691
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:57,457
of whoever's ass
I have to kick!

692
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:00,169
That's what I call, contender.

693
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:02,754
Direction would be
this way, Lord.

694
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:04,423
Ah! Loki!

695
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,845
(GRUNTING)

696
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:12,639
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

697
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:14,975
-(PANTING)
-Over here.

698
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:16,727
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

699
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:19,438
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

700
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,190
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

701
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:22,691
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

702
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:24,610
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

703
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,278
But don't let that
intimidate you.

704
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:27,613
You don't need to be afraid

705
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,364
unless you're
made of scissors. (CHUCKLES)

706
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:30,699
Just a little
rock-paper-scissor

707
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:31,825
joke for you.

708
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:34,745
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

709
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:37,664
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

710
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,750
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

711
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,503
-That I am.
-How'd you end up in here?

712
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,379
Ah, well, I tried to start
a revolution,

713
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:45,631
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

714
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,174
So hardly anyone turned up,

715
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,968
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

716
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:51,470
As punishment, I was forced

717
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,972
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

718
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:55,599
Bit of a promotional disaster,
that one.

719
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:58,477
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

720
00:41:58,644 --> 00:41:59,645
I don't know
if you'd be interested

721
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:00,771
in something like that.

722
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,648
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

723
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:05,901
How did you...

724
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:08,779
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

725
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:12,115
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

726
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:13,492
This doesn't make any sense.

727
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:14,952
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

728
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:16,495
The only thing
that does make sense

729
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,121
is that nothing makes sense.

730
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:20,624
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

731
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:21,875
Doug has.

732
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,043
Doug!

733
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,294
Our luck, Doug's dead.

734
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,379
That's right.

735
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:26,547
Everyone who fights

736
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,965
the Grandmaster's champion
perishes.

737
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:29,800
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

738
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:32,636
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

739
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,596
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

740
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,640
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

741
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:38,559
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

742
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,185
Yes, I am.

743
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:42,187
Gonna fight him, win,

744
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:43,856
and get the hell out
of this place.

745
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,149
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

746
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:49,027
See you later, new Doug.

747
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,872
Does no one remember me?

748
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:02,833
Has no one been taught
our history?

749
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:09,882
Look at these lies.

750
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,050
Goblets and garden parties?

751
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:15,929
Peace treaties?

752
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:17,973
Odin...

753
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,766
proud to have it...

754
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,310
ashamed of how he got it.

755
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:22,644
(GRUNTING)

756
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:42,831
We were unstoppable.

757
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:44,958
I was his weapon
in the conquest

758
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:47,586
that built Asgard's empire.

759
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,717
One by one,
the realms became ours.

760
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:58,096
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

761
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:02,935
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

762
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:05,979
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

763
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:09,775
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

Or weak.

768

Smaller than I thought
it would be.

769
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:35,843
That's not bad.

770

Being lied to.

Being told you're one thing

789

and then learning
it's all a fiction.

come and see you, did you?

you could join me

You faked your own death...

Hammer?

844
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,650
Quite unique.
It was made from this

special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

846
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,737
And when I spun it really,
really fast,

847
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:07,114
it gave me the ability to fly.

848

You rode a hammer?

849
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:10,117
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:11,577
The hammer rode you
on your back?

851
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:13,537
No. I used to spin it
really fast,

852
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,122
and it would pull me
off the...

853

Oh, my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

854
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,209
The ground. It would pull me
off the ground,

855
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,170
up into the air,
and I would fly.

856
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:22,379
Every time I threw it,

857
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:24,339
it would always
come back to me.

858
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:25,757
Sounds like you had
a pretty special

859
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:27,176
and intimate relationship
with this hammer...

860
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:28,427
and that losing it

861
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,470
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

862
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:33,599
That's a nice way
of putting it.

863

I said they're mine.

My God, you're a Valkyrie.

875
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:08,634
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger...

until I found out that
you were all women.

There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

I love women.

that there is

01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:07,841
No! No, Banner!

01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:14,932
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

1315
01:15:15,015 --> 01:15:16,350
Oh, jeez.

1316
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:18,727
Banner.

1317
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:21,396
-Hey, hey, hey.
-(GROANING)

1318
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:23,148
-You all right, Banner?
-(GASPS)

-(GASPING)

Sun's going down.
Sun's going down.

1321
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:29,279
That's it, breathe.

1322
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,907
(EXHALES) I won't hurt you.

1323
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:33,575
-Sun's going down.
-(GROANS)

1324
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:35,160
-Thor.
-Yeah.

1325
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:37,371
What happened to your hair?

1326
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:38,872
Some creepy old man
cut it off.

1327
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:40,499
-It looks good.
-Oh, thanks.

1328
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:43,001
Where are we? Oh, how's Nat?

1329
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:46,129
-Uh, Nat is good, I'm sure.
-Is she okay?

1330
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,090
-And what about Sokovia?
-Sokovia?

1331
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:49,758
The city, Sokovia.
Did we save it?

1332
01:15:49,925 --> 01:15:51,093
-Banner, listen.
-What?

1333
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,262
Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

1334
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:54,930
-What are you saying?
-Well...

1335
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:56,223
What?

1336
01:15:57,015 --> 01:15:58,433
I've been Hulk for two years?

1337
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:00,269
I'm afraid so.

1338
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:05,524
(CLATTERS)

1339
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,442
What the hell happened?

1340
01:16:10,863 --> 01:16:12,531
Banner, there's something
you should know.

1341
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:14,825

1343
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,160
Banner.

1344
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:18,787
Welcome, strongest Avenger.

1345
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:19,872
Uh, what?

1346
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,123
Ship's log.

(ALARM BLARING)

1350
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:34,178
Thor, where are we?

1351
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:35,387
Yeah, about that.

1352
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:36,805
GRANDMASTER: (ON SPEAKERS)
Sakaar, hear ye.

1353
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,682
Attention please.
I have some bad news.

1354
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:41,643
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.

1355
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,104
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.

1356
01:16:44,188 --> 01:16:45,189
BANNER: Who's that?

1357
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,024
He kind of runs the place.

1358
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:49,151
You actually lived
at his house for awhile.

1359
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:50,360
-I did?
-Yeah.

1360
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:52,446
Quite a lot's happened. You
and I had a fight recently.

1361
01:16:53,155 --> 01:16:55,032
-Did I win?
-No, I won. Easily.

1362
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:56,200
Doesn't sound right.

1363
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:57,326
Well, it's true.

1364
01:16:57,409 --> 01:16:59,453
It seems that that
criminally seductive

1365
01:16:59,536 --> 01:17:02,080
Lord of Thunder
has stolen him away.

1366
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:04,750
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.

1367
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:06,502
Oh, no.

1368
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:08,295
(GRANDMASTER CONTINUES
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

1369
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:09,505
This is bad.

1370
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:11,715
This is really, really bad.

1371
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:18,138
Thor, I think
I'm freaking out.

1372
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:19,515
No, no, no.

1373
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:21,600
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.

1374
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:22,809
These are Tony's clothes.

1375
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:24,269
-I know, come on.
-Is he here?

1376
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:26,313
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

1377
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,565
The sun's going down.
The sun's getting really low.

1378
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:29,858
Sun's going down.

1379
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:39,326
GRANDMASTER: I'm upset!

1380
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:44,206
I'm very upset.

1381
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,458
You know what I like about
being upset? The blame.

1382
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:48,752
Right now, that's
the mindset that I'm in.

1383
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:50,003
And you know who I'm blaming?

1384
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,713
-Grandmaster, I can...
-Hey!

1385
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:52,798
Don't interrupt me!

1386
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:54,091
Here you go.

1387
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,218
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

1388
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:58,220
He was interrupting.

1389
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:00,138
That's not
a capital violation.

1390
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:01,682
Where was I?

1391
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:04,518
My precious champion
has come up missing...

1392
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:06,645
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

1393
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:09,022
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

1394
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:12,109
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

1395
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:13,277
I'm sure
there's a big history.

1396
01:18:13,443 --> 01:18:14,611
And your contender...

1397
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:16,405
LOKI: My dear friend...

1398
01:18:16,572 --> 01:18:18,448
if you were to give me
12 hours,

1399
01:18:18,532 --> 01:18:19,867
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

1400
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:21,535
I could do it in two.

1401
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:23,495
I could do it in one.

1402
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:24,705
Let's stop there.

1403
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:26,665
You know what?
I woke up this morning

1404
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:28,917
thinking about
a public execution.

1405
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:30,627
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

1406
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:33,589
(EXCLAIMS)
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1407
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,176
So, you're on the clock.

1408
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:40,220
What have you done?

1409
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:41,555
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1410
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:42,764
It's Loki.

1411
01:18:42,848 --> 01:18:44,516
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

1412
01:18:45,559 --> 01:18:47,311
-(GRUNTS)
-Hmm.

1413
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:50,522
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1414
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:52,065
I don't help anyone.

1415
01:18:58,572 --> 01:18:59,698
You're a Valkyrie.

1416
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,830
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1417
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:09,708
Choose your next words wisely.

1418
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:13,170
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1419
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:00,759
(GRUNTS)

1420
01:20:05,806 --> 01:20:08,392
THOR: The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1421
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,811
The sun's going down.

1422
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:12,479
-It's getting real low.
-Oh, shoot.

1423
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:14,773
-Sun's getting low.
-Would you stop saying that?

1424
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,108
I just need you to stay calm.

1425
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:18,193
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1426
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,112
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1427
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:21,321
Yeah. One.

1428
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:23,115
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1429
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:24,491
It's a new experience.

1430
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:26,577
My neurons,
they're firing faster

1431
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,745
than my brain can handle
the information.

1432
01:20:28,912 --> 01:20:31,164
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1433
01:20:31,331 --> 01:20:33,083
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

1434
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,626
each had a hand on the wheel.

1435
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:36,503
But this time, it's like
he had the keys

1436
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:38,213
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

1437
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:40,215
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

1438
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:41,466
No, it's not what matters.

1439
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:42,676
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

1440
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:44,386
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

1441
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,054
Banner may never come back.

1442
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:47,472
And we're stranded on a planet

1443
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:49,516
that is designed
to stress me out.

1444
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:50,809
We're not stranded.

1445
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:52,227
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1446
01:20:52,603 --> 01:20:53,604
Thank you.

1447
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:55,981
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1448
01:20:56,148 --> 01:20:57,191
What?

1449
01:20:57,357 --> 01:20:59,151
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

1450
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:01,820
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1451
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:03,822
who also happens
to be my sister.

1452
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:05,699
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

1453
01:21:05,866 --> 01:21:06,992
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

1454
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:08,368
That's a family issue.

1455
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:09,912
No, she's an evil being.

1456
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:11,455
I don't care what she is.

1457
01:21:11,622 --> 01:21:13,957
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1458
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:15,209
-What?
-I just told you.

1459
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:16,877
If I turn into the Hulk,

1460
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,170
I am never gonna
come back again.

1461
01:21:18,337 --> 01:21:19,379
And you don't care.

1462
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:21,340
No, no. I'm putting together
the team.

1463
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:22,841
The Hulk is the fire.

1464
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:24,760
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1465
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:26,470
-What? No!
-It's gross.

1466
01:21:26,637 --> 01:21:28,388
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1467
01:21:28,555 --> 01:21:30,307
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

1468
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:31,642
He's all like...

1469
01:21:31,808 --> 01:21:33,310
"Smash, smash, smash."

1470
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:34,686
I prefer you.

1471
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:36,522
Thanks.

1472
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:38,774
But if I'm being honest,

1473
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:40,317
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

1474
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:41,902
he is very powerful
and useful.

1475
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:44,029
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1476
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:45,322
Is he though?

1477
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:47,616
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1478
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:49,701
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

1479
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:52,454
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

1480
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:54,581
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

What are you doing with that?

1482
01:21:59,753 --> 01:22:00,754
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1483
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:02,673
-I need a disguise.
-You are the disguise.

1484
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,050
-I'll be Tony Stark.
-What?

1485
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:06,969
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1486
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:09,596
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1487
01:22:09,763 --> 01:22:11,056
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1488
01:22:11,223 --> 01:22:12,224
Because you were naked.

1489
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:13,767
Okay, I'll give you that.

1490

Stop doing that!

1491

Tony wears his pants
super tight.

1492
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:18,313
-Stop it!
-I'm sorry.

1493
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,607
-Why are you being so weird?
-I don't know.

1494
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:23,110
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1495
01:22:23,277 --> 01:22:25,863
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

Hey. Shh. It's okay.

I thought you were leaving.

the best place

and to die one day.

was gonna kill you.

it was called that

Okay, can I just... (WHISTLES)
A quick FYI.

1614
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:49,751
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

1615
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:52,421
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1616
01:26:52,588 --> 01:26:53,755
He did try to kill me.

Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

1618

There was one time
when we were children...

1619
01:26:57,676 --> 01:26:59,136
he transformed himself
into a snake,

1620
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:00,429
and he knows
that I love snakes.

1621
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:02,431
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

and he transformed back
into himself

"Yeah, it's me!"

It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.
