Binky, take that priceless
artifact out of your mouth.

You don't know where
it's been. (WHIMPERING)

Walter, have you
seen Binky's pacifier?

00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,898
Jeepers Christmas, Madge, we may
have left it behind in the museum.

Gosh, Binky, I hate to say
it, but that pacifier's gone.

Wait a minute.
You robbed the museum.

00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,546
Nah-uh, Baby-face,
you ain't going anywhere
