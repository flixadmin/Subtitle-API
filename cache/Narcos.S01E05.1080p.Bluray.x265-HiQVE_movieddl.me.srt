00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,447
Beloved countrymen,

20
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,082
the New Liberalism party
is the only force in Colombia

21
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,606
that is not afraid of narcotraffickers.

22
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,122
"There are three ways
the narcotraffickers...

23
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,330
- try to weaken extradition."
- ...try to weaken extradition.

24
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,811
- "Bribery..."
- Bribery...

25
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,689
"...intimidation through violence..."

26
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,762
...intimidation through violence...

27
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,922
- "...and extortion."
- ...and extortion!

28
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,285
- "A dark and terrible scourge."
- A dark and terrible scourge.

29
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,408
What are you doing?

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,767
Just making sure he gets it right.

31
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,690
You wrote it, you should know.

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,530
- Mm.
- Look, I brought you this.

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,045
What's this?

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,842
Clean socks.
Your wife dropped them off before we left.

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,326
How's Galán doing?

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,801
All right.

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,362
I wish he didn't focus so much
on extradition of narcos.

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,245
There are other things to mention.

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,004
Galán's got some balls.

40
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,688
Brave men have a way of dying quickly.

41
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,643
Well, then, you don't have to worry...
do you?

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,051
Aah...

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,251
Pass me the socks.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,808
First thing
is that we get you out of Bogotá.

45
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,281
- OK.
- There's an orphanage in Cumaral.

46
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,443
It's out of the guerrilla zone
and away from the narcos.

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,891
And then what?

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,371
We get you a passport.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,210
From another country, we can depose you
about Escobar and the siege.

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,001
You may have run away from your country,
but I'm not running away from mine.

51
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,288
This is about keeping you alive.

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,081
Do you sleep with all your informants?

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,009
I'm not your responsibility.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,571
If Pablo Escobar finds you...
he'll kill you in a heartbeat.

55
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,569
Not if I kill him first.

56
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,483
Yeah, she's a live hand grenade.

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,609
She's the only witness we got that
can tie Escobar to the palace massacre.

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,126
Hard to bring her in when
she gets turned over to the Colombians

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,601
and she gets disappeared.
Are you ready for that?

60
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,920
No.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,764
So what's our options,
since we have none?

62
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,723
Well, we keep her in hiding
until things cool down,

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,763
and get her immunity
in exchange for her testimony...

64
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,127
Are you gonna get us immunity?

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,726
We are going to jail
if we get caught with this woman.

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,644
Well, the next time your wife decides
to bring home a human hand grenade,

67
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,529
how about she hands it to you?

68
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,008
Are you fucking her?

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,844
Sleep with a communist?

70
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,888
That would be downright un-American.

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,481
Any intel to support the DEA theory

72
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,609
that Escobar is behind
the Palace of Justice siege?

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,170
No, ma'am.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,210
Agent Peña claims to have an informant
that can testify to that effect,

75
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,044
but he hasn't brought him forward.

76
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,407
In my book,
there's only two of them that know that.

77
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,882
And one of them is Elisa Alvaro,
girlfriend of Alejandro Ayala.

78
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,129
The other one is Ernesto Sobrino,

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,411
a radical priest who gave shelter
to M-19 fugitives in Los Altos comuna.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,762
Is one of these people your informant?

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,050
Ambassador, this is...
unofficial wiretap information.

82
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,447
We, uh, intercepted
a discussion between narcos.

83
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,080
What? Which narcos?

84
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,771
- Sounded like Pablo Escobar.
- We're almost certain.

85
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,241
It was, uh...
it was hard to tell.

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,687
The... connection was bad.
They were calling from Panama.

87
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,604
- Panama?
- They know Galán's gonna win

88
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,648
and they know
that he'll support extradition,

89
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,564
and they're not gonna sit around
and await being sent back to the US.

90
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,122
Ambassador, word is Manuel Noriega
is providing safe harbor for the narcos,

91
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,931
and possibly shipping points
for their cocaine.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,162
They're moving
their drug operations to Panama?

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,811
That's horseshit, Peña.
Excuse me, Ambassador.

94
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,726
On one hand, you're saying Escobar's
in bed with left-wing communists.

95
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,007
Now you're saying
he's in bed with Manuel Noriega.

96
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,604
You can't have it both ways, son.

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,322
Ambassador, Manuel Noriega has helped us
fight communism all over Latin America

98
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,561
for the last two decades.

99
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,964
I take great offense at any attempt
by the DEA to smear his good name.

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,370
I couldn't help but laugh.

101
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,443
Right wing, left wing...

102
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,002
For Manuel Noriega,
it was all about the money.

103
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,606
When Bush was head of the CIA,
Noriega pretended to be a commie hater

104
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,607
so the US would ignore the fact that he
was heavily involved as a drug trafficker.

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,441
When Noriega realized he could
make even more money shipping his drugs

106
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,008
by siding with communists,
he switched teams.

107
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,165
So, we invaded Panama,
and arrested "Old Pineapple Face."

108
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,844
But, that was later.

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,005
For now, the trusted friend and ally
was a right-wing CIA asset

110
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,448
who was taking money from Bush...
and right from the narcos.

111
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,169
Pablo had knocked off half the Colombian
Supreme Court to fight extradition.

112
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,084
And now, he was offering
to pay off Colombia's national debt

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,366
in exchange for a truce.

114
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,324
Guess he missed home.

115
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,846
Look at this
shit. We are spending millions of dollars,

116
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,244
and can't even get a decent meal anywhere.

117
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,850
Listen, the problem isn't the food,
the problem is Noriega.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,402
First chance he gets,
he'll sell us to the Americans.

119
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,811
You guys stay calm.

120
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,924
Once we reach an agreement with the
government, we'll be back in our homeland.

121
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,762
Pay the Colombian
national debt for amnesty?

122
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,807
I'd rather go live in Spain.

123
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,329
I say we go back and fight.

124
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,609
No, sir, none of that.
War is bad for business.

125
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,967
We will negotiate with them
as Pablo agreed.

126
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,725
Look, Gustavo,
none of this would've happened

127
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,848
if he hadn't started
killing politicians and judges.

128
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,287
Tell me what we are supposed to do, then.

129
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,523
Do you want to sit here
and cry over spilled milk?

130
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,326
You know something, Pablo?

131
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,650
Sometimes, I think you kill these men
because they won't let you in their club.

132
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,565
You better watch your mouth, asshole.

133
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,964
The Colombian government
has refused our amnesty offer.

134
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,325
Get used to the food, gentlemen.

135
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,283
It's not safe to go back home.

136
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,280
They've rejected our amnesty deal.

137
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,529
We may have to stay.

138
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,724
I hate this place.

139
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,047
We can go someplace else.

140
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,522
I hear Switzerland is very beautiful.

141
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,967
In Switzerland,
we are nobody, Pablo.

142
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,442
What good is having all the money
in the world if you can't go home?

143
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,529
If we go back...
I'm going to have to fight.

144
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,246
Do whatever is necessary,
my love.

145
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,048
So, there it was.

146
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,406
The decision that would
change Colombia forever.

147
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,761
You're way ahead in the polls.

148
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,929
In my opinion,
the outcome is decided.

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,243
My question is... why do you
keep getting involved with the narcos?

150
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,409
I want a country at peace.

151
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,169
And if I don't do it, who will?

152
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,690
You're backing them into a corner.

153
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,963
I'm wearing a vest.

154
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,122
I'm afraid that a bulletproof vest...

155
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,602
isn't enough to ensure
that you have a future.

156
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,322
Don't worry, my friend.
There will be a future.

157
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,248
Luis Carlos Galán
took the stage in Soacha on August 18th,

158
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,086
against the advice
of his campaign manager, César Gaviria.

159
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,084
The bullets entered just below
his vest and he was dead within minutes.

160
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,164
For a brief shining moment,
there was hope...

161
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,726
extinguished by the pull
of an assassin's trigger.

162
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,204
To mourn Galán's death, every hut in the
countryside lit a candle in remembrance...

163
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,330
and in the cities, thousands took
to the streets in a march of the silent,

164
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,927
a mute protest
against the violence of the narcos.

165
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,049
With Galán's murder... came the end
of hope for a peaceful future.

166
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,729
Let's speak clearly, brother.

167
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,644
Galán's dead.

168
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,369
You had him killed, didn't you?

169
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,721
You didn't tell us shit,
and you killed him, you son of a bitch.

170
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,531
- I want to go home, Fabio.
- Home?

171
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,160
Why are we going home?
So they can capture us?

172
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,403
All this shit you talk about partnership,
and then you do this on your own? Huh?

173
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,211
Galán was the only threat.

174
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,009
There is no one left to challenge us.

175
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,570
And you know why, Fabio.

176
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,569
Because no one
has the balls that we have.

177
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,481
Going home.

178
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,249
Pablo was right.

179
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,005
Who would have the balls
to fill Galán's shoes?

180
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,486
...that unique honesty.

181
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,684
As the people now rise
and call for justice,

182
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,771
I pray to God
that this sacrifice will serve at last...

183
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,722
as motivation for society
to react and bond...

184
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,125
to support the government...
and institutions...

185
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,888
while also demanding
a more effective leadership,

186
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,965
one undeterred by the hitmen,
the hijackings,

187
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,607
or any other manifestations of violence.

188
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,763
My father, Luis Carlos Galán,

189
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,127
will be remembered
for awakening the Colombian people

190
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,329
to the danger of the narcos.

191
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,529
The assassin's bullets...
will not stop what my father began.

192
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,644
As he fell,
another rises in his place.

193
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,606
I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...

194
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,690
in the name of the people of Colombia,
and my family...

195
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,407
that we entrust my father's ideals to him,
and that he can count on our support...

196
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,650
to become the president
Colombia wants and needs.

197
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,161
Dr. César Gaviria, save Colombia!

198
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,562
Gaviria! Gaviria! Gaviria!

199
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,801
Dr. César Gaviria...
the new hope of Colombia.

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,891
If he took Galán's position on
extradition, the narcos would declare war.

201
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,761
If he didn't,
the country would become a narco state.

202
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,171
Phone!

203
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,441
Let it go to the answering machine.

204
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,523
The machine's full.

205
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,807
I wish it would stop ringing.

206
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,327
It's your friends.
They're calling to offer support.

207
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,408
Or opinions about what I should do.

208
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,846
Why can't you run
without backing extradition?

209
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,969
- I wrote those speeches.
- Yes...

210
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,730
but do you even believe in them?

211
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,323
I don't know what I believe.

212
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,731
I don't want the narcos having free reign.

213
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,967
But I don't want the United States
involved in our affairs.

214
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,764
So say nothing.

215
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,881
That's the best way to stay alive.

216
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,406
Gentlemen.

217
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,801
Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink.

218
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,769
We're going home!

219
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,126
- How are you? Hm?
- Fine, my love.

220
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,610
What about you?

221
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,727
Give me one.

222
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,240
Margarita, right?

223
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,281
Let's see.

224
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,442
- Son of a bitch, that's good.
- Right?

225
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,326
Thank you.
Listen, I've got a question for you.

226
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,647
Why are we going back?

227
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,006
We're walking into a world of shit.

228
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,243
Relax, brother.

229
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,803
Spain's too far away
to protect our interests.

230
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,407
We have a better chance
of influencing Pablo at home.

231
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,771
We need to be close by.
Relax.

232
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,002
Don't you get it?

233
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,242
He's only comfortable at war.

234
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,761
He's taking us to the slaughter.

235
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,445
How's business?

236
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,084
Fucking Noriega is charging us a fortune,
but we got 175 tons to Miami.

237
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,441
Gacha's Mexican routes
are opening up Los Angeles.

238
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,089
But do you know what matters most
for our business, Pablo?

239
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,006
That the situation at home stays calm.
Know what I mean?

240
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,320
Sure.

241
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,885
You should have
consulted with me about Galán.

242
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,124
You would have tried to talk me out of it.

243
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,565
Yes.

244
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,251
I would have tried.

245
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,969
The amount of money we are losing
is because of that bullshit.

246
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,971
Are you listening?

247
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,208
Look at those peaks, Gustavo.

248
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,165
I'll die...
before I ever leave Colombia again.

249
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,324
What's happening, Carrillo?

250
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,686
Thank you for coming.

251
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,444
I understand the narcos
are back from Panama.

252
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,329
So you practice your English with me?

253
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,926
Because these men
aren't cleared, and if we speak Spanish,

254
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,411
it could get back to Pablo.

255
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,210
So I started this to monitor
Pablo's sicarios' communications.

256
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,886
SAT phones, landlines, you name it.

257
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,291
I've got dozens of wiretaps,

258
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,330
but I've only managed to seize
about ten kilos in the last month.

259
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,563
Probably because I've listened
to my own men tipping the narcos off.

260
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,051
So I've had to start surveilling them.

261
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,611
I listen to them
tell their girlfriends they're afraid...

262
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,286
cry to their mothers
when one of our men gets shot down.

263
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,683
But every once in a while...
l hear them trade secrets with Pablo.

264
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,088
Do your bosses know you're doing this?

265
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,365
I trust them even less.

266
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,004
Most of my men are from here,

267
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,368
where they can get to your mother,
your aunt, your cousin.

268
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,848
How do I fight... when my soldiers
are already working for Escobar?

269
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,368
Well, do they have to be from Medellín?

270
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,765
Yes.

271
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,922
I definitely like the red one best.

272
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,161
- Really?
- Mm.

273
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,685
I prefer the gray.

274
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,450
Red is the color of the party,

275
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,320
and it makes you more...
sociable and close to the people.

276
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,483
- That's important.
- Mm.

277
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,806
I wonder what Luis Carlos
would have chosen?

278
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,729
You know, we should
also hire an image consultant.

279
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,522
We have to make you more appealing
to the youth, give you a more modern look.

280
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,643
Now you are going to give me image advice?

281
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,563
I'm just thinking about the polls.

282
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,571
Anyway...

283
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,401
Galán had professionals at his side,
but which could he trust?

284
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,289
Hm?

285
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,728
And you know perfectly well
that you can trust me, right?

286
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,290
Mm-hm.

287
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,090
Well, what are you going to choose,
red or gray?

288
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,610
Luis Carlos said something to me
before he died.

289
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,005
"There will be a future."

290
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,721
Now let's see what kind of future it is.

291
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,408
We worked together in the ministry.

292
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,881
The idea that
he's a presidential candidate

293
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,281
shows you our sad state of affairs.

294
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,842
I need to know which side he is on.

295
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,004
He speaks with
the Foreign Press next week.

296
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,048
They'll certainly ask his position.

297
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,805
Don't worry, Pablo.
He'll be easy to influence.

298
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,331
- No, I disagree.
- Why?

299
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,206
I did an interview with him once,
when he was an economic advisor.

300
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,807
I found him sitting in the parking lot
in his beat-up Renault,

301
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,330
eating a bag of apples...
and reading economic reform textbooks.

302
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,211
He was testifying to the cabinet
and wanted to be ready.

303
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,648
He's a bookworm, not a leader.

304
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,007
- No... No...
- No, no, no, you're missing my point.

305
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,048
- No.
- He's not an oligarch.

306
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,123
He's from modest circumstances.

307
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,163
Like you,
he's worked for everything he has.

308
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,607
You have to be careful
with people like that.

309
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,042
I want you to deliver a message.

310
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,482
We've made a lot of money.

311
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,044
What we have to decide is do we stick
with Pablo... or chart our own course?

312
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,327
We should talk to our friends down south.

313
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,003
No, no. It's not time. No. Mm?

314
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,885
Whatever you say.

315
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,564
Have you seen Marina?

316
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,244
She told me she was
going to buy a new brush.

317
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,051
You know your sister.

318
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,449
Her shopping expeditions take weeks.

319
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,201
You have no idea how much
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.

320
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,611
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

321
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,127
I could tell that you really wanted to.

322
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,726
- Come here, baby.
- You are very patient.

323
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,086
Yes, of course.

324
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,044
All your people were there,
your brothers...

325
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,285
My brothers are driving me crazy.

326
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,366
- You know what?
- What?

327
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,886
They can go fuck themselves.

328
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,321
If they want to,
they can go live in Spain...

329
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,244
...but you're staying here with me.

330
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,450
Let's not hide anymore.

331
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,481
Not anymore.

332
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,806
All right.

333
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,326
What do we do about my wife?

334
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,569
Ask Pablo to do us a favor.

335
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,202
Just like he took care of Galán,
he can take care of your wife.

336
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,965
You...

337
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,565
are very evil for such a young girl.

338
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,971
You've moved up, Fernando.

339
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:40,010
From government minister
to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.

340
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,120
I guess the pay is much better.

341
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,809
I'm not doing this for the money.

342
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,448
What country sends its own citizens
to an iron tomb in the United States?

343
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,010
I understand your dilemma.

344
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,962
Speak out in favor, you're seen as a US
puppet and you might not win the election.

345
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,482
Speak out against,
you anger the US...

346
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,524
and are criticized by our media
as a shill of the narcos.

347
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,127
César, I was thinking I would love
to dedicate a program for your campaign.

348
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,046
It would be an honor for me,
and would benefit us both.

349
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,491
What a great idea.

350
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,005
You guys are really shameless,
aren't you?

351
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,960
- How do you sleep at night?
- César, it doesn't have to be this way.

352
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,886
If Luis had been as smart as you,

353
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,088
perhaps we could have avoided
this horrible tragedy.

354
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,011
We could have had peace.

355
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,440
Easy.

356
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,601
Get out.

357
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,649
Read Pablo's letter.

358
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,888
Maybe you will have a future.

359
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,562
They just picked up
that commie priest, Father Sobrino.

360
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,531
He's gonna talk. And when he does,
I hope you DEA boys understand

361
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,250
what's important in this hemisphere.

362
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,766
Well, how about you, uh...
clue us in?

363
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,367
Drug dealers, I mean, bad as they are,
they want your money.

364
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,491
Communists want everything.

365
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,001
I don't know about you, Peña, but l...
I like to own shit.

366
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,440
Right.

367
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,126
Good talk, Lou.

368
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,204
- Very, uh... enlightening.
- Yeah.

369
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,361
Oh...

370
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,370
This... priest?

371
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,727
If it comes out that he was your informant
and you protected him...

372
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,524
I'm gonna make sure
you're tried for treason.

373
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,162
Peña had to figure out
how to get fake papers for Elisa.

374
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,043
So he did what he does best.

375
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,250
Let me guess: it's a very
sad and complicated situation

376
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,845
involving you and a beautiful local.

377
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,686
You got your nails done.
It's... It's your color, Colleen.

378
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,485
- What do you want, Javier?
- It's simple.

379
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,040
I just need your signature...
right there.

380
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,527
You want me to create an embassy ID?

381
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,409
- Who is this woman?
- What I want you to do

382
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,450
is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy
and help someone stay alive.

383
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,770
You really think I'd be asking you
if it wasn't important?

384
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,569
She's my informant.

385
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,041
And she could be the key to bringing down
the whole Medellín cartel,

386
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,248
so come on, Colleen,
whose side are you on?

387
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,563
Cousin, what happened?

388
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,971
Where were you?

389
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,724
- In the office.
- In the office?

390
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,966
Yes.

391
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,564
Is that where you were?

392
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,330
That's weird...

393
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,648
because I called
and they said you hadn't been in all day.

394
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,606
I don't know which office you called,
but I was there.

395
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,160
They're seizing everything, Pablo.
All the accounts...

396
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,811
We knew there would
be a reaction with Galán, right?

397
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,889
Yeah.

398
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,849
Relax, Gustavo.

399
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,130
Relax, because everything
will calm down later.

400
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,924
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna kill us both?

401
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,129
- You afraid to die?
- No. Are you?

402
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,880
- Put it out.
- Where were you?

403
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,809
Put it out, Pablo.

404
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,765
Put it out, Pablo!

405
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,006
Are you with me or what?

406
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,689
And when have I not been with you?

407
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,690
From the beginning,
it has been you and me.

408
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,131
I cannot do this without you.

409
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,926
Are you doubting my loyalty, Pablo?

410
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,131
No.

411
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,841
But I'm having serious doubts
about the Ochoas.

412
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,000
Gaviria read Pablo's letter.

413
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,008
The terms were simple.

414
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,966
He promised peace
if the narcos were left alone...

415
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,006
and if not...
he promised all-out war.

416
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,482
Carrillo with his wiretaps
knew a storm was on the horizon.

417
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,489
Pablo became his duty
and his obsession.

418
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,566
He came to recognize Pablo's voice,

419
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,564
his sleep patterns,
what he liked to eat,

420
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,167
his tastes in art,
his love of silk sheets,

421
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,730
and his favorite music.

422
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,164
He would die
for the love of his wife

423
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,730
when you'd hear him over the airwaves.

424
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,402
But did she know
how easily he ordered his men to kill?

425
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,206
He came to understand
that Pablo spoke in code.

426
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,725
Time to thin the herd.

427
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,122
"Cattle" were judges
or politicians who supported extradition.

428
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,129
But did we score a goal?

429
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,123
The reporter, right.

430
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,761
Let's make sure
we score a goal on him as well.

431
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,968
A "goal" was a targeted assassination.

432
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,921
Come on, come on.

433
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,480
If you spoke out against him,
you were dead.

434
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,728
- The list grew by the week.
- Ooh!

435
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,007
Guillermo Cano, editor of El Espectador,

436
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,481
and his reporter, Luis Camacho.

437
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,927
Jaime Rodriguez, the former head
of the anti-drug squad before Carrillo.

438
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,480
The drumbeat went on and on.

439
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,291
For Carrillo,
the war had already started.

440
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,283
But he just couldn't trust his army.

441
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,807
You are aware
that I can end your military career?

442
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,649
- I don't give a fuck.
- Excuse me?

443
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,644
Horacio... don't give up.

444
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,206
You've always been the leader
of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.

445
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,408
Is this how you show your appreciation
for all we've done?

446
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,528
This operation
could be a failure before it starts.

447
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,927
I'm not here for fun.

448
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,650
What's gonna happen
is the defense minister

449
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,122
will give you credit for the evidence
that we found at Hacienda Nápoles.

450
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,250
So... then if you resign,
I will look really bad.

451
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,488
Is that what you're doing?
Is that what you want?

452
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,688
Horacio...
you remember when were cadets,

453
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,482
we never thought they would call us
to lead the country's most important unit.

454
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,403
Horacio, as your friend...
I'm asking you to think about it.

455
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,051
Rodrigo, I don't even know who Pablo pays.

456
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,410
It could be any of us three.

457
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,165
- Horacio, please.
- I've put my family at risk.

458
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,801
If there is going to be a war,
I need the right tools.

459
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,770
All right.

460
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,080
Perfect.

461
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,762
Then tell me what you need.
Hm?

462
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,648
Incorruptible men.

463
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,571
And that's how the Search Bloc came to be.

464
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,691
But Carrillo
wasn't the only one recruiting soldiers.

465
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,884
Hey, punk.
Are you all right?

466
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,042
- Sure.
- Come here.

467
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,883
La Quica and Poison
had kids deliver packages.

468
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,530
And if they didn't look inside,

469
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,361
it meant they could be trusted
to deliver anything from cocaine to...

470
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,721
well, anything else.

471
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,964
How are you, son?

472
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,562
- How are you?
- Good.

473
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,567
I have to kill that son of a bitch.

474
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,882
Carrillo's a cop.
You can always buy a cop with money.

475
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,442
- I've tried, believe me.
- Then offer more.

476
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,006
Or I can loan you Navegante.
He will do whatever I ask.

477
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,090
That's true.

478
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:00,371
It's silver or lead.
That's the choice for that bastard.

479
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,446
Speaking of lead,
I'm getting a shipment of weapons in.

480
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,363
Uzis, grenades...

481
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,402
If I could find a nuclear weapon...
But now I'm negotiating a fucking missile.

482
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,563
- A missile? No fucking way.
- Yes.

483
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,926
- Boss.
- Eh?

484
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,447
This is crack cocaine,
seized a few days ago

485
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,682
by drug enforcement agents,

486
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,969
in a park just across the street
from the White House.

487
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,443
And our message
to the drug cartels is this:

488
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,165
the rules have changed.

489
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,527
He's bullshitting, right?

490
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,924
He's smoking that shit.
I guarantee it.

491
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,721
Motherfucker.

492
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,882
Mm...

493
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,882
Mrs. Quiroga told me
the neighbors on the block took a vote.

494
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,246
They want us to move.

495
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,849
But we have guards stationed
outside the house 24 hours a day.

496
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,490
That's what scares them.

497
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,525
Come here.

498
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,011
It won't always be like this,
my love.

499
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,490
- Rodrigo.
- Hello, Horacio.

500
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,483
- Everything OK?
- May I speak with you?

501
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,130
Yes, sure. Come in, come in.

502
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,729
Let's talk about the incorruptibles.

503
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,891
I'm listening.

504
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,290
I've been instructed to tell you that
if you cease and desist your operations,

505
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,887
you will receive
a one-time payment of six million.

506
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,731
Horacio... that's US dollars,
not pesos.

507
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,124
Instructed by whom?

508
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,003
I think you can guess.

509
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,361
Say the name.

510
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,170
You know who.

511
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,840
Say the name, Rodrigo.

512
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,806
Escobar.

513
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,445
Don't look at me like that, Horacio.
I've always cared for you.

514
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,923
I'm making this suggestion to save
you and your family from terrible grief.

515
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,402
This man has tentacles.

516
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,324
I'm surprised
he hasn't killed you already.

517
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,366
Get out.

518
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,250
Horacio, please...

519
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,886
Horacio...

520
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,880
Take care.

521
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,122
I was driving to the church.

522
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,965
Was with my buddy, John.
He was my best man.

523
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,050
We were late.

524
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,169
It was fucking blazing outside,
110 degrees.

525
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,449
Whole bridal party was there
sweating their balls off, I'm sure.

526
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,288
And all of a sudden, I stopped the car.

527
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,408
Please don't tell me
you left her at the altar.

528
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,209
I don't know if she actually
made it to the altar.

529
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,444
Well, you saved her
a lifetime of hell.

530
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,206
Yeah, she forgave me. Eventually.

531
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,807
- Married a stockbroker from Dallas.
- Hm.

532
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,770
Randy... I think.

533
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,407
Trust me, she's better off.

534
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,884
What if Father Sobrino talks?

535
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,285
He's gonna talk.

536
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,641
It's about time, Navegante.

537
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,011
Sorry I'm late. I couldn't came before.

538
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,085
What do you got?

539
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,528
Gacha's going tonight to Cartagena.

540
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,889
I can help you get him.

541
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,566
You said you had information.
You didn't say Gacha.

542
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,089
I guess is your lucky day.

543
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,846
- What's the informant's motivation?
- Could be money.

544
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,368
The reward for Gacha is one million US.
I'd say that's pretty good motivation.

545
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,284
He spends his life on the run
if we don't catch him.

546
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,284
- Something else going on with this guy.
- It's worth taking a risk.

547
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,724
Peña, you go to Cartagena.
Solely in an observational capacity.

548
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,441
We want this man captured alive,
if possible.

549
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,851
Murphy stays here in Bogotá.

550
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,327
Gaviria's press conference is tonight,

551
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,246
and I wanna be sure whatever
he plans to say, he gets to say it.

552
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,005
Yes, ma'am.

553
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,367
That's a beautiful dress,
Ambassador Noonan.

554
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,524
Come on, Father. Ah, yeah. Talk!

555
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,205
Huh?

556
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,168
Huh?

557
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,443
More? You want more?

558
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,888
No! No more, please! No more!

559
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,088
No more!

560
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,687
Ah, he's all yours.
He's ready to talk.

561
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,801
Father...

562
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,210
how did Elisa Alvaro get away?

563
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,686
She left with the American woman.

564
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,764
Murphy's wife.

565
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,322
I just don't understand.
How'd you get involved with communists?

566
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,402
Have you actually met a communist?

567
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,887
Yeah, I have, actually...
and she lied to me.

568
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,803
Well, I'm not a communist, Connie.

569
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,447
I'm fighting against poverty,
corruption, injustice and greed.

570
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,120
But I guess Americans
don't have the same problem.

571
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,526
Don't we?

572
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,125
It's not the same.

573
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,481
Look, I just wish
you'd been straight with me.

574
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,206
I'm sorry.

575
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,245
Perhaps I should go.

576
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,246
You can't just go.
Look, if they find you, they'll kill you.

577
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,243
I fell in love with a man...
with a good man.

578
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,926
And I was hoping
to do something good.

579
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,927
But instead, I fell into something...
else, something more violent.

580
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,848
Yeah, that makes two of us.

581
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,206
I'll see you when I get home.

582
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,968
Here, Elisa's ID.

583
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,169
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Take her to Cumaral.

584
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,730
My contact there agreed to hide her.

585
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,245
While you go to Cartagena?

586
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,448
I can't believe this shit.

587
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,251
- Who made this?
- Brother, what do you suggest we do?

588
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,765
Jump out of a window?

589
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,526
Look, she's...

590
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,046
- She's important.
- To who?

591
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,286
To us.

592
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,488
I take care of Elisa...
you better fucking get Gacha.

593
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,882
Finally, a romantic date.

594
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,530
It's been a long time
since we've been alone.

595
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,130
Mm. Just you, me...
and our bodyguard.

596
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,761
Like the old days when we were young
and your father watched us.

597
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,322
- Mm. My father adored you.
- Yeah, right.

598
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,328
Garcia...

599
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,881
Hello? Yes.

600
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,520
Yes.

601
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,890
But he's all right?

602
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,211
All right.

603
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,569
Ana?

604
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,727
Ana?

605
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,206
Ana?

606
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,601
Ana!

607
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,084
A little bird... came into the house.

608
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,764
I'm helping it out.

609
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,201
What?

610
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,568
There was an assassination attempt...

611
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,086
on Colonel Carrillo.

612
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,491
Did someone die?

613
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,081
One of his men.

614
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,441
It must be terrible,

615
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,727
the position you're in.

616
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,128
I want you to know
I think you are very brave.

617
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,681
I'm not brave. Not like Galán.

618
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,002
That fear keeps you alive.

619
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,131
That's what none of them understand.

620
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,521
I will support any decision you make.

621
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,720
It's been said that nothing gives
the fearful more courage...

622
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,648
than another's fear.

623
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,291
Luis Carlos Galán
had made a decision that cost his life.

624
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,204
And now, it was Gaviria's turn.

625
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,324
Welcome, American press.

626
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,404
Tonight, I have the great pleasure

627
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,486
of introducing candidate César Gaviria.

628
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,405
It has long been
our government's policy...

629
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:10,046
to deal with every man equally...
in the eyes of the law.

630
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,406
So...

631
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,450
Colombians say...

632
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,886
God made our land so beautiful...

633
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,486
it was unfair to the rest of the world.

634
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,369
So to even the score...

635
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,444
God populated the land...
with a race of evil men.

636
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,890
The primary impediment
to a free and uninhibited future

637
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:08,928
is the violence and terror
that currently grips our beloved country.

638
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,082
A violence initiated by these evil men...

639
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,601
will be brought to justice...

640
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,208
in the name of decency...

641
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,286
and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.

642
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,926
We will extradite.

643
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,168
This decision...
will not come from fear.

644
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,086
It has come from a clarity of judgment...

645
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,971
free from the cloud of terror
that surrounds us

646
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,530
and obscures our view.

647
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,648
I can say only one thing to Colombians
in these times of peril:

648
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,691
There will be a future.

649
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,724
Thank you.

650
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,440
Hello?

651
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,881
You think you're hot shit?

652
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,327
You should change your satellite phone.

653
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,645
Who is this?

654
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,281
Your mother's in Rionegro
with that tub of lard you call your son.

655
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,728
And your wife was at Carrera 11 today,
shopping for clothes.

656
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,849
You bastard son of a bitch,
you think that...

657
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,764
What, you think because you're a cop
I'm afraid of you or something?

658
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,128
You know where my family is, fag,
well, I know where yours is, too.

659
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,202
- Don't forget that.
- Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.

660
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,442
Why don't you take money
like everyone else?

661
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,285
I could have had you living like a king.
But now, guess what?

662
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:40,810
Time to kill your dad, your mom,
your kids, your entire family,

663
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,087
and you should be smart enough to realize

664
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,688
I have each and every one of them
under watch, you fucking bastard.

665
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,240
Not everyone's for sale, Pablo.

666
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,164
You just keep hiding,
and I will find you.

667
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,651
Don't know when...

668
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,649
but I will find you.

669
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,090
And when I find you...

670
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,889
- I'm going to kill you.
- I'm going to kill you

671
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,406
and your entire family,
you son of a bitch!

672
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,882
It's war, then.

673
00:53:27,906 --> 00:53:29,906
