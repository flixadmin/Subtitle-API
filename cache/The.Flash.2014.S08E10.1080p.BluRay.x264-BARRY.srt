1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,760
Deon, what's happening to me?

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,970
The temporal mutations
I've been tracking?

3
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,806
It turns out every one of them
leads to you.

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,327
I know I've been treating
your time sickness

5
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,436
like it's a virus
that's giving you symptoms.

6
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:19,896
The gaps in time.

7
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:23,858
And now I've been noticing that things

8
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,528
are there one minute
and they're gone the next.

9
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:29,864
There's something about you that's
causing time to fracture around you.

10
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,867
Iris, this isn't a virus
that you have.

11
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,328
Whatever this time sickness is...

12
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:36,746
It's coming from me.

13
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:49,424
What is it?

14
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,679
What's wrong?

15
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:10,569
How do you feel right now?

16
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,575
Well, I mean, that's what's so weird.
I feel fine.

17
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,848
And this is all because of what happened
in the other timeline?

18
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:18,996
Yeah.

19
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,843
I should've never reversed
your treatments.

20
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,709
No, it's not your fault, Deon,

21
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,420
I asked you to do it,
and it was the right thing to do.

22
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,716
There was no other way to prove Barry's
innocence and to save my dad's life.

23
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:34,262
But these anomalies you're experiencing,
I mean, who knows what's next?

24
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,270
- Well, we have to find a cure.
- And we will.

25
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,070
Right now, we've got to
get you stabilized.

26
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,894
I'm sorry,
but you gotta stay put.

27
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,232
Well, I mean, there are worse places
to hang out.

28
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,277
How long do I have to stay?

29
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:53,406
Well, considering the universe
is like a zillion light years large,

30
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,784
I'd say staying put is a relative thing
when it comes to Earthly movement.

31
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,579
So I'm thinking that if you confine
your movements

32
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,999
to Coast City for a while,
it should lessen the risk.

33
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,376
Or at least I hope so.

34
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,338
Good, because there's still
someone here that needs my help.

35
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,632
What if she has another episode?

36
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:12,860
Well, I'll have to do something
a little more radical this time

37
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:13,884
to patch you up.

38
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,679
Look, I won't lie to you guys.

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,430
This is gonna hurt.

40
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,490
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

41
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,053
I'll be back as soon as I can.

42
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,118
Iris, if you have any blackouts

43
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,287
or anything weird happens,
you let me know ASAP.

44
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,549
Okay, I'm gonna go grab
a few of my things from home.

45
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,009
I'll be back in a few seconds.

46
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,511
No, no. Barry, you can't.

47
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,323
I mean, remember what you said
about that black fire.

48
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,492
There are people that are still
in danger. You have to stop it.

49
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:03,434
But I can't just leave you here alone.

50
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,228
I'm not. I mean, Sue will be back soon,

51
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,647
and besides, I mean,
I have work to do, too.

52
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,234
Your world is falling apart

53
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,357
and you're still worried about
helping other people.

54
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,865
You just call me if you need anything.

55
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,159
- I will.
- Okay.

56
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,692
Now that is what you call art.

57
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,077
Since when do I sweat?

58
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,431
What the hell?

59
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,939
Is Iris okay?

60
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:35,651
Yeah. I mean, you know,
as well as she can be.

61
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:38,321
Well, Barry,
are you sure you don't wanna...

62
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,824
I mean, Team Flash can hold down
the fort, if you need to be with her.

63
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,785
No, thanks. Iris is right.

64
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,578
I mean, as long as she's stable,

65
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,247
keeping everyone safe
in Central City is the priority.

66
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,083
Joe, Cecile, you guys found anything?

67
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:55,546
Uh, well, besides all suffering
recent personal losses, no.

68
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,049
None of our fire victims
had anything in common.

69
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,802
Yeah, Barr, I triple checked
the victims' files.

70
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:06,015
Stan Mullens, Donna Winters,
that yoga instructor, Parker DeStefano.

71
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,518
At first, we thought
all these freaky flames

72
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,841
are feeding on people
who recently mourned, like Mullens.

73
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:14,065
Then it attacked me
and my dad died when I was a kid.

74
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,733
Which doesn't follow the pattern.

75
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:18,069
Maybe it's looking for people
who don't face their grief.

76
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,320
No, I don't think so.

77
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,448
DeStefano had completed grief counseling
after her fiancé died,

78
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,784
and she was already seeing somebody new.

79
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,911
Well, I've assigned Vanya and Aariz

80
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,830
to dig into the backgrounds
of our victims,

81
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:30,373
for secondary similarities.

82
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,488
You sound just like Iris.
No wonder she put you in charge.

83
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:38,005
Speaking of similarities,
Kramer pulled files

84
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:42,260
for every suspicious fire-related crimes
since the particle accelerator exploded.

85
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,012
So, me and Cecile have to
go through all of it.

86
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:48,516
And there's a ton.
So are you ready, babe?

87
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,599
Mm.

88
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:50,976
Later.

89
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,112
What's an SR37 alert?

90
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,864
Someone just entered the Med Lab.

91
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,616
What? Is Caitlin back from
her wine country tour with Marcus?

92
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,742
No, not yet.

93
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,118
Stay here.

94
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,880
Hey. Any idea where
Caity keeps the bandages?

95
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,424
It seems more like a "top shelf"
kinda thing, if you ask me.

96
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,259
- What happened to your arm?
- Oh.

97
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:26,512
Our freaking fire attacked me
at the apartment.

98
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:31,100
And before you ask,
no, I don't know why it didn't kill me.

99
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,268
- Were you...
- Grieving?

100
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,646
Nope. I was perfectly happy
working on a new piece.

101
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,748
Could be the best thing I've ever done.

102
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,901
But that does not explain

103
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:42,403
why our Sentient Smokey Joe
would attack me,

104
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,197
and only leave me with this.

105
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:47,575
Frost, come here. Let me help. Ow.

106
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:49,326
Ah.

107
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,412
You make a good Caity-substitute.

108
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:56,042
Maybe it's like Joe says,
there's got to be something more.

109
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,462
- It's after something we're missing.
- Something I have?

110
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,881
I don't know.

111
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:07,595
But, I mean, this fire attacked
you and me here at S.T.A.R. Labs.

112
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,557
And then follows you home
less than 24 hours later?

113
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:14,644
That can't be a coincidence.

114
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:19,857
So if we can figure out why the flames
think I'd be a tasty snack...

115
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,541
Maybe that could tell us how to stop it.

116
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:26,989
Frost, um, if it's okay, I'd like to
search your apartment top to bottom,

117
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:29,301
see if there's any clues as to why
the fire is targeting you.

118
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,325
Go for it.

119
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:31,785
Okay.

120
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,192
Frost. Been a while
since we caught up. What's wrong?

121
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:48,678
It's about Team Flash's new case,
and this one's a little creepy.

122
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:52,098
Over the last few weeks,
three bodies have turned up,

123
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,058
all of them burnt to a crisp.

124
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,977
So this is an arson case?

125
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,268
Mm...

126
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,479
More like a ghost story.

127
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,440
The fires that did the damage
were black.

128
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:04,110
And so cold that they burn the victims

129
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,487
like frostbite,
only 1,000 times more lethal.

130
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,615
And you need my help to figure out
what's causing this phenomenon?

131
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,741
Not exactly.

132
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,537
The flames are alive
and they are attacking people,

133
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,561
and I think they're coming after me.

134
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:21,544
My God, of course. I'll do
whatever I can to help keep you safe.

135
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,714
Actually, I need you
to do just the opposite.

136
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,969
I want you to help me catch this thing,
using me as bait.

137
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,942
You want to use yourself as bait
to capture the black fire?

138
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,361
I know how it sounds, but hear us out.

139
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:52,199
If this homicidal stuff is after me now,
why not use it to our advantage?

140
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,160
Carla, you can't actually
be considering this.

141
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,828
I wasn't at first.

142
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,749
And then Frost laid out the facts in the
case, how it's killing innocent people.

143
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,357
And now it's coming after her, too,

144
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:04,253
with flames that generate a cold
so intense it burns?

145
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:08,340
That last item is almost an exact
description of how cold fusion works.

146
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,010
But why is the fire attracted to Frost?

147
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:14,305
I believe it's because
her meta abilities are cryokinetic,

148
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,640
just like our cold fusion fire.

149
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,851
So you think it's hunting her for fuel?

150
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,311
To recharge itself?

151
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,813
Correct. So the key to catching it

152
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:25,524
is to wait until it comes
after her again and then trap it.

153
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,985
Frost, we are not using you as bait.

154
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,405
Look, this is a perfectly good plan
that could save lives.

155
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,716
Why won't you at least let us try?

156
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,909
Because this feels like a last resort.

157
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,220
Besides, there's still so much
we don't know about this fire.

158
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,498
I mean, even if we tried this,
we still have no way to capture it.

159
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,583
Cold fusion is still a fusion reaction,

160
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,752
one that occurs at
a low molecular temperature.

161
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:48,589
If we could build some kind
of fusion containment housing...

162
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,133
Then all we'd need to do
is recalibrate the unit

163
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,178
to absorb and amplify
Frost's cryokinetic signature.

164
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,931
Yes. Then, as long as Frost
is in proximity,

165
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,767
the unit can amplify
her cryokinetic signature,

166
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,437
and attract the fire,
allowing us to capture and imprison it.

167
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,526
Of course, building a unit like that
could take weeks or longer.

168
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,906
Well, not that I'm saying
we should do this at all,

169
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,535
but we kind of already have
what you're describing.

170
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,910
We do?

171
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:21,080
The Fusion Sphere from the ASF.

172
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,959
It can already handle the entire output
of the artificial Speed Force.

173
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:30,089
If Dr. Tannhauser and I recalibrate it
for a cryokinetic signature,

174
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,881
we'd be in business.

175
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,091
Great. Then it's settled.

176
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,594
Chester, you and Mom
work on the nerd stuff.

177
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,121
- Allegra, you and I...
- Wait around for you to get killed?

178
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,852
Barry, whatever this thing is,
it's coming after me no matter what.

179
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,855
So I am not going to sit around
and do nothing

180
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,065
when we have a plan to fight back.

181
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,360
Barry, it's your call.

182
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,444
Ditto that.

183
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,825
I'm sorry, but I can't support this.

184
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,829
I know we don't have
another plan right now,

185
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,914
but putting you in harm's way?

186
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,375
There's got to be another option.

187
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:13,382
I still think this could work.

188
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,968
Get started, I'll be back.

189
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,767
Look, I'm not going to change my mind.

190
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,519
Okay, fine. But just hear me out.

191
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,856
Before this, you were telling us
about Iris and her condition.

192
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,483
How she wants to help Tinya,
but Deon told her to stay put.

193
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:36,238
Do you really think
that's what she's doing right now?

194
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,780
Because if I know Iris...

195
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,659
She's gonna try and help Tinya
find her mom.

196
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:44,413
Instead of sitting in a hotel,
doing nothing and helping no one.

197
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,415
But she's not
endangering herself either.

198
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,418
But she is doing
what this whole team does best.

199
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:50,961
Helping people.

200
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,380
Despite what it could mean
for themselves.

201
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,010
Sound familiar?

202
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:03,140
Look, my mom is the world's
top specialist in cold fusion,

203
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,559
and she thinks this will work.
Chester agrees.

204
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,622
So why won't you give me the chance
to make a difference

205
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:09,688
that you're giving Iris?

206
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,443
Okay.

207
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:20,324
- But if anything goes wrong...
- You'll pull the plug. Got it.

208
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,578
Yes!

209
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,919
I finished fine-tuning the sphere to
amplify Frost's cryokinetic signature.

210
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,797
Now make sure to calibrate
the containment housing...

211
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,298
To compensate for the possibility

212
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:38,592
of a reconfiguration flip
at the subatomic level?

213
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,717
Already done.

214
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,847
Really? Well, when this is over,

215
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,433
there's a job waiting for you
at Tannhauser Labs.

216
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,185
Spoiler, I pay better.

217
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,272
For real?

218
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:57,069
I mean, nah,
you know, I actually kinda like it here.

219
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,112
Suit yourself.

220
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,199
We're ready. Frost.

221
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,666
Okay. What next?

222
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,461
Chester, activate
the cold Fusion Sphere.

223
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,343
Now remember, the sphere will amplify

224
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:24,471
your cryokinetic signature,
drawing the fire near.

225
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,140
But you need to stay in the gurney

226
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,018
until the fire is pulled into
that sphere and we've trapped it.

227
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,939
Okay, so now we just wait around

228
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:36,317
for some sentient fire
to come get its dinner?

229
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:37,900
That could take forever.

230
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,487
Not if Carla is right.

231
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,240
The sphere will amplify Frost's
cryo signature exponentially.

232
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,035
Like an animal scent
getting broadcast to a larger area

233
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,245
to entice a predator and draw them in.

234
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,581
Making Frost honey on a fly trap.

235
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,168
Once it senses her, it'll pounce.
And then we've got it.

236
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:58,088
If this spooky thing is looking for fuel
instead of just grief,

237
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,174
it's the place to find it.

238
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:04,762
Frost, about what you're doing.

239
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,222
I don't know if I'd have
the strength to do the same.

240
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,809
I mean, I'm just saying
you're very brave.

241
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,435
Thanks.

242
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:17,566
Although right now, I kinda feel like
the stupid person in the horror movie

243
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,694
who runs into the house
instead of running away from it.

244
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,158
Folks, our intelligent ignition source

245
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,078
just popped back up on the grid
and it's heading here fast.

246
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,082
Somebody turned up the heat.

247
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,499
It's here.

248
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,507
It's working.

249
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,312
Why did it stop?

250
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,066
Something's not right.

251
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,444
What are you waiting for?

252
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,363
Come and get me.

253
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,366
It knows what we're planning.

254
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,082
Frost!

255
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,559
Thank goodness you're all right.

256
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:37,604
We're lucky your boss is a superhero.

257
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,567
- Is she gonna be okay?
- I am fine.

258
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,349
I thought you were on vacation.

259
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,779
I was and then Allegra called and said

260
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,156
you were using yourself as bait

261
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,950
to summon an uncontrollable fire
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

262
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,869
What the hell were you thinking?

263
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,038
That we could end this
and save folks' lives.

264
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,291
Also, your bedside manner is terrible.

265
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,126
Frost, she's right.
We're worried about you.

266
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,546
Barry says you antagonized the flames.
Was that part of your plan, too?

267
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,829
It didn't take the bait.
What else was I supposed to do?

268
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,926
Okay, what happened out there
after the Babadook Blaze went postal?

269
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,722
Once we got you back to the Med Lab,
I did a grid search of the entire city.

270
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,015
There's no sign of it.

271
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,434
We need to get back out there.

272
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,717
What we need to do is find
another way to stop this thing.

273
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,665
Frost, we know how dangerous
this thing is.

274
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,484
I mean, it's killed three people
already that we know of.

275
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,528
It came after me, again.
We can do this.

276
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,572
I hear the cold Fusion Sphere
didn't even work.

277
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,658
More precisely, we never had a chance
to see if it would work.

278
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,703
The fire hesitated,
so it didn't get close enough.

279
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,624
If only there was a way to make Frost
more attractive to the flames.

280
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,269
Sounds like something
Chester can help us with.

281
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,604
I'll have him meet us in the Speed Lab.

282
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,046
Sit down.

283
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,044
Can I have the room, please?

284
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,886
You stay.

285
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,205
I don't understand.

286
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,109
You said over the phone that you could
give me the information in person.

287
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,900
I am sorry, Mrs. West-Allen.

288
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,527
You said you'd fix this.

289
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,153
And I will.

290
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,925
Look, I've worked stories like this
before, and I've never had a problem.

291
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,743
I know. But after your call,
I checked the files in question.

292
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,958
It turns out there's
a no-contact rule in play.

293
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:22,834
Wait. You mean someone doesn't want me
to find my own birth mother?

294
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,129
Uh, who? I want to know right now.

295
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,590
Okay. Tinya, hi.

296
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,594
Why don't you just give us a few minutes
so that we can work things out?

297
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,472
Right. She's my mom, all right?
I have a right to know the truth.

298
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,392
Okay.

299
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,942
Look, is there anyone we could talk to
about overriding a no-contact order?

300
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,317
No one.

301
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,523
I mean, I'd need approval from our board
of directors for something like that.

302
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,116
Oh! Is that all?

303
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:56,367
I got this.

304
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,913
Hi, Uncle Leroy.

305
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,873
Yes, it's Sue.

306
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,417
Yeah, I'm in town for the day.

307
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,670
Yeah. I am so glad that you asked.

308
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,924
I just need a little favor
from the R.A.A. Chairman of the Board.

309
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,720
Yes, it's a no-contact order.
It's really important.

310
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,763
I'm trying to help an orphan.

311
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,517
I know, just like you.

312
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,101
It's for you.

313
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:26,856
Yes, sir.

314
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,986
Of course, no problem.

315
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:32,862
Thank you.

316
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,785
- Yeah, okay.
- Just a sec.

317
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,210
Sorry about that.

318
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,505
Oh, no problem.
You were just doing your job.

319
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,005
Thanks.

320
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,007
Thank you.

321
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,013
I need a break.

322
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,538
Okay.

323
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,916
Ready for the next step?

324
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,922
How about I go pull up the car?

325
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,976
What's wrong?
I thought this is what you wanted.

326
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,350
Um...

327
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,563
What if my mom doesn't want to meet me?

328
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:51,732
She will.

329
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,404
Iris, she gave up on me
the moment I was born.

330
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,323
So what if nothing's changed?

331
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,577
Tinya, look, when I was your age,

332
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,205
my mom wasn't in my life, either.

333
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,333
and there was so much trauma around it.

334
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,336
All the lies I had been told,
the feelings of abandonment,

335
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,337
how much it hurt.

336
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,884
And it got so bad
that when I finally had the chance

337
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,388
to reconcile with my mom,
I almost lost the opportunity.

338
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:27,352
And then someone made me realize
that reconnecting with my mom,

339
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,355
no matter how or why was a gift.

340
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:37,821
And let me tell you, I am really glad
that I listened to them.

341
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,782
Because I barely

342
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,035
got to heal my relationship
with my mother before she passed.

343
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:49,749
Um...

344
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,962
Hey, I'm really sorry.
I didn't know that.

345
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,924
No, it's okay. I'm just saying
that I almost made a mistake

346
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,385
that I would have regretted
for the rest of my life.

347
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,804
How did you do it?
I mean, where did you even start?

348
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,056
I told her I was scared.
I told her I was angry.

349
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:10,979
And also that I loved her,
even though I didn't know why.

350
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,485
And, Tinya, whatever you do,
everything is going to be okay.

351
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,086
Because you're not going to do it alone.

352
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,447
I won't let you.

353
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:28,954
Come on.

354
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,544
Frost.
Why do you keep doing this?

355
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,756
You need to stop putting your
personal safety in danger for nothing.

356
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,134
Like when you stabbed yourself
just to get Chillblaine arrested

357
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,404
- that first time.
- That turned out okay. This will, too.

358
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:44,513
You don't know that.

359
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,616
Damn it, Frost, it's like you
don't even care about yourself.

360
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,767
I'm trying to help people.

361
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,478
Right. Okay, but at some point,
you need to realize

362
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,855
that you could also get yourself killed.

363
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,592
And then you need to think, "Hmm.

364
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:56,942
Maybe I shouldn't do this," or,

365
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,003
"Hmm... Maybe I should come up
with a different plan.

366
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,862
One that doesn't get me killed."

367
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,575
And you, Mom, seriously,
how could you go along with this?

368
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,829
Frost's powers presented an opportunity
to take this thing off the streets.

369
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,919
And that's where our focus has been
ever since.

370
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,542
You put her life at risk.
You realize that, right?

371
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,835
Because she asked me to.

372
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,253
And that makes it okay?

373
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:20,048
Hey, we made a decision today
to try to protect people.

374
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,342
I would think that you
would be fine with that.

375
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,053
What I am not fine with
is losing Frost forever,

376
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,972
which is what could have happened today.

377
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,058
You used your child as bait
for a monster.

378
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,893
It's not how I see it.

379
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,020
No, you don't, because
you're looking at Frost

380
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,314
as a science experiment
instead of as your daughter.

381
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,695
Frost, please listen to me.

382
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,989
You need to learn
to value your own life.

383
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,876
Carla, you still think
that fusion globe will work?

384
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:01,715
Yes, if we can find a way
to make sure it gets closer next time.

385
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,558
Great. I'll have Chester
start working on it.

386
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,343
Frost, wait. Uh...

387
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,471
Our plan will work.

388
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,061
You better hope it does, because
right now you have two daughters.

389
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,715
But if something happens to Frost

390
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:20,025
because of something
you helped her with, you'll have none.

391
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,423
Barr, I ran into Carla Tannhauser.

392
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,301
She told me about her plan
to stop these devil flames.

393
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,471
And your objection.

394
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Yeah.

395
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,099
You want to tell me your side,

396
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,954
because I'm pretty sure I'm not
the only one that wants

397
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,413
to get these damn things off the street.

398
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,106
Look, I know why she's doing this
and she's not wrong.

399
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,709
If there's something
out there hurting people,

400
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,652
then we need to do
everything we can to stop it.

401
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,070
Right. So what's the problem?

402
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:10,575
She's found a way to use Frost's powers
to lure the black fire here

403
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,327
by boosting Frost's powers to trap it.

404
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:17,040
- And that's a bad plan because...
- It's too dangerous.

405
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,652
Frost has already been hurt once.

406
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,919
If we try this again,
something even worse could happen.

407
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,350
That's not all
you're concerned about, is it?

408
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,065
I mean, my gut told me
this was a bad idea.

409
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,011
I should have listened to it.

410
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:34,850
And now you're worried about
not being able to stop it,

411
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,643
because these things
were set in motion?

412
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,687
I'm team leader.

413
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,272
Having a plan
that keeps everybody safe is my job.

414
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,816
Only today,

415
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,319
I don't know how.
And now our only solution is

416
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,488
putting a team member's life
in jeopardy.

417
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:49,822
Hmm.

418
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,535
Are you talking about Frost or Iris?

419
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Mm-hmm.

420
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,583
I'm worried about her, too.

421
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,338
But you're the one
who also left your wife in Coast City

422
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:08,091
asking the same question
you're asking about Frost.

423
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:12,303
Is it safe for her to continue
her mission or pull the plug?

424
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:18,351
Look, I'm not the boss here.
So I can't make the decision for you.

425
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,146
But I can tell you this.

426
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:26,651
Sometimes the hardest part
about being a leader is letting go,

427
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:31,197
and trusting the ones you've trained
to make the call themselves.

428
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,451
And then you'll be there for them

429
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,536
in a blink of an eye.

430
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,673
Took you long enough.
Jeez, where is Chester?

431
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:49,837
We got a lot of work to do.

432
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:51,759
He's not coming.

433
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,305
Frost, I talked to Caitlin.

434
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,931
Let me guess.

435
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,808
She changed your mind.

436
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,687
So what, now you're here
to give me some sort of mom talk?

437
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:05,315
- Seriously?
- Yes, I am.

438
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,400
Because I am your mom.

439
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,320
And it's time I start acting like it.

440
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:15,158
Frost, I think it's wonderful
that you have such a strong instinct

441
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,618
to protect people.

442
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,912
But from what Caitlin shared
and what I saw

443
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:22,540
with my own eyes today,
I think your sister's right.

444
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,126
You need to stop being so reckless.

445
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,213
You don't get it. This is Team Flash.
Protecting people,

446
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,623
kinda in the job description.

447
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,925
No, you don't get it.

448
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,178
You can't help anyone if you're dead.

449
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,100
I swear, sometimes
you remind me of your father.

450
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,478
Oh. A murderous psychopath. Gee, thanks.

451
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,231
<i>No, not Icicle. Thomas.</i>

452
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,735
Your father would do whatever it took
to protect his family, too.

453
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,113
Including creating you to save Caitlin.

454
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,658
But he took it too far
and it cost him a future

455
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,177
with the people who loved him the most.

456
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,001
And I don't want to see you
go down that road.

457
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,078
Neither do I.

458
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:04,958
Look, you people think I have
some sort of death wish or something,

459
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,084
but it's not that.

460
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:10,880
I was literally born
to be Caity's bodyguard.

461
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,757
Asking me not to jump
in the line of fire,

462
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,761
it's like asking the sky
not to be freaking blue.

463
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,722
Frost, you're more than a bodyguard.

464
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:24,435
You're an incredible young woman
and a vital part of Team Flash.

465
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,689
And of the Snow family, too.

466
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:30,942
Because you're my daughter.

467
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:36,447
And as your mother,
it's my job to protect you.

468
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,785
Which is why I'm telling you
there's a time for protecting others,

469
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,579
and there's a time
for protecting yourself.

470
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,790
And now is the time to do the latter.

471
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,126
I...

472
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,838
I should have seen it before,
and I hope you do now.

473
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,342
Yeah, I do.

474
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:03,641
But what about the Phantom Flicker?

475
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,936
I still think your plan would work.

476
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:08,730
We just need to keep you safe.

477
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:11,816
So the way to do that
is to trap the fire quickly.

478
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:15,695
I think if we add a secondary
cryokinetic signature,

479
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,614
it would make the meal more appetizing.

480
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,617
- Like frosting on a cake.
- Mm.

481
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,162
But I'm unique.
No one has cryo powers like me.

482
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:26,997
I do.

483
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:34,047
After your... After Icicle put me
in his cryo-chamber,

484
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,256
Caitlin and I did a test

485
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,967
for any residual meta-genome signatures
in my body.

486
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,094
Yeah, I remember.

487
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,261
It came back negative.

488
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,639
Mm. It was wrong.

489
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:46,851
According to my research,
my exposure in Icicle's chamber

490
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,561
activated a latent cryo-gene.

491
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:52,815
I don't have ice powers yet,
but I have the potential for them.

492
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:57,278
Frost, if we combine
your cryokinetic signature with mine...

493
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,239
It would be impossible
for it to resist us.

494
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:02,033
Yes, and there'll be less risk
because the fire won't hesitate

495
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,868
and we'll be able to trap it quickly.

496
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,329
What do you say?

497
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,253
I'm in. Just one more person
we need to get on board.

498
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:14,378
Not anymore.

499
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,716
I'm still not thrilled
with how dangerous this plan is.

500
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,678
But Mom's right.

501
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,596
If the two of you work together,

502
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,724
the fire won't hesitate,
and then we can trap it.

503
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,143
And that will keep everyone safe.

504
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,276
Guys, the black fire's back.
It just landed downtown.

505
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,362
Yeah. So whatever you guys
are gonna do, it's now or never.

506
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:43,116
Okay, let's take this thing out.

507
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:44,701
Once and for all.

508
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:54,793
How long have you known?

509
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,256
That I have my own
cryokinetic signature? For a while now.

510
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,744
Turns out it runs in the family.

511
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,799
I can't believe you didn't tell us

512
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,678
there's two Ice Queens
in the Snow family.

513
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,238
And if you ever need
to learn more about

514
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,180
how to control your powers,
we're here for you.

515
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,141
Thanks. It means a lot.

516
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,601
- Now let's get to work.
- Yes.

517
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:13,687
Okay, we are ready.

518
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,774
And, Mom, just so you know,
the tests I ran confirm your findings.

519
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,277
Your latent genome
plus Frost's meta signature

520
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:22,488
should amplify the sphere's
cryokinetic output exponentially.

521
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:25,408
Giving our bonfire from hell
an offer it can't refuse.

522
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,576
And then some.

523
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:31,205
Listen, Barry, I know you've never been
on board with this plan, so,

524
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:34,125
- if anything goes wrong...
- I know. You'll pull the plug.

525
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,669
I trust you. All of you.

526
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:38,295
Don't worry.

527
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:41,799
If it comes to that, I'll still be ready
to get us all out of here in a second.

528
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,555
Do you do this kind of thing
all the time?

529
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:48,638
Do what?

530
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:49,639
Be a hero.

531
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,392
What can I say,
it's a living.

532
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,896
Yeah. They just don't tell you
how intense it can be.

533
00:30:55,897 --> 00:31:00,026
You're gonna do great, and remember,
what you're doing will save lives.

534
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,029
- I know.
- And after this, we can get dinner.

535
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,115
Okay. But only if you let me buy.

536
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,742
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

537
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:11,995
Okay.

538
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:14,332
Their vitals look good.

539
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,501
Activating the sphere.

540
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,592
Okay. Focus on your powers, like this.

541
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,771
I feel strange.

542
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,898
- Means you're doing it right.
- Okay.

543
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:44,654
Caitlin, how are they doing?

544
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,417
<i>Their bio-signatures
are in sync.</i>

545
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,700
Yeah, well, the containment system's
active. Chester?

546
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:54,539
Great Otis Boykin,
It just changed direction.

547
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:55,832
And heading straight for us.

548
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,209
Contact in five...

549
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:03,464
<i>Four... Three... Two... One.</i>

550
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:28,865
It's working.

551
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,274
The sphere is losing its integrity,
it's trying to break free.

552
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:07,570
- We have to abort.
- No! No. I can do this.

553
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,700
Barry, we can't do this.
She's going into cardiac arrest.

554
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,410
Carla, we have to let it go.

555
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:17,205
No, it's worth it to sacrifice me.

556
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:43,522
What happened?

557
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:45,233
It's gone again.

558
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,026
We still have no idea why.

559
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:55,618
Did we get it?

560
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,371
No. And that's okay.

561
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,042
Oh.

562
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,602
So you just let that hellfire go?

563
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,729
It's on me. I made the call.

564
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,332
And it was
the right thing to do.

565
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,024
You put Carla and
your own safety first.

566
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:28,484
And you saved Mom's life.

567
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:29,568
But Joe's right.

568
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,571
We had a chance to stop it
and we didn't.

569
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:35,908
No, that was before I knew you made
a judgment call, Frost, and a good one.

570
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:39,537
Look, don't worry, we will stop
that thing. That's what we do.

571
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,373
Yeah, your mom sounds
like she's a fighter.

572
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:43,957
She is.

573
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,794
She's going to make
a great meta.

574
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,505
Just one thing, though.
We're back to square one.

575
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,718
Joe, Cecile, have you found anything
that can help us

576
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,844
in Captain Kramer's files?

577
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,764
I wish. We are almost through them all,
and still nothing.

578
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,727
So, we failed?

579
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,271
No, we didn't fail. Thanks to Frost.

580
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:07,982
Now we know the cold Fusion Sphere
can contain that thing.

581
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,191
And that's a win.

582
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:12,028
Barry's right. That means
we can try again to capture it.

583
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:13,321
And this time it will work.

584
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:16,616
If we could create a strong enough
signal, the sphere could work

585
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:19,744
without someone's cryokinetic RNA
in close proximity.

586
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,203
Good. So no bait.

587
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,456
Yeah, which'll keep
Frost and Carla safe.

588
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,299
And then we can catch
the fire again.

589
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,418
Take the fight to it this time.

590
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:34,008
I'm telling you, I'm okay, really.

591
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,885
Caity says you need to rest.

592
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,179
Fine, I'll stay the night.

593
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:40,765
But then I promise, I'll be
out of your hair in the morning.

594
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,475
It's really no problem.

595
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,145
Also, I'm sorry I yelled at you two.

596
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,106
Don't be. I needed to hear it.

597
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,274
Both of us did.

598
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,904
Thank you for keeping us safe,
like you always do.

599
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:59,033
Good thing, too, 'cause I
couldn't lose you... Either one of you.

600
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,871
Oh, shoot. It's Marcus.

601
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,791
He has no idea what happened today.

602
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,354
What happened to going all in?

603
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,672
Yeah. I really do need
to tell him everything.

604
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,715
Just, um... not tonight.

605
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:20,680
Hey! No, I'm fine.
Just a crazy day at work.

606
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,263
How are you?

607
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:30,231
So about that dinner
we were supposed to have...

608
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,668
How about we make it brunch
in the morning?

609
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:34,901
Absolutely.

610
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:41,867
And, Frost, I need to apologize, too.

611
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:46,455
I should have told you
about my condition sooner.

612
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:52,128
I just... I guess I was just worried
about what it could mean for me.

613
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:55,672
Maybe if we talked more,

614
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:58,135
you would have felt more comfortable
sharing it with me.

615
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,011
Yeah.

616
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,098
It's okay.

617
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,433
- Something to work on.
- Yeah.

618
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,149
I've missed so much of your life,

619
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,986
and that's my fault.

620
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,824
There is so much about you
that I don't know

621
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,493
and so much that I want to know.

622
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,287
Really?

623
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:32,543
Yes, of course. It's like I said before,
you're my daughter.

624
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:37,965
And I love you, Frost.

625
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:41,302
You do?

626
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:43,804
More than you could ever know.

627
00:37:58,819 --> 00:37:59,819
You're okay.

628
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:14,626
Can I help you?

629
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:18,756
Are you Renee Wazzo?

630
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:21,550
Who's asking?

631
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:25,011
Your daughter.

632
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,314
All the adoption websites
warn you about days like this.

633
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:37,566
That's not what...

634
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:38,858
I mean, it's just...

635
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,321
I guess I knew
this might happen eventually.

636
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:44,740
Maybe even wanted it.

637
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:48,076
Yeah, me, too.

638
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:52,748
Look, I'm sure you have
so many questions.

639
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,876
Just one, actually.

640
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:02,674
Um...

641
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,010
Why didn't you want me?

642
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,518
I always wanted you, Tinya.

643
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,271
I want you to know that.

644
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,900
The truth is, I wanted to be your mom
more than anything,

645
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:22,361
but I was so young.

646
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:27,950
I was 16 and confused,
and my parents were furious.

647
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:34,957
They convinced me that the best thing
for both of us was to sign that clause,

648
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,543
then give you away.

649
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,007
They were wrong.

650
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,972
I swear to you, I've never regretted
anything more than letting you go.

651
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,120
The only way
I could get through

652
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,813
this crap life of mine that came after
was the hope

653
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,482
that you were living a good life.

654
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:04,653
A better life without me.

655
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:10,783
No, I'm not.

656
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:14,162
I needed you.

657
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,792
I needed my mother.

658
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,171
Tinya, I...

659
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,090
Iris?

660
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,931
Whoa. What is wrong with her?

661
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:33,140
I don't know.

662
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,600
Are you okay?

663
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,027
What the hell?

664
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:47,529
Mom?

665
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,076
Mom? Mom?

666
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,413
What did you do to my mom?

667
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:15,932
Frost?

668
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:20,896
Frost, that isn't funny.

669
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:32,783
<i>Caitlin.</i>

670
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:35,511
<i>The world is different now.</i>

671
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,122
<i>There is no normal life for us.</i>

672
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:40,206
Oh, my God.

673
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,835
Cait, the world's different now.

674
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,295
Look, I thought we could get away.

675
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:49,174
Start a normal life together,
but there is no normal life for us.

676
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:52,802
Ronnie?
