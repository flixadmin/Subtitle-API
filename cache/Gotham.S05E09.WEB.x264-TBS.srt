1
00:00:01,077 --> 00:00:02,226
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,228 --> 00:00:03,694
<i>Word of the chemical spill</i>

3
00:00:03,696 --> 00:00:05,838
- reached the mainland.
- Reunification isn't happening.

4
00:00:05,915 --> 00:00:07,248
No action until the government

5
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:08,999
can determine if Gotham's safe.

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,831
I sentence you,

7
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,670
Victor Zsasz, to die.

8
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,389
Get him out of there!

9
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:18,968
What the hell are you doing?!

10
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:21,095
Trying to keep you all
from making a terrible mistake.

11
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:23,160
- Her name is Ivy.
- She's a witch.

12
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:28,692
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

13
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,138
It consumes them,

14
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:31,480
and then it flourishes.

15
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:33,032
We wouldn't have escaped without you.

16
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:35,106
You saved me and my friends.

17
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:36,202
I wanted to help.

18
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,691
- Come with us.
- Are you telling me

19
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:43,867
you found a way out of Gotham?

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,119
It's a submarine.

21
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:46,528
I've been giving you space,

22
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:48,024
but we have to talk
about how this is gonna work.

23
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:49,402
I'm gonna be a part of this kid's life.

24
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:51,720
- You seem pretty confident about that.
- I am.

25
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:53,938
You're having a baby with Barbara.

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,629
Can't change the past, so...

27
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:57,515
I guess we just have to live with it.

28
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:08,785
Come on, people! Time's a-wastin'!

29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,022
The filtration system that
Lucius designed is working.

30
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,943
What you're doing is both
unnecessary and it's reckless.

31
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,763
Our supplies of drinking water
are at critical levels.

32
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,631
Every day, the gangs
grow more aggressive.

33
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:23,118
If I can get a cease-fire,
even a temporary one,

34
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:25,328
then when reunification does happen,

35
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:27,163
at least there will be people
left to save.

36
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:28,340
They deserve that much.

37
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:30,250
And does your child deserve a father?

38
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:32,335
You have no problem taking
care of the entire city.

39
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:34,504
What about focusing on just one life?

40
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:35,983
Why are you always so ready

41
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,381
to put yourself in the crosshairs?

42
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:40,469
It's like you won't be satisfied
until you sacrifice yourself.

43
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:43,000
- You really believe that?
- I do.

44
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:44,914
And it scares me.

45
00:01:46,157 --> 00:01:47,636
How is this gonna work?

46
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,681
Am I supposed to just stay at home

47
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,485
and raise this child with Barbara

48
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:53,754
while you go cowboying off all the time?

49
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:55,394
It won't always be like this.

50
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:56,818
After reunification...

51
00:01:56,843 --> 00:01:58,397
Nothing will be different.

52
00:01:58,422 --> 00:01:59,815
Unless you stop being...

53
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,075
Me?

54
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:04,236
Hey, Jim.

55
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:06,202
I have to go. We'll talk after.

56
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:07,585
If there is an after.

57
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:29,595
Oh, yeah?! Oh-ho!

58
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,431
Oswald, where the hell is Nygma?

59
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,239
Shouldn't we have left the city already?

60
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:38,468
Ms. Kean, this may come as a surprise,

61
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:41,109
but building a submarine from scratch

62
00:02:41,134 --> 00:02:42,945
by yourself takes time.

63
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,859
- Patience.
- Easy for you to say.

64
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:46,477
You're not a walking egg timer.

65
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:48,243
Tell him to get a move on.

66
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,856
And why, exactly,

67
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,505
are you hosting Gordon's
gangland get-together?

68
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,677
Keep your friends close and
your enemies closer, my dear.

69
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:57,778
If we're really going to leave Gotham,

70
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,347
we need to keep Gordon happy.

71
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,591
You know all about that, don't you?

72
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,426
It was a momentary slip.

73
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:06,344
The world was on fire.

74
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,937
Jim, it's your show.

75
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,674
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

76
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:23,320
I'll make this short.

77
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:25,581
Gotham is running dry.

78
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,158
Our supply of clean water

79
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,492
will only last a few more months.

80
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,496
So you have a choice.

81
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:35,780
You can keep killing each other,

82
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:38,067
fighting over what little water is left,

83
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,670
maybe eke out a few
more months, then die.

84
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:42,389
Or...

85
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:45,288
we can all agree right now

86
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:47,302
to an immediate cease-fire.

87
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:56,144
The government
will not annex a war zone.

88
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:59,988
If we can show them that we
deserve to rejoin the mainland,

89
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:01,605
supply chain will be restored

90
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,618
and we will all survive
until reunification.

91
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:08,344
That's the choice.

92
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:09,908
Life or death.

93
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,418
Your call.

94
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:27,342
Weapons down!

95
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,677
Get back!

96
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:31,388
Jim, you see where the shooter was?

97
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:33,344
Jim.

98
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:38,458
Oh, my God.

99
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:49,138

100
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,606
Get back!

101
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:55,805
You're gonna be all right.

102
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:57,807
It's bad. We got to move him. Now.

103
00:04:57,818 --> 00:04:59,871
Clinic's too far. M.E.'s office.

104
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:01,112
Alvarez, come on. Help.

105
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,478
On it.

106
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:04,389
Take my gun.

107
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:06,324
One, two, three.

108
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,775
All right. Get back.

109
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:10,670
Back! Get back!

110
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,748
Well, I did not see that coming.

111
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:28,922
What made you choose this,
of all places,

112
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:30,902
for a scavenging mission?

113
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,394
Just trust me, okay?

114
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:41,751
What the hell?

115
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:56,791
Sit.

116
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,010
Wow.

117
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:18,396
Candles.

118
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:20,240
If I didn't know any better,

119
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:23,068
I'd say this was a... date.

120
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:30,575
Maybe it is.

121
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:37,196
That okay with you?

122
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:40,043
Maybe.

123
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,803
Good.

124
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:53,682
So let's eat.

125
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:02,478
Lee!

126
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:05,375
It's Jim. He's lost a lot of blood.
Can you save him?

127
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,556
Come with me!

128
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:19,398
Doc says he's gonna be okay.

129
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,484
He's gonna pull through.

130
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:25,188
But until then, I'm acting captain.

131
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:28,407
Now, the gangs of this city

132
00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:31,502
think this is their time
that they can run wild!

133
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:33,960
They are dead wrong!

134
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:35,796
I want us to take to the streets.

135
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,132
It is show-of-force time!

136
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,419
We ain't gonna give 'em an inch!

137
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:42,199
Harper,

138
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:43,877
I want you to organize patrol teams.

139
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,132
What are you gonna do?

140
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:48,353
I'm gonna find out who shot my partner.

141
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:51,744
The bullet shattered against a rib.

142
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:56,490
I have to get all the fragments out.

143
00:07:57,902 --> 00:08:01,615
I haven't done general surgery
since med school.

144
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,888
There.

145
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:07,973
All right, there's an exit wound,

146
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:09,484
so the rest must've gone through.

147
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,810
I need to sew him up.
Can you get my kit?

148
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:13,711
Right away.

149
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,586
Come on, Jim.

150
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:21,394
You can do this, but you have to fight.

151
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:23,457
You hear me?

152
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,617
You have to fight.

153
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:40,848
Order in the court.

154
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:42,933
James Gordon,

155
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,843
you have been brought here

156
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:47,325
to be judged for your many crimes,

157
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:50,683
and your very life hangs in the balance.

158
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,142
Do you understand?

159
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:53,644
No, I...

160
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,919
The defendant understands

161
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:59,348
and waives his right to appeal.

162
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,819
The trial of James Gordon

163
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:04,809
will now begin.

164
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,440
No! Wait!

165
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:20,671
That...

166
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:23,638
was the best canned meal I've ever had.

167
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,767
And if this was a date,

168
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:26,756
I don't know how you're gonna top it

169
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:28,771
when everything gets back to normal.

170
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:34,848
I don't think
things are ever gonna be normal.

171
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,027
For me, anyways.

172
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:39,732
What do you mean?

173
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:42,444
Wayne Manor's gone.

174
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,863
And I know that a lot of people
lost a lot more,

175
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:47,899
but part of me wonders
if it wasn't fate.

176
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:49,522
It wasn't.

177
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,994
It was Jeremiah blowing up your house.

178
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,570
Maybe it's time to move on.

179
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,668
You mean, like, leave Gotham?

180
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:01,754
Bruce, forget Wayne Manor.

181
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:03,547
This city is your home.

182
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:06,759
And how many terrible things
have happened to it

183
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,619
because of me?

184
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,869
Galavan.

185
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:14,385
Ra's al Ghul.

186
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:21,732
If this city really is my home,

187
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:26,852
then maybe the best thing
I can do for it is leave.

188
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,773
I have to say...

189
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:32,618
...kind of agree with you on that one,

190
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:35,079
billionaire boy.

191
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,299
Jim Gordon's blood on my floor.

192
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,144
Olga!

193
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:43,472
Why is the help never around
when you need them?

194
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:46,757
This could be good for us.

195
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,734
- You especially.
- Are you serious?

196
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:54,179
Your baby daddy is
the top cop in Gotham.

197
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,800
A dead Jim Gordon is the only way

198
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,727
you can hold on to your little...

199
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:00,562
bundle of joy.

200
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:02,765
Harvey, how is our dear...

201
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,715
Who the hell did it?!
If I find out it was you,

202
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,881
I swear to God...

203
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:11,872
It wasn't me!
I merely supplied the venue!

204
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:13,575
At your boss's request!

205
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:15,147
That doesn't mean squat!

206
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:17,745
Fine. You want to know who's to blame?

207
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:19,547
James Gordon!

208
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,792
He invited every criminal in Gotham!

209
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:24,011
What did he think was gonna happen?

210
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:28,799
How about you, huh?

211
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:30,518
When did you two become so...

212
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:32,052
buddy-buddy?

213
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:33,309
Maybe when you hatched up a plan

214
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:35,920
so you could keep that baby
for yourself.

215
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:38,031
Harvey, whatever you think of me,

216
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:41,136
I did not plot to kill
my child's father.

217
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,488
Well, someone here did!

218
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:45,082
Someone in this room shot Jim Gordon,

219
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,526
and I'm not leaving
till I find out who it was!

220
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:50,812
Wrong! The shooter was not here!

221
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,414
Look at the window, stupid!

222
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,593
The shot came from outside.

223
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,613
If the shooter was there...

224
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:04,952
and the trajectory was here...

225
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:06,716
Jim was...

226
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,116
then the bullet...

227
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,019
Uh-huh.

228
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:19,546
I'm gonna find out who this was,

229
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,167
and when I do,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

230
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:24,780
Harvey.

231
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,535
Is there anything I can do?

232
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:32,163
Yeah. You can keep the gangs
from tearing the city apart.

233
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,586
What do you want?

234
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:39,754
You...

235
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,979
I will deal with later.

236
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,502
I'm here...

237
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:45,843
...for you.

238
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,682
I need you to come with me.

239
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:49,588
Why would I do that?

240
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,849
Because you love me so much.

241
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:54,885
Well, not yet, but you will.

242
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:56,606
Don't mess with him, Ivy.

243
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:57,938
Protecting your boyfriend?

244
00:12:58,015 --> 00:12:59,774
That's cute.

245
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,935
But I thought that might happen, so...

246
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:05,358
I brought a friend.

247
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,906
I stumbled across this charming man

248
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:09,260
on the way over here,

249
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,539
and apparently, you two know each other.

250
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:14,836
Leave her out of this!

251
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:22,375
You know, I heard you talking
about the future of Gotham...

252
00:13:23,156 --> 00:13:25,364
but Gotham will be what<i> I</i> decide.

253
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,511
A green world.

254
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:32,056
Won't that be beautiful?

255
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,801
Gorgeous.

256
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,857
Bruce and I have to go.

257
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,153
You always did think
you were better than me.

258
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:49,170
But without my plants,

259
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:51,942
you never would have left your bed.

260
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,495
I made you strong again.

261
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,071
Think about that

262
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:59,458
while my friend
is cutting out your heart.

263
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:12,680
There are so many things
I wish I could say to you.

264
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:19,937
So many things I wish we could do.

265
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,326
This can't be the end.

266
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:27,194
Come on, Jim.

267
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:29,113
Talk to me.

268
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:32,491
Say something.

269
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:35,806
Speak.

270
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,779
No.

271
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:40,303
This isn't right. I shouldn't be here.

272
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:42,297
- You have to listen to me.
- Silence! Silence!

273
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,860
The prosecution will now give
its opening remarks.

274
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:52,096
Your Honor, Jim Gordon's crimes
are a matter of public record.

275
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:55,673
He's failed Gotham at every turn.

276
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:58,726
He failed to clean up the city...

277
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:02,550
failed to stop the bridges
from being destroyed,

278
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,510
failed to protect
those poor, innocent souls

279
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,728
in the refuge he himself created...

280
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:12,564
- Haven.
- I tried.

281
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,410
- I did the best...
- Silence!

282
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:19,788
One more outburst and you
will be held in contempt.

283
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:25,869
I'm hurt.

284
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,100
I need help. Please.

285
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,258
Continue.

286
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:35,724
The issue here is not
how many people have died

287
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:37,701
because of Jim Gordon,

288
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:39,427
but how many more must die

289
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,531
in order to satisfy
his need to be a hero.

290
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:46,848
Therefore we pose one simple question:

291
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:50,560
Are the people in Jim Gordon's life

292
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,416
better off with him alive

293
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:55,849
or dead?

294
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,465
I think I'm dying.

295
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:00,845
The prosecution would like to call

296
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:02,375
its first witness, Your Honor.

297
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,619
Dr. Lee Thompkins.

298
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,973
Come on, Jim.

299
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:20,474
Hold on.

300
00:16:21,978 --> 00:16:23,477
How is he?

301
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:25,095
Touch and go.

302
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:27,978
He's stable for now.

303
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,002
I removed all the bullet fragments,

304
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,096
but something keeps pulling him down.

305
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,821
Where are the fragments?

306
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,372
What is it?

307
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:46,992
"V.Z."

308
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:49,913
Victor Zsasz.

309
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:55,167
Okey-dokey.

310
00:16:56,104 --> 00:16:57,637
Time to boogie.

311
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:11,525
Hey! I'm only here for Gordon.

312
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:13,769
So all of you stay down.

313
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,696
'Cause I see anyone...

314
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:18,532
and, you know...

315
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:20,630
bang.

316
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,488
Oi, oi!

317
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:27,187
Now, I heard you were looking
for Jim Gordon.

318
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:28,605
Uh-huh.

319
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:36,379
Listen, I know we have history.

320
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:38,977
Let's just let bygones be bygones.

321
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:40,311
Yeah, right.

322
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:43,728
- You did this to my face.
- Whatever.

323
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,176
It's not like you were much
of a looker before, anyway.

324
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,043
Ivy says you hurt her feelings.

325
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:51,206
Why would you do that!?

326
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:53,455
She's so sweet!

327
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,543
Ivy didn't make me strong.

328
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:00,498
I made me strong.

329
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,676
Tell me where she took Bruce.

330
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:09,663
The only reason I'm not
ending you right now

331
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:12,138
is the thought of the look on your face

332
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:13,926
when Jim Gordon walks through that door.

333
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:16,395
Because he's alive, you son of a bitch!

334
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:19,058
Ugh. What did you eat?

335
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:20,935
You smell like a butcher.

336
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,896
You know, I'm vegan now.

337
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:25,349
Why kill Jim now?

338
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:28,263
Makes no sense.
He saved your miserable ass.

339
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:31,771
He prevented Penguin from executing you.

340
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,831
If anyone, you should be
going after Cobblepot.

341
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,899
Yeah, that's a good point.

342
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:38,953
Maybe I'll do him next.

343
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,303
It's kind of not up to me.

344
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,133
You're working for someone?

345
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,468
Oh.

346
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,485
Sorry.

347
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,049
I want a name!

348
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:54,337
Ah, what's in a name?

349
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:57,329
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet.

350
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:59,134
You know, I'm really taking the time

351
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:01,100
to stop and smell the roses these days.

352
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:02,768
Like, actual roses.

353
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:04,812
They're great.

354
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:06,364
Are you high?

355
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:07,417
On love.

356
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,358
But like I said...

357
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,273
my lips are sealed.

358
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,570
Ivy Pepper.

359
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:18,156
You said it, not me.

360
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:20,086
Uh, I'm technically
not allowed to say it.

361
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:22,024
Her name. Which is such a bummer,

362
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:24,331
because it's the most beautiful
name in the world.

363
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:25,384
You watch him.

364
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:26,625
I could say it all day.

365
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:28,502
Hey, I<i> will</i> say it all day.

366
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:29,670
Ivy.

367
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:31,321
Ivy Pepper.

368
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:32,479
Mrs....

369
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,085
Ivy Pepper Zsasz.

370
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,140
Oh, that sounds good.

371
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,653
Here you are, Miss Thompkins.
Careful, it's... it'll be hot.

372
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,100
Forgive me, but I...

373
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:52,028
heard on the grapevine
that you and Captain Gordon

374
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,745
had a rather heated exchange
this morning.

375
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:55,237
Oh, God.

376
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,739
Was it that bad?

377
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,332
Apparently, it was like a session
of the Italian parliament.

378
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,417
You have misgivings

379
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:11,196
about the arrival
of this child, don't you?

380
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:15,508
What am I getting myself into, Alfred?

381
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,578
How am I supposed to raise a child

382
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,953
alongside a psychopath
like Barbara Kean?

383
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:23,211
I mean, how the hell is this gonna work?

384
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:26,602
But... but that's not all of it.

385
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,976
If Jim and I are gonna do this,
then we have to do it together.

386
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,232
You know how he is.

387
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:32,351
I don't know what's going on

388
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:34,062
inside that man's head sometimes.

389
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:36,102
I think you'll find that he needs you

390
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:38,531
a lot more than he's letting on.

391
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:41,008
Well, I need to hear it from him.

392
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:46,472
I never thought that this was
how my life was going to be.

393
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:50,153
I have no interest
in being a father myself.

394
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,665
I always presumed that
I was unfit to be one.

395
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:56,822
And then I found myself...

396
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:00,520
one night staring
down an alley at this little boy

397
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,583
quite literally shaking with fear.

398
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,958
I don't know, it's funny,
isn't it, what life throws you?

399
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:11,666
I'm keenly aware that I am not
Master Bruce's flesh and blood.

400
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:14,065
But it's the moments.

401
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,150
The little things, like...

402
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:19,736
like when he uses a skill
that I once taught him,

403
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:23,129
or we laugh at a joke
that only he and I share.

404
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:26,701
Those have been some of the most
ecstatic moments of my life.

405
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:30,450
Nothing can possibly
prepare you for that joy.

406
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:33,269
The hows and the whats...

407
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:35,535
you'll figure that stuff out.

408
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:38,547
What matters is this:

409
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:41,552
you'll be an exquisite mother,

410
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,067
and that child, he or she
will be extraordinary...

411
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,903
...because of you.

412
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,455
Thank you, Alfred.

413
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,733
Jim, can you hear me?

414
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,374
I'm right here, right next to you.

415
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,802
<i>Can you feel me?</i>

416
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:22,474
Lee?

417
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,051
Dr. Lee Thompkins.

418
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:28,499
You've suffered at this man's
hands more than anyone.

419
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:30,843
Broken heart,

420
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,985
broken engagement.

421
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:36,216
A lost child.

422
00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:39,452
And yet, you're still with him.

423
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,735
I love him.

424
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:44,312
After all the pain he's caused you,

425
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:46,719
would your life be better,

426
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:49,630
could it not still<i> be</i> better,

427
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,148
without Jim Gordon?

428
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:55,262
Answer the question.

429
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:57,342
- Lee?
- I'll ask it a different way.

430
00:22:57,397 --> 00:23:00,084
Would you, Dr. Lee Thompkins,

431
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:03,371
be better off if Jim Gordon were dead?

432
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,012
I'm sorry.

433
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:10,590
Everything he touches dies.

434
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:13,561
Prosecution rests, Your Honor.

435
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:16,928
You made her say that.

436
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:19,030
I didn't make her say anything.

437
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,535
Ask them.

438
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:23,755
Who are they?

439
00:23:23,832 --> 00:23:26,990
More people who trusted
you, who believed you

440
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:30,060
when you said you would protect them.

441
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:33,181
They're from Haven.

442
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:36,184
I think I'm dying.

443
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:39,687
And isn't it about time?

444
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:44,559
The verdict's in.

445
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:45,924
You're guilty.

446
00:23:54,604 --> 00:23:56,250
Hey, Jeff, listen to me.

447
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:57,579
One day, you're gonna meet someone

448
00:23:57,648 --> 00:23:58,875
who's gonna totally change your life,

449
00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:00,914
and that's gonna make you happy,

450
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,098
and you deserve it.

451
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:07,433
Or not.

452
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:09,792
Is she here?

453
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:11,761
She's here, isn't he?

454
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:15,465
Sweetie.

455
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,381
All I asked of you

456
00:24:18,502 --> 00:24:21,138
was to kill Jim Gordon.

457
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:22,995
You're not angry, are you?

458
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:24,779
'Cause I'll do it. I'll do it right now.

459
00:24:27,178 --> 00:24:28,978
I'll do it.

460
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,838
You keep the cops busy.

461
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:35,963
Luckily, the other part of my
plan is coming together nicely.

462
00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:02,806
Lucius!

463
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:04,364
Bruce.

464
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:07,174
I had no idea you were stopping by.

465
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:10,231
I wanted to check on your progress.

466
00:25:10,364 --> 00:25:13,567
Well, the toxicity levels in
this river continue to drop.

467
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:16,050
At this point, we'll be under
the threshold mandated

468
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,902
by the government sooner than expected.

469
00:25:17,972 --> 00:25:19,989
It's not glamorous work,
but we are helping

470
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:22,111
to save the lives
of thousands of people.

471
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:24,297
People. Ugh.

472
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:27,673
I'm sorry. Did you just say
"People. Ugh"?

473
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,811
Lucius, what if I were to tell you

474
00:25:29,884 --> 00:25:32,635
I have in my possession
the most intoxicating perfume

475
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:33,959
you'll ever smell?

476
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:36,167
I would tell you that's
an abrupt change of topic.

477
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:38,448
Can we go back to the part
where you said "People. Ugh"?

478
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:43,210
Mmm.

479
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:47,569
Oh, my... goodness.

480
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,068
Lucius, Ivy sent me here to get
you to shut down the plant.

481
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:52,987
Can you do that for her?

482
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:56,008
For Ivy? Anything.

483
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,357
She is so great.

484
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,984
♪ They say, they say
she's got to grow up ♪

485
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,539
♪ And they say, they say
she's got to get a job ♪

486
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:14,794
♪ I know, I know
I'll never be like the rest ♪

487
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:17,076
♪ Of the bunch. Oh! ♪

488
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:19,052
Raise your glasses.

489
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:21,624
I called you all here today

490
00:26:21,685 --> 00:26:25,122
because Jim Gordon is at death's door.

491
00:26:25,177 --> 00:26:27,639
Yeah!

492
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:29,516
For years, he has hounded us,

493
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:31,536
beaten us, shot us.

494
00:26:31,614 --> 00:26:33,362
And today, he got his due.

495
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:36,272
To Jim Gordon. May he rot in hell!

496
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:38,492
Yeah!

497
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:43,279
What exactly are you doing?

498
00:26:43,356 --> 00:26:45,959
I'm trying to keep this city
from ripping itself apart.

499
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:50,069
So this has nothing to do
with your feelings for Jim?

500
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,663
What if Ed fails, and we are stuck here?

501
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:55,552
This will put us in
Gordon's good graces.

502
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:57,813
Consider it a backup plan.

503
00:27:00,464 --> 00:27:02,101
Listen up!

504
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,656
Now to the real reason
I brought you all here.

505
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,325
I want you to agree
to an immediate truce.

506
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:12,031
Get out of here.

507
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:15,798
And what if, instead,
we shoot you and take your club?

508
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:18,792
I don't think so.

509
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:20,864
See, those drinks I just gave you...

510
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,190
they're poisoned.

511
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:26,325
And you had two shots
before everyone got here.

512
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,637
So that should be taking effect
around...

513
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,328
...now.

514
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,799
The rest of you have 48 hours
before you'll need

515
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:41,987
the antidote, which
I will deliver to you,

516
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,252
provided you go back
to your territories,

517
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:47,541
play nice,
and send me all your guns. Deal?

518
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:51,158
I said, "Deal?"

519
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:54,578
- Now get out of here!
- All right.

520
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:56,797
Yeah. Out. Come on.

521
00:27:57,838 --> 00:27:59,258
Hmm.

522
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:02,204
Jim will be so pleased.

523
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,337
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer.

524
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:07,923
Isn't that right... Pengy?

525
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,302
Once I reverse the system,

526
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:25,919
all the toxin we pulled from
the river will be rereleased,

527
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:28,278
and the overload should
destroy the filters.

528
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,005
In a matter of minutes,

529
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,997
the entire facility will be inoperable.

530
00:28:33,448 --> 00:28:34,942
There.

531
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:36,724
Perfect.

532
00:28:36,797 --> 00:28:39,581
Ivy's gonna be so happy.

533
00:28:39,658 --> 00:28:41,800
You think so?

534
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:44,703
<i>Security breach. Zone 1.</i>

535
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:46,722
That's odd.

536
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,933
Selina.

537
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:01,770
I'll take care of it.

538
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:03,664
Okay.

539
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:06,513
All right, listen up!

540
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:10,487
I know you're probably familiar
with Ivy Pepper.

541
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,734
In fact, you were probably here

542
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:15,070
when she hypnotized the whole
frigging precinct, okay?

543
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:16,502
She is on the loose,

544
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,992
and we've got to find her
and take her down.

545
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,189
Actually, fellas,

546
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:22,790
she's already here!

547
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,832
That's right. Ivy came and freed me.

548
00:29:30,908 --> 00:29:33,425
That is true love for you.

549
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:38,103
She really understands
what makes me tick.

550
00:29:38,181 --> 00:29:39,548
Don't worry, though.

551
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:41,103
I'm just a distraction

552
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:44,056
so she can finish off Jim
once and for all.

553
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,978
You know, that's how great couples work.

554
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:49,392
Maybe I shouldn't have told you that.

555
00:29:49,473 --> 00:29:50,787
Oh, well.

556
00:30:01,055 --> 00:30:03,016
- I'm sorry, Miss Thompkins.
- I know. Go.

557
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:04,907
Thank you, Alfred.

558
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:06,927
Come on, Jim.

559
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:08,424
Can you hear me?

560
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:09,863
Stay with me.

561
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:11,539
Stay with me, Jim.

562
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:17,273
Jim!

563
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:19,687
Want a drink?

564
00:30:19,757 --> 00:30:21,883
Alvarez makes a hell of a Mai Thai.

565
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,344
I can barely feel my face.

566
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,262
Harvey, what is this?

567
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:27,903
It's your wake.

568
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:29,891
Pretty nice turn-out, huh?

569
00:30:29,993 --> 00:30:34,087
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

570
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:35,903
- ♪ For he's a jolly good ♪
- Stop.

571
00:30:35,974 --> 00:30:36,964
♪ Fellow ♪

572
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:40,902
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

573
00:30:42,864 --> 00:30:46,853
♪ Which nobody can deny ♪

574
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:48,293
Wake?

575
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:51,196
I'm not dead yet.

576
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,736
Well, be a little bit of a bummer

577
00:30:53,814 --> 00:30:56,572
to have it after you died,
don't you think?

578
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:58,845
I'm gonna have a kid, Harvey.

579
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,767
How do I protect that child
when everything around me dies?

580
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:07,278
Harvey?

581
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:11,339
That's a good question.

582
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:17,222
Will.

583
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,324
You said I'd be safe in Haven.

584
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:21,414
I trusted you.

585
00:31:21,523 --> 00:31:22,856
I know.

586
00:31:22,987 --> 00:31:24,866
I did my best.

587
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,944
Your best never seems good enough.

588
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,173
It's time to go.

589
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,321
No, no, no.

590
00:31:39,392 --> 00:31:40,726
No, no, no, no. Jim.

591
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:42,750
Where's my adrenaline?

592
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:44,856
Oh...

593
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:53,140
Oh, looks like
Victor succeeded after all.

594
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,058
I guess I'll have
to settle for killing you.

595
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:09,458
I can tell you one thing.

596
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:12,685
I am sick and tired of getting
shot at in my own precinct.

597
00:32:13,195 --> 00:32:15,287
Hey, what the bloody hell's going on?

598
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:16,833
I thought you had this
lunatic locked up.

599
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:19,078
Ivy broke him out
and gave him an arsenal.

600
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:21,953
But I have an idea. I got to get
to the storeroom. Give me cover.

601
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:23,352
Alvarez, go!

602
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:34,696
Why are you doing this?

603
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,689
What has Jim ever done to you?

604
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:40,389
Gotham has a chance to be born anew.

605
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,644
To return to what it was

606
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,342
before people ripped down the
trees and paved over the earth.

607
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,388
He's trying to reunify with the mainland

608
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,494
to save all these people.

609
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,068
A return to filth.

610
00:32:51,284 --> 00:32:52,877
Pollution.

611
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:55,557
He's fighting for death, while I...

612
00:32:56,244 --> 00:32:57,740
promise life...

613
00:32:57,869 --> 00:33:00,158
in its purest form.

614
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:04,502
Is that your plan?

615
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,924
To have the plants take over
Gotham by killing Jim?

616
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,182
Oh, killing Gordon's
just the first part.

617
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,329
Bruce Wayne is taking care of the rest.

618
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:15,266
- For what it's worth, I am sorry.
- For what?

619
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:25,100
This pain is nothing

620
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:28,377
compared to what you are about to feel.

621
00:33:29,823 --> 00:33:32,582
Say good-bye... to Jim Gordon for me.

622
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:34,786
No! No, no, no, no, no!

623
00:33:34,876 --> 00:33:36,466
No!

624
00:33:37,831 --> 00:33:39,197
Jim.

625
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:46,113
Selena, you're wasting your time.

626
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:48,079
Bruce, you have
to snap out of Ivy's spell.

627
00:33:48,172 --> 00:33:50,071
- This is not you.
- You're wrong.

628
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,571
Ivy's given me a purpose.

629
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:55,438
Stop! Stop! I don't want to fight you!

630
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:58,684
What are you gonna do?
Kill everything in Gotham?

631
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:00,786
The toxins will only kill
all the people.

632
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,950
The plants will adapt; they always do.

633
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:05,248
- Can you hear what that sounds like?
- Yeah.

634
00:34:05,324 --> 00:34:06,817
It sounds great!

635
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:18,264
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

636
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:20,529
You don't care about Gotham.
You're gonna leave anyway.

637
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,121
What about the rest of us, huh?

638
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,497
The ones who are gonna be

639
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:28,216
stuck here without you?!

640
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:30,000
Selena...

641
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:35,126
Selena... I'm okay.

642
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:37,150
- Bruce, I'm so sorry.
- We got to stop Lucius.

643
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,242
- Come on.
- Okay.

644
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:44,532
Lucius! You have to stop the shutdown.

645
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,509
Oh, no, I can't do that.

646
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,229
Ivy will be so mad.

647
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:53,482
Listen to me, I-I used
Ivy's perfume to hypnotize you.

648
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:56,861
- She's using you.
- No.

649
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:59,080
Ivy would never do that.

650
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:03,086
We're perfectly bonded, like...
carbon and oxygen

651
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:04,797
or hydrogen and oxygen...

652
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:06,743
We do not have time for this.

653
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,586
I'm sorry.

654
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:14,351
There.

655
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:15,983
Oh, you kicked me in the head.

656
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:17,724
I didn't have a choice, Lucius.

657
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:19,552
Bruce, where's Ivy?

658
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:25,000
She was headed to the GCPD.

659
00:35:28,772 --> 00:35:31,239
I wonder what Ivy's doing right now.

660
00:35:31,347 --> 00:35:33,440
Hey, lover boy.

661
00:35:37,028 --> 00:35:38,845
Are you serious right now?

662
00:35:38,946 --> 00:35:41,193
As a heart attack.

663
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:49,452
What an idiot.

664
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:52,467
Oh, my...

665
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:02,454
Ah, that felt good.

666
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:03,730
Come on, Jim.

667
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,676
You fight for everyone else.
You never give up.

668
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,440
Fight for yourself, Jim. Come on!

669
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:32,064
It's time.

670
00:36:48,828 --> 00:36:50,470
Jim.

671
00:36:58,227 --> 00:36:59,845
Lee.

672
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:01,931
Is that...?

673
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:03,252
Yes.

674
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:07,388
Do you want to...?

675
00:37:11,156 --> 00:37:13,123
I don't know.

676
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,093
I don't know that I can.

677
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:20,092
Oh, I see.

678
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:21,998
No!

679
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,322
Good-bye, Jim.

680
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:26,002
No! I want to live!

681
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,919
- I want to live!
- It's too late.

682
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,528
No! I want to live!

683
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:43,842
Lee.

684
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:45,867
Don't move. Don't move.

685
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,233
How do you feel?

686
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:51,930
Like I almost died.

687
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:55,118
Well, you didn't.

688
00:37:55,143 --> 00:37:57,074
You fought. You came back to me.

689
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:59,119
Because I need you.

690
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:02,101
Lee...

691
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,495
- this child...
- It's okay.

692
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:07,424
It's okay to be scared.

693
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,108
The only thing scarier than doing this

694
00:38:12,182 --> 00:38:13,848
is doing it without you.

695
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:20,171
Can I ask you something?

696
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:32,542
_

697
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:50,051
He seems nervous.

698
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,461
I know.

699
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:53,949
He should be thrilled.

700
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:57,724
Marrying a woman who's smarter
<i>and</i> better-looking than him.

701
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:03,303
Selina, while we were fighting,

702
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:05,121
when I was hypnotized,
you talked about me leaving...

703
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:06,699
Quiet.

704
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:08,238
Here she comes.

705
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:35,440
You may sit.

706
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:40,263
I'm just gonna say,

707
00:39:40,315 --> 00:39:42,729
this isn't gonna be some
long, drawn-out, tearful affair

708
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,033
like you all are used to, okay?

709
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:45,035
This is gonna be a short wedding.

710
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:48,038
I'm gonna try and make it quick
so we can all get to the bar.

711
00:39:48,115 --> 00:39:50,242
Okay?

712
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,062
I first met a young Jim Gordon

713
00:39:53,304 --> 00:39:55,421
when he was a, uh...

714
00:39:55,497 --> 00:39:57,493
pain-in-the-ass, moralistic

715
00:39:57,556 --> 00:39:59,642
rookie detective.

716
00:39:59,922 --> 00:40:03,469
In the years since, he's evolved
into a pain-in-the-ass,

717
00:40:03,555 --> 00:40:06,125
moralistic captain.

718
00:40:06,422 --> 00:40:09,113
I'd say he's my best friend,

719
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:12,097
but in truth, he's my<i> only</i> friend.

720
00:40:14,475 --> 00:40:16,567
So we'll skip that.

721
00:40:17,136 --> 00:40:19,335
Uh, on to Lee.

722
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,929
Lee's always had his back.

723
00:40:22,147 --> 00:40:24,241
Except for the time
when she was infected

724
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:27,569
with the crazy-making virus
and she tried to kill him,

725
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,666
but that's love.

726
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,643
But I will say,

727
00:40:31,713 --> 00:40:33,648
if there's one beautiful thing
that's happened

728
00:40:33,726 --> 00:40:37,288
over these last few crazy years,

729
00:40:37,344 --> 00:40:40,700
it's that these two people
met each other.

730
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:43,575
And that truly is...

731
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:45,607
a beautiful thing.

732
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:48,911
Jim, will you please take Lee's hand?

733
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:55,495
Do you, Jim Gordon,
take Lee Thompkins to be

734
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,291
your lawfully wedded wife,

735
00:40:57,419 --> 00:40:59,219
to have and to hold,

736
00:40:59,277 --> 00:41:01,111
from this day forward,

737
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:03,336
for better, for worse,

738
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:05,505
for richer, for poorer,

739
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,325
in sickness and in health,

740
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:11,138
to love and cherish

741
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:13,271
till death do you part?

742
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,733
I do.

743
00:41:17,656 --> 00:41:19,740
And you, Lee Thompkins,
do you do the same?

744
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:22,772
Sure, Harvey.

745
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,034
I do.

746
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:29,643
By the power vested in me...

747
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,688
by absolutely no one...

748
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:36,128
...I now pronounce you

749
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:39,071
husband and wife.

750
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,446
What?

751
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:26,925
And now Jim Gordon and Lee Thompkins

752
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:29,449
are man and wife.

753
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:33,746
Thank God you held the
city together so that

754
00:42:33,816 --> 00:42:36,524
this blessed event could take place.

755
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,311
It was never gonna work.

756
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:43,436
What?

757
00:42:43,513 --> 00:42:46,427
Controlling the gangs
was not a backup plan.

758
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:49,075
You... saw a chance

759
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:52,271
to convince James Gordon
that you had changed.

760
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,227
But he will never see you

761
00:42:55,313 --> 00:42:58,055
as anything but a dangerous woman

762
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:00,119
keeping his child from him.

763
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:02,251
Then I'd best be long gone

764
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:04,649
before he can do anything about it.

765
00:43:06,743 --> 00:43:10,641
He will hunt you
till the ends of the earth.

766
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:16,756
Let him.

767
00:43:17,983 --> 00:43:21,780
