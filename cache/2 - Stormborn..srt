1
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,731
On a night like this,
you came into the world.

2
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,057
I remember that storm.

3
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,646
All the dogs in King's Landing
howled through the night.

4
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,480
I wish I could remember it.

5
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,446
I always thought
this would be a homecoming.

6
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,276
Doesn't feel like home.

7
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,454
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

8
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,700
Good.

9
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,075
Not so many lions.

10
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,877
Cersei controls fewer than
half the Seven Kingdoms.

11
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,167
The lords of Westeros despise her.

12
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,589
Even before your arrival,

13
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,009
they plotted against her. Now...

14
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,712
They cry out for their true queen?

15
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,593
They drink secret toasts to my health?

16
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,161
People used to tell my brother
that sort of thing,

17
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,848
and he was stupid enough
to believe them.

18
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,483
If Viserys had three dragons

19
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,185
and an army at his back,

20
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,191
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

21
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,773
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you,

22
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,154
but you're not here
to be queen of the ashes.

23
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,745
No.

24
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,989
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

25
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,120
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

26
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,544
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

27
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,041
the game is won.

28
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,003
With the Tyrell army
and the Dornish on our side,

29
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,925
we have powerful allies in the South.

30
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,242
I never properly thanked you for that.

31
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,598
They joined our side, my queen,

32
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,892
because they believe in you.

33
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,479
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

34
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,727
I did.

35
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,729
And then you served the man
who overthrew him.

36
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,900
I had a choice, Your Grace.

37
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,229
Serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's ax.

38
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,405
But you didn't serve him long.

39
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,027
You turned against him.

40
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,446
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

41
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,285
There have been few rulers in history

42
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,241
as cruel as the Mad King.

43
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,827
Robert was neither mad nor cruel,

44
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,459
he simply had no interest
in being king.

45
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,916
So, you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

46
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,550
Your Grace...

47
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,425
When I was ready to drink myself
into a small coffin,

48
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,452
Lord Varys told me
about a queen in the east who...

49
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,842
Before I came to power,

50
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,594
you favoured my brother.

51
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,015
All your spies, your little birds,

52
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,352
did they tell you Viserys was
cruel, stupid and weak?

53
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,981
Would those qualities
have made for a good king,

54
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,531
in your learned opinion?

55
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,027
Until your marriage
to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

56
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,328
I knew nothing about you,

57
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,873
save your existence and that
you were said to be beautiful.

58
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,079
So, you and your friends
traded me like a prized horse

59
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,456
to the Dothraki.

60
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,458
Which you turned to your advantage.

61
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,505
Who gave the order to kill me?

62
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,011
King Robert.

63
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,388
Who hired the assassins?

64
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,643
Who sent word to Essos
to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

65
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,847
Your Grace, I did
what had to be done to...

66
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,022
To keep yourself alive.

67
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,270
Lord Varys has proven himself
a loyal servant.

68
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,193
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

69
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,895
If he dislikes one monarch,

70
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,981
he conspires to crown the next one.

71
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,067
What kind of servant is that?

72
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,277
The kind the realm needs.

73
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,580
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

74
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,750
As long as I have my eyes,
I'll use them.

75
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,294
I wasn't born into a great house.

76
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,089
I came from nothing.

77
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,009
I was sold as a slave,
and carved up as an offering.

78
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,343
When I was a child,

79
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,713
I lived in alleys, gutters,
abandoned houses.

80
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,307
You wish to know
where my true loyalties lie?

81
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,430
Not with any king or queen,

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,681
but with the people.

83
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,021
The people who suffer under despots

84
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,598
and prosper under just rule.

85
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,934
The people whose hearts
you aim to win.

86
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,819
If you demand blind allegiance,

87
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,490
I respect your wishes.

88
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,363
Grey Worm can behead me,
or your dragons can devour me.

89
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,244
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

90
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,372
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne,

91
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,748
because I choose you.

92
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,545
Because I know that people have
no better chance than you.

93
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,926
Swear this to me, Varys.

94
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,731
If you ever think
I'm failing the people,

95
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,934
you won't conspire behind my back.

96
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,715
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

97
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,731
and you'll tell me
how I'm failing them.

98
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,655
I swear it, my queen.

99
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,034
And I swear this.

100
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,081
If you ever betray me,
I'll burn you alive.

101
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,379
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

102
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,516
Forgive me, my queen.

103
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,562
A red priestess from Asshai
has come to see you.

104
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Episode 2 - Stormborn.

105
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,945
Queen Daenerys.

106
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,871
I was a slave once,

107
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,456
bought and sold,

108
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,416
scourged and branded.

109
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,161
It is an honour to meet
the Breaker of Chains.

110
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,549
The red priests helped
bring peace to Meereen.

111
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,509
You are very welcome here.

112
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,258
What is your name?

113
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,089
I am called Melisandre.

114
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,760
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

115
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,893
It didn't end well
for Stannis Baratheon, did it?

116
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,061
No. It didn't.

117
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,019
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

118
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,396
We've just decided to pardon

119
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,107
those who once served the wrong king.

120
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,350
The Lord of Light
doesn't have many followers

121
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,956
in Westeros, does he?

122
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,249
Not yet.

123
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,961
But even those who don't worship
the Lord can serve his cause.

124
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,834
What does your Lord expect from me?

125
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,173
The Long Night is coming.

126
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,836
Only the prince who was promised
can bring the dawn.

127
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,638
"The prince who was
promised will bring the dawn."

128
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,971
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

129
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,144
Your Grace, forgive me,
but your translation

130
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,347
is not quite accurate.

131
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,024
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian.

132
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,023
So, the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

133
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,856
"The prince or princess
who was promised"

134
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,315
"will bring the dawn."

135
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,401
Doesn't really
roll off the tongue, does it?

136
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,861
No, but I like it better.

137
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,535
And you believe
this prophecy refers to me?

138
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,241
Prophecies are dangerous things.

139
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,545
I believe you have a role to play.

140
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,129
As does another,
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

141
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,425
Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?

142
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,675
You know him?

143
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,091
I travelled with him to the Wall

144
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,454
when he joined the Night's Watch.

145
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,060
And why do you think
the Lord of Light

146
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,853
singled out this Jon Snow?

147
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,556
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

148
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,313
As Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

149
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,690
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

150
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,273
to protect them from grave danger.

151
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,447
As King in the North,

152
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,159
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

153
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,703
so together they may face
their common enemy.

154
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,702
He sounds like quite a man.

155
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,162
Summon Jon Snow.

156
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,413
Let him stand before you

157
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,541
and tell you the things
that have happened to him.

158
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,749
The things he has seen
with his own eyes.

159
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,127
I can't speak to prophecies

160
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,929
or visions in the flames,

161
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,678
but I like Jon Snow,
and I trusted him.

162
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,097
And I am an excellent judge
of character.

163
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,562
If he does rule the North,

164
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,731
he would make a valuable ally.

165
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,725
The Lannisters executed his father,

166
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,903
and conspired to murder his brother.

167
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,106
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

168
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,117
Very well. Send a raven north.

169
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,040
Tell Jon Snow
that his queen invites him

170
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,709
to come to Dragonstone.

171
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,708
And bend the knee.

172
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,591
Gather 'round. Come here.

173
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,101
You think it's really Tyrion?

174
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,056
It could be someone
trying to lure you into a trap.

175
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,857
Read the last bit.

176
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,274
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

177
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,364
What does that mean?

178
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,157
It's something he said to me
the first night we met.

179
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,369
You know him better than any of us.

180
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,580
What do you think?

181
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,670
Tyrion's not like
the other Lannisters.

182
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,041
He was always kind to me.

183
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,465
But it's too great a risk.

184
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,713
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed"

185
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,886
"as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne."

186
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,010
"Join us. Together we can
end her tyranny."

187
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,016
Sounds like a charmer.

188
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,348
Of course, the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

189
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,980
a legion of Unsullied
and three dragons,

190
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,981
a bit less charming.

191
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,856
What?

192
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,908
Fire kills wights, you told me.

193
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,326
What breathes fire?

194
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,493
You're not suggesting
Jon meet with her?

195
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,291
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

196
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,874
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

197
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,880
do we have enough men to fight them?

198
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,091
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

199
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,093
she'll destroy the realm
as we know it.

200
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,389
Some of you are Bannerman
of House Tyrell.

201
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,347
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the Crown.

202
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,140
With their help,

203
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,816
the Mad King's daughter has ferried

204
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,270
an army of savages to our shores.

205
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,445
Mindless Unsullied soldiers

206
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,989
who will destroy your castles
and your holdfasts.

207
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,369
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

208
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,242
rape and enslave your women,

209
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,040
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

210
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,493
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards

211
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,125
centuries of service and loyalty.

212
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,048
You all remember the Mad King.

213
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,252
You remember the horrors
he inflicted upon his people.

214
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,429
His daughter is no different.

215
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,303
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

216
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,387
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

217
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,314
And when she grew bored of that,

218
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,188
she fed them to her dragons.

219
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,315
It is my solemn duty to protect
the people,

220
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,113
and I will,
but I need your help, my lords.

221
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,071
We must stand together, all of us,

222
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,029
if we hope to stop her.

223
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,624
She has three
full-grown dragons, Your Grace.

224
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,834
The same as Aegon when
he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.

225
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,633
How do you propose to stop them?

226
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:34,349
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

227
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,315
Lord Tarly.

228
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,864
Ser Jaime.

229
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,613
- I believe you know my son.
- Ser Jaime.

230
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,111
Rickard, isn't it?

231
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,742
- Dickon.
- That's it.

232
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,745
Thank you for coming.

233
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,955
The other lords of the Reach
look to you for guidance,

234
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,453
now more than ever.

235
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,129
They might not have come
if you hadn't.

236
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,458
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

237
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,260
And I've heard what she does
to those who defy her.

238
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,599
You ride for Horn Hill today?

239
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,426
I have an army to mobilize.

240
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,430
Won't be long
before the fighting starts.

241
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,856
And which side
will you be fighting for?

242
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,186
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle,

243
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,862
not even Rhaegar Targaryen...

244
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,940
It's a long ride back
to the Reach, Ser Jaime.

245
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,115
How may I serve?

246
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,031
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

247
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,238
I want you
to swear allegiance to Cersei,

248
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,166
and I want you to help me
destroy her enemies.

249
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,083
All her enemies.

250
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,253
Including Olenna Tyrell.

251
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,250
I'm a Tarly.

252
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,085
That name means something.

253
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,881
We're not Oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

254
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,682
We don't stab our rivals in the back

255
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,261
or cut their throats at weddings.

256
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,312
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

257
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,860
You swore an oath to
the Crown as well, Lord Tarly.

258
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,489
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

259
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,825
She was a great woman, once.

260
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,903
Now, she's broken.

261
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,488
She wants revenge so badly

262
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,790
she brought the Dothraki
to our shores.

263
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,460
The Dothraki, in Westeros,
for the first time in history.

264
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,715
I know you don't like my sister.

265
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,002
But you have to make a choice.

266
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,755
Do you fight with us,

267
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,966
or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

268
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,181
When the war is won,

269
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,562
the queen will need
a new Warden of the South.

270
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,939
I can think of no better man
than Randyll Tarly.

271
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,160
The infection
has spread too far.

272
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,824
You should have cut off your arm

273
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,576
the moment you were touched.

274
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,417
How long?

275
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,717
Be years before it kills you.
Could be 10, could be 20.

276
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,010
But how long until...

277
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,214
Your mind?

278
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,221
Six months, maybe fewer.

279
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,769
Um...

280
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,068
Um, pardon, Archmaester.

281
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,739
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

282
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,744
She had the greyscale
as a baby and was cured.

283
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,541
- No.
- Isn't there some way...

284
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,415
Does this look
like a baby to you?

285
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,505
No.

286
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,956
Have you studied the varying
rates of greyscale progression

287
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,837
in infants and fully-grown men?

288
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,760
No.

289
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,138
Maester Cressen discovered

290
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,808
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

291
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,969
This is quite advanced.

292
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,149
And beyond our skills, ser.

293
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,359
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

294
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,066
to live out your life
with the stone men.

295
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,571
As an anointed knight,

296
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,405
I'll allow you one more day.

297
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,079
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

298
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,375
Come, Samwell.

299
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,507
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...

300
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,093
Jorah.

301
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,516
Jorah Mormont.

302
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,147
- Mormont?
- There's no need.

303
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,437
I've been dead to them for years.

304
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,734
Come, Samwell!

305
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,872
Have you ever
been down here, Your Grace?

306
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,628
No, I can't say I have.

307
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,007
I haven't seen these
since Robert had them removed

308
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,304
from the throne room.

309
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,134
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

310
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,344
They were his trophies.

311
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,498
He couldn't keep them around,

312
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,434
they would have made him look small.

313
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,192
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

314
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,656
I believe he brought his
on occasion.

315
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,239
Balerion the Dread.

316
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,665
The beast that Aegon rode
across the sea.

317
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,539
His flames forged the Iron Throne,

318
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,501
and brought the Seven Kingdoms
to heel.

319
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,803
Powerful.

320
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,471
But not invincible.

321
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:10,856
Apparently, one of Daenerys'
dragons was wounded by spears

322
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,024
in the fighting pits of Meereen.

323
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,694
And if they can be wounded,

324
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,113
they can be killed.

325
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,239
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

326
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,117
have been labouring
day and night, Your Grace.

327
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,289
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

328
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,189
If you want the Iron Throne,

329
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,770
take it.

330
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,401
We have an army, a fleet
and three dragons.

331
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,573
We should hit
King's Landing now, hard,

332
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,942
with everything we have.

333
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,197
The city will fall within a day.

334
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,619
If we turn the dragons loose,

335
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,538
tens of thousands will die
in the firestorms.

336
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,865
It's called war.

337
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,168
You don't have the stomach
for it, scurry back into hiding.

338
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,495
I know how you wage war.

339
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,999
We don't poison little girls here.

340
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,295
- Myrcella was innocent.
- She was a Lannister.

341
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,503
There are no innocent Lannisters.

342
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,464
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

343
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,594
That's enough.

344
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,059
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen,

345
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,556
you will treat him with respect.

346
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,017
I am not here
to be queen of the ashes.

347
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,192
That's very nice to hear.

348
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,989
Of course, I can't remember a queen

349
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,988
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

350
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,571
The common people loved her,
the nobles loved her.

351
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,201
And what is left of her now?

352
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,123
Ashes.

353
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,838
Commoners, nobles, they're all
just children, really.

354
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,379
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

355
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,407
I'm grateful to you,
Lady Olenna, for your counsel.

356
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,717
I'm grateful to all of you.

357
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,138
But you have chosen to follow me.

358
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,473
I will not attack King's Landing.

359
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,351
We will not attack King's Landing.

360
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,109
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

361
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,436
By asking nicely?

362
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,842
We will lay siege to the capital,

363
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,573
surrounding the city on all sides.

364
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,363
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

365
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,911
but no food for her army
or the people.

366
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,785
But we won't use
Dothraki and Unsullied.

367
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,787
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

368
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,334
by appealing to their loyalty,

369
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,911
their love for their country.

370
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,879
If we besiege the city
with foreigners,

371
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,623
we prove her point.

372
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,379
Our army should be Westerosi.

373
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,552
And I suppose
we're providing the Westerosi?

374
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,011
You are.

375
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,391
Lady Greyjoy will
escort you home to Sunspear.

376
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,142
And her Iron Fleet
will ferry the Dornish army

377
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,349
back up to King's Landing.

378
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,101
The Dornish will lay siege
to the capital,

379
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,106
alongside the Tyrell army.

380
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,860
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

381
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:11,036
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

382
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,328
Forgive me for asking,

383
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,451
but why did you bother
to bring your own?

384
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:19,002
The Unsullied
will have another objective.

385
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,579
For decades, House Lannister has been

386
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,414
the true power in Westeros

387
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,502
and the seat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

388
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,006
Grey Worm and the Unsullied
will sail for the Rock,

389
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,506
and take it.

390
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,152
Do I have your support?

391
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,787
You have mine.

392
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,788
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

393
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,963
Thank you, all.

394
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,459
Lady Olenna,
may I speak with you alone?

395
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,516
I realize you're here
out of hatred for Cersei

396
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,598
and not love for me.

397
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,275
But I swear to you, she will pay
for what she's done.

398
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,191
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

399
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,564
Peace?

400
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,866
Do you think that's what we had
under your father?

401
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,659
Or his father? Or his?

402
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,281
Peace never lasts, my dear.

403
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,245
Will you take a bit of advice
from an old woman?

404
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,128
He's a clever man, your Hand.

405
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,920
I've known a great many clever men.

406
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,876
I've outlived them all.

407
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,882
You know why?

408
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,338
I ignored them.

409
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,054
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

410
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,806
Are you a sheep?

411
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,856
No. You're a dragon.

412
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,475
Be a dragon.

413
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,621
You leave tomorrow.

414
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,080
Were you going to say goodbye?

415
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,711
I will see you when I return.

416
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,252
But you don't know when that will be.

417
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,633
No one knows.

418
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,638
I wish you good fortune.

419
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,342
Missandei.

420
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,819
It is hard for me
to say goodbye to you.

421
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,108
Why?

422
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,074
- You know why.
- I don't.

423
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,701
You are my weakness.

424
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,581
That's what I am? Your weakness?

425
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:09,756
When Unsullied are young,
the masters learn their fears.

426
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,505
One boy is scared of dogs,

427
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,961
one boy hates high places.

428
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,671
One is frightened of the ocean.

429
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:22,177
They make the boy sleep
with dogs, or climb a cliff.

430
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,978
They throw him in the water.

431
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,898
If he learns to swim, good.

432
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,850
If he drowns, good.

433
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,904
Either way, strong Unsullied.

434
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,403
But I had no fears.

435
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,575
I was never the biggest,

436
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,324
never the strongest,

437
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,822
but I was bravest.

438
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,997
Always.

439
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,246
I believe it.

440
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:51,172
Until I meet Missandei
from the Isle of Naath.

441
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,968
Now, I have fear.

442
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,555
I do, too.

443
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:18,964
No.

444
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,964
I want to see you.

445
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,342
Please.

446
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,862
Might be useful.

447
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:03,816
Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,
but an excellent researcher.

448
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,992
- Archmaester, I wondered if I...
- And this one.

449
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,035
Maester Faull was quite the opposite.

450
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,157
A brilliant stylist

451
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,955
who invented
half the stories he tells.

452
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,327
Um, I wanted to ask you...

453
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,079
If you're going to write
histories, Tarly,

454
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,751
you have to do the research.

455
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,578
If you want people
to read your histories,

456
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,505
you need a bit of style.

457
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,924
I'm not writing
A Chronicle of the Wars

458
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,797
Following the Death of King Robert I

459
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,879
so it can sit on a shelf unread.

460
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,641
What? You don't like the title?

461
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,099
What would you call it, then?

462
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,476
Mmm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

463
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,149
We're not poets, Tarly.

464
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,547
Archmaester, if I could
just have a moment...

465
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,609
This is your moment. Use it wisely.

466
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,739
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

467
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,242
There are two recorded cases

468
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,994
of advanced greyscale being cured.

469
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,121
I found the procedure
in the study of rare diseases

470
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,211
by Archmaester Pylos.

471
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,288
I am familiar
with Archmaester Pylos

472
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,418
and his study of rare diseases.

473
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,420
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

474
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,422
And should I tell you how he died?

475
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,796
From greyscale.

476
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,177
- Oh.
- Procedure's far too dangerous,

477
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,554
which is why it's now forbidden.

478
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,346
Hello.

479
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,268
What are you doing?

480
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:06,150
You're Jorah Mormont,
the only son of Jeor Mormont.

481
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,365
My name is Samwell Tarly,

482
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,321
sworn brother of the Night's Watch,

483
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,994
training to serve as maester
at Castle Black.

484
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,197
I knew your father.

485
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,410
I was with him when he died.

486
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,165
You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.

487
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,721
Drink this.

488
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,552
- What is it?
- Rum.

489
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,727
Drink it all, please. I'm afraid
this is going to hurt.

490
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,873
If you could take off your shirt...

491
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,714
If you wouldn't mind,

492
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,050
bite down hard.

493
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,102
I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,

494
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,428
and if they hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

495
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,730
Have you ever done this before?

496
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,284
No.

497
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,490
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

498
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,915
Have a seat.

499
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,882
I'm going to have to remove

500
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,676
the entire upper layer
of infected tissue,

501
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,469
then apply a medicinal ointment
to the...

502
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,983
Again, I'm sorry.

503
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,989
Please try not to scream.

504
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,013
They say her dragons
are bigger than Aegon's.

505
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,341
Cersei's just
trying to frighten us.

506
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,266
I hope it's true.

507
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,345
If she lays siege to King's Landing,

508
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,554
prices will triple.

509
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,186
As long as we get back there
before they start.

510
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,230
One more round. It's a long ride.

511
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,774
Arry!

512
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,947
Hello, Hot Pie.

513
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,275
Sit down.

514
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,032
Who's that for?

515
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,539
Mmm. This is good.

516
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,834
You think so?

517
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,510
The secret is browning the butter

518
00:34:58,597 --> 00:34:59,804
before making the dough.

519
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,346
Most people don't do that

520
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,049
'cause it takes up too much time.

521
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,259
Hmm. I didn't do that.

522
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,686
You've been making pies?

523
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,971
One or two.

524
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,938
Can't believe you're here.

525
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,312
Did you meet the big lady?

526
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,482
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

527
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,882
You know, I figured she was a knight

528
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,942
'cause she had armour on.

529
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,319
She was looking for your sister,

530
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,490
but I told her about you.

531
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,118
She ever find you?

532
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,121
She found me.

533
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,586
What happened to you, Arry?

534
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,139
You got any ale?

535
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,611
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

536
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,987
Why?

537
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,194
Heard Cersei's queen now.

538
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,619
Heard she blew up the Great Sept.

539
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,196
That must have been something to see.

540
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,156
- Boom.
- Hmm.

541
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,451
I can't believe
someone would do that.

542
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,660
Cersei would do that.

543
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,044
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

544
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,251
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

545
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,837
No. The Boltons are dead.

546
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,177
What?

547
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,707
Jon Snow came down from Castle Black

548
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,136
with a wildling army and won
the Battle of the Bastards.

549
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,516
He's King of the North now.

550
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,144
You're lying.

551
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,977
Why would I lie about that?
He's your brother, right?

552
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,739
Thanks for the pie.

553
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,029
Friends don't pay.

554
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,831
Can't believe I thought
you were a boy.

555
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,908
You're pretty.

556
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,794
Thanks.

557
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,131
Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.

558
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,637
Try not to get killed.

559
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,724
Ah, I won't.

560
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,551
- I'm like you, Arry.
- I'm a survivor.

561
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,227
200 miles to King's Landing.

562
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,388
Come in.

563
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,557
A raven, my king.

564
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,357
From the Citadel.

565
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,037
This message was sent to me
by Samwell Tarly.

566
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,831
He was my brother
at the Night's Watch,

567
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:18,582
a man I trust as much as anyone
in this world.

568
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,872
He's discovered proof

569
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,959
that Dragonstone sits
on a mountain of dragonglass.

570
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:33,225
I received this a few days ago

571
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,223
from Dragonstone.

572
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,807
It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

573
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,441
He is now Hand of the Queen
to Daenerys Targaryen.

574
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,859
She intends to take the Iron Throne

575
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,566
from Cersei Lannister.

576
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,743
She has a powerful army at her back,

577
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,116
and if this message is to be believed,

578
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,368
three dragons.

579
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,210
Lord Tyrion has invited me
to Dragonstone

580
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,878
to meet with Daenerys.

581
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,623
And I'm going to accept.

582
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,676
We need this dragonglass, my lords.

583
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,596
We know that dragonglass can destroy

584
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,643
both White Walkers and their army.

585
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,970
We need to mine it

586
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,934
and turn it into weapons.

587
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,358
But more importantly, we need allies.

588
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,688
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

589
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,273
We can't defeat them on our own.

590
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,654
We don't have the numbers.

591
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,908
Daenerys has her own army,
and she has dragon fire.

592
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,241
I need to try and persuade her
to fight with us.

593
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,285
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

594
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,749
then sail for Dragonstone.

595
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,120
Have you forgotten what happened

596
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,836
to our grandfather?

597
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,009
The Mad King invited him
to King's Landing

598
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,257
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

599
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,213
She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne

600
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,515
and the Seven Kingdoms.

601
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,263
The North
is one of those seven kingdoms.

602
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,095
This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.

603
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,349
It could be.

604
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,477
But I don't believe
Tyrion would do that.

605
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,854
You know him. He's a good man.

606
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,278
Your Grace, with respect,
I must agree with Lady Sansa.

607
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,736
I remember the Mad King all too well.

608
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,068
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

609
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,370
Nor can a Lannister.

610
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,241
We called your brother king.

611
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,749
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

612
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,247
Winter is here, Your Grace.

613
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,926
We need the King in the North
in the North.

614
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,480
You all crowned me your king.

615
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,981
I never wanted it.

616
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,029
I never asked for it.

617
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,697
But I accepted it
because the North is my home.

618
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,905
It's part of me and I will never
stop fighting for it,

619
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,911
no matter the odds.

620
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,127
But the odds are against us.

621
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,208
None of you have seen
the Army of the Dead,

622
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,302
none of you.

623
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:16,256
We can never hope
to defeat them alone.

624
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,433
We need allies, powerful allies.

625
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,058
I know it's a risk.

626
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,482
But I have to take it.

627
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,185
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

628
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,611
Daenerys is a queen.

629
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,940
Only a king can convince her
to help us.

630
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,033
It has to be me.

631
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,907
You're abandoning your people.
You're abandoning your home.

632
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,408
I'm leaving both in good hands.

633
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,990
- Whose?
- Yours.

634
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,369
You are my sister.

635
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,419
You're the only Stark in Winterfell.

636
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,170
Until I return, the North is yours.

637
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,615
I delivered his bones myself.

638
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,911
I presented them to Lady Catelyn

639
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,159
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

640
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,082
It seems like a lifetime ago.

641
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,250
Do give Lord Tyrion my best
when you see him.

642
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,879
I was sorry when he died.

643
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,549
Your father and I had our differences,

644
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,220
but he loved Cat very much.

645
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,266
So did I.

646
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,266
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

647
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,981
Well, it appears
she vastly underestimated you.

648
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,564
Your father and brothers are gone,

649
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,024
yet here you stand, King in the North.

650
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,278
Last best hope
against the coming storm.

651
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,368
You don't belong down here.

652
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,420
Forgive me.

653
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,962
We haven't ever talked properly.

654
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,010
I wanted to remedy that.

655
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,055
I have nothing to say to you.

656
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,259
Not even, "Thank you"?

657
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,604
If it weren't for me,

658
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,975
you'd have been slaughtered
on that battlefield.

659
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,892
You have many enemies, my king,
but I swear to you,

660
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,647
I'm not one of them.

661
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,823
I love Sansa as I loved her mother.

662
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,129
Touch my sister,
and I'll kill you myself.

663
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,778
Nymeria?

664
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,467
Nymeria, it's me, Arya.

665
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,762
I'm heading north, girl.

666
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,517
Back to Winterfell,
I'm finally going home.

667
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,768
Come with me.

668
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,037
Come with me.

669
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,605
That's not you.

670
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,874
You can't have them all.
It's not fair.

671
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,454
I'm oldest.

672
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,460
Mama will want Cersei for herself.

673
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,459
She's not my mama.

674
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,544
You can have Cersei.

675
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,175
I want the Mountain.

676
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:17,009
The Mountain killed Father.
He'll crush you with one hand.

677
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,766
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

678
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,063
Will you shut up about Mama?

679
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,981
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

680
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,527
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing,

681
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,104
and then I won't have to share.

682
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,736
- "Mama!"
- "Mama!"

683
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,736
How can you drink this piss?

684
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,038
When we reach Sunspear,

685
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:42,914
I'll treat you to a Dornish red,
the best in the world.

686
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,913
- Have you ever been to Dorne?
- A few times.

687
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,508
Never stayed long.

688
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,254
A boy in every port?

689
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,711
A boy, a girl.

690
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,722
Depends on the port.

691
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,094
Could we get some more?

692
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,894
I thought it wasn't for you.

693
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,976
I'm developing a taste for it.

694
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,646
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

695
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:17,661
So, you're gonna be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

696
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,282
Once I kill my uncle.

697
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,535
And what will you be, handsome?

698
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,541
Whatever my queen commands.

699
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:27,333
He'll be my advisor. And my protector.

700
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:28,539
Oh, I see.

701
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,003
Your protector.

702
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,219
So, if someone gets too close
to you...

703
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,848
- He might have to intervene.
- To hold that person back.

704
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,176
Until they've made
their intentions known.

705
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,984
Why are you standing
all the way over there, then?

706
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,192
A foreign invasion is underway.

707
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,062
Leave him be.

708
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,742
Seems like you don't need a protector.

709
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,867
Stay here.

710
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,237
Euron.

711
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,048
You mother's below deck.
Keep her safe.

712
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,466
Kill us.

713
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,009
Get it over with.

714
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,326
Give your uncle a kiss.

715
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,861
Little Theon!

716
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,798
Ah, come on, you coward.

717
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:12,049
I have her. Come and get her.
