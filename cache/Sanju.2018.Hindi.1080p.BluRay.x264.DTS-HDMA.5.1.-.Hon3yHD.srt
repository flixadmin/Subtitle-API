1
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:23,374
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,124
thank you for being here.

3
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:27,124
It's a joyous day for me,

4
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,332
because my autobiography,

5
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,499
is being released.

6
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,707
I'm a very... misunderstood man.

7
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,957
If you want to know
the real Sanjay Dutt,

8
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,124
read my autobiography.

9
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,707
It's my story, but written by
my buddy, DN Tripathi.

10
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:50,374
And he wishes that
I read you a chapter.

11
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,249
Chapter one...

12
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:56,874
Bapu and Sanju.

13
00:03:58,249 --> 00:04:00,207
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

14
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,624
And, Sanju...
yours truly... Sanjay Dutt.

15
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,749
Our lives have followed
quite a... similar graph.

16
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,749
- Hey, Tripathi...
- Yes.

17
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,957
Killer opening!
Moved me to tears.

18
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,291
Your wish is my command.
I've put my soul into it.

19
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,624
Mohammad... Sudama...
come here.

20
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,874
Tripathi has written
a rump-ripping book.

21
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:26,957
Read us a chapter.
Nanny, take a seat.

22
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,791
The book is titled “Sage Sanju...

23
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,249
Chapter one...

24
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,374
Bapu and Sanju.

25
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,124
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

26
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,499
And, Sanju...
yours truly... Sanjay Dutt.

27
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,249
Our lives have followed
quite a similar graph.

28
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,957
For instance... we've both spent
a lot of time in prison.

29
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,999
He's a national hero.

30
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,332
I'm a Bollywood hero.

31
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:55,332
He was against violence.

32
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,332
He walked with a stick
but never used it as a weapon.

33
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:04,374
I had an AK-56 rifle
and never used it either.

34
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,624
He dreamed of a free India.

35
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,624
I dream of... my freedom.

36
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,082
Maanayata, it's a slow starter.

37
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:16,624
Don't worry,
the story picks up later.

38
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:24,457
Hold this...

39
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,999
pick up the bell... ring it.

40
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:30,124
Go around and worship me.

41
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:34,249
You've elevated me
to Mahatma Gandhi in the first chapter.

42
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,499
By the end,
you'll turn me into God!

43
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,749
Find a temple for sale.

44
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,999
He'll put me on the altar.

45
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,874
Sorry... sorry.

46
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,624
Buddy, tell me...

47
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,499
are shoes allowed
inside a temple?

48
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:53,082
Not at all, Sanju.

49
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,874
Then how dare you wear shoes
in front of God?

50
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,999
Sanju... I'd told you,
I'm no biographer.

51
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,832
I'm a songwriter...

52
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:05,999
Sanju, stop it.

53
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,707
Sanju... please!

54
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,624
What about me
reminds you of Gandhi?

55
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:19,749
I'll write another draft.

56
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:23,207
<i>Shithead, you jacked my book!</i>

57
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,082
<i>Our correspondent is outside
the Supreme Court.</i>

58
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:31,124
<i>In moments, we'll know
whether the actor Sanjay Dutt,</i>

59
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,499
<i>will go to prison or be free.</i>

60
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:38,124
<i>In 2006, the Anti-Terrorism Court
had sentenced Sanjay Dutt</i>

61
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,624
<i>to six years imprisonment
in the Mumbai bomb blast case.</i>

62
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,499
<i>He'd appealed to the Supreme Court
against the judgment.</i>

63
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:50,082
<i>The judgment was expected
next week.</i>

64
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,666
<i>But, we've just received information...</i>

65
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,624
<i>the Supreme Court
will give its verdict today.</i>

66
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,832
<i>Stay tuned, as we report live
from the Supreme Court.</i>

67
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,332
<i>Dinesh, give us an update.</i>

68
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:06,249
<i>The verdict is out.
Sanjay Dutt will go to prison.</i>

69
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:09,082
<i>The Court has sentenced him
to five years,</i>

70
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:12,041
<i>for possession of an AK-56 rifle.</i>

71
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,999
<i>When does he go to prison?</i>

72
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,999
<i>The Court has given him
a month to surrender...</i>

73
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:22,374
<i>so he can complete his films.</i>

74
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,624
<i>His father, late Sunil Dutt,
popular actor and politician...</i>

75
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:29,999
<i>his mother, late Nargis,
iconic actor of the</i> '603...

76
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:34,082
<i>the scion of this eminent family,
Sanjay, will go to prison.</i>

77
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,582
<i>Let's hear what people have to say.</i>

78
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,624
<i>Five years is nothing.
He should be hanged!</i>

79
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,124
<i>Traitor... a bloody terrorist!</i>

80
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,457
<i>Celebrities have it easy.</i>

81
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,999
<i>Such terrorists
should be shot dead!</i>

82
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:03,374
Come inside.

83
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,249
<i>Dear Maanayata...</i>

84
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,499
<i>When the kids start school,</i>

85
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,499
<i>they are sure to be asked...</i>

86
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:26,624
<i>"Where's your terrorist-dad?
In prison?“</i>

87
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,582
<i>It'll be easier for them to say,
"No, he's dead."</i>

88
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,207
<i>Sanju!</i>

89
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:51,582
Suicide may solve your problem,

90
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:53,499
not your kids“.

91
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:58,499
They'll still be called
terrorist's kids.

92
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,374
We decided to fight,
didn't we?

93
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,749
That we'll get the truth out there.

94
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,124
Didn't we try?

95
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,499
What did we get?
Bapu and Sanju!

96
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,666
That's what you get
with knuckleheads.

97
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,166
Write it yourself.

98
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,749
Struggled with a four-line
suicide note.

99
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,749
Imagine a 400-page book!

100
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,207
We'll find a good writer.

101
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,916
Why Will they be interested?

102
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,749
It's said, "Bad choices
make good stories."

103
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:33,749
And you're the king
of bad choices.

104
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,749
Some writer out there
will understand this.

105
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,249
<i>Sanju, be respectful.</i>

106
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,874
She's <i>no Tripathi.
She's Winnie Dias.</i>

107
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,624
<i>World's top biographer.</i>

108
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,707
<i>She's down from London.</i>

109
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:03,082
<i>Control slang like...
rump-ripper, jacked...</i>

110
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:05,457
Got it. Okay... bye!

111
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:19,332
Winnie...

112
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,082
I won't take much of your time.

113
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,374
I wanted...

114
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,291
I can't write your biography.
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,707
Why not?

116
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:30,249
When your wife called,

117
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,957
I asked around and...

118
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:37,707
And they said,
"I'm a terrorist."

119
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,999
Yes.

120
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,499
Who are these people?
Do they know me?

121
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,082
Do they hang outwith me?

122
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,999
Then how can they be so sure?

123
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:57,124
Their opinion is based
merely on TV and print news.

124
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,541
And these TV anchors,
newspaper reporters,

125
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,624
who dish out opinions everyday,

126
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:04,999
haven't met me either!

127
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,499
The media has maligned me.

128
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,832
So, I need a good writer
to present my side of the story.

129
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:18,582
You think millions
will read your biography?

130
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,874
It doesn't work like that.

131
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:25,624
Thousands of books
rot away in book stores.

132
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,374
Once in a blue moon
a book comes that...

133
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,874
That's a rump-ripper!

134
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,999
My story's that!

135
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,957
What's there in your life story?

136
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,749
Drugs... alcohol... guns?

137
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:43,624
Give me just one hour.
Guns... drugs... alcohol...

138
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:46,457
Pick any chapter,
I'll tell you the story...

139
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,999
I guarantee...
you'll be jacked...

140
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:54,707
I mean... jack...
it'll be a J K Rowling.

141
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,124
I have a month to surrender.

142
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,624
This time I may not survive.

143
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,957
One hour, please.

144
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:09,582
Okay.

145
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:13,874
5 pm tomorrow.
Right here.

146
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:19,249
At 6 pm, I'll tell you
if I'm jacked or not.

147
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:20,999
Done.

148
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,207
Alright.

149
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:37,499
From Amitabh Bachchan
to Sachin Tendulkar...

150
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,499
you've upset everyone.

151
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,749
Sorry?

152
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:45,957
So many heroes, but you'll pen
a terrorist's biography!

153
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:50,499
Rubbish... this is fake news.

154
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,916
He too is a fake.
This is a pressure tactic.

155
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,874
- Who are you?
- Zubin Mistry.

156
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,041
Doesn't help.

157
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,124
I'm into construction.
I construct malls.

158
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,874
I suggest you don't
write this book.

159
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,624
And you came all the way
to "suggest" it?

160
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:15,249
I'm here daily... to jog.
Saw you here, so...

161
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:18,499
Jog in a suit?
Is work-wear shorts?

162
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,999
- Listen.
- Excuse me!

163
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,541
He's dangerous.

164
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,374
Look at this.
He hit me.

165
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:27,207
He's on cocaine, LSD, heroin...

166
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:32,707
A womanizer, too.
Ask him his score.

167
00:13:32,874 --> 00:13:35,874
Any number less than 200,
he's lying.

168
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,874
Want to know his truth?
Call me.

169
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,457
Big fan.

170
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,082
Sanju.

171
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,749
For once, I feel like
thanking the press.

172
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,624
One headline... and you're here.

173
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,749
- Why did you get this printed?
- I didn't, Winnie.

174
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:11,499
Reporters live outside my gate.
They follow me everywhere.

175
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:12,999
If you were a doctor,

176
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,124
they'd print, “Sanju ill",
an actress... "Sanju's new lady.“

177
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:18,874
They want spicy headlines.
Not the truth.

178
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,041
- That's why <i>we've</i> come to you.
- Will he tell me the truth?

179
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,749
Nothing but the truth.
Fire away.

180
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,207
Okay. Alright.

181
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:32,332
Excluding your wife, how many women
have you slept with?

182
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,832
- Look here.
- Sure, of course.

183
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,707
Should I count the prostitutes or...?

184
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:45,124
No, let's keep them aside.

185
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,874
Never kept a score-card.

186
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:54,499
But once, I did the math,
I recalled around 308.

187
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:59,124
I must've missed a few.
On the safe side, let's say... 350.

188
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,457
Do you know him?

189
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,374
Zubinl
He was my friend.

190
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,624
I nicknamed him "God".

191
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,416
Since you picked him,
let's start with chapter "God".

192
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,124
My time starts now.

193
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,249
1981 my debut film.
He was always on the sets.

194
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,999
Dad was directing me
and I was nervous as hell.

195
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:36,499

Sonny, your lips are off sync.

199
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,582
Match them to the song.

200
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:55,999
And... a romantic reaction
when the girl sings.

201
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,249
But, dad... where's the girl?

202
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,624
How do I react
to a cold camera?

203
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:04,374
An actor's job is to imagine.

204
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:09,749
Imagine a beautiful actress
in front of you.

205
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:13,207
Ganpat, come here.

219
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,624

Well played, Ramu.
Ace!

229
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:42,582
Sonny...

230
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,749
- You've been smoking?
- No, dad.

231
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,374
Now you lie, too?

232
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:59,624
Thousands struggle to be
an actor... with no luck.

233
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:04,499
You've got it on a silver platter,
respect that.

234
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,624
Drinking, smoking...
will show on your face.

235
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:11,624
The camera spares no one.

236
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:17,124
Quit smoking
or I'll shelve the film.

237
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:36,624
Smoke with your left hand.
Fathers sniff the right hand.

238
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:38,374
Boys!

239
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:51,374
Bro, I'm the first actor in the world
to romance a bandit.

240
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,666
But, dad praised the cameraman.

241
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,624
<i>"We“ flayed, Ram“
Ace?</i>

242
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,957
However we” I do,
he never praises me.

243
00:18:59,624 --> 00:19:02,207
He insults me publicly.

244
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:07,499
- Reason with him.
- That would be suicide.

245
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,499
You're too scared of your dad.

246
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:13,499
Hey, try this.

247
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,749
It bumps up confidence.

248
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:21,207
Gladiators would take
this before a fight.

249
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,457
Watch.

250
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:33,249
Put this in your nose...
and snort it all.

251
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:38,249
I make my Pomeranian snort it
and he thinks he's an Alsatian.

252
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,249
Try it.

253
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,749
Sanju, not good for health.

254
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,457
Hey! I've been taking it for years.

Yes, don't sneak in
through the balcony.

298
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:18,624
I'll ring the door bell.
Wake him.

299
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,707
At this hour?

300
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:24,457
What's so important?

301
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,624
I want something, baby.

302
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,374
- Are you sure?
- Yes, baby.

303
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,332
I'll be there in five.
Open the door.

00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:36,457
Bye-

305
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,999
- Wake up your dad.
- Are you sure?

306
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:55,707
Dad, mom... wake up.
Sanju's here.

307
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,999
At 1 am?
Is everything okay?

308
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,374
Took him six months
to muster courage.

309
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:02,999
He'd said, once
his career kickstarted,

310
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,624
he'll ask for my hand.

311
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,624
Just the hand,
or all of you?

312
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,332
Dad, come on!

313
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,249
We'll ask for the
18 year-old scotch.

314
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:15,874
Will the old fart agree?

315
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,124
If he doesn't agree,
we grab and flee!

316
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,207
Hello, child.
How are you?

317
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:27,374
Before you ask for anything,
I have something for you.

318
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,749
Ten rupees?

319
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,791
My father's gift to <i>me...</i>
when I joined the Navy.

320
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:40,332
He said, "There are
two kinds of bills.“

321
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,999
"Real and fake."

322
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,999
When you tug at a real bill...

323
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,999
it won't tear.

324
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,749
You're starting your career.

325
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:56,124
Life will pull you left and right.

326
00:24:56,291 --> 00:25:01,457
But, if you stay honest,
nothing can rip you apart.

327
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:06,374
My father's wisdom is now yours.

328
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,332
Homi, let him sit.

329
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:09,832
Sit.

330
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,582
Now, tell us.

331
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,749
What brings you here?

332
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:16,874
See, daddy.

333
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:21,874
The real reason we're here is...
we have... the midnight urge.

334
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,749
Can't control it anymore.

335
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:34,874
Look, we're weak with idioms.

336
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:38,416
Tell us clearly,
what's a "midnight urge"?

337
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,249
Midnight urge means...

338
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,374
desire...

339
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,249
need... want.

340
00:25:47,124 --> 00:25:49,749
I'm 21 now.
It's a biological need.

341
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:53,582
As soon as midnight strikes...
the urge surges.

342
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:57,957
I need it now...
or I'm gonna explode!

343
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,999
But dad doesn't allow it.

344
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:04,874
He's orthodox.
So I sin in secret.

345
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:08,749
Once, I was enjoying an 18 year-old
on the terrace... dad walked in.

346
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:12,374
I told him frankly,
"Dad, I'm an adult."

347
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:15,624
"My friends do it every night.
Their parents never object."

348
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:20,291
He said, "Alright, have your
18 year-old. But don't hide."

349
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,999
"Do it openly on the dining table...
before the family.“

350
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,499
"And that too,
only once a month.“

351
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:28,707
Daddy, how will once a month
quench this thirst?

352
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,874
Now I frequent the illicit joints.

353
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:33,832
16, 18, 21
I grab whatever is available.

354
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:39,124
I park on a lonely stretch,
and indulge in the backseat.

355
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:41,249
Only fear is the cops.

356
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,874
They peek when
you're about to peak.

357
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,749
Auntie, try the backseat.
No fun!

358
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:51,707
You were a Navy Captain.

359
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:55,457
You must've tasted the best
on every shore.

360
00:26:56,874 --> 00:27:01,374
Be kind, let us taste some
from your home.

361
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,249
- May we get one each?
- What!

362
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,749
- Okay, we'll share one.
- How dare you!

363
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,832
When daddy gets the urge,
you happily serve.

364
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,791
All we get is a "How dare you!“
Sorry, I've promised my friend.

365
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,874
I'm gonna grab one.

366
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,999
Stop!

367
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,374
- Soda or water?
- I'll help myself.

368
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:31,707
Sanju, you're drunk.
Just get out!

369
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,999
And return my papa's box.

370
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:39,457
Can I say something?

371
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:42,874
Your papa was wrong.

372
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:48,124
Life doesn't just pull you
left and right.

373
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:51,457
It also pulls you up and down.

374
00:28:03,624 --> 00:28:05,999
<i>I drank all night with my friends.</i>

375
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,124
<i>And returned home in the morning.</i>

376
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,499
Good morning.

377
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,374
Good morning, dad.

378
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:20,749
I'm going for a jog.

379
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:29,832
Sit.

380
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:37,832
Sorry, sonny.
I yelled at you publicly.

381
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:42,624
I'm stressed...
couldn't control myself.

382
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,957
A request...

383
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:48,999
Please focus on your work.

384
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:53,374
Your mother should feel proud
when she sees your first film.

385
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:57,874
She may not be able
to see your next.

386
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,332
Why?

387
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,999
She has cancer
of the pancreas.

388
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:10,874
I'm taking her to New York.
Sloan Hospital.

389
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,582
Why didn't anyone tell me?

390
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:17,499
She hid it from you
so your work won't suffer.

391
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:20,374
She's been in pain all year.

392
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:23,374
But, acts fit in front of you.

393
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,124
<i>Where are you?</i>

394
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:27,999
In the dining...
Want some tea?

395
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,374
<i>Half a cup.</i>

396
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,457
Hide it.

397
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,749
Don't cry in her presence.

398
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:39,124
She's acting. So must you.
Make her happy.

399
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:42,374
Up so early?
Not bad.

400
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:46,124
Did you tell Sanju
we're off to New York?

401
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:50,124
What? Haven't shared the news?

402
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:55,374
Take a deep breath.
You're gonna be shocked.

403
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:59,124
I've been offered
a Hollywood film.

404
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,749
Now I'll mouth English dialogues.

405
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,749
My name is Bond.

406
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,999
James Bond.

407
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,999
I'm going to make him
an offer he can't refuse.

408
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,999
You talkin' to me?

409
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,457
You talkin' to me?

410
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,457
I wish they had songs
like our films.

411
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:26,624
<i>♪ This heart has lost its mate</i> I

412
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:31,124
<i>♪ No one knows
where my liver went 3'</i>

413
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,749
A song here... a dance there...

414
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,957
and the Oscar's mine!

415
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,832
You shouldn't have retired!

416
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:44,249
Retired?
I still act... don't I?

417
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,124
<i>Dad took mom to New York.</i>

418
00:31:07,124 --> 00:31:09,666
<i>And I started spending
more time with God.</i>

419
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,582
I feel your pain, man.

420
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:15,874
I was 18 when I lost my parents
in a car crash.

421
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,457
I was going to kill myself.

422
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,999
A fakir saved me.

423
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:25,707
He said, “The Lord who created pain,
also created a remedy.“

424
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:26,874
Here.

425
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:30,124
Put it under your tongue.
It'll melt away all pain.

426
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:33,374
He gets it from the Himalayas.
So it's expensive.

427
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:35,957
But, I'll send him the money.

428
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:06,249
<i>The first time I did drugs,
was 'cause I was upset with dad.</i>

429
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:09,207
<i>The second time,
'cause mom was dying.</i>

430
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,749
<i>By the third time,
I was an addict.</i>

431
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,874
<i>Then I got the news...
mom was in a coma.</i>

432
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,249
<i>Dad summoned me to America.</i>

433
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,374
<i>I traveled with my sisters...</i>

434
00:32:23,624 --> 00:32:25,457
<i>and 20 grams of cocaine.</i>

435
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:31,249
<i>Being caught at the airport,
would've meant...</i>

436
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:35,124
<i>20 years in prison...
even for my sisters.</i>

437
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:37,249
<i>But back then,
20 years in prison,</i>

438
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,999
<i>versus 20 grams of cocaine...</i>

439
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,249
<i>my choice was crystal clear.</i>

440
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,291
<i>I was so irresponsible...</i>

441
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:47,874
<i>that instead of spending
time with</i> mom,

442
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:50,416
<i>I'd smoke away in the fire exit.</i>

443
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,332
<i>Then one night,
walked into my life...</i>

444
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,957
<i>Mr. Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.</i>

445
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:19,499
- What did you steal?
- Twins... twins... twins...

446
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,999
- O Lord Ganesha!
- This is Jesus' jurisdiction.

447
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:27,457
Lord Ganesha doesn't operate here.
What did you steal?

448
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:30,957
I'd gone to keep the idol inside.

449
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:45,249
I'm a fan of your parents.

450
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:49,707
Thought Lord Ganesha
will heal your mother.

451
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,249
Sorry, bro.

452
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:55,124
But, what's "Twins"?

453
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:59,332
Eggs... back home
we call them Twins.

454
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,749
Hope "The Twins“
haven't parted ways.

455
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:07,082
They are out of shape.

456
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,374
Come.

457
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,874
- Where?
- To get The Twins back in shape.

458
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:19,749
Hi-

459
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,874
- Two of us.
- Can't come in without a jacket.

460
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,957
Hey, bro. Nice jacket.

461
00:34:27,124 --> 00:34:28,624
- How much?
-30.

462
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,457
What if I give you 50?

463
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,874
Take it, man.
Enjoy the show.

464
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,957
Ever seen a topless girl?

465
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,999
Of course, I have.

466
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:56,124
- Where? On TV?
- No... live.

467
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:59,707
My physics teacher, back home...

468
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:02,374
his mother slipped
in the bathroom.

469
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:05,624
I broke the door,
hauled her on my shoulder

470
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:07,124
and put her in the ambulance.

471
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,999
Stark naked... topless, bottomless.

472
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,124
How old was she?

473
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,249
90... no... 91.

474
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:18,749
I did see stuff...
I'm not naive.

475
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,457
- Ever had alcohol?
- Of course.

476
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,707
Hi... two vodkas, please.

477
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,749
Hey, sweetheart.

478
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,624
Can I have a private dance?

479
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:30,749
Okay.

480
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:32,499
For ten dollars.

481
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,957
I only have seven.

482
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,499
For seven, you get him.

483
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,749
There's a saying back home...

484
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:50,124
<i>“ Jam-"3 am ham-ham.“</i>

485
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:51,707
Translate that.

486
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:53,707
"Jam-jam" is money.

487
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,707
<i>And “ham-ham“?</i>

488
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,124
Sex.

489
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,999
Your jacket took away jam-jam,
I lost my bam-bam.

490
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:07,249
You owe me a blonde.

491
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:14,874
Cover me.

492
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:27,749
Don't! You'll land in prison.

493
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,124
Relax.

494
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,749
Sir, come with me.

495
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:35,624
It's all good, bro.

496
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,666
- Easy... easy.
- Call the cops.

497
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,249
Come on, man.
I didn't do anything.

498
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:41,999
Hold on, sir.

499
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,124
He's got cancer.
He will die in a week.

500
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:46,749
You think I was born yesterday?

501
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:50,874
See... I've got a hospital
visitor's pass.

502
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:52,749
I just got him from there.

503
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:55,499
His last wish... to do powder
and see a topless girl.

504
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:57,166
I gave him powder,
you give him girl.

505
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,624
- He'll die happy.
- He can't die here.

506
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,499
- Noble cause, brother!
- We don't want any trouble.

507
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:04,749
I'll take the body away.
No trouble.

508
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:07,499
Look... where would you
want to die?

509
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:10,791
In a hospital, hopeless
or in a club with a topless?

510
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:12,999
Go some place else.

511
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:15,749
Okay.

512
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,499
Let's go, brother.

513
00:37:17,874 --> 00:37:19,291
These are emotionless people.

514
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,207
I'll get you a girl
more topless than here.

515
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:22,624
No... I want that girl!

516
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,832
- Call the cops.
- Run!

517
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:39,166
Get me a girl, brother.
More topless than there.

518
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,124
You promised, brother.

519
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,457
Stop joking.
We could've been arrested.

520
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:44,999
Noble cause, brother.

521
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,374
Please help. Get me a girl.

522
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:51,499
Your mom's in the hospital
and you're snorting?

523
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,874
Hey, Mr. Righteousness.

524
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,249
We've been friends
for just five minutes.

525
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,374
- Control your emotions.
- Friendship?

526
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:03,207
You aren't a good son!
How'II you be a good friend?

527
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:10,874
Get lost! I don't need a friend.

528
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,207
Hey, stop!

529
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,999
Okay, I'm sorry.

530
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,707
I just can't quit.

531
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:34,082
Alright... go!

532
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:38,957
If my friend was on drugs,
I wouldn't abandon him.

533
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:41,707
I'd thrash him till he quit.

534
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,374
Throw it.

535
00:38:51,749 --> 00:38:53,999
- I'll quit... tomorrow.
- Now.

536
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,749
I promise... tomorrow.

537
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,832
- Let go my twins.
- Let go the powder.

538
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:02,249
- Twins first.
- Powder first.

539
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:04,999
- I'm desperate.
- It's the time to fight.

540
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:06,457
Say, “I'm a tiger."

541
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:08,624
<i>- Now, To".
-'Ron"?</i>

542
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,124
Once more.

543
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:18,749
I quit! I promise.

544
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:24,999
Never abandon me, Master.
Such words of wisdom...

545
00:39:25,374 --> 00:39:28,624
<i>Ron... "yam-3am barn-ham... tw'ms.</i>

546
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,207
Guess what?

547
00:39:31,374 --> 00:39:33,332
You didn't twist my twins...

548
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,499
but this.

549
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,249
<i>I was seeking drugs in New York.</i>

550
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:47,999
<i>Instead, I found a friend.</i>

551
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:51,374
Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
They call me Kamli.

552
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:55,374
As Sex-spear has said,
"What's in a name?"

553
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:58,707
- Who?
- Sex-spear.

554
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:00,624
William...

555
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:03,624
- Sir, will you have snakes?
- Snakes?

556
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:06,624
Snakes... there are lots in the hole.

557
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,832
I'll get it, sir.

558
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:16,749
<i>In his accent, snacks were "snakes“
and hall was “hole“.</i>

559
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:20,082
<i>He brought back our smiles.</i>

560
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:25,124
<i>And miraculously, his idol got
mom out of coma.</i>

561
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:26,874
Ready, everyone?

562
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,999
Smile.

563
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:36,624
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

564
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:49,332
At your film premiere,
I'll sit between father and son.

565
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:54,124
As you appear on screen,
I'll whistle.

566
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:56,999
Sorry!

567
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:02,249
At your wedding,
I'll dance on the table.

568
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:04,624
Warn Ruby
not to be embarrassed.

569
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:12,374
<i>Mom didn't know
Ruby wasn't talking to me.</i>

570
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,582
<i>Mom didn't have
much time left.</i>

571
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,624
<i>I decided...</i>

572
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:24,624
<i>I'd apologise to Ruby's dad
and ask for her hand.</i>

573
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,832
I love Ruby and I want to...

574
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,624
Hi, daddy.

575
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:32,124
I've come to apologize.

576
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:35,249
- I misbehaved that day.
- It's alright, child.

577
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:37,707
- A tipple often does that.
- No, daddy.

578
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:41,082
I wasn't just drunk...
I had also done cocaine.

579
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:47,874
Let me confess.
The next day I did LSD.

580
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,624
But I've been clean
for a month.

581
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,499
What will power!

582
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,832
Congratulations!

583
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,207
Thank you, daddy.

584
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:00,249
I'll go meet Ruby.

585
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,332
- Ruby.
- Wait.

586
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:06,332
Meet her on the 22nd...
at Hotel Sun and Sand.

587
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,624
With these flowers.

588
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:10,874
- What's on the 22nd?
- Wait...

589
00:42:18,124 --> 00:42:20,249
That's for your parents.

590
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,749
And that's for you.
Write your name.

591
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,332
Ruby weds... who's this... Rustom?

592
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,832
Now, get out.
Bye-bye!

593
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:32,374
All this for a 10 rupee bill?
I'll glue it up.

594
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:36,457
I'm glad you tore it...
it led us to Rustom!

595
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:40,832
He's a doctor in New York.
Not a junkie like you... Out!

596
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:44,332
- Daddy, let me meet Ruby...
- Don't call me daddy.

597
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:45,499
- Papa?
- No papa.

598
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,999
- Okay... uncle?
- Don't call me uncle!

599
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:50,374
Then what should I call you...
Old fart?

600
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:54,541
Meet Ruby over my dead body.

601
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:56,541
Fine... I'll wait.

602
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,374
For what?

603
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,582
For you to die, old fart!

604
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:03,957
Rascal... scoundrel!

605
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,332
Get out!

606
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,582
I'll break your legs,
you swine.

00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:58,082
Mummy, don't cry.

635
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,499
Your son-in-Iaw is with you.

636
00:46:04,249 --> 00:46:06,749
Have you read the Holy Gita?

637
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:09,666
"Everything happens for the best."

638
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:10,707
Superb!

639
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:14,124
"Nothing we create...

640
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:17,249
so nothing should we mourn."

641
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:21,499
Did you create this old man?
Gave him birth?

642
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,749
Mummy, please...

643
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,749
Let her grieve...

644
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,624
When my puppy died,
I was bawling.

645
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:34,499
A full-grown husband's exit
deserves howling.

646
00:46:34,874 --> 00:46:36,124
Take your time, mummy.

647
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:40,457
But remember,
only the body parishes.

648
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:42,249
The soul is eternal.

649
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,082
Away with this body.

650
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:46,416
Focus on the soul.

651
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,374
Baby, all okay?

652
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,124
Silly question!

653
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,624
Papa conked
and you say, "All okay?“

654
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,791
Stupid...

655
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:56,499
How shall we
dispose the body?

656
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,749
Bury it? Cremate it?

657
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:01,124
Papa.

658
00:47:01,374 --> 00:47:03,541
God, that's not our papa.

659
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,499
Move that body.
It's freakin' confusing.

660
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:07,999
<i>Move it.</i>

661
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:09,874
So, Ruby...

662
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,249
What did I do?

663
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:23,457
No one can tell
it's secondhand.

664
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,874
A very fair price.

665
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,624
Five hundred dollars.

666
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:30,999
What's this?

667
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,249
Robbed a beggar?

668
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:35,999
Robbed a barber!
He cuts his own hair.

669
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:38,207
Puts three dollars
in the piggy bank.

670
00:47:38,374 --> 00:47:42,582
- Who's gonna count this?
- Call from India... it's Sanju!

671
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:44,582
Awesome!

672
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:52,249
Sanju, perfect timing.
I'm buying my first car.

673
00:47:52,499 --> 00:47:55,582
I need you here, bro.

674
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,957
Ruby's getting married.

675
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:00,249
<i>Please... please come.</i>

676
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:03,916
- You snorting again?
- No. I swear.

677
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:06,374
Please... come down.

678
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:08,749
Sanju... hello.

679
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:15,207
Sir, no need to count.

680
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:17,874
- The car will have to wait.
- Why?

681
00:48:17,874 --> 00:48:21,124
Need to buy a ticket to India.

682
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:24,999
Sorry, sir.

683
00:48:25,499 --> 00:48:28,499
Didn't want the car?
Why make me count?

684
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:36,999
Hello, Ruby.

685
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:40,374
I'm Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
Sanju's friend.

686
00:48:41,374 --> 00:48:43,374
Sir, can you go inside?

687
00:48:43,374 --> 00:48:45,874
- Take a loo break.
- Why?

688
00:48:46,374 --> 00:48:49,749
- Need to discuss a private matter.
- Come

689
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:52,207
Excuse me.

690
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:56,749
Whatever the matter,
say it in front of me.

691
00:48:57,249 --> 00:48:59,249
It'll upset you.

692
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:02,582
Take a stroll outside.
Lovely weather.

693
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,541
No way.
We've got no secrets.

694
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,999
- I know everything about her.
- Really?

695
00:49:09,124 --> 00:49:11,624
- Everything?
- Yes... everything.

696
00:49:11,874 --> 00:49:14,582
Then name Ruby's
favorite animal.

697
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:16,999
Cat?

698
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,499
Dog?

699
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:21,541
You live in New York?

700
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:25,249
Ask any jeweler there...

701
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:27,624
They'll all say... “Penguin...

702
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:30,499
- Know why?
- Why?

703
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:34,207
For a month, Sanju hopped
from jeweler to jeweler.

704
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:38,332
For a wedding necklace
with a penguin pendant.

705
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,374
And finally got it!

706
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:42,374
But when he returned to India...

707
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:45,374
he discovered,
you were engaged.

708
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:49,124
He was shattered...
took to drugs again.

709
00:49:49,499 --> 00:49:51,541
But yesterday, he braved up.

710
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:53,749
Flushed all the drugs
down the drain.

711
00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:56,582
Swore never
to touch them again.

712
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:59,874
He prayed,
"Lord, bring Ruby back."

713
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:02,124
Sanju's back.

714
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,582
- Can you come back?
- Listen... it's too late.

715
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:08,249
The wedding date, venue...
it's all set.

716
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:10,666
Nothing changes,
except the groom.

717
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:12,624
Wedding cards... printed.

718
00:50:12,624 --> 00:50:15,749
We'll put a "Sanju' sticker
over your <i>name.</i>

719
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:17,374
Don't sweat the small stuff.

720
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:20,957
I suggest you get out of here
before I smash your face.

721
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:26,749
Ruby, in America there'll be
no househelp.

722
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,249
You'll be cleaning,
mopping, washing...

723
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:32,082
Imagine washing
his sweaty underpants!

724
00:50:32,249 --> 00:50:35,291
- Scumbag!
- I told you, you'd be upset.

725
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:39,249
Sanju will be at the Marriage Registrar's,
tomorrow 4 pm.

726
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,249
A penguin's not an animal.

727
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,749
It's a bird. Stupid man!

728
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:56,874
Mister, what's her favourite food?

729
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:01,249
Waffles. Sanju knows.

730
00:51:02,499 --> 00:51:04,457
Her favourite film?

731
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,249
<i>Mary Poppins.</i>

732
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:09,374
<i>Sanju knows.
You have no clue.</i>

733
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:11,499
Ruby, 4 pm tomorrow.

734
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:13,749
<i>The Marriage Registrar's office.</i>

735
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,624
Where did you get money
for this?

736
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:34,124
Your wallet, cheques...
they're with me.

737
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:39,332
The wedding necklace...

738
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:40,499
What about it?

739
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:43,332
I sold it... to God.

740
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:57,874
- Where's he?
- He isn't home.

741
00:51:58,166 --> 00:51:59,874
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

742
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:11,124
Is this a joke?

743
00:52:13,499 --> 00:52:17,207
I wait at the Registrar's office
and you get stoned here?

744
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,457
No sweat.
We'll marry tomorrow.

745
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:28,832
You'd flushed the drugs...
fished them out again?

746
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:35,249
I'm so stupid, I believed this.

747
00:52:35,624 --> 00:52:38,499
Where's the wedding necklace?

748
00:52:39,874 --> 00:52:41,499
<i>Where is it?</i>

749
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:44,124
Where's the bloody necklace?

750
00:52:53,374 --> 00:52:54,749
The wedding necklace.

751
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:22,249
Please wait, Ruby.

752
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,374
I'm sorry...

753
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:28,207
Yuck.

754
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:32,124
He's not in his senses.
Won't remember a thing tomorrow!

755
00:53:32,374 --> 00:53:36,374
I swear, he did buy
the wedding necklace.

756
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,332
He's too far gone...

757
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:43,749
and to expect you'll hang on
is not right.

758
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:48,124
You move on... I'm with him.

759
00:53:58,666 --> 00:53:59,874
Kamlesh.

760
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:01,249
Yes, Ruby.

761
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,749
Don't ever tell him
what he did.

762
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:05,749
He'll be devastated.

763
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,374
Tell him...

764
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:11,249
that rotten Ruby,
never showed up.

765
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:23,999
May I come in, sir?

766
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:32,457
You've been drinking?

767
00:54:32,624 --> 00:54:36,707
What I <i>wanna</i> say...
needs courage.

768
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:39,832
So I downed a couple.

769
00:54:40,749 --> 00:54:42,457
Tell me.

770
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:46,624
Your son will die
before your wife!

771
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:49,749
He can't handle his life.

772
00:54:49,749 --> 00:54:50,582
Why?

773
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:54,082
He sees you
nursing your ailing wife.

774
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:59,374
Any responsibility...
at home, film industry, society...

775
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:02,374
he sees you never shirk it.

776
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:05,082
You're a great man, sir.

777
00:55:05,374 --> 00:55:06,999
And your son...

778
00:55:08,499 --> 00:55:10,874
He's an ordinary guy.

779
00:55:11,249 --> 00:55:14,332
No goals... no purpose in life.

780
00:55:14,624 --> 00:55:19,082
He says,
"There are three things to life, bro."

781
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:23,374
"C... B... S...“

782
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:27,499
"Chew, brew and scr--"

783
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:32,999
Sorry... sorry.

784
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:36,874
The problem is...
you want him to be you!

785
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:39,874
He's buried...

786
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:43,749
buried under the weight
of your legacy!

787
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:48,124
He knows, however hard he toils,
he can never be as great.

788
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:51,124
So, he doesn't even try.

789
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,124
Feels a hero with
nobodies like me.

790
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:59,749
"Yo, Kamli...',
"Hey, Kamli...'

791
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:06,624
What should I do, Kamlesh?

792
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:08,332
Sir, you...

793
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:14,832
Just be his friend.

794
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:16,874
Sit with him.

795
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,707
Drink with him.

796
00:56:18,874 --> 00:56:21,499
Use a few cuss words,
and say...

797
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:26,332
"Sonny, it's okay to be ordinary."

798
00:56:26,874 --> 00:56:28,874
<i>“You don't have to be Sun“ Dun.“</i>

799
00:56:28,874 --> 00:56:31,832
"It's okay to be Sanjay Dutt."

800
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:33,999
Please save him.

801
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,207
If he dies...

802
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:42,749
whom will I tell...
"Let go my twins."

803
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,832
Please, sir... save him.

804
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,999
Save him.

805
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:09,874
Good morning!

806
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:13,291
Morning, dad.

807
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:15,332
I showed the distributors
your film.

808
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:20,499
They went crazy...
"What a freakin' actor!"

809
00:57:26,124 --> 00:57:27,832
Has mom seen the posters?

810
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:29,957
She's in hospital.

811
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:31,374
What happened?

812
00:57:32,874 --> 00:57:35,124
She slipped into a coma again.

813
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:38,749
- I just met her yesterday!
- No... day before.

814
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:42,874
You've woken up
after two days. It's okay.

815
00:57:47,249 --> 00:57:49,124
I've spoken to the doctors.

816
00:57:49,124 --> 00:57:52,207
They recommend
a rehab centre in America.

817
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:53,374
Ready?

818
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:55,124
No... no.

819
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:56,874
Please don't send me there, dad.

820
00:57:57,124 --> 00:57:58,749
Just a few days, sonny.

821
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:00,457
No... no.

822
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:08,124
Come out.
We won't send you anywhere.

823
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:11,541
I had one cigarette, you packed me off
to boarding school.

824
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:13,874
I was just six.
Couldn't even tie my Shoelaces.

825
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:15,749
I missed mom.

826
00:58:15,999 --> 00:58:18,499
Sorry... sorry.
Please come out.

827
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:21,249
I won't go anywhere.

828
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:24,499
I'll stay with mom...
in the hospital!

829
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:31,999
<i>Dad agreed... on one condition.</i>

830
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:35,624
<i>That I wouldn't do drugs
in the hospital.</i>

831
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:37,124
<i>And I promised.</i>

832
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:40,207
<i>I started spending
every night at the hospital.</i>

833
00:58:40,749 --> 00:58:43,332
<i>I'd stare at mom for hours.</i>

834
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:46,124
<i>I'd hold her hand
and talk to her.</i>

835
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:48,499
The premiere's next week.

836
00:58:48,749 --> 00:58:49,999
Won't you come?

837
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:51,499
Get up, mom.

838
00:58:51,874 --> 00:58:53,624
You gotta see me act.

839
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:55,957
You'll be proud, mom.

840
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:57,624
Mom.

841
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:01,707
<i>Then one day...</i>

842
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:03,249
<i>I couldn't resist.</i>

843
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:23,374
<i>Sanju...</i>

<i>Mom never saw my film.</i>

846
01:00:32,499 --> 01:00:35,624
<i>She died three days
before the premiere.</i>

847
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:37,999
<i>She'd left a note...</i>

848
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:41,082
<i>"Even if I'm gone,

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

854
01:01:22,874 --> 01:01:25,749
Excuse me, Mr. Dutt.
Is anyone sitting here?

855
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:29,499
Yes... my wife.

856
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:48,874
Sanju, congratulations!

857
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:54,874
<i>Sanju, you'll be a film star!</i>

<i>At your wedding,

861
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:11,082
Sanju.

862
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:21,124
What happened?

863
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:24,999
Mom opened her eyes
before she died.

864
01:02:25,999 --> 01:02:29,249
She touched my head
to bless me.

865
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,832
But I was drugged, dad.

866
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,457
Not sure if it happened
or I was hallucinating...

867
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:38,874
I'm a mess, dad.

868
01:02:39,249 --> 01:02:42,374
I can't tell what's real
and what's imaginary.

869
01:02:45,791 --> 01:02:47,249
Are you real, dad?

870
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:50,749
Buddy, listen.

871
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:52,749
Is that Mr. Sunil Dutt?

872
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:55,957
- Is dad there?
- Yes.

873
01:02:57,999 --> 01:02:59,249
Please save me, dad.

874
01:02:59,416 --> 01:03:00,582
I want to quit drugs.

875
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:02,207
I want to live.

876
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:03,749
I want to live.

877
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:09,707
You'll be fine, sonny.

878
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:18,749
<i>Dad got me to America
for treatment.</i>

879
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:21,999
Mark the drugs
you've ever consumed.

880
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:25,874
<i>I was given a list.</i>

881
01:03:32,624 --> 01:03:34,999
<i>He was shocked
that I was still alive.</i>

882
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,999
He has to be here for a while.
We'll look after him.

883
01:03:44,124 --> 01:03:46,082
<i>My treatment started.</i>

884
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:52,457
<i>As the drugs stopped,
my body rebelled.</i>

885
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,707
<i>A storm unleashed within.</i>

886
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,832
<i>Often I shivered
as if inside an ice slab.</i>

887
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:00,082
<i>Biting cold I couldn't bear.</i>

888
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,124
<i>Often my body was ablaze.</i>

889
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:05,749
<i>I was burning.</i>

890
01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:08,957
<i>Bombs exploded in my head.</i>

891
01:04:09,124 --> 01:04:11,749
<i>My pulse would spike up to 150.</i>

892
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,041
<i>My hands would tremor.</i>

893
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:16,749
<i>Depression... anxiety...
I couldn't bear it.</i>

894
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:20,249
When you dance, the body generates
chemicals that heal.

895
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,957
Our motto... "Dance to recovery."

896
01:04:23,124 --> 01:04:24,957
One, two, cha, cha, cha.

897
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:27,124
One, two, cha, cha, cha.

898
01:04:36,124 --> 01:04:38,624
<i>I couldn't take it.
I ran away.</i>

899
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,749
<i>I was desperate for drugs.</i>

900
01:04:41,999 --> 01:04:42,707
Hey, bro!

901
01:04:43,749 --> 01:04:45,624
- Can I get a gram?
- Money. bro?

902
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:47,207
I'll give you tomorrow.

903
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:48,999
Hang off, man.

904
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:54,624
- Please, bro?
- Sorry, I'm broke.

905
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,124
A little bit, man.

906
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:04,582
<i>The only person
who'd lend me money...</i>

907
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:08,374
<i>was 1500 miles away,
in New York.</i>

908
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:16,582
<i>Like a madman,
I took off for New York... on foot.</i>

909
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:32,582
Can I get a lift?

910
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:34,124
Hop on.

911
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:50,999
<i>I realized the power of attire.</i>

912
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:53,624
<i>When the clothes were clean,
I got rides.</i>

913
01:05:54,249 --> 01:05:57,457
<i>When dirty... alms.</i>

914
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:05,499
<i>Both served well.</i>

915
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:11,374
<i>A few days of begging,
earned me a bus ticket.</i>

916
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,082
<i>In 12 days, I was in New York.</i>

917
01:06:18,624 --> 01:06:19,707
Hi, bro.

918
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:35,374
I'll have one drink
and go back.

919
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:37,832
Never had a drink with you.

920
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:41,457
Just one and I'll go away.

921
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:44,124
I'll be okay, dad.

922
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:22,624
When your mom was in hospital...

923
01:07:22,874 --> 01:07:26,749
she'd send these recordings.

924
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:28,874
Ever listened to them?

925
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:36,999
<i>Silly piglet, how are you?</i>

926
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:42,624
<i>Remember, when angry,
I'd call you “piglet"?</i>

927
01:07:42,999 --> 01:07:46,749
<i>And you'd say, "Why are you
calling your husband names?"</i>

928
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:50,124
<i>“If I'm a piglet,

929
01:07:52,249 --> 01:07:54,374
<i>Hello, Sanju.

938
01:08:20,999 --> 01:08:25,249
<i>I encountered thousands of songs

He's off drugs for 18 months.

01:13:12,999 --> 01:13:17,249
Wear sunglasses...
our boy is glowing like a floodlight.

1001
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:18,707
<i>Thank you, Kamlesh.</i>

1002
01:13:18,874 --> 01:13:24,124
As your Sex-spear says,
"AII's well that ends well."

1003
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:28,749
Take the bags.
The taximeter's on.

1004
01:13:29,416 --> 01:13:30,874
Hurry up.

1005
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,541
It's not "the end“ yet.

1006
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:36,249
The doctor warned,
he could relapse.

1007
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:39,499
If he starts again, he'll die.

1008
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,874
Please keep him away
from bad company.

1009
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:44,832
Thank you, son.

1010
01:13:45,249 --> 01:13:46,624
Thank you.

1011
01:14:02,749 --> 01:14:06,374
Dad, you carry on.
I'll join you.

1012
01:14:09,374 --> 01:14:11,249
Dad, stop him.

1013
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:14,249
For how long can we stop him?

1014
01:14:14,666 --> 01:14:18,332
Now he must fight
his own battles. Let's go.

1015
01:14:19,374 --> 01:14:21,124
I thought you wouldn't meet me.

1016
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,374
How could I not?

1017
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:26,999
I thought of you everyday
the past 18 months.

1018
01:14:27,249 --> 01:14:29,207
What an honor!

1019
01:14:30,124 --> 01:14:32,582
I have a special
welcome-back gift.

1020
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:36,082
Haven't seen
such fine stuff in 18 years.

1021
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:39,124
Just to celebrate your return.

1022
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:43,749
Normally, I don't share
such exclusive stuff with anyone.

1023
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:46,874
To your health.

1024
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,749
Cheers!

1025
01:14:52,124 --> 01:14:54,249
Bro, that's my dose.
It's potent.

1026
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:55,999
Too strong for you.

1027
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:59,582
Doesn't such potent stuff
ruin your health?

1028
01:15:00,624 --> 01:15:02,749
Your parents must've
gifted you strong genes.

1029
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,499
How are they?

1030
01:15:04,499 --> 01:15:07,707
They're fine...
by the grace of God.

1031
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:11,749
Amazing! They're reborn
after the car crash?

1032
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:22,124
Glucose powder suits me fine.

1033
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:24,999
Now try that!

1034
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:33,624
I cracked it!

1035
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:37,124
You took glucose
and fed me drugs.

1036
01:15:38,124 --> 01:15:40,957
You aren't an addict...
you're a peddler!

1037
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:43,499
Posed as a friend
for my money.

1038
01:15:47,374 --> 01:15:49,874
Bro, I'll return your money.

1039
01:15:50,041 --> 01:15:51,874
Great idea!

1040
01:15:52,124 --> 01:15:55,499
Return those five years
which I was too numb to feel.

1041
01:15:57,124 --> 01:16:00,999
My father hasn't slept in five years.
Return that lost sleep.

1042
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:05,499
I lost Ruby.
Can you get her back?

1043
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:08,791
My sisters stopped smiling.
Return that smile.

1044
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:10,957
Can you? You peddler!

1045
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:42,874
My real gods.

1046
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:45,832
And one more.

1047
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,749
Lord Ganesha, MD.

1048
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:53,249
He's lived with me
in prison, too.

1049
01:16:58,291 --> 01:16:59,457
You're crying?

1050
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:02,582
Was the story so bad?

1051
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:05,874
Will you write it?

1052
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,249
Yes, I'll write it.

1053
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:11,707
Thank you.

1054
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:13,374
Thank you.

1055
01:17:14,874 --> 01:17:17,249
So, I'll call you on Sunday.

1056
01:17:18,749 --> 01:17:20,124
We'll continue then.

1057
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:26,499
Winnie, do you have a boyfriend?

1058
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:30,499
- Yes. Why?
- Tell him, he's very lucky.

1059
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:33,374
'Cause I'm intelligent
and good looking?

1060
01:17:34,124 --> 01:17:36,332
-'Cause I'm going to prison.
- Stop it.

1061
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:37,624
Ignore him.

1062
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,499
When he's happy
he blabbers.

1063
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:40,999
He's harmless.

1064
01:17:51,374 --> 01:17:51,874
Hello?

1065
01:17:52,249 --> 01:17:54,166
Hello, this is Winnie.

1066
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,124
Hello, mighty writer.

1067
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:58,999
Hello... “God...

1068
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:03,624
So, you met the terrorist.

1069
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:07,749
Also figured why you're
desperate to stop me.

1070
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:11,749
Once a drug-peddler,
now a big builder.

1071
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:14,957
He fooled you.
He's an actor.

1072
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:17,249
Even his lies seem true.

1073
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:21,124
Ask him why
his best friend, Kamlesh...

1074
01:18:21,124 --> 01:18:23,749
hasn't spoken to him
in 20 years.

1075
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:26,124
Ask him.

1076
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,249
Hello.

1077
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:51,957
Is that Mr. Kamlesh?

1078
01:18:52,249 --> 01:18:54,624
- Yeah.
- Hi, this is Winnie Diaz.

1079
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:56,374
I'm a writer.

1080
01:18:56,624 --> 01:18:59,124
I'm writing a book
on your friend, Sanjay Dutt...

1081
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:02,624
He's not my friend.

1082
01:19:05,499 --> 01:19:09,374
But he says,
"Kamli is my best friend."

1083
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:13,499
In a past life.

1084
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:20,332
Then in this life, why are you
glued to the TV watching his news?

1085
01:19:28,999 --> 01:19:30,332
Hello?

1086
01:20:10,666 --> 01:20:11,957
Excuse me?

1087
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:14,624
Hi, I'm Winnie.

1088
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:19,999
- You called from India?
- Right. And you hung up.

1089
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:21,999
So, I'm here.

1090
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:26,624
Look, I promise, I won't even
mention you in the book.

1091
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:32,874
- Shall we sit somewhere?
- Sure.

1092
01:20:33,749 --> 01:20:36,207
I know a great place.

1093
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,874
I think we should go there.

1094
01:20:39,124 --> 01:20:39,624
Where?

1095
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:42,707
<i>Head North and take a left
after 100 metres.</i>

1096
01:20:42,874 --> 01:20:44,999
Follow Aunt Annie.

1097
01:20:51,291 --> 01:20:52,749
Remember this place?

1098
01:21:16,499 --> 01:21:21,249
He loves you.
Why did you cut off ties?

1099
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:24,707
Do you know what RDX is?

1100
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:29,166
An explosive. It was used
in the Mumbai bomb blasts.

1101
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:31,874
And where was it stored?

1102
01:21:32,541 --> 01:21:35,749
In a truck parked
at Sanjay Dutt's house.

1103
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:39,124
He knew Mumbai would
be bombed, but kept mum.

1104
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:42,582
- Who told you?
- The man who loved him the most.

1105
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:43,999
Who?

1106
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:47,874
<i>Sun“ Du“... h'vs father.</i>

1107
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:11,249
Tell me your side of the story.

1108
01:22:11,416 --> 01:22:13,374
If he's a terrorist,
I'll scrap the book.

1109
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:16,666
I flew 12000 kms
just to meet you.

1110
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:19,749
And I wasted 12 years
of my life with him.

1111
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:21,249
No more time for him.

1112
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:23,499
He's the one with no time.
He's off to prison.

1113
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:25,624
Know what he's taking along?

1114
01:22:38,499 --> 01:22:40,499
This story has four characters.

1115
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:42,624
<i>San'yay Du“, Sun“ Du“...</i>

1116
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,624
I, and the Babri mosque.

1117
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:51,249
Babri mosque was demolished
on 6th December, 1992.

1118
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:53,624
Riots burned the country.

1119
01:22:54,999 --> 01:22:57,249
<i>Mr. Dutt was then
a Member of Parliament.</i>

1120
01:22:57,541 --> 01:22:59,249
<i>He'd stopped making films.</i>

1121
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:01,374
<i>All his time was spent
sewing people.</i>

1122
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:04,332
<i>When riots erupted
in his constituency,</i>

1123
01:23:04,624 --> 01:23:06,624
<i>Muslim homes were burnt...</i>

1124
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,582
<i>he plunged into relief work.</i>

1125
01:23:09,374 --> 01:23:12,124
<i>And his son, unconcerned...
lived in his own world.</i>

1126
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:24,249
<i>He was no longer the drug-addict.</i>

1127
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:29,124
<i>He reigned as an A-list film star
those 12 years.</i>

1128
01:23:29,499 --> 01:23:32,499
<i>As for me... my IT business
was prospering.</i>

1129
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:35,249
<i>I made tons of money.
But, had one grouse...</i>

1130
01:23:35,999 --> 01:23:37,749
<i>I was still a virgin.</i>

1131
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:41,249
<i>Then I met a girl, Pinky.</i>

1132
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:47,624
<i>I flew every weekend to Mumbai,
hoping to get lucky.</i>

1133
01:23:47,791 --> 01:23:49,457
Excuse me, sir.

1134
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:52,874
<i>The result...
I was jetlagged 24/7.</i>

1135
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:55,832
Still on the runway?
Not taken off?

1136
01:23:56,166 --> 01:23:58,041
Sir, <i>we've</i> landed.

1137
01:23:58,041 --> 01:23:58,999
Landed?

1138
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:02,249
<i>This time, Sanju had
invited Pinky for dinner.</i>

1139
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:06,499
<i>The mission...
to make sure I score.</i>

1140
01:24:12,249 --> 01:24:13,749
Pinky loves pink.

1141
01:24:14,041 --> 01:24:16,374
She asked for a pink t-shirt.

1142
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:18,874
So you bought the store?

1143
01:24:19,124 --> 01:24:20,249
Superb!

1144
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:25,374
Control... you're drinking too much!

1145
01:24:25,749 --> 01:24:28,499
Need courage
to open my account.

1146
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:30,499
Account! Which bank?

1147
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:34,624
My aunt's cousin is a banker.
You'll be done in a jiffy.

1148
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:38,749
- You need an account, too?
- No, I have many accounts.

1149
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,499
What's all this?

1150
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:50,749
All for you.

1151
01:24:52,791 --> 01:24:56,207
This pink t-shirt, sweater,

1152
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:59,624
<i>“Mar-tee...</i>

1153
01:25:01,791 --> 01:25:06,332
This pink nightie... just for you!
Try it.

1154
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:11,582
No, I'll stick to the t-shirt.

1155
01:25:11,874 --> 01:25:13,249
Thank you, Kamlesh.

1156
01:25:17,666 --> 01:25:18,749
One moment.

1157
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:23,457
Do you know why
nighties are called nighties?

1158
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:24,874
Why?

1159
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:28,124
'Cause they are worn at night.

1160
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:34,124
Scriptures say...
hour and attire must match.

1161
01:25:35,374 --> 01:25:36,332
Give.

1162
01:25:36,499 --> 01:25:37,624
Give.

1163
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:52,082
I've got her in the nightie.

1164
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:55,707
- Your job... get her out of it.
- Done!

1165
01:25:56,624 --> 01:26:00,374
<i>Don't overdrink...
or there'“ be no ham-ham.</i>

1166
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:05,124
I'm out of here.
Freshen up.

1167
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:08,124
- I'll change, too.
- All the best.

Time for bam-bam.

Wake up.

1181

Baby, you ready?

Have breakfast, Kamli.

1193
01:28:44,624 --> 01:28:47,374
- You're meeting some girls today.
- I have a girlfriend.

1194
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:50,874
Forget her.
She's a floozy.

1195
01:28:51,124 --> 01:28:53,499
- Shush... she'll hear you.
- She's gone.

1196
01:28:54,041 --> 01:28:56,874
You were very irresponsible last night!

1197
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:59,832
You passed out and
I had to bam-bam...

1198
01:28:59,999 --> 01:29:03,582
and then wrap up
your pink store.

1199
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:06,499
Chill... I'll set it up
for the next attempt.

1200
01:29:06,749 --> 01:29:09,374
Tell me, you're lying.

1201
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:14,082
I was checking
her loyalty towards you.

1202
01:29:14,499 --> 01:29:18,874
I held her hand,
she rubbed it with her thumb.

1203
01:29:19,166 --> 01:29:21,999
That's all she does.

1204
01:29:22,249 --> 01:29:24,499
Never goes further.

1205
01:29:25,541 --> 01:29:27,749
With me, she went further, bro.

1206
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:30,499
I said, "Nightie."

1207
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:34,999
She took it off?

1208
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:44,124
It was clear,
she can't be my sister-in-Iaw.

1209
01:29:44,124 --> 01:29:46,624
No one cheats
on my best friend!

1210
01:29:46,791 --> 01:29:50,582
It was guilt free bam-bam.
What's her name?

1211
01:29:50,749 --> 01:29:52,749
You slept with her
and don't know her name?

1212
01:29:52,749 --> 01:29:55,707
Name after the game?
Bad manners!

1213
01:29:56,166 --> 01:29:57,874
You swine!

1214
01:29:58,374 --> 01:30:01,791
I've unveiled her true colors.

1215
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:03,874
You should be grateful.

1216
01:30:05,749 --> 01:30:07,457
<i>Hey, Sanju.</i>

1217
01:30:07,624 --> 01:30:10,249
<i>Your pop's buddying up
to the Muslims.</i>

1218
01:30:10,416 --> 01:30:12,541
- Drill sense into him.
- Who the hell...?

1219
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,999
<i>You half-Muslim!</i>

1220
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:18,457
<i>Your sister is sizzling hot.
Shall I get her raped?</i>

1221
01:30:18,624 --> 01:30:19,457
Hey!

1222
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,749
<i>It's a stone.
Could've been a grenade.</i>

1223
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:30,124
<i>Your pop's loading trucks
with relief material, right?</i>

1224
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:33,332
<i>- I'll bump him off.
- HelloI</i>

1225
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:51,249
- Let's get out of here.
- We've got a threat call.

1226
01:30:51,416 --> 01:30:54,124
You wake up late.
I've already got five.

1227
01:30:54,374 --> 01:30:56,207
Barking dogs seldom bite.

1228
01:30:56,374 --> 01:30:58,582
Out here you can be shot.

1229
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:00,249
We'll shield him.

1230
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:02,249
We'll take the bullet.

1231
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:06,166
We'll defend Mr. Dutt
till our last breath.

1232
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:08,416
With that toy?
Does it even work?

1233
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,457
Yes, it does.

1234
01:31:16,166 --> 01:31:18,874
When did you last fire it?
World War II?

1235
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:20,499
Stop it, Sanju.

1236
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:22,499
Hurry... load the truck.

1237
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:24,957
Kamli, reason with dad.
He never listens to me.

1238
01:31:25,124 --> 01:31:28,249
Look at him,
and then at yourself.

1239
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:30,166
He helps strangers.

1240
01:31:30,166 --> 01:31:33,457
While you bam-bam
your best friend's girl.

1241
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:51,874
<i>Hi! This is Kamlesh.</i>

1242
01:31:52,124 --> 01:31:55,249
<i>Sorry, I'm not home.
Please leave a message.</i>

1243
01:31:55,499 --> 01:31:58,874
<i>Hey Kamli,
remember the strip club?</i>

1244
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:02,207
I lost out on a chick
for your jacket.

1245
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:06,082
Remember,
you owed me a blonde.

1246
01:32:06,291 --> 01:32:09,249
Let's say Pinky is the blonds...
we're square!

1247
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:12,082
I'm in New York on the 22nd.

1248
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:14,874
I'll wait outside the same club.

1249
01:32:15,916 --> 01:32:17,499
Wear that red jacket...

1250
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:19,957
and I'll know you've forgiven me.

1251
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:21,999
I love you, bro.

1252
01:32:23,166 --> 01:32:26,249
Kamli, please forgive me.

1253
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:28,499
Kamli...

1254
01:32:32,416 --> 01:32:38,207
<i>They say, "Life is what happens
when you're making other plans."</i>

1255
01:32:38,416 --> 01:32:42,832
<i>While he was planning his trip...
life had other plans.</i>

1256
01:33:04,249 --> 01:33:06,332
<i>Twelve bombs exploded that day.</i>

1257
01:33:06,749 --> 01:33:09,374
<i>250 people died.
800 were injured.</i>

1258
01:33:10,041 --> 01:33:12,249
<i>Police investigations
revealed a name...</i>

1259
01:33:12,666 --> 01:33:13,999
<i>Tiger Memon.</i>

1260
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:17,082
<i>In the riots following
the Babri mosque demolition,</i>

1261
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:19,582
<i>Tiger Memon's office
was burnt down.</i>

1262
01:33:19,749 --> 01:33:21,582
<i>He struck back.</i>

1263
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:24,999
<i>As the truth unfolded,
many were arrested.</i>

1264
01:33:26,791 --> 01:33:28,999
Kamlesh, read the news?

1265
01:33:31,416 --> 01:33:32,332
No... why?

1266
01:33:32,499 --> 01:33:35,457
Your friend was involved
in the Bombay bomb blasts.

1267
01:33:35,749 --> 01:33:36,874
He's been arrested.

1268
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:39,832
He had an AK-56 rifle.

1269
01:33:43,374 --> 01:33:46,249
Did you possess an AK-56 rifle?

1270
01:33:46,749 --> 01:33:47,624
No, sir.

1271
01:33:55,874 --> 01:33:59,624
Did you possess an AK-56?

1272
01:34:00,124 --> 01:34:01,332
I'll tell you, sir.

1273
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:03,624
I'll tell you everything.

1274
01:34:04,416 --> 01:34:06,249
But, don't tell dad.

1275
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:19,207
- Babu?
- Kamli.

1276
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:23,874
I knew you'd come.

1277
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:25,499
I'm glad.

1278
01:34:26,249 --> 01:34:30,124
Sir, I'm sure
the AK-56 charges are bogus.

1279
01:34:34,541 --> 01:34:36,332
Here's Sanju's confession.

1280
01:34:36,499 --> 01:34:37,999
Read it.

1281
01:34:46,499 --> 01:34:49,707
Dad would send relief material
to riot victims.

1282
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:51,749
Majority of them... Muslim.

1283
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:55,457
Some people didn't approve.

1284
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:58,499
They thought dad was pro-Muslim.

1285
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:01,582
That's when the threats started.

1286
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:05,457
To murder us...
and rape my sisters.

1287
01:35:06,249 --> 01:35:07,499
I was terrified.

1288
01:35:08,249 --> 01:35:11,707
Then there were
two attacks on dad.

1289
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:14,749
I requested special protection,
but was denied.

1290
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:17,624
I feared a mob attack any time.

1291
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:23,124
<i>Han“ and Sam“,
producers of my mm...</i>

1292
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:27,999
suggested I keep an assault rifle,
for protection.

1293
01:35:38,374 --> 01:35:43,124
<i>In January, Samir, Hanif
and Abu Salem came home.</i>

1294
01:36:10,874 --> 01:36:13,874
<i>They gave me three rifles
and some bullets,</i>

1295
01:36:14,124 --> 01:36:16,624
<i>which I kept in my car.</i>

1296
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:21,749
<i>Soon, I panicked.</i>

1297
01:36:22,541 --> 01:36:26,624
I'll keep only one rifle...
till the riots and.

1298
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:28,999
Please take away the rest.

1299
01:36:29,291 --> 01:36:30,874
<i>They came back two days later.</i>

1300
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:36,582
<i>I returned two rifles.
Kept one rifle and 250 bullets.</i>

1301
01:36:38,374 --> 01:36:41,582
<i>On 2nd April, I went to Mauritius
for a film shoot.</i>

1302
01:36:42,166 --> 01:36:45,249
<i>I got news of Hanif
and Samir's arrest.</i>

1303
01:36:45,749 --> 01:36:49,707
<i>I feared they'd rat me out.</i>

1304
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:52,624
<i>I called my friend, Yusuf Nulwala.</i>

1305
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:56,749
Yusuf, go to my house.

1306
01:36:57,666 --> 01:36:59,249
Go to my room.

1307
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:01,999
You'll find a black bag.

1308
01:37:04,749 --> 01:37:06,707
There's some stuff in it.

1309
01:37:06,916 --> 01:37:09,249
Destroy it.

1310
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:25,749
<i>Then one day, dad called.</i>

1311
01:37:26,499 --> 01:37:30,124
The papers say,
you possess an AK-56 rifle.

1312
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:32,332
AK-56? No, dad!

1313
01:37:32,624 --> 01:37:35,416
I've got you a meeting
with the Police Commissioner.

1314
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:36,749
Come to Bombay.

1315
01:37:37,666 --> 01:37:40,874
<i>Dad informed the cops
about my arrival,</i>

1316
01:37:41,291 --> 01:37:45,249
<i>and assured them he'll get me
to the police station.</i>

1317
01:37:45,416 --> 01:37:46,374
<i>But...</i>

1318
01:37:50,666 --> 01:37:51,832
Mr. Sanjay Dutt.

1319
01:37:56,291 --> 01:37:57,582
Boarding pass.

1320
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:02,624
Deliver the luggage to his father.

1321
01:38:03,124 --> 01:38:04,249
Come with me.

1322
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,207
- What's the problem, officer?
- Come.

1323
01:38:07,374 --> 01:38:09,332
Sir, what happened?

1324
01:38:10,541 --> 01:38:11,749
Get in.

1325
01:38:22,666 --> 01:38:26,374
Last time, we won the fight
against drugs.

1326
01:38:26,874 --> 01:38:31,749
But this time, the battle
will be tougher.

1327
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:37,374
- I'll need you, son.
- I'm not going anywhere, sir.

1328
01:38:37,624 --> 01:38:40,082
The "snakes“ are in the “hole“.

1329
01:38:40,624 --> 01:38:41,999
Grab a bite.

1330
01:38:43,416 --> 01:38:45,499
Sleep in Sanju's room.

1331
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,749
I'll be here for a while.

1332
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:54,957
Switch off the fan.

1333
01:38:55,624 --> 01:38:57,499
Sir, it's hot.

1334
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:02,374
He sleeps without a fan, too.

1335
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:28,749
<i>For security reasons,</i>

1336
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:34,124
<i>Sanju was kept in isolation
in a windowless cell.</i>

1337
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:38,207
<i>His only companions... ants.</i>

1338
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:41,374
It's been seven days, soldiers.

1339
01:39:41,999 --> 01:39:44,124
When will I get bail?

1340
01:39:47,124 --> 01:39:49,124
Tell me.

1341
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:51,582
Please...

1342
01:40:11,666 --> 01:40:13,999
Sir, the pot is overflowing.

1343
01:40:14,499 --> 01:40:15,707
Sir.

1344
01:40:21,499 --> 01:40:22,874
Please help!

1345
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:28,124
Help!

1346
01:40:36,249 --> 01:40:42,249
<i>He suffered inside prison
and his dad, outside.</i>

1347
01:40:44,249 --> 01:40:46,582
Look... the terrorist's pop.

1348
01:41:06,874 --> 01:41:07,749
Come.

1349
01:41:11,749 --> 01:41:13,124
Give him a shave.

1350
01:41:15,374 --> 01:41:16,249
You're done.

1351
01:41:18,291 --> 01:41:20,207
Come... wash your face.

1352
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:22,832
You speak English!

1353
01:41:23,041 --> 01:41:26,624
I've done my Masters.
Even had a bank job.

1354
01:41:27,249 --> 01:41:28,999
How'd you land here?

1355
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:31,624
My wife cheated on me.

1356
01:41:31,916 --> 01:41:33,499
I killed her!

1357
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:35,749
Chopped her into pieces,

1358
01:41:35,999 --> 01:41:39,957
stuffed her in a bag and left it
on along distance train.

1359
01:41:40,916 --> 01:41:42,499
A porter saw me...

1360
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:44,124
and here I am.

1361
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:47,249
- I'll skip the shave.
- Why?

1362
01:41:47,624 --> 01:41:50,791
Need a beard for my next film.

1363
01:41:50,791 --> 01:41:53,874
I'm playing Santa Claus.
He had a big beard.

1364
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,999
I've to let it grow.

1365
01:41:59,291 --> 01:42:01,874
Hello! This is Sunil Dutt.

1366
01:42:02,666 --> 01:42:03,582
A moment.

1367
01:42:04,249 --> 01:42:05,499
<i>Mr. Butt.</i>

1368
01:42:07,624 --> 01:42:09,457
Sir, the minister's bathing.

1369
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:13,957
Morning, noon and evening?

1370
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:15,749
He's always in the bath!

1371
01:42:15,999 --> 01:42:18,499
Health reasons, sir.

1372
01:42:18,916 --> 01:42:22,874
He has a fungal infection
on his thigh.

1373
01:42:23,999 --> 01:42:25,749
I'll pass on your message.

1374
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:29,874
<i>Everyone avoided Mr. Dutt.</i>

1375
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:34,499
<i>Terror charges being stigmatic,
no one wanted any involvement.</i>

1376
01:42:35,791 --> 01:42:41,374
Partner, we've been
roomies for 180 days.

1377
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:46,332
That's longer than any girl
I've been with.

1378
01:42:47,374 --> 01:42:51,957
Supreme Court will hear
my bail petition today.

1379
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:54,874
Which means I'm a free bird.

1380
01:42:58,791 --> 01:43:00,749
I'll miss you.

1381
01:43:02,041 --> 01:43:04,999
- Your bail's been rejected.
- What?

1382
01:43:05,166 --> 01:43:08,582
Bail is always tough
in the Terror Act.

1383
01:43:08,874 --> 01:43:10,374
Sir...

1384
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:52,124
Dad, what's up with my bail?

1385
01:43:52,374 --> 01:43:56,207
Don't worry, sonny.
We're going to the Supreme Court.

1386
01:43:56,499 --> 01:43:58,166
You get better.

1387
01:43:58,166 --> 01:44:01,624
Why are you lying?

1388
01:44:02,749 --> 01:44:06,791
I know my bail's rejected.
I've been in for six months.

1389
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:09,624
You know the Prime Minister...
the President... speak to them.

1390
01:44:09,791 --> 01:44:13,874
What have I done?
Killed anyone? Fire a bullet?

1391
01:44:14,416 --> 01:44:16,707
Just kept a gun,
for your protection!

1392
01:44:16,874 --> 01:44:18,999
My protection?

1393
01:44:20,249 --> 01:44:24,582
I'd rather you shot me
with that gun!

1394
01:44:26,249 --> 01:44:27,957
Sir...

1395
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:33,832
He'll never appreciate me.

1396
01:44:34,791 --> 01:44:39,624
Praises my sisters all the time...
"Ace! Well played!“

1397
01:44:41,666 --> 01:44:43,499
I want to die.

1398
01:44:43,749 --> 01:44:44,999
Please help me.

1399
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:53,499
There's cyanide in the tea.

1400
01:44:55,791 --> 01:44:56,874
Drink up.

1401
01:45:02,916 --> 01:45:04,541
Vodka in the tea?

1402
01:45:04,541 --> 01:45:06,874
Now chill!
Don't blabber about dying.

1403
01:45:07,041 --> 01:45:08,624
Think of your dad!

1404
01:45:08,791 --> 01:45:10,874
He strives from dawn to dusk
for your bail.

1405
01:45:11,124 --> 01:45:14,874
Begs lawyers, politicians, cops...

1406
01:45:15,249 --> 01:45:18,624
Sleeps on the floor
'cause you have no bad.

1407
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:22,124
Doesn't use the fan
'cause you don't have one.

1408
01:45:22,374 --> 01:45:24,874
People call him,
"Terrorist's pop."

1409
01:45:25,874 --> 01:45:29,249
You've twisted his twins...
spare him your suicide!

1410
01:45:29,416 --> 01:45:32,707
Fight! You'll definitely get bail.

1411
01:45:40,791 --> 01:45:42,791
Once out of prison...

1412
01:45:42,791 --> 01:45:45,332
get a sexy girlfriend.

1413
01:45:45,666 --> 01:45:49,457
I'll get you drunk
and bam-bam her!

1414
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:51,457
Then, we're even.

1415
01:45:53,166 --> 01:45:56,582
"I want to die."
Enough! You're a tiger.

1416
01:45:57,166 --> 01:46:00,082
"Rorr'... come on.

1417
01:46:00,541 --> 01:46:02,124

1420
01:46:17,166 --> 01:46:20,707

agreed to meet him.</i>

1427
01:46:41,166 --> 01:46:42,124
Hello, sir.

1428
01:46:43,166 --> 01:46:46,749
Come... sit.

1429
01:46:47,416 --> 01:46:48,832
How's daddy?

1430
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:50,499
He has a fever.

1431
01:46:50,791 --> 01:46:52,457
Very good...

1432
01:46:54,041 --> 01:46:55,624
What brings you here?

1433
01:46:56,666 --> 01:46:58,874
Sir, I'll be honest.

1434
01:46:59,166 --> 01:47:00,874
I did possess a gun.

1435
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:03,624
I should be tried
under the Arms Act.

1436
01:47:04,166 --> 01:47:06,332
But they've slapped me
with the Terror Act.

1437
01:47:07,749 --> 01:47:10,707
If I was involved
in the bomb blasts,

1438
01:47:10,874 --> 01:47:12,457
would I return to India?

1439
01:47:12,791 --> 01:47:15,082
I could've run away
from Mauritius.

1440
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:17,374
Taken asylum in another country.

1441
01:47:27,041 --> 01:47:29,582
- He's dozed off!
- Speak louder.

1442
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:35,874
Sir, I got a gun because
I feared a mob attack.

1443
01:47:41,041 --> 01:47:44,624
<i>If the minister really slept
or play acted to avoid us...</i>

1444
01:47:44,874 --> 01:47:46,874
<i>is still a mystery.</i>

1445
01:47:51,624 --> 01:47:52,957
How's daddy?

1446
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:57,999
- He has a fever.
- Very good...

1447
01:47:59,291 --> 01:48:00,874
What brings you here?

1448
01:48:02,249 --> 01:48:05,332
Our legs brought us here...
we'll go back swimming.

1449
01:48:05,624 --> 01:48:07,832
Very good...

1450
01:48:07,999 --> 01:48:10,332
Let me know if I can help.

1451
01:48:10,874 --> 01:48:13,457
<i>It was evident,
we were on our own.</i>

1452
01:48:13,666 --> 01:48:17,374
<i>I decided... till Sanju was cleared
of terror charges,</i>

1453
01:48:17,374 --> 01:48:20,749
<i>I'd be by his side.
But, the next day...</i>

1454
01:48:20,999 --> 01:48:23,124
<i>[RDX truck at Dutt house?]</i>

1455
01:48:28,791 --> 01:48:30,332
Babu, where's Sanju?

1456
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:31,749
In the preview theatre.

1457
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:45,041
No one goes in.
Mr. Dutt's orders.

1458
01:48:45,041 --> 01:48:50,874
Tell the Court... you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.

1459
01:48:53,666 --> 01:48:54,749
Kamlesh...

1460
01:48:55,166 --> 01:48:57,124
please wait outside.

1461
01:49:12,041 --> 01:49:13,457
Where are you going?

1462
01:49:14,749 --> 01:49:16,957
FBI raided my office.

1463
01:49:17,124 --> 01:49:18,124
Why?

1464
01:49:20,666 --> 01:49:22,374
<i>[RDX truck at Dutt house?]</i>

1465
01:49:23,791 --> 01:49:26,207
What's that got to do
with the FBI?

1466
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:29,749
My company works with
the American government.

1467
01:49:30,124 --> 01:49:32,332
Now they'll investigate
our association.

1468
01:49:32,999 --> 01:49:35,249
Terror charges freak them out.

1469
01:49:38,249 --> 01:49:39,207
Sorry, buddy.

1470
01:49:40,249 --> 01:49:42,249
I've put you through all this...

1471
01:49:43,666 --> 01:49:47,999
- Call me when you get there.
- No... my phone will be tapped.

1472
01:49:49,791 --> 01:49:52,957
We must disconnect
for a few years.

1473
01:49:54,916 --> 01:49:57,957
Don't worry. I understand.
Go...

1474
01:49:59,624 --> 01:50:02,124
Hey, Kamli. You're a tiger.

1475
01:50:10,291 --> 01:50:11,457
Let's go.

1476
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:12,874
Bye!

1477
01:50:21,916 --> 01:50:24,124
First time ever...
I lied to Sanju.

1478
01:50:24,541 --> 01:50:26,749
I can be friends with an addict.

1479
01:50:26,916 --> 01:50:29,749
Even with a guy
who slept with my girl.

1480
01:50:29,916 --> 01:50:32,707
But with a terrorist?
I'm no fool!

1481
01:50:35,291 --> 01:50:38,499
Every time I drink,
I miss him...

1482
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:40,957
yearn to call him.

1483
01:50:41,666 --> 01:50:43,499
Then I remind myself...

1484
01:50:44,374 --> 01:50:47,791
there was a truck full of RDX
at his house.

1485
01:50:47,791 --> 01:50:49,624
He's a bloody terrorist!

1486
01:50:51,749 --> 01:50:53,457
Are we done?

1487
01:50:56,874 --> 01:50:57,957
<i>Mail from Winnie.</i>

1488
01:50:58,541 --> 01:50:59,999
Where's she?

1489
01:51:00,791 --> 01:51:01,582
America.

1490
01:51:02,916 --> 01:51:04,874
She won't write the book.

1491
01:51:07,624 --> 01:51:10,207
<i>Sanjay Dutt was given 30 days
to surrender.</i>

1492
01:51:10,416 --> 01:51:12,207
<i>That time is over.</i>

1493
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:15,374
<i>He's on his way to prison.</i>

1494
01:51:16,791 --> 01:51:18,249
<i>Clothes off.</i>

1495
01:51:18,749 --> 01:51:19,832
Raise your hands.

1496
01:51:22,666 --> 01:51:23,874
Turn.

1497
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:29,457
Bend.

1498
01:51:31,791 --> 01:51:32,999
Cough.

1499
01:51:33,416 --> 01:51:34,457
Harder.

1500
01:52:14,041 --> 01:52:18,957
You dropped Sanju's story for a book
on museums? How boring!

1501
01:52:19,624 --> 01:52:22,874
- Museums don't lie.
- Nor did Sanju.

1502
01:52:23,541 --> 01:52:27,499
But a news report
became your gospel truth.

1503
01:52:28,041 --> 01:52:28,999
Here.

1504
01:52:29,999 --> 01:52:30,957
What's this?

1505
01:52:31,749 --> 01:52:35,124
Prison has a community radio
for prisoners' reform.

1506
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:37,749
Sanju hosts a show.

1507
01:52:38,291 --> 01:52:40,624
He wants you to hear
this episode.

1508
01:52:40,791 --> 01:52:42,874
Took great pains
to smuggle it out.

1509
01:52:43,124 --> 01:52:44,124
Your coffee...

1510
01:52:46,916 --> 01:52:48,124
My number.

1511
01:52:48,499 --> 01:52:51,082
You'll need it after you're done.

1512
01:53:04,916 --> 01:53:07,124
<i>Howdy, Yerwada!</i>

1513
01:53:07,499 --> 01:53:11,624
This is your buddy, Sanju!

1514
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:20,374
Today's topic... newspapers.

1515
01:53:20,999 --> 01:53:23,999
There were no newspapers
400 years ago.

1516
01:53:24,374 --> 01:53:26,249
News traveled word of mouth.

1517
01:53:26,249 --> 01:53:28,374
Then, someone printed
the first newspaper.

1518
01:53:28,541 --> 01:53:32,249
Soon, selling news
became big business.

1519
01:53:32,249 --> 01:53:38,749
Today, India has 105,437
registered publications,

1520
01:53:39,249 --> 01:53:42,749
thousands of radio stations,
TV channels and the internet.

1521
01:53:43,041 --> 01:53:46,332
And they're in a rat race...

1522
01:53:46,541 --> 01:53:48,874
fighting for readership.

1523
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:52,999
More readers means
more money from ads.

1524
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:57,999
And how do you lure readers?
With the truth?

1525
01:53:58,874 --> 01:54:00,124
No!

1526
01:54:00,541 --> 01:54:03,957
With news that's spicy!

1527
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:07,832
And how do you that?

1528
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:09,957
Easy! With a question mark.

1529
01:54:12,624 --> 01:54:18,749
When I was on bail,
these question marks were on my tail.

1530
01:54:18,749 --> 01:54:20,249

01:54:34,124 --> 01:54:36,624
Mr. Dutt, what a surprise!

1537
01:54:36,874 --> 01:54:39,499
How many pages
does your paper have?

1538
01:54:39,666 --> 01:54:40,374
Twenty four.

1539
01:54:40,666 --> 01:54:42,666
Cut it down to eight.

1540
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:45,624
Then you won't need
fake news to fill pages.

1541
01:54:46,374 --> 01:54:47,624
Please come.

1542

How can I fight you?

1544
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:00,749
You have James Bond with you.

1545
01:55:01,041 --> 01:55:01,999
James Bond?

1546
01:55:02,249 --> 01:55:05,207
James Bond has a license to kill.

1547
01:55:05,374 --> 01:55:08,124
He has legal immunity.

1548
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:11,124
Similarly, you have
these question marks.

1549
01:55:11,416 --> 01:55:14,374
In Court, you'll state,
"This isn't confirmed news.“

1550
01:55:14,374 --> 01:55:17,707
"Just speculation.
Don't miss the question mark."

1551
01:55:18,041 --> 01:55:20,999
"According to sources...

1552
01:55:21,291 --> 01:55:22,999
"It has been alleged..."

1553
01:55:23,291 --> 01:55:25,249

Cops have 60 such phone taps.

1559
01:55:50,791 --> 01:55:54,374
He's not focused on work.
His last 12 films tanked.

1560
01:55:54,791 --> 01:56:00,374
His bail can be revoked.
In short... he's finished!

1561
01:56:01,041 --> 01:56:04,499
Then state that with conviction!

1562
01:56:05,874 --> 01:56:09,082
Put a full stop.
Not a question mark.

1563

If you hobnob with gangsters,
won't the press hound you?

1572
01:56:58,041 --> 01:57:00,499
Gangster? Who, dad?

1573
01:57:01,749 --> 01:57:02,957
Bandu Boss.

Aren't you attending his event?

1575

Don't go.

Don't go, sonny.

Why are we here, dad?

1586
01:57:59,291 --> 01:58:02,249
"If a Hindu marries her,
we'll slaughter him."

1587
01:58:02,791 --> 01:58:04,874
I called him...

1588
01:58:06,041 --> 01:58:09,499
"Let's meet... and talk."

1589
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:14,624
He agreed.
1 am... right here.

1590
01:58:15,916 --> 01:58:18,582
- You came here alone?
- No.

1591
01:58:19,124 --> 01:58:20,999
My Master was with me.

1592
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:23,874
- Which one?
- Sahir Ludhianvi.

1593
01:58:24,499 --> 01:58:27,499
I reached an hour earlier.

1594
01:58:27,916 --> 01:58:31,874
I let Sahir's song
play in my mind on loop.

1595
01:58:32,166 --> 01:58:37,957
When the don arrived,
I said, "I love Nargis deeply.“

1596
01:58:38,791 --> 01:58:40,707
"I want to marry her."

1597
01:58:40,874 --> 01:58:43,374
"And I'll keep her happy forever."

1598
01:58:43,624 --> 01:58:47,499
"If to love someone is wrong,
shoot <i>me.“</i>

1599
01:58:47,791 --> 01:58:50,874
"If right... give me a hug."

1600
01:58:51,541 --> 01:58:53,082
On our wedding day,

1601
01:58:53,374 --> 01:58:56,249
the biggest bouquet...

1602
01:58:56,541 --> 01:58:58,082
came from Mastan!

1603
01:59:00,666 --> 01:59:03,582
- What song was it, dad?
- Will you sing it?

1604
01:59:04,666 --> 01:59:06,624
Sing along with me.

1605
01:59:09,374 --> 01:59:12,707

1614
02:00:04,916 --> 02:00:07,332
He'll never call again.

02:00:33,791 --> 02:00:34,957
Hey, the great Sanju!

1619
02:00:35,124 --> 02:00:37,124
Boss, look who's here.

1620
02:00:38,749 --> 02:00:39,999
The star!

1621
02:00:40,666 --> 02:00:42,374
Welcome!

1622
02:00:43,041 --> 02:00:46,999
No calendar at home?
You're ten days early!

1623
02:00:47,166 --> 02:00:50,207
Welcome... sit.

1624
02:00:54,291 --> 02:00:56,707
May I speak in private?

1625
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:57,874
In private?

1626
02:00:58,541 --> 02:01:00,332
They're family.

1627
02:01:01,791 --> 02:01:03,582
Close your ears.

1628
02:01:05,666 --> 02:01:09,457
We reject condoms
and eject large families.

1629
02:01:10,624 --> 02:01:12,707
Now tell me...

1630
02:01:15,291 --> 02:01:18,249
I can't attend the Ganesha festival.

1631
02:01:19,374 --> 02:01:20,874
Are you sloshed?

1632
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:23,374
I've already announced
to the world.

1633
02:01:23,541 --> 02:01:25,624
My parents are joining, too.

1634
02:01:25,791 --> 02:01:28,957
I too, have a father.
He disapproves.

1635
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:34,082
He approves when you meet
the gangs in Dubai?

1636
02:01:34,374 --> 02:01:37,124
Did I have a choice?
I was scared.

1637
02:01:39,499 --> 02:01:41,374
You ain't scared of me?

1638
02:01:42,541 --> 02:01:44,582
Boys... show him fear.

1639
02:02:06,291 --> 02:02:08,624
Wanna see your brains?

1640
02:02:11,791 --> 02:02:16,624
Blow them out, but first...
hear me out.

1641
02:02:16,791 --> 02:02:20,249
If I attend your event,
the press will print...

1642
02:02:20,666 --> 02:02:23,374
"Sanju-Gangsters Romance."

1643
02:02:23,541 --> 02:02:27,874
If I don't attend,
"Gang kills Sanju."

1644
02:02:28,041 --> 02:02:29,999
Either ways,
it'll make headlines.

1645
02:02:30,291 --> 02:02:34,249
But, the second headline
won't shame my dad.

1646
02:02:34,874 --> 02:02:36,457
He'll cry gallons.

1647
02:02:37,124 --> 02:02:40,832
But when he faces the world,
his head will be held high.

1648
02:02:41,499 --> 02:02:43,749
Not bowed down in shame.

1649
02:02:45,416 --> 02:02:48,874
If this makes sense... fine.

1650
02:02:52,166 --> 02:02:54,499
If not... shoot me.

1651
02:02:56,916 --> 02:02:58,999
- Boss...
- Shut up!

1652
02:03:05,291 --> 02:03:06,624
I'll leave now.

1653
02:03:07,416 --> 02:03:09,749
If I've overstepped...
I'm sorry.

1654
02:03:32,291 --> 02:03:33,457
<i>Dad was right.</i>

1655
02:03:33,624 --> 02:03:36,582
<i>Bandu Boss never called.</i>

1656
02:03:37,666 --> 02:03:40,457
<i>But he showed up!</i>

1657
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:43,624
Hey... out!

1658
02:03:46,041 --> 02:03:47,874
It's a family tradition.

1659
02:03:48,374 --> 02:03:50,624
No murders during
the Ganesha fest.

1660
02:03:51,291 --> 02:03:53,249
Decided to kill you
after the fest.

1661
02:03:53,749 --> 02:03:55,707
These ten days,
I only thought of you.

1662
02:03:56,291 --> 02:04:00,249
You risked life to keep
your dad's head unbowed.

1663
02:04:00,749 --> 02:04:03,832
Who does such a stupid thing?

1664
02:04:04,041 --> 02:04:07,957
Head, a few degrees up or down,
what bloody difference?

1665
02:04:09,291 --> 02:04:11,624
I prayed to the Lord for you.

1666
02:04:12,041 --> 02:04:14,499
Told Him... "He's one gutsy guy."

1667
02:04:14,791 --> 02:04:18,332
"Help him.
Get his charges dropped."

1668
02:04:18,749 --> 02:04:21,707
The Lord said,
“Bandu Boss... done!“

1669
02:04:21,916 --> 02:04:23,624
Here are the offerings.

1670
02:04:26,916 --> 02:04:28,457
Success guaranteed!

1671
02:04:28,666 --> 02:04:30,499
- Lord Ganesha...
- Glory be thine!

1672
02:04:30,666 --> 02:04:32,374
Be thine...

1673
02:04:33,166 --> 02:04:34,832
Stay in touch.

1674
02:04:35,041 --> 02:04:36,374
Let's go.

1675
02:04:42,416 --> 02:04:46,082
Get Bandu Boss teary-eyed often.

1676
02:04:46,291 --> 02:04:48,499
Free sweets will follow.

1677
02:04:49,374 --> 02:04:51,082
Sir, it's the director.

1678
02:04:54,291 --> 02:04:55,749
Yes, bro.

1679
02:04:55,749 --> 02:04:57,791
Where are you?
We are ready to shoot.

1680
02:04:57,791 --> 02:05:01,457
Insane traffic...
on the highway.

1681
02:05:01,874 --> 02:05:03,749
A truck hit a car.

1682
02:05:06,374 --> 02:05:09,249
Hey, move that taxi.

1683
02:05:10,291 --> 02:05:11,624
Listen... listen.

1684
02:05:11,791 --> 02:05:13,749
I've called the Iandline.

1685
02:05:16,499 --> 02:05:18,499
Landline's for all and sundry.

1686
02:05:18,666 --> 02:05:20,749
You're my bro...
always call on my cell.

1687
02:05:20,916 --> 02:05:23,499
We missed the sunrise shot.

1688
02:05:23,666 --> 02:05:26,207
Shoot it at sunset.

1689
02:05:26,374 --> 02:05:28,332
The audience won't know shit.

1690
02:05:28,541 --> 02:05:31,624
Now hang up
or we'll miss the sunset.

1691
02:05:33,291 --> 02:05:36,332
Time to introduce you
to Master no. 2.

1692
02:05:37,791 --> 02:05:40,874
He'll teach you to respect work.

1693
02:05:41,291 --> 02:05:43,707
If you keep missing
sunrise shoots...

1694
02:05:43,916 --> 02:05:46,207
the sun will set on your career.

1695
02:05:46,499 --> 02:05:49,999
Do good work and the press
will change its opinion, too.

1696
02:05:50,291 --> 02:05:51,957
Good work?

1697
02:05:52,166 --> 02:05:54,374
With such trashy scripts.

1698
02:05:55,541 --> 02:05:56,874

1702
02:06:08,041 --> 02:06:11,957
- Do you read these scripts?
- Cover to cover.

1703
02:06:12,124 --> 02:06:14,999
All read and rejected.

1704
02:06:15,499 --> 02:06:18,249
Munnabhai MBBS...
read this one?

1705
02:06:18,416 --> 02:06:20,832
- I did.
- What's the story?

1706
02:06:23,291 --> 02:06:24,707
It's trash!

1707
02:06:26,249 --> 02:06:28,582
There's a hospital...

1708
02:06:28,749 --> 02:06:33,124
where a patient
gets murdered... everyday!

1709
02:06:33,749 --> 02:06:37,582
Then... kidneys are stolen.
It's a horror story.

1710
02:06:37,874 --> 02:06:39,749
I need a family film.

1711
02:06:39,749 --> 02:06:43,082
The draft I read
has no murders.

1712
02:06:44,124 --> 02:06:45,791
Why did you read it?

1713
02:06:45,791 --> 02:06:49,499
I'm playing your father
in this film.

1714
02:06:50,124 --> 02:06:53,624
I'll set up Master no.2
in your car.

1715
02:06:53,791 --> 02:06:57,707
Listen to the song on loop
at full volume.

1716
02:06:58,416 --> 02:06:59,499

Just for the shot, dad!

1738
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:36,249
Hey, pal.
No fear, I'm here!

1739
02:08:37,291 --> 02:08:41,332
You lied to me shamelessly
for 10 years.

1740
02:08:42,166 --> 02:08:44,499
Scene 79, page 175.

1741
02:08:46,749 --> 02:08:51,082
Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?

1742
02:08:51,291 --> 02:08:54,749
That's my dialogue.
I'm playing the father.

02:08:55,291 --> 02:08:57,499
But, father...
I couldn't become a doctor.

1744
02:08:57,666 --> 02:08:58,582
Again.

1745
02:08:58,791 --> 02:09:02,499
You lied to me shamelessly
for 10 years.

1746
02:09:02,791 --> 02:09:06,624
Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?

1747
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:07,749
Once again?

1748
02:09:07,916 --> 02:09:11,707
<i>Prison time was
easier than this.</i>

1749
02:09:11,874 --> 02:09:13,999
<i>Dad's discipline roasted me.</i>

1750
02:09:14,916 --> 02:09:18,874
<i>But, I won't ever forget...
that "magic hug" scene.</i>

1751
02:09:19,124 --> 02:09:21,832
Your mom gets a thousand hugs.

1752
02:09:23,041 --> 02:09:24,957
Spare one for dad.

1753
02:09:30,291 --> 02:09:33,749
<i>Neither of us heard it
when the director called, "Cut!"</i>

1754
02:09:33,916 --> 02:09:35,999
<i>We were weeping.</i>

1755
02:09:36,249 --> 02:09:39,374
<i>It was a lifetime since
we had hugged.</i>

1756
02:09:40,791 --> 02:09:45,499
And the award for the best actor,
male, in a comic role goes to...

1757
02:09:46,291 --> 02:09:47,249
of course...

1758
02:09:47,416 --> 02:09:49,707
Sanjay Dutt for Munnabhai MBBS.

1759
02:09:54,541 --> 02:09:56,124
Go on, sonny.

1760
02:10:09,749 --> 02:10:12,957
Mr. Dutt, didn't I tell you...
“Sanju will be back."

1761
02:10:13,166 --> 02:10:15,374
Really? Did you?

1762
02:10:15,666 --> 02:10:17,082
Didn't I?

1763
02:10:17,874 --> 02:10:20,374
- I told... someone.
- Who?

1764
02:10:20,749 --> 02:10:22,707
Our Associate Editor.

1765
02:10:22,916 --> 02:10:25,249
Told him to print,
"Sanju will be back."

1766
02:10:25,624 --> 02:10:27,624
He must've forgotten.

1767
02:10:27,916 --> 02:10:31,832
Make it tomorrow's headline...
“Sanjay Dutt is back."

1768
02:10:33,874 --> 02:10:36,082
Without a question mark.

1769
02:10:45,124 --> 02:10:47,374
Look... Munnabhai's pop!

1770
02:10:55,791 --> 02:10:58,082
<i>Look... the terrorist's pop!</i>

1771
02:11:01,166 --> 02:11:02,666
What happened, dad?

1772
02:11:02,666 --> 02:11:07,874
It's the second time
you've made me cry with joy.

1773
02:11:08,791 --> 02:11:13,249
<i>The first time dad cried with joy
was in our preview theater.</i>

1774
02:11:13,624 --> 02:11:17,957
<i>That day a headline read,
"RDX truck at Dutt house.“</i>

1775
02:11:29,874 --> 02:11:35,749
Tell the judge... you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.

1776
02:11:42,166 --> 02:11:46,707
<i>The first time dad cried with joy
was in our preview theater.</i>

1777
02:11:46,874 --> 02:11:50,999
<i>That day a headline read,
"RDX truck at Dutt house.“</i>

1778
02:11:51,416 --> 02:11:53,999
<i>But that's another episode.</i>

1779
02:11:54,249 --> 02:11:55,457
<i>I'll save it for another day.</i>

1780
02:11:55,749 --> 02:11:57,999
<i>Let's get back to dad.</i>

1781
02:11:58,166 --> 02:12:00,582
<i>I got another chance
to make dad happy.</i>

1782
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:05,749
<i>Dad was being honored
at a Consulate dinner.</i>

1783
02:12:06,291 --> 02:12:08,874
You guys never praise me.

1784
02:12:09,291 --> 02:12:11,457
So, here I <i>am...</i> as chief guest.

1785
02:12:11,666 --> 02:12:16,124
<i>Dad was unaware, his son would
sing his praises tonight!</i>

1786
02:12:16,124 --> 02:12:20,499
<i>I was to make
the introduction speech.</i>

1787
02:12:27,124 --> 02:12:29,374
Sir, could you come with me?

1788
02:12:29,749 --> 02:12:31,624
- Sir, please.
- Yes.

1789
02:12:32,374 --> 02:12:34,249
Dad, I'll be back.

1790
02:12:34,541 --> 02:12:36,582
Sir... a minor problem.

1791
02:12:36,791 --> 02:12:40,749
Today's headline said, "Blast suspect
to attend diplomatic event."

1792
02:12:41,666 --> 02:12:45,999
The Embassy wanted you
off the guest list.

1793
02:12:46,499 --> 02:12:49,999
We said, “That would be rude.“

1794
02:12:50,374 --> 02:12:52,999
"We'll seat him
away from the diplomats.“

1795
02:12:53,291 --> 02:12:56,582
That might be the best solution
for everybody.

1796
02:12:56,999 --> 02:12:58,874
Please cooperate, sir.

1797
02:12:59,041 --> 02:13:00,999
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.</i>

1798
02:13:01,166 --> 02:13:02,749
Sir, please.

1799
02:13:03,291 --> 02:13:04,374
Thank you.

1800
02:13:06,291 --> 02:13:08,332
My speech... when's that?

1801
02:13:09,499 --> 02:13:10,999
It's canceled.

1802
02:13:14,166 --> 02:13:14,957
I'm sorry.

1803
02:13:16,916 --> 02:13:21,207
<i>I welcome you to our
Global Foundation Charity dinner.</i>

1804
02:13:21,749 --> 02:13:24,207
We'd like to thank you
for joining us tonight...

1805
02:13:24,499 --> 02:13:26,624
in support of this noble cause.

1806
02:13:29,291 --> 02:13:31,749
Sonny, what's the problem?

1807
02:13:33,041 --> 02:13:37,249
I'm right here.
Read out your speech.

1808
02:13:39,291 --> 02:13:41,207
I wanted everyone to hear it.

1809
02:13:42,416 --> 02:13:44,749
They had no right to deny me.

1810
02:13:46,416 --> 02:13:49,332
Learn to ignore such people.

1811
02:13:49,916 --> 02:13:56,124
Tlme for Master no.3.
I'll set the song in your car.

1812
02:13:56,666 --> 02:13:57,749
Anand Bakshi.

1813
02:13:58,041 --> 02:14:02,374
He'll teach you
to deal with humiliation. Okay?

1814
02:14:04,999 --> 02:14:06,999
Sanju...

1815
02:14:12,791 --> 02:14:16,707
Hey, pal...
No fear, I'm here!

1816
02:14:18,541 --> 02:14:20,249
Go, sleep.

1817
02:14:25,041 --> 02:14:27,749
<i>Wish I'd read him the speech...</i>

1818
02:14:28,124 --> 02:14:30,874
<i>for... the next morning,
he didn't wake up.</i>

1819
02:15:42,124 --> 02:15:44,666
<i>If life had a rewind button...</i>

1820
02:15:44,666 --> 02:15:47,874
<i>I'd go back and
read him the speech!</i>

1821
02:15:50,541 --> 02:15:52,249
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1822
02:15:52,916 --> 02:15:54,124
Hi, dad.

1823
02:15:54,916 --> 02:15:59,499
Today, I'll try the impossible...
an attempt to thank dad.

1824
02:15:59,666 --> 02:16:02,624
In the past,
I never found the words.

1825
02:16:02,916 --> 02:16:07,707
To define what dad's done for me...
every word fell short.

1826
02:16:12,916 --> 02:16:14,249
<i>1981...</i>

1827
02:16:14,791 --> 02:16:16,749
<i>a wife dying in the hospital,</i>

1828
02:16:17,291 --> 02:16:20,082
<i>a son destroyed by drugs.</i>

1829
02:16:20,416 --> 02:16:22,499
<i>Dad fought... all alone.</i>

1830
02:16:22,874 --> 02:16:25,332
He's the reason I'm alive.

1831
02:16:27,499 --> 02:16:30,999
Tried to thank him then...
couldn't find the words.

1832
02:16:31,416 --> 02:16:33,999
Dad walked long peace marches...

1833
02:16:34,666 --> 02:16:35,999
from Hiroshima to Nagasaki...

1834
02:16:36,291 --> 02:16:37,749
Mumbai to Amritsar.

1835
02:16:38,374 --> 02:16:41,249
But none wore off his shoes
as much as...

1836
02:16:41,499 --> 02:16:43,999
the jostle between
courts and cops.

1837
02:16:44,416 --> 02:16:47,374
Legal costs forced
dad to sell his house.

1838
02:16:47,541 --> 02:16:49,832
Not once did he complain!

1839
02:16:50,166 --> 02:16:56,374
Wanted to thank him then...
couldn't find the words.

1840
02:16:56,916 --> 02:17:01,582
Now, after a lifetime...
I've found the words.

1841
02:17:05,916 --> 02:17:10,582
You deserved a better son, dad.

1842
02:17:10,749 --> 02:17:15,457
One who'd support you...
not be a burden.

1843
02:17:15,624 --> 02:17:19,082
One known for his honesty,
not his travesties.

1844
02:17:19,291 --> 02:17:23,249
One more like you...
and less like me.

1845
02:17:24,499 --> 02:17:25,957
But know what, dad?

1846
02:17:28,999 --> 02:17:31,999
That son would've
never loved you as much...

1847
02:17:32,291 --> 02:17:34,874
as this no-good sonny does!

1848
02:17:35,041 --> 02:17:39,624
I could never say it...
but you're my hero, dad.

1849
02:17:40,041 --> 02:17:41,999
You're my strength,

1850
02:17:42,291 --> 02:17:43,874
my solace,

1851
02:17:44,416 --> 02:17:45,832
my pride.

1852
02:17:46,041 --> 02:17:48,707
You're my world, dad.

1853
02:17:51,999 --> 02:17:53,374
Love you, sonny.

1854
02:17:54,874 --> 02:17:56,374
Love you, dad.

1855
02:18:03,541 --> 02:18:05,999
Had dad lived another year,

1856
02:18:06,249 --> 02:18:09,249
he'd have witnessed
what he yearned for.

1857
02:18:09,749 --> 02:18:12,957
Mr. Sanjay Dutt,
I want to go on record and say,

1858
02:18:13,124 --> 02:18:16,124
I do not find you to be a terrorist.

1859
02:18:17,249 --> 02:18:20,999
But, you're convicted
under the Arms Act for six years.

1860
02:18:21,624 --> 02:18:24,374
<i>I was acquitted
from the Terror Act.</i>

1861
02:18:24,541 --> 02:18:27,999
<i>I got six years
under the Arms Act.</i>

1862
02:18:28,291 --> 02:18:31,249
<i>The judge clearly said...
I was not a terrorist.</i>

1863
02:18:31,499 --> 02:18:32,999
<i>But, the next morning...</i>

1864
02:18:33,416 --> 02:18:36,999
<i>no headline read
"Dutt not a terrorist.“</i>

1865
02:18:39,666 --> 02:18:43,624
<i>All said... "Dutt gets
six years in the blast case.“</i>

1866
02:18:46,291 --> 02:18:49,249
Till date, I'm branded a terrorist.

1867
02:18:49,874 --> 02:18:51,624
I still feel insulted.

1868
02:18:54,666 --> 02:18:59,749
Master no.3 was to teach me
to deal with insults.

1869
02:19:01,124 --> 02:19:05,332
But with dad's death,
that song remains a mystery.

1870
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:10,957
If you can crack that song,
do tell.

1871
02:19:11,416 --> 02:19:15,624
Until tomorrow...
Sanju says, "Adios, amigos."

1872
02:19:28,416 --> 02:19:29,249
Hello.

1873
02:19:31,416 --> 02:19:32,957
I want to meet Sanju.

1874
02:19:53,291 --> 02:19:53,874
How are you?

1875
02:19:54,749 --> 02:19:57,207
They don't let me step out,
the rest is fine.

1876
02:19:57,374 --> 02:20:01,499
Yeah. Sticklers for rules!
Weren't letting me in, either.

1877
02:20:01,999 --> 02:20:03,999
Missing me?
Boyfriend vamoosed?

1878
02:20:04,541 --> 02:20:06,124
Don't try this on me.

1879
02:20:06,541 --> 02:20:07,749
I'm no Pinky.

1880
02:20:10,124 --> 02:20:12,832
- You met Kamli?
- Yes.

1881
02:20:13,041 --> 02:20:15,124
In your recording, you say...

1882
02:20:15,374 --> 02:20:20,999
on the day the RDX news appeared,
your dad cried with joy.

1883
02:20:21,374 --> 02:20:22,374
Yes.

1884
02:20:22,374 --> 02:20:23,749
Kamlesh has a different version.

1885
02:20:24,041 --> 02:20:26,374
When he came
to the preview theater,

1886
02:20:26,749 --> 02:20:30,249
your dad was urging you
to confess in court...

1887
02:20:30,416 --> 02:20:33,499
that you knew about
the bomb blasts conspiracy.

1888
02:20:40,041 --> 02:20:41,374
The moron!

1889
02:20:42,874 --> 02:20:44,374
Get Kamli here.

1890
02:20:45,374 --> 02:20:48,874
- Tell me about it.
- No. I'll tell him directly.

1891
02:20:49,249 --> 02:20:51,707
It's hard to get permission.

1892
02:20:55,666 --> 02:20:58,249
Remember this number... 88.0.

1893
02:20:58,541 --> 02:21:00,374
- What's that?
- A radio frequency.

1894
02:21:00,541 --> 02:21:02,874
There's an FM mic
in our studio.

1895
02:21:03,166 --> 02:21:08,499
Park close to the prison walls
and tune in.

1896
02:21:11,666 --> 02:21:13,624
Kamlesh won't come.

1897
02:21:14,416 --> 02:21:19,499
Tell him... 6th June.
He won't refuse.

1898
02:21:19,916 --> 02:21:21,832
6th June?

1899
02:21:22,666 --> 02:21:26,749
It's his dad's birthday.
Bloody emotional blackmailer!

1900
02:21:27,291 --> 02:21:29,624
Will you come?
Please.

1901
02:22:02,999 --> 02:22:04,999
<i>Howdy, Yerwada!</i>

1902
02:22:05,166 --> 02:22:09,207
<i>This is your buddy, Sanju!</i>

1903
02:22:12,749 --> 02:22:15,707
Today's topic... friendship.

1904
02:22:16,124 --> 02:22:18,999
My best friend was Kamli

1905
02:22:19,249 --> 02:22:23,499
Great guy.
But fall prey to drugs.

1906
02:22:23,916 --> 02:22:26,874
No... not the psychotropic drugs.

1907
02:22:27,291 --> 02:22:33,874
But the ones that are slid
under our doors... daily.

1908
02:22:34,666 --> 02:22:37,207
We have them with
our morning tea.

1909
02:22:37,374 --> 02:22:40,707
Drugs called... "News".

1910
02:22:41,541 --> 02:22:43,499
These drugs are sold on TV, too.

1911
02:22:43,666 --> 02:22:47,999
Haven't you heard those
cacophonous debates...

1912
02:22:48,374 --> 02:22:50,624
that numb our minds?

1913
02:22:51,416 --> 02:22:54,499
Courts take years
to just understand a case.

1914
02:22:54,791 --> 02:22:58,374
But these panelists
pass verdicts in an hour.

1915
02:22:59,041 --> 02:23:04,874
Back then, a headline said...
"RDX truck at Dutt house."

1916
02:23:06,666 --> 02:23:08,457
It was fake news.

1917
02:23:08,791 --> 02:23:12,374
No cop, no prosecutor,
no Witness ever said...

1918
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:14,874
there was a truck
with RDX at my house.

1919
02:23:15,041 --> 02:23:16,749
So, why this headline?

1920
02:23:16,749 --> 02:23:21,499
During riots, a truck with relief material
was parked at our house.

1921
02:23:23,291 --> 02:23:25,916
Some jerk spread a rumor
it had RDX.

1922
02:23:25,916 --> 02:23:28,874
And a journo printed
this spicy news.

1923
02:23:29,374 --> 02:23:32,249
Read my Supreme Court judgment.

1924
02:23:32,541 --> 02:23:35,499
I was never accused
of possessing RDX!

1925
02:23:36,791 --> 02:23:40,999
But which journo bothers
with facts?

1926
02:23:41,291 --> 02:23:44,957
All they want is
"Breaking News!"

1927
02:23:46,791 --> 02:23:49,457
This headline worked like a drug.

1928
02:23:49,624 --> 02:23:53,332
In Kamli's head,
I morphed into a terrorist.

1929
02:23:54,666 --> 02:23:58,249
He put a full-stop
to our friendship.

1930
02:23:58,499 --> 02:24:02,124
Didn't even notice...
the headline had a question mark!

1931
02:24:07,874 --> 02:24:11,082
<i>[RDX truck at Dutt house?]</i>

1932
02:24:12,749 --> 02:24:15,082
This news shattered Dad.

1933
02:24:15,374 --> 02:24:18,332
In desperation,
he brought in a lawyer.

1934
02:24:19,874 --> 02:24:22,499
- What's this?
- Your ticket to freedom.

1935
02:24:22,874 --> 02:24:24,749
Sign and turn approver.

1936
02:24:25,249 --> 02:24:27,624
- Approver?
- Government witness.

1937
02:24:28,416 --> 02:24:29,374
Dad?

1938
02:24:29,749 --> 02:24:34,874
Tell the Court... you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.

1939
02:24:36,291 --> 02:24:39,207
Kamlesh, please wait outside.

1940
02:24:43,041 --> 02:24:44,874
I knew nothing about
the bomb blasts.

1941
02:24:45,124 --> 02:24:46,957
But tell the Court... you knew.

1942
02:24:47,291 --> 02:24:50,582
Tell them who got the RDX...
who made the bombs...

1943
02:24:50,749 --> 02:24:52,249
Who planted them...

1944
02:24:52,416 --> 02:24:56,124
- I know nothing!
- I'll give you the names.

1945
02:24:56,416 --> 02:24:59,624
You help the State
with missing links.

1946
02:24:59,916 --> 02:25:04,624
In return, the State
will let you go soot-free.

1947
02:25:05,749 --> 02:25:09,457
- I'll be branded a terrorist.
- You're already branded.

1948
02:25:09,624 --> 02:25:13,124
It's a lie, a sign
will make it the truth.

1949
02:25:13,124 --> 02:25:15,707
The country will spit on me.

1950
02:25:16,041 --> 02:25:17,874
Leave the country.

1951
02:25:17,874 --> 02:25:20,499
London, Kenya... pick a place.
Get a new life.

1952
02:25:20,791 --> 02:25:25,457
And dad? My sisters?
Dad, heard that?

1953
02:25:25,666 --> 02:25:29,499
Don't worry about us.
Leave the country.

1954
02:25:34,666 --> 02:25:38,249
Sir, I don't have a law degree.

1955
02:25:39,041 --> 02:25:40,957
In fact, I'm a college dropout.

1956
02:25:41,166 --> 02:25:44,249
But I know, this is rotten advice.

1957
02:25:44,874 --> 02:25:48,457
I brand him "Terrorist's pop'
and run away?

1958
02:25:48,624 --> 02:25:50,207
People will hate dad.

1959
02:25:50,416 --> 02:25:53,749
His life's work... respect...
all down the drain!

1960
02:25:53,999 --> 02:25:56,249
- Listen to me...
- You listen to me.

1961
02:25:56,541 --> 02:25:57,457
Get lost!

1962
02:25:57,666 --> 02:25:59,874
You might be a great lawyer...

1963
02:25:59,874 --> 02:26:03,582
but with a broken nose,
you'll look like a clown.

1964
02:26:04,041 --> 02:26:06,374
- Is this any way to behave?
- No, sir.

1965
02:26:07,666 --> 02:26:09,124
Let me do it the right way.

1966
02:26:10,499 --> 02:26:12,957
You're going to pay for this.

1967
02:26:13,999 --> 02:26:15,749
You're going to pay for this!

1968
02:26:16,874 --> 02:26:18,457
I'm not a terrorist.

1969
02:26:27,499 --> 02:26:28,624
What happened, dad?

1970
02:26:29,999 --> 02:26:35,374
Ace, sonny!
Well played.

1971
02:26:41,291 --> 02:26:43,874
For the first time,
my father cried with joy.

1972
02:26:44,666 --> 02:26:47,374
That day, I was his hero.

1973
02:26:48,541 --> 02:26:52,207
The same day, I turned
villain for my friend.

1974
02:26:52,416 --> 02:26:56,374
Hey, Kamli.
Hope you can hear me.

1975
02:26:58,166 --> 02:27:00,707
When I come out...

1976
02:27:01,291 --> 02:27:03,749
meet me once, buddy.

1977
02:27:04,874 --> 02:27:08,124
If you do, I'll be happy.
If you don't...

1978
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:12,374
I'll live with your fond memories...

1979
02:27:14,374 --> 02:27:19,749
I'll remember, the first nude girl
my friend saw was 91.

1980
02:27:22,916 --> 02:27:26,999
I'll remember, he perked me up
with vodka-infused tea.

1981
02:27:28,624 --> 02:27:32,666
And to meet me
he bought an air-ticket...

1982
02:27:32,666 --> 02:27:35,874
with the pennies saved
for his first car.

1983
02:27:36,874 --> 02:27:40,874
Hey, Kamli.
We're getting old, bro.

1984
02:27:42,499 --> 02:27:46,457
Give me one last hug.
