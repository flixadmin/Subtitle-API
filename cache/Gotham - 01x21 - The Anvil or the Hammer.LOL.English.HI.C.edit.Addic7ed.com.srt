1
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:05,075
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,544
You need to leave Ms. Kringle alone.

3
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:08,803
I get it now.

4
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:10,071
You got a thing for my girl.

5
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:11,772
Oh! (groans)

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,009
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,211
(laughs)

8
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:18,880
Who sent you?

9
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:21,249
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

10
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,217
(grunts) No! (screams)

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,220
I'm Bruce Wayne.

12
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:27,255
Sid Bunderslaw.

13
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:31,974
GORDON: The people of
Gotham deserve to know

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,343
that there's a serial
killer in their midst.

15
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:35,445
I'm coming after you.

16
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,647
He murders the loved ones

17
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:39,749
of any cop who investigates him.

18
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:42,618
Care to dance?

19
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:03,970
Morning. How'd you sleep?

20
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,472
The hour we slept?

21
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:07,974
Great.

22
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,376
You hungry? I have quiche.

23
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,145
No, thanks.

24
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:13,379
At least have some coffee.

25
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:15,314
Let me tell you about the day

26
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:16,783
I have planned for us.

27
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:18,785
I think I'm just gonna get out of here.

28
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,053
Just wait.

29
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,591
We had fun last night, right?

30
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:31,373
Stay.

31
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:35,902
Listen, you don't have to do this.

32
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,370
Do what?

33
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:39,639
Last night at the ball,

34
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:41,040
you talked a good game.

35
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:43,376
But let's not pretend this
is more than what it is.

36
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,712
Barbara, I'm not pretending with you.

37
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:48,114
I want you

38
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:49,654
to stay with me.

39
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,618
I don't think so.

40
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:54,787
Just... wait, wait, wait.

41
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:57,090
Let go.

42
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:58,193
Look...

43
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:03,663
I was pretending with you.

44
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:07,066
But not in the way you think.

45
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:11,749
(sighs)

46
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:17,510
The night we met...

47
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,680
I was going to kill you.

48
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:26,319
- That's not funny.
- But then...

49
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:30,423
I saw something in you,

50
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:32,925
Barbara, I saw...

51
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,328
the real you.

52
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:43,236
You are the woman that I
have been searching for.

53
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,898
(whispers): You're lying.

54
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:55,882
I'm gonna let you go now,

55
00:02:55,916 --> 00:03:00,753
and you're going to sit down
and have breakfast with me.

56
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:13,433
(grunting)

57
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,600
Come on.

58
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,371
No! (whimpering)

59
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,093
- So I do it the hard way.

61
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:33,353
Hey. How are you doing?

62
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:34,921
Been better. You seen Harvey?

63
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:35,955
No.

64
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,857
Any word on Barbara?

65
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,759
They haven't found her body yet,

66
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:41,928
so there's a chance she's still alive.

67
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:44,263
When's the last time you slept?

68
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:45,365
I don't know.

69
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,266
- Last time you ate?
- I don't know.

70
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:49,569
I know better than to
try to get you to sleep,

71
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:50,870
but you really should eat something.

72
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:52,038
I'm not hungry.

73
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:54,140
Jim...

74
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:55,742
it's not your fault.

75
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,880
I did this. I pressed Loeb,
he sent the Ogre after me,

76
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:02,749
and I didn't stop.

77
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:04,984
It was bad enough I
knowingly put you in danger.

78
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,519
I didn't even think of Barbara.

79
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:09,088
You were doing your job.

80
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,057
- But I should've known.
- How?

81
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:12,592
Y-You weren't together.

82
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:13,760
Do you blame yourself

83
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:15,762
for falling out of love?

84
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,130
Lee, it's my responsibility.

85
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:19,432
There's nothing you can
say that changes that.

86
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:20,933
Whatever happens to Barbara,

87
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,102
it's on me.

88
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,170
I understand.

89
00:04:24,204 --> 00:04:25,605
BULLOCK: Jimbo!

90
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,907
Meet Jake the JV pimp.

91
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,609
He's been bragging on the streets that

92
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,444
- he knows who the Ogre is.
- I keep telling you,

93
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:33,530
man, you been lied to;
I don't know nothing.

94
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:34,554
BULLOCK: Yeah?

95
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,580
We'll see about that.

96
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,997
(wheels squeaking softly)

97
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:07,814
(exhales)

98
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:17,690
Okey doke.

99
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:20,727
No body, no crime. No body, no crime.

100
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:26,032
Nope. Never seen him before.

101
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:30,803
We think this is a serial
killer called the Ogre.

102
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,772
He's kidnapped a woman,

103
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:35,074
and he's gonna kill her
unless we find him first.

104
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:36,576
Bummer.

105
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,144
Just so you understand,

106
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:40,847
the lady in question is a real good

107
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,048
friend of ours.

108
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:44,851
Supposing, for the sake of argument,

109
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:47,453
I did see him before.

110
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:48,888
What's she worth?

111
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,525
What's she worth?

112
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,527
Yeah, you know,

113
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,817
if you had to assign a dollar amount.

114
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,201
Harvey, I'm about to
violate departmental policy

115
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,705
on interrogation techniques.

116
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:09,108
Think I saw some donuts outside
with my name all over them.

117
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,912
Hey, now. C-Calm yourself.

118
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:15,427
There's no need to get carried...

119
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,985
Jake worked as a barman at a brothel

120
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,286
called the Foxglove.

121
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:22,922
Said the Ogre was a regular.
Can't give us a location.

122
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:25,091
Yeah, 'cause they never
use the same place twice.

123
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,125
- What, you know it?
- Not personally.

124
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:30,396
The Foxglove is very
high-class, very extreme.

125
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,165
You got to know someone who knows someone.

126
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,100
Uh, I might know someone.

127
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:35,735
Oh. You talking Penguin?

128
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:38,271
If you get any deeper with
that clown, he will own you.

129
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:40,240
I don't have a choice;
the Ogre has Barbara.

130
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,574
Let me shake a few trees.

131
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,942
Take the time, grab some z's.

132
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:44,577
You're burnt!

133
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:47,947
First one was the hardest.

134
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:49,849
But it wasn't her fault.

135
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:51,885
She just wasn't the one.

136
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,254
I also couldn't let her go.

137
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,489
Still, it strengthened my resolve

138
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:58,858
to never stop till I found my soul mate...

139
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:01,261
Person I could share everything with.

140
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:07,567
I think that person is you,
Barbara, but I need your help.

141
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,836
So...

142
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,772
let's begin again, shall we?

143
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:14,807
(whimpering)

144
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,710
(gasps)

145
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,143
This just, uh...

146
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:32,746
came for you by messenger, Master Bruce.

147
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:37,918
Thank you.

148
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:42,856
Right, well, I'll...

149
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,858
I'll just be off.

150
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:46,326
Do you want company?

151
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,562
To identify Reggie?

152
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:52,165
No, I don't think so. Best done alone.

153
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,302
I'm sorry, Alfred.

154
00:07:56,048 --> 00:07:57,304
I know he was your friend.

155
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,039
Just doesn't make any sense.

156
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:01,875
Reggie topping himself like that.

157
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,710
You said he fell out of a window.

158
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,278
He might've been
drinking, lost his balance.

159
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:06,646
(scoffs)

160
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:09,416
No, Reggie, he was a legend.

161
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:13,078
He could be blind drunk
and walk a tightrope.

162
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:17,524
Doesn't matter what he was like in the end.

163
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:20,093
I want to see he gets a proper send-off.

164
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:25,599
I'll see you this evening, sir.

165
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:34,114
(door closes)

166
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:54,494
LIDIA: What, your boss
doesn't trust his partners?

167
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,329
It's called due diligence.

168
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:58,565
He just wants me to look the place over.

169
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,933
So look.

170
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:03,603
I got a gravy going... Special party today.

171
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:05,372
Don't let me keep you.

172
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:07,407
(chuckles softly) Piece of work.

173
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,187
GILZEAN: I'll put the pistol under the bar,

174
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:23,223
machine gun behind the juke.

175
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:26,693
All Connor and his guy got to do

176
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,495
is get to them.

177
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,497
The day is finally here. (chuckles)

178
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:31,531
(door opens)

179
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:33,400
Maroni...

180
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:35,302
(chuckles) Jim.

181
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:37,804
So lovely to see you.

182
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:41,641
To what do I owe this wonderful surprise?

183
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:43,343
I need to know where the Foxglove is.

184
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:45,745
And I need an invitation.

185
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,647
(laughs)

186
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:49,649
Well, someone's in a mood.

187
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:51,985
Can you help me out? Yes or no.

188
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:57,023
Jim, I do so love our
give-and-take relationship.

189
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:59,826
But it's starting to feel a bit one-sided.

190
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,461
Fine.

191
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:03,396
I'll owe you a favor.

192
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:04,898
You already do.

193
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:07,901
Then I'll owe you another.

194
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:11,171
Cards on the table.

195
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:12,939
The Foxglove makes a lot of money

196
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:15,454
for some important f...

197
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:18,912
(gasping)

198
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:21,514
You think you know who I am.

199
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:23,783
What I'm capable of.

200
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:25,752
You have no idea.

201
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:27,706
Today is an important day for me...

202
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:32,359
so I will accommodate your request.

203
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:36,196
But, Detective, mark my words.

204
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,965
You owe me a big favor.

205
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:48,041
WOMAN: Here we have the
Physical Operations department.

206
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:50,644
The Physical Operations department

207
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,746
handles logistics for the corporation,

208
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,681
management of our properties, offices...

209
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:57,083
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

210
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:59,598
Of course, Mr. Wayne. It's right here.

211
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,221
Thank you.

212
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:11,097
(fire alarm ringing)

213
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:17,370
The Foxglove is in the old
Klondike Building on Mayflower.

214
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:19,272
- You score a ticket?
- Yep.

215
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:20,340
But only one.

216
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:22,809
I figure you go in, pose as a john,

217
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,377
find something to bust them on,

218
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:26,980
then we squeeze them till they talk.

219
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:28,782
Smart move sending me, hmm?

220
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:31,256
You couldn't look more like a
cop if you wore a blue uniform.

221
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:33,053
You got something to wear?

222
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:35,255
- You, uh, are gonna need to fit in.
- Don't worry.

223
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:37,257
Alvarez busted some guys
smuggling Italian suits

224
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,793
last week, and a couple fell in my locker

225
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:42,262
on their way to the evidence room.

226
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,897
(snickers)

227
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:46,266
JASON: I'm sorry I left you alone,

228
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,903
but you needed time to think,

229
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:52,605
to accept that this was real.

230
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,008
This apartment is soundproofed, by the way,

231
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,043
so save your lungs.

232
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:05,385
(chuckles)

233
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:09,189
(panting)

234
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:16,025
Look at me. My hands are shaking.

235
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,826
That's never happened before

236
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,021
with any of the other
women that I've had here.

237
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,331
You know why that is?

238
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,966
(shuddering exhale)

239
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,136
Do you know why

240
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,104
that is?

241
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,607
You're a psycho.

242
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:33,642
I don't know what you're thinking.

243
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,983
It's because I always somehow knew

244
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:45,187
that deep down, the others weren't the one.

245
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,189
(grunts) They weren't the one.

246
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:49,992
(panting)

247
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:53,205
I want this to work, Barbara.

248
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:00,683
You're scared.

249
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,472
It's okay.

250
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,819
Jim will find...

251
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,221
(grunting)

252
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,690
(crying)

253
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,527
The only way you're
going to make me angry is

254
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,896
if you mention his name.

255
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,235
(panting)

256
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,907
Drink this.

257
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:33,567
It's water. You're dehydrated.

258
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:46,295
Barbara, come here. I
want you to see something.

259
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,031
Barbara, I love you.

260
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,356
I love you like no one has ever loved you.

261
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:57,457
But if you try to escape,

262
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:59,623
I will chain you to
the ceiling and gut you.

263
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:02,616
Now come... here.

264
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,015
(sniffles)

265
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,393
Are those...

266
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,995
When you're looking for love,

267
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,730
you have to kiss a lot of frogs.

268
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:28,292
Still, I-I should be thankful.

269
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,168
They led me to you.

270
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,871
(shuddering breaths)

271
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,907
All those women...

272
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,012
they died here?

273
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,065
You killed them...

274
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,816
here?

275
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,785
Yes.

276
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,822
(glass shatters)

277
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,358
(shallow gasping)

278
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,722
Don't worry.

279
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:56,815
I'm gonna set you free.

280
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,794
You're the one, Barbara.

281
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,900
You're the one.

282
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,573
(fire alarm ringing)

283
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,335
(fire alarm continues ringing)

284
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,512
(alarm stops)

285
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:52,794
(door opens)

286
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,324
BUNDERSLAW: Hello, Bruce.

287
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,917
I've been expecting you.

288
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:09,439
Ever since your friend borrowed my key,

289
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:11,087
I've been expecting you.

290
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:12,745
Even canceled my trip.

291
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,716
Cookie?

292
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:18,771
When I was a boy,

293
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:21,507
I'd always take a cookie
when I had the chance.

294
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,678
You hired a man to kill Alfred.

295
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:28,847
I hired your guardian's comrade

296
00:16:28,882 --> 00:16:30,249
to find out what you knew.

297
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:33,285
I never intended harm to come to anyone.

298
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,690
I told the board you were a special case,

299
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,091
that you need the talk

300
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:41,356
early.

301
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,271
The talk?

302
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:46,586
Bruce, when members of the
Wayne family reach a certain age,

303
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:49,323
some facts of life and
business are explained...

304
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:51,992
Wayne Enterprises is
committing serious crimes.

305
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:54,094
Oh, my, yes.

306
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:56,563
This is a multinational corporation

307
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,999
operating in hundreds of jurisdictions.

308
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:03,022
We do our best to subvert all
of them if it means profits.

309
00:17:03,382 --> 00:17:06,373
So... you admit it?

310
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:08,008
Just like your father.

311
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:11,845
He came in with his secret
files, demanding justice.

312
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:13,180
At first.

313
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:15,349
Then he changed his mind.

314
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,370
You're lying.

315
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:18,705
Your father

316
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:21,062
came to understand the
reality of this business.

317
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:22,579
As did his father.

318
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:23,952
And as will you.

319
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,836
My father was a good man.

320
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,330
You have an opportunity
to live a blessed life,

321
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,499
the life your father and mother

322
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:34,935
wanted for you.

323
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:38,171
I beg you to reconsider.

324
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,341
Pardon me.

325
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,368
Lucius, come in.

326
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:45,318
Bruce Wayne,

327
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:47,857
meet one of our junior
executives, Lucius Fox.

328
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:49,746
There's a public relations person out there

329
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,748
desperately searching for this young man.

330
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:54,150
Then you'd best reunite them.

331
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:56,219
Bruce,

332
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,688
don't forget your cookie.

333
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:14,037
Now...

334
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:16,339
I'm going to tell you
something, and I'd appreciate

335
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:18,741
if you kept your face perfectly still.

336
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:20,076
There's cameras everywhere.

337
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,678
I know because I put them there.

338
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:24,948
What I'm about to say must be a deep secret

339
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:27,083
between you and me.

340
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:29,452
I knew your father well.

341
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:31,387
He was a good man.

342
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:33,790
He wasn't the man the
company thought he was.

343
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:36,960
I don't understand you.

344
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:38,294
Bruce,

345
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:41,431
your father was a true Stoic.

346
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:44,867
He kept his best self hidden.

347
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:47,637
That's all I'll say.

348
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:53,576
(elevator bell dings)

349
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:56,045
Good luck.

350
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:01,317

One sec!

358
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:32,749
I need the Hendricks case files.

359
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:34,217
Um, yes. Hendricks.

360
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,318
Wait right here.

361
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:39,656

(gasps) Oh, my goodness.

365
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:50,200
What happened to him? Um...

366
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:53,169
axe... uh, a-accidental death.

367
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:54,938
Oh. At a sheet metal factory.

368
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:56,706
Industrial saw. Just...

369
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,141
(imitates buzzing)

370
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,443
Poor man.

371
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:04,013
I... I don't know how you do this job.

372
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:05,849
Death all around you.

373
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,083
(chuckles) Yes.

374
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:09,619
One must have a sense of humor.

375
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:12,188
The-the file?

376
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:13,456
Yes.

377
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:20,497
Um, Mr. Nygma,

378
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:24,033
you haven't, by chance, seen,
uh, Tom... Officer Dougherty?

379
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:27,537
We were... supposed to
have dinner last night.

380
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:28,671
He didn't show... no surprise...

381
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:30,206
Um, but I haven't seen him today.

382
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:32,409
Me neither.

383
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:35,145
Oh.

384
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,213
Excuse me. I really
need to get back to work.

385
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:38,314
Oh, uh...

386
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:39,516
- Uh...
- Now.

387
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,551
Okay. Um...

388
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:46,656
Oh, dear.

389
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,827
You're sure...

390
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,562
the guns are there?

391
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:55,116
Butch placed them himself.

392
00:20:55,132 --> 00:20:57,901
Do you remember what to say to
Maroni before you do the deed?

393
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:01,371
I never saw the point in
telling a man something

394
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:04,240
right before you're gonna whack him,

395
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:07,610
but you're not the first to ask for it.

396
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:11,146
I appreciate you humoring me.

397
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,117
So how do you know Maroni's
gonna be in this bar

398
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:15,952
on this exact day?

399
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:17,987

There he is.

Tommy freakin' Bones.

403
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:39,442
Nine years up the river,

405

Took care of myself.

00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:46,186
I was hoping you'd remember.

You say that

because you don't know what
it is to live without fear.

I'm looking for this man.

485
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,523
Arrest me if you want to; I
don't talk about my clients.

486
00:26:16,098 --> 00:26:20,001
One call to the Gazette, they'll
send a reporter down here.

487
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,237
I'll perp-walk each and
every one of your clients

488
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:23,638
in front of the cameras.

489

How's that sound?

490
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:29,719
Talk to Sally.

491
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:34,747
Do you know him?

492
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,516
You sure?

493
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,043
I'm sure.

494
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:50,832
He said his name was Jason.

495
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:53,168
He was sweet.

496
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:57,005
As soon as I got into his car,
he pulled a hood over my head

497
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,316
and tied my wrists.

498
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:00,208
He took me back to his apartment.

499
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:02,444
That's where he did this.

500
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,946
I don't know why he let me go.

501
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:06,781
When was this?

502
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:08,617
-Almost nine years ago.
- About a year before

503
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:10,885
the first murder... He
was working his way up.

504
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,387
Why didn't you go to the police?

505
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:13,688
I did.

506
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:16,491
I was a hooker; he was
a rich man with no name.

507
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:18,560
Anything else you can tell us?

508
00:27:18,594 --> 00:27:20,862
Anything about his
apartment? The smallest detail

509
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:22,731
might help.

510
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,235
The elevator opened
right into the apartment.

511
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:29,237
You can see out into the city.

512
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,739
We were in midtown.

513
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,208
And there was a big neon sign

514
00:27:33,242 --> 00:27:35,722
on the building across the street.

515
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:37,812
I could only read the last four letters.

516
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:39,914
O-Y-A-L.

517
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,583
GORDON:
O-Y-A-L.

518
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:43,585
Hmm. Loyal, royal...

519
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:44,853
Royal.

520
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:46,388
Gotham Royal Hotel.

521
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:48,056
That's in midtown. 10th and Gainsly.

522
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,391
Thank you, Sally.

523
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:50,925
Promise me, when you find him,

524
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,495
don't arrest him.

525
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:54,896
Kill him.

526
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,166
You got it.

527
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,468
(laughter, quiet chatter)

528
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:02,837
Whoa, fellas, private party.

529
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:04,706
CONNOR: Just here to pay respects.

530
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,242
MARONI: Connor from the wild northeast.

531
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,712
What's that old man Falcone want now?

532
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:12,714
Don Falcone sends me with his respects,

533
00:28:12,748 --> 00:28:14,549
and a small gift for you

534
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,384
and Tommy Bones on this happy day.

535
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:17,585
Cheech.

536
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:21,489
MARONI: Forgive my suspicious nature.

537
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:24,592
Of course. Can't be too careful.

538
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,796
Come here. Let me see this.

539
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:32,367
Madre Di Dios.

540
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:34,269
My favorite.

541
00:28:34,303 --> 00:28:37,539
You tell Falcone I appreciate the gesture.

542
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:39,253
Don Falcone knew it was a special occasion.

543
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:40,909
We got time for a drink. Lidia!

544
00:28:40,943 --> 00:28:42,444
Clean glasses, please.

545
00:28:42,478 --> 00:28:44,446
The gift comes with a message.

546
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,547
Oh, yeah?

547
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:47,449
What's that?

548
00:28:47,483 --> 00:28:49,250
He wants you to know that it wasn't easy

549
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:50,952
for him to decide to kill you.

550
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:52,420
(guns cocking)

551
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:55,724
Son of a bitch.

552
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,660
But business is business.

553
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,329
(guns clicking)

554
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,468
(grunting)

555
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:08,737
You believe it?

556
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:10,739
You both jammed.

557
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:12,774
If that ain't a sign from
God, I don't know what.

558
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:14,009
Please... Shut your mouth!

559
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,043
Ow! You're gonna take

560
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:16,411
Don Falcone a message from me.

561
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,924
- You're gonna let him know that you messed up...
- (grunting)

562
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:22,417
and you're gonna let him
know that I'm coming for him.

563
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:26,321
Of course, you don't need
to be alive to tell him that.

564
00:29:26,355 --> 00:29:27,455
Tommy, do the honors.

565
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:29,518
CONNOR: Wait...

566
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:48,322
Connor blew it.

567
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:50,347
Maroni's still alive

568
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,372
This is flat!

569
00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:55,291
Did you not hear me?

570
00:29:55,316 --> 00:29:56,971
Maroni is still alive!

571
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,346
You got to get out of town.

572
00:29:59,371 --> 00:30:01,027
And miss all the fun?

573
00:30:02,242 --> 00:30:03,820
You knew.

574
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,936
You set him up.

575
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:10,234
I took the firing pins out of
the guns before you hid them.

576
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:12,727
(laughs): A spin on a
trick I learned from Maroni.

577
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,613
But you could have had Maroni dead.

578
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:20,896
True, but I still would've
been under Falcone's thumb,

579
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:23,987
and that... has grown intolerable.

580
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,381
No, I'd much rather Maroni be alive,

581
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:29,639
and out for blood.

582
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,103
Alas, Officer Dougherty, she's
gonna wonder where you went.

583
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,910
Perhaps a letter.

584
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:48,705
You could say good-bye,
give her some advice.

585
00:30:49,588 --> 00:30:51,556
Something that might lead her

586
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,559
to make better choices in the future, hmm?

587
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:09,607
(yelling)

588
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:35,333
BULLOCK: Jim?

589
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:39,137
Place is empty.

590
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:42,006
But there's something you should see.

591
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:49,612
You see anything that connects to Barbara?

592
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,451
Maybe she was never here.

593
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:55,381
No, she was here.

594
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:57,240
I can still smell her perfume.

595
00:31:58,138 --> 00:32:00,677
Hey, we're gonna find this guy,

596
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:03,182
but you need to prepare yourself...

597
00:32:04,812 --> 00:32:07,158
that we might not be in time to save her.

598
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:08,760
That is not an option.

599
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:10,719
It's the most likely option.

600
00:32:10,744 --> 00:32:12,745
(phone ringing)

601
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,473
Hello.

602
00:32:26,508 --> 00:32:28,442
JASON: Detective Gordon,

603
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:30,544
I assume you are the one
who triggered the alarm.

604
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:32,279
You son of a bitch. Where's Barbara?

605
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:35,582
(over speakerphone): With me, of course.

606
00:32:35,617 --> 00:32:36,984
If you've hurt her...

607
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:38,852
She's as safe as milk.

608
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:41,355
Safer than she ever was
when she was with you.

609
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:42,789
(train horn blowing)

610
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:44,591
What the hell does that mean?

611
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:46,793
She doesn't need your protection, Jim.

612
00:32:46,828 --> 00:32:49,029
Fact is, she never did.

613
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:50,631
I'll see you around.

614
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:52,666
Wait. (line clicks, dial tone)

615
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:55,802
He was driving.

616
00:32:55,837 --> 00:32:57,571
To Tahiti if he's smart.

617
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:59,139
Yeah, there was a noise, right?

618
00:32:59,174 --> 00:33:02,943
A thumping, like he
was going over a bridge.

619
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:05,812
You know, I heard, uh, a
horn, like a train horn.

620
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:07,814
Okay, so, which bridge has a train?

621
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:09,650
Um...

622
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:13,320
Damn. Um... Whitecross, but
that's the upstate train.

623
00:33:13,354 --> 00:33:15,989
Upstate.

624
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:18,025
It's where her parents live.

625
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:22,095
(whimpering softly)

626
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:27,301
Barbara, please.

627
00:33:27,326 --> 00:33:29,293
What's happening?

628
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:32,787
JASON: What's happening is your
daughter is finally waking up.

629
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:36,338
Please.

630
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,747
Barbara, we're doing this for you.

631
00:33:40,782 --> 00:33:42,049

Drop the knife, or I'll shoot.

Just an ounce of pressure,

I don't want that. Do you want that?

649

It's gonna be all right, Barbara.

It's gonna be all right.

Won't be me that slits her throat.

He's dead?

Yeah. He's dead.

It's gonna be okay.

Not really, uh, an experience

674
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:21,043
I'd care to repeat, Master Bruce.

675
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:25,404
But then again, the Reggie
I knew died years ago.

676
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:32,291
Alfred, I haven't been honest with you.

677
00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:37,650
After you were hurt,

678
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:40,062
Selina and I went looking for Reggie.

679
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:44,710
We found him.

680
00:37:46,169 --> 00:37:48,136
Did you, now?

681
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:49,865
He didn't jump

682
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,692
or fall.

683
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:55,110
Selina pushed him.

684
00:37:56,145 --> 00:37:58,747
And why did she do that?

685
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:02,617
Reggie was sent here by a
man named Sid Bunderslaw.

686
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:04,886
Bunderslaw works for Wayne Enterprises.

687
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:06,922
Reggie gave us the name,

688
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:09,296
but said he was gonna tell
Bunderslaw what we were doing.

689
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:13,962
I see.

690
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:16,131
And the rest?

691
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,760
The charity ball...

692
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:21,087
Presumably to have
access to Mr. Bunderslaw.

693
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:25,407
Selina stole the key to his office safe.

694
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:28,110
I went there today. It was empty.

695
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:31,656
But Bunderslaw was waiting for me.

696
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:32,814
- What did he do?
- Nothing.

697
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:35,059
- What did he do?!
- Nothing!

698
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:36,918
(breath quivering)

699
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:39,290
But he said that my father and grandfather

700
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:42,324
knew about the illegal things
that the company was doing,

701
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:44,159
and chose...

702
00:38:44,193 --> 00:38:46,662
They chose to stay quiet.

703
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:51,433
(sighs)

704
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,871
Your father was a good man.

705
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,571
I know.

706
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:02,783
But even good men have secrets.

707
00:39:05,048 --> 00:39:07,049
(applause, excited chatter)

708
00:39:08,885 --> 00:39:10,886
There he is.

709
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:14,366
MAN: That guy right there.
MAN 2: Yeah, nice work.

710
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:15,655
MAN 3: Yeah, nice work.

711
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,685
Congratulations. You're a hero.

712
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,027
Yeah, it won't last.

713
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:20,896
Tomorrow, they'll go back to hating me.

714
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,397
Well, then I'll remind them.

715
00:39:23,954 --> 00:39:26,277
Yesterday, you were trying to help.

716
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:28,170
I couldn't hear it. I'm sorry.

717
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:30,878
I would never try to change you, Jim.

718
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:34,009
Your sense of mission... it's
part of what I love about you.

719
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:36,745
I thought it was my devastating good looks.

720
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:38,046
That's a joke.

721
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:40,082
(laughs)

722
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:43,552
I was scared.

723
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,664
Scared that Barbara would get hurt

724
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:49,425
and you would blame yourself
for protecting me first,

725
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:52,743
and then whatever we had would die.

726
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:56,498
It wasn't heroic. It was selfish.

727
00:39:58,935 --> 00:40:01,536
(sighs)

728
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:03,272
Lee, I love you.

729
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:05,440
Not her.

730
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,886
If I had to do it again,
I'd still protect you first.

731
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,951
(gasps)

732
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:17,519
What did you do?

733
00:40:17,553 --> 00:40:20,722
Uh, grabbed a... knife by the blade.

734
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:23,191
Of course you did.

735
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:24,559
Let me see.

736
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:25,874
(sighs)

737
00:40:28,831 --> 00:40:30,799
(groans softly)

738
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,468
Miss Kringle?

739
00:40:33,503 --> 00:40:35,704
Are you okay?

740
00:40:37,388 --> 00:40:39,690
I got a letter from Officer Dougherty.

741
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:42,244
He left town.

742
00:40:43,096 --> 00:40:44,446
(clears throat)

743
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,649
"Don't wait around for
me. Go have some fun,

744
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:49,451
and maybe I'll give you
a call when I get back."

745
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:50,619
Blah, blah, blah.

746
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:52,777
Couldn't even tell me to my face.

747
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:56,592
I mean, why do I keep picking creeps?

748
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:00,847
Sometimes with men, you need
to read between the lines.

749
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:04,066
Sometimes with men, you need a drink.

750
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,965
(chuckles)

751
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:07,227
Good day, Mr. Nygma.

752
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:14,688
Read between the lines.

753
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:18,113
(laughing)

754
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,185
♪ ♪

755
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:49,745
♪ ♪

756
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:17,472

757
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:19,508
(tires screech)

758
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,923
Everybody listen up!

759
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:43,332
Just got wind of three separate attacks

760
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:45,434
on Falcone businesses in
different parts of town.

761
00:42:45,468 --> 00:42:48,003
Word is it's Maroni.

762
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,940
As of right now, all leaves are canceled,

763
00:42:51,975 --> 00:42:55,010
and all units are called
in for active duty.

764
00:42:55,044 --> 00:42:57,011
We're in a shooting war, people.

765
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,402
(laughing)
