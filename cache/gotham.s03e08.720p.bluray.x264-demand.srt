- Clean up guy for the Gotham underworld.
- Bingo.

161
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,375
I'm thinking it was some kind of
business deal. Maybe an unhappy customer.

162
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,835
Perhaps a competitor?

163
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,468
Good place to start.
Hey, listen, seriously, Jim,

164
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,472
I'm glad you're back.

165
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,185
Me too, Harv. Feels good.

00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,864
This wasn't just business.

169
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,370
We should call Barnes.

Do you know why I'm here?

00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,219
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

173
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,934
She's in there, isn't she?

174
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,228
Inside of you.

175
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,401
Hello, sister dear.

176
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,073
Just tell me,

177
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,953
you grew up with your sister,
you've seen this virus first hand.

178
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,788
How do I beat it?

179
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:08,502
Hmm, I believe the way this works is

180
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,424
you give me something.
I give you something. Tick-tock.

181
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,259
- How's about I let you keep your teeth?
- Or?

182
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,308
My sister's virus is a beautiful thing,

183
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,064
it makes the darkest parts
of a person sing.

184
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,064
What darkness in you

185
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,439
has Alice brought to life?

186
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,944
Tell me that, and I'll tell you everything
I know.

188
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,123
The guilty.

189
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,004
My anger at them.

190
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,971
Oh, but it's not anger I see.

191
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,802
Rage.

192
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,975
Violent, bloody rage.

193
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,192
All right, Tetch, my turn.

194
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,152
Is there a cure?

(SIGHS)

196
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,697
Yes, there is a cure.

197
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,242
What is it?

198
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,835
You give in, and let my dear sister win.
(LAUGHS)

199
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,746
You think I'm playing!

200
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,132
- Have you heard the voices?
- What voices?

201
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,093
The virus, even as it grows stronger,
waxes and wanes.

202
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,677
You may have the illusion you're winning.

203
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,300
Then you hear the voices,

204
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,684
those dark voices from deep within you,

205
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,434
whispering, whispering.

206
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:53,197
And, finally,
you'll see the world as it really is.

You don't know me!

You've dirtied your hands, haven't you?

213
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,836
And now you're desperately
trying to make it right.

214
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,212
I can make it right.

217
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,730
I'm back.

218
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,821
I suppose it was only a matter of time.

Once a cop, always a cop.

220
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,457
For better or worse,
this is where I belong.

221
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,922
- How's Vale?
- Good. I think.

222
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,178
Well, she's out of the hospital anyway.

223
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,638
- You two are not...
- No.

224
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,723
I'm not trying to make this awkward.

225
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,430
Why would it be? We're both adults.

226
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:12,728
- There's no reason we can't work together.
- I'm glad you feel that way. Mario agrees?

227
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,773
- He will. Eventually.
- Right.

Our engagement party is tonight.

229
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,904
I only bring it up
because a few people here are going.

230
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,122
- Now it's awkward, isn't it?
- A little.

231
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,833
You wanna know about the two bodies

232
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,585
- that, were found this morning?
- Yes.

233
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,424
I've only done
the preliminary examination.

234
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:35,467
But that John Doe in the acid?
His face had been removed.

235
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,797
Removed? How?

236
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,259
Scalpel? Razor blade? Whoever did it
knew exactly what they were doing.

237
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,049
- I'll have more for you soon.
- Okay.

238
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,975
Jim.

239
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,180
I think you made the right decision,
coming back.

exactly look like just business.

But, right now, we're thinking

242
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,077
(CLEARLY) whoever paid Paulie Pennies
to dispose of the body

243
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,416
in the bathtub also might have killed him
to tie up some loose ends.

244
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,624
Uh-huh.

245
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,718
Jim, good to see you with a shield again.
And a tie.

246
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,846
- Captain. Good to be back.
- Bullock was just filling me in.

00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,848
- Hell of a one to catch on your first day.
- Yeah. (SIGHS)

It's the preliminary report from Lee.

249
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,979
John Doe had his face removed.

250
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,727
Trying to cover up his identity?

251
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,190
I don't know, maybe.
But the acid would've done that anyway.

252
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,649
I'm running point on this one.

253
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,814
- Honestly, Captain...
- That's cool.

254
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,635
Uh, look, I know I've been away...

255
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,871
Maybe that's why you've forgotten
how things go around here.

256
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,374
- I give you an order, and you follow it.
- Which, for the record, Captain,

257
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,705
I totally support.

258
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,371
I'm taking point on this.
I'm not giving you the day off.

259
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,547
Follow the physical evidence, Bullock.

260
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,133
- Report back to me.
- Aye aye.

261
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,673
Jim,

262
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,180
I didn't mean to bite your head off.

263
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,437
It's just sometimes the ugliness here
gets to me.

264
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,940
No need to explain.
Let me know if you need anything.

265
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,900
And, uh...

266
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,108
Don't let the bastards
haze you too hard, rookie.

267
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,322
(CHUCKLES) Yes, sir.

Here's the one you wanted, Captain.
Uh, mid-level felon. Goes by The Toad.

270
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,412
Yeah, that's him. Thank you.

272
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,438
What if there's something about
Miss Kringle's... Kristen's...

00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,311
Isabella's face.

274
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,019
What if there's something about her face
that unlocks this side of me?

275
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,274
What if I do hurt her?

276
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,988
- Oswald?
- Yes?

277
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,486
You're smiling.

278
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,908
- I was?
- Yes.

279
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,955
On. (STAMMERS)

280
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,575
I was just thinking

281
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,956
how darned lucky Isabella is.

282
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,090
You love her, yet to protect her
you are willing to break up with her.

283
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,722
Beautiful. Sad.

284
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,892
- But beautiful.
- So you think I should break up with her.

285
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,971
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that's what
we were talking about.

286
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,648
- Oh. Certainly, I would never pressure...
- No, you're right.

287
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,483
If I did hurt her,
I would never forgive myself.

(SCOFFS)

289
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:50,153
That life would put her in your path again
only to snatch her from you.

290
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,992
- Why?
- I can't do it.

291
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,828
- What?
- I can't break up with her.

292
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,460
- But you said yourself...
- I need you to do it for me.

293
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,338
Would you do that?
I would be forever in your debt.

294
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,303
Just be gentle.

295
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,141
Of course.

00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,067
I'm looking for a punk
who supposedly frequents this rat hole.

Captain Nathaniel Barnes of the GCPD.

00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,211
How about you and I go down
to the precinct,

301
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,593
and you can answer some questions.

(GLASS SHATTERS)

306
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,064
I wanna know about Paulie Pennies.

307
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,321
The body he was getting rid of last night.
Where did it come from?

(BREATH TREMBLING)

00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,288
Maybe you want me to open that mouth
for you?

310
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,700
Okay. Stop. I hired Paulie!

311

- But I'm just the go-between!

No one's responsible for anything.
Everyone's a middleman.

- I want a name!
- Symon. Okay?

Can't we bury the hatchet?
So I came at you with a knife,

477
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,177
kidnapped you, whatever.

478
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,686
I've forgiven you for beating me
unconscious. Water under the bridge.

479
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,723
You just stay right here.
I'm gonna get someone.

480
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,097
I'm leaving.

481
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,066
I just wanted to ask.

482
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:32,397
As someone else who was once
with Jim Gordon, don't you miss it?

483
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:33,738
Miss what?

484
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,695
The heat.

485
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:40,204
Being so close,
so much darkness and light,

486
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,365
to someone always at war with himself.

487
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,289
Let me think. Tormented Jim Gordon.

488
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,954
Or Mario, who I know is a good man,

489
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,340
who'll be a wonderful father
to my children,

490
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,962
and whom I love.

491
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,385
No, I don't miss it.

492
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,470
Wow.

493
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,552
I think you actually believe that.

494
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,717
(CHUCKLES) It's kind Of sad.

495
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,429
Tell my dates I've left, would you?

496
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,561
Uh-uh.

497
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,476
- Don't let her ruin your night.
- (SIGHS)

498
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,561
Captain, I'm so glad you came.

499
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,319
I can't stay. I came to congratulate you.

500
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,700
You deserve to be happy.

501
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,527
Thank you.

502
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,414
But you have to stay
for at least one drink.

503
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,541
If nothing else,
to save me from these people.

504
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,580
One drink.

505
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,919
- But no work talk.
- Deal.

506
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,876
So, among the materials
confiscated in Symon's lab,

507
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,716
I came across
a unique anesthetic cocktail.

508
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,633
Let me guess, the same cocktail
toxicology found in the John Doe.

509
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,799
Exactly.

510
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,016
Hey. I got some bad news. Symon walked.

511
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,263
What?

512
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,938
The girl he had tied up refused to
press charges, they probably paid her off,

513
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,603
and we just got an order
from Judge Bam-Bam

514
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,064
demanding his immediate release.

515
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,242
The botoxed son of a bitch
is uber-connected.

516
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,904
The toxicology definitely ties Symon
to the John Doe murder.

517
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,289
We gotta get him back here.

518
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,625
Captain Barnes?

519
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,300
Carmine Falcone.
I don't believe we've met.

520
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,637
No. But I was just leaving.

521
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,596
I see. Is my company so odious?

522
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,635
You belong behind bars.

523
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,811
I'm retired.

524
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,349
After running Gotham's underworld
for 30 years.

525
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,987
This city was built
because of men like me.

526
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,364
People have jobs because of men like me.

527
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,525
That whiskey you're drinking,

528
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,160
paid for through my work.

529
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,821
So you did some good. So what?

530
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,164
It doesn't mean you're above the law.

531
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,582
Nobody is.

532
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,996
You know, whenever I hear a man
possessed of such certainty,

533
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,416
I always think he's trying
mostly to convince himself.

534
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:02,262
I wish you a pleasant evening, Captain.

- Hey, Cap.
- Alvarez.

538
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,948
Tell Gordon I'm bringing him the man
responsible for Paulie Pennies' murder.

539
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,871
No backup.
He's coming in of his own accord.

540
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:36,588
Sure thing, Cap. But you should know
the judge released Dr. Symon.

541
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,670
We had to let him go.

551
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,607
Isabella?

552
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,952
Isabella, I got your note.

553
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,707
I thought you needed
to leave for your conference.

554
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,499
ISABELLA: I can be late, Edward.

555
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,629
This is more important.

Oswald... (CLEARS THROAT)

557
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,679
Oswald,

558
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,061
the Mayor,
he informed me of your position.

559
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,142
But believe me, I think

560
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,486
our breaking up is for the best.

561
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,485
No, Edward, it's not.

562
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,823
I understand your fear.
It comes from a place of love.

563
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,034
I know you won 't hurt me.

564
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,792
You never could.

565
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,790
I don't think that you...

566
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,629
(GASPS)

567
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,460
on, my... (SHUDDERS)

568
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,341
Kristen.

569
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,637
I found old photos in newspapers.

570
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,515
- You have to...
- I need to leave. Now!

571
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:13,143
No, no, no. Look at me!

572
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,771
- Look at me!
- You don't know what you're doing.

573
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,650
I am forcing you to face your fear!
You won't hurt me!

574
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,311
Even when I look like this! Edward!

575
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,275
Edward.

(CHOKING) Edward.

580
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,314
Should I take the glasses off?

581
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,937
Keep 'em on.

582
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,740
Seal off the exits. But do it quietly.
Last thing anyone wants is a scene.

583
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,906
FEMALE OFFICER: Yes, sir.

584
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,043
A little late for that.
What are you doing here?

585
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,885
I'm sorry, but we have to make an arrest

586
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,631
in the Paulie Pennies case.
We tried to get the guy at home.

587
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:25,965
But his housekeeper said he was here.

588
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,843
Just makes you realize what a small town
Gotham is, doesn't it?

589
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,801
Couldn't you wait'?
If he's here, he's not exactly running.

590
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,216
She makes a good point, Jim.
You wanna take that one?

591
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,725
Good evening, everyone.

592
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,058
Jim, what's going on?

593
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,064
Apparently, there's a murder suspect
among our guests.

594
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,270
Can I ask who?

595
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,193
Dr. Maxwell Symon. He's a...

596
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,489
Plastic surgeon. You arrest him, you're
gonna have to fight off every woman here.

597
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,649
He's a favorite.

598
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,697
He's also a murderer.

599
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,575
I'd be curious to know
how your father knows him.

600
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,490
I'm sure that their relationship
is completely aboveboard.

601
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,542
While you two hash this out.
I'm gonna go grab Symon.

602
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,918
- Harvey.
- What?

603
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,001
I can handle a plastic surgeon on my own.

604
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,257
Don't worry, discretion is my middle name.

605
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,596
Lee, I'd like a word with Jim.

606
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,553
- Mario.
- It'll be fine.

607
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,558
Okay.

608
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:35,152
Look, Mario, I have a job to do,
so whatever this is...

609
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,240
When you told Tetch to kill Lee,
you knew he would do the opposite.

610
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,667
You sacrificed your girlfriend
for my fiancée.

611
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,750
- That's insane.
- Can we just admit you still love her?

612
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,230
- I don't have time for this.
- Hey!

613
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:53,011
You once told me that
if I ever hurt her Lee, you'd kill me.

614
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,134
Well, now it's my turn.

615
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:59,218
I love Lee, and I'll do
whatever I have to to keep her.

616
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:03,017
Then word of advice, lose the jealousy.

617
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,473
It's weak.

618
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,148
Gordon.

619
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,240
(SPITS)

620
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,576
For Lee, I'll give you that one.

621
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,890
Oh, Captain.

622
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,468
If you keep frowning like that,

623
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,754
you'll never get those wrinkles out
around your mouth.

624
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,190
Come down to my office tomorrow.

625
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,853
I'll give you a free evaluation.

626

- (GRUNTING)
- (GROANING)

627
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:00,738
I'm surprised you can feel that
through that thing you call a face.

628
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,413
What are you doing? (GRUNTS)

629
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,282
What I should have done all along.

630
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,620
(PANTING)

631
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,706
You're insane.

632
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,799
Oh, no, Doc.

633
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,210
I'm saner than I've ever been.

634
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,181
I'm seeing things clearly
for the very first time.

635
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,560
All these years,
I've put my trust in the system,
