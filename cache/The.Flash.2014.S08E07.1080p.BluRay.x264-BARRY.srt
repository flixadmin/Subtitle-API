1
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:08,218
<i>10-38 on Dayton Boulevard
at Second Street intersection,</i>

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,467
<i>unit en route.</i>

3
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:12,388
Routine traffic stop downtown.

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:13,681
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:17,101
It looks like it was a good day
to pull monitor duty, Chester P.

6
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:20,480
Ooh. Snack time.

7
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:30,822
Damn!

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,701
I was supposed to make
the egg salad this morning.

9
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:37,372
Grandma Runk
is going to be epically mad.

10
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:38,957
Now I got nada for lunch.

11
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:47,715
Although, legally, I am entitled
to break every four hours,

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,926
and it's only gonna take me,
like, four minutes

13
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,471
because the kitchen
is just right down the hall.

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,685
Then again, that is time enough
for a nuclear meltdown

15
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,853
and an alien invasion in this town.

16
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,188
- So...
- Hey, Chuck.

17
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,274
Oh, what up, A?

18
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,442
I thought you'd be working.

19
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:09,654
I was. And then I remembered
it's Wednesday,

20
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:13,366
and that place I told you about at
last week's <i>D&D</i> game, Hirschfield's.

21
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:16,911
Today is when they have their amazing
chicken Parmesan sandwiches.

22
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:18,997
So I thought, "It's lunchtime.

23
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:20,852
Why not surprise you with the treat?"

24
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,375
Wow, thanks.

25
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,794
Guess I'm lunch date worthy now, huh?

26
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,463
Chuck, you are date worthy
in all the major categories.

27
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:29,548
I am?

28
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:31,009
Yeah, definitely.

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,761
I mean, that's good.

30
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:38,766
That's good to know, you know,
and I, too, think that you are also,

31
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:44,856
um, what you just, like, worthy
of what you just said a second ago.

32
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,404
Holy Alice H. Parker.

33
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,367
Okay, we've got a mugging
in progress up at 119.

34
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:55,908
And a carjacking at
the Edwards Center parking lot.

35
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,535
And a hold up at Jitters.

36
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,412
And they're all happening right now.

37
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,682
<i>Don't worry, guys, already on it.</i>

38
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,207
Uh, all of it, Boss?

39
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,552
You heard me.
I want everything in the register,

40
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:18,014
and a triple shot latte
with oat milk, not soy!

41
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,936
I think these guys could use
some help finding their cells.

42
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:25,897
Thanks, Flash.

43
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,564
Yeah.

44
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,859
What's going on out here?

45
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,904
- I didn't do nothing.
- I want to see my lawyer.

46
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,405
Yeah, what they said.

47
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:35,739
Hey...

48
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,201
Any chance Flash brought
that latte I ordered?

49
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,871
Officers, take these gentlemen
to holding, please.

50
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:44,456
Ow.

51
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,293
Captain. Hey.

52
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,338
Staff meeting's canceled, Allen,

53
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,607
and for the record,
you'd have been late.

54
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:55,301
Sorry, I, uh, was just... I got caught up
with a little blood spatter analysis,

55
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:56,737
but it looks like
you've had a busy morning.

56
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,764
Yeah, and it's about to turn into
a busy afternoon, evening and night,

57
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,725
thanks to this generous donation
from the Scarlet Speedster.

58
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:05,895
But the Flash caught those guys,
that's a good thing, right?

59
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:09,107
How can I press charges when
I don't know what crimes were committed,

60
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,334
how they were done and where?

61
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,402
I forgot that file's on my desk.
I'll be right back.

62
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:15,321
And it's not like we can just
call up the Flash and ask.

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,573
Yeah, like on a Flash phone or...

64
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,032
Yeah.

65
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,077
That's a terrible name.

66
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:21,785
Yeah.

67
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:26,332
Uh, but Captain, C.C.P.D.'s never had
a line to the Flash before.

68
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,084
Yeah. But, for once,
I would like to feel

69
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,837
like the Flash and law enforcement
are on the same page.

70
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:33,214
Instead of us just
always playing catch up.

71
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:37,760
But, since that's not happening,
cancel any plans you have for tonight.

72
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,262
We've got a lot of legwork to do.

73
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,225
You're welcome.

74
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:05,037
Sounds like Kramer has a point.

75
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:07,516
Uh, look, maybe I could do
a better job communicating

76
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,642
when I'm dropping off criminals.

77
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,210
But giving C.C.P.D.
a direct line to the Flash,

78
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,397
you don't really think
that's necessary, do you?

79
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,275
I don't know, Barr. When I was captain,
I had a direct line to the Flash.

80
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,010
Mm, I mean, me, too.

81
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,739
When I was district attorney,
if I had a question on a case,

82
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,615
all I ever had to do was call you
and get the details.

83
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,932
That's because you're family.

84
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,559
Which she is not, and I get that.

85
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,812
But what she and I went through
when we were tracking down Craig,

86
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,356
I... I trust her with my life.

87
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,485
And maybe you should consider
letting her in a bit more.

88
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:38,946
Give her one of the alert apps
that we all have on our phones.

89
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,740
Joe, look, I get it.
She's a good cop.

90
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:41,823
She's a great captain.

91
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,952
And when I first got my speed.

92
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,412
I needed a lot of help.
Not just from Caitlin and Cisco,

93
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:48,539
but from you and
everybody at C.C.P.D.

94
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,501
- But now...
- Now you've leveled up.

95
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Yeah.

96
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,799
Which means I can find other ways
to solve Kramer's Flash problem,

97
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,135
like doing extra C.S.I. work to collect
what she needs for processing.

98
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,679
I mean, that'll ease
the burden for her, right?

99
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:08,976
It sounds like it, and I get how
keeping church and state separated

100
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,187
is the easiest choice,
but I also know Kramer,

101
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,440
and if she's asking
for a line to the Flash,

102
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:17,151
she probably has a good reason.
Just saying.

103
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:21,572
Maybe you want to think about it
before you decide what to do, Barr.

104
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:31,958
Waddup, party people!

105
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,669
It's your boy, Chester P,
and I'm ready to rock your world

106
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:39,507
with knowledge
for free, free, free, free.

107
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,134
Hey, today we have a self-flying drone

108
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:45,513
based off of an AI algorithm
created by yours truly.

109
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,557
I'm gonna upload the specs online

110
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,102
because here at the Runk Yard,
we keep tech openly sourced,

111
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:52,727
and classy.

112
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,568
All right,
how is this even possible?

113
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,275
I have silenced my phone,

114
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,360
I have turned off all the notifications,
and look at what keeps popping up.

115
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:03,256
This all from Frost and Mark?

116
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:06,075
Oh, you mean my sister
and her ex-con-boyfriend?

117
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,035
Yes, they are.
Look at what they're doing.

118
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:11,830
Looks cool.

119
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:12,957
No, it looks dangerous.

120
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,669
Hey, hey, Caitlin, do you mind just
taking a wee little step to the right?

121
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,255
Are you live streaming?

122
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,590
Uh-huh. Yeah.

123
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,592
WookiLover77 says,

124
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:23,885
"Who's the girl?

125
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,928
Her sister seems cooler."

126
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,555
Okay, that's it for today.

127
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:28,931
Smash that "Like" button.

128
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,767
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

129
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:32,851
I'm just so annoyed.

130
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:35,438
Mark keeps taking Frost
on all these ridiculous dates.

131
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,273
Well, maybe tonight will distract you.

132
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,520
Don't you have a date, too?

133
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:42,987
Yes. Yeah. Marcus is taking me
to the Spanish Hamper.

134
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,240
How'd he get you guys a reservation
for the hottest place in town?

135
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,325
That's impressive.

136
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:48,868
Is it turning serious?

137
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:53,205
I mean, he's really nice,
and I like nice.

138
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,000
So, that's nice. It's nice.

139
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,753
Oh, man. I can see it now.

140
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,838
He doesn't know we're on Team Flash.

141
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,052
But soon, you and Marcus
are gonna fall in love,

142
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,527
and then he's going to join us for,
like, some crazy adventure.

143
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,345
Then, boom! He's on the team.

144
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,307
Hey, hey, maybe he'll learn
how to control plants.

145
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,934
It's their third date, Chuck.

146
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,077
So maybe just slow your roll.

147
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,395
You're right, right. Reel it.
Reel it back.

148
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,481
Yeah, speaking of,
I should go get ready.

149
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:19,899
Good night, guys.

150
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,442
- Have fun.
- Bye.

151
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,527
Fancy date night.

152
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,530
- Sounds expensive.
- Yeah, right.

153
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:31,410
Could be fun, though.

154
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,292
Yeah, I have to go write, article...

155
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,296
I gotta type things,
algorithms and such. Mm-hmm.

156
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,587
Oh, that's a typo.

157
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,174
- Huh? Oh.
- No, uh, I'm just thinking out loud.

158
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,005
I'm just gonna...

159
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,851
Hey, Captain, you got a sec?

160
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:57,687
I'm on my way to Processing.

161
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,770
These will come in handy.

162
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:02,024
Um, I cross referenced the 911 calls
from this morning

163
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,468
with the description of the perps
that the Flash brought in.

164
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:07,130
And then I hit the crime scenes,
fingerprints, security footage.

165
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,614
Korber even interviewed witnesses.

166
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:11,093
So, this should be everything you need
to wrap up these cases.

167
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,994
Wow, I appreciate the hustle, Allen.

168
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:15,984
I just wish it was more than
a band aid on a bullet wound.

169
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:19,792
Well, you have more than enough
to charge all three suspects.

170
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,420
What about the suspects
the Flash drops off tomorrow,

171
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,087
or the day after that?

172
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,841
Respectfully, Captain.
I mean, this is the way

173
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,653
we've done things the past seven years,
ever since the Flash showed up.

174
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,595
You know, the system works.

175
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,055
From your perspective.

176
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,741
But there are things
you don't need to worry about

177
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,560
as a forensic scientist
that I need to consider as Captain.

178
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:38,978
I understand that.

179
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,439
But you know, the Flash
is just trying to help this city.

180
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,065
And he does, all the time.

181
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,152
But together,
we could help it even more,

182
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:49,655
humans and meta-humans alike.

183
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,425
Now, if you'll excuse me.

184
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,373
Hey, hey, hey.

185
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:33,115
Time to get to work.

186
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
What the hell?

187
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:56,971
What are these?

188
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,435
They're meta dampening bracelets.

189
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,563
I've seen these before.

190
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,108
Wakey wakey, ladies and gents in blue.

191
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,610
Folks call me Goldface.

192
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,656
That's because if it's made of gold,
it's mine to control.

193
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,866
From your dental fillings

194
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:19,829
to 0.35 grams of gold
in your cell phones.

195
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:22,218
Don't even bother
trying to phone a friend.

196
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,038
Because we knocked out
the nearest cell phone tower.

197
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,586
But, if anyone does come calling,

198
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,565
they'll find a couple of
Central City's finest outside

199
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,091
telling them there's a gas leak.

200
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,153
What are you doing? What are you... Hey.

201
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Goldface.

202
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,852
This is my precinct.

203
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,230
You have a problem,
you take it up with me.

204
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:47,648
But my officers go.

205
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,732
Ah.

206
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,153
If it isn't the famous Kristen Kramer.

207
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,406
I loved you
on the <i>Citizentopia</i> podcast.

208
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,448
Very inspiring.

209
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,741
Thanks.

210
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,662
Captain, I'm guessing
you want to play hero.

211
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:06,292
Let me let my man Carver here
show you what happens

212
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,669
to anyone that gets out of line.

213
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:14,217
Now, you may have all noticed that
you're sporting a new piece of jewelry.

214
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,969
Well, since Captain Mimic here
outed herself as a meta,

215
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,513
I figured she may not be
the only one of you.

216
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:21,973
But these bracelets,

217
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,966
they don't just dampen powers,

218
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:26,020
they also do this.

219
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,995
You feeling me now, Captain?

220
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,333
Hold on.

221
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,001
Don't I know you?

222
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,677
You're that rat that cost me
the organ printer.

223
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,215
The chemist!

224
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,596
Yes. Um, yeah.

225
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,767
Look, I was on an undercover assignment.

226
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,354
Look, why don't you just tell us
what it is you want?

227
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,649
Nobody has to die tonight.

228
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,987
You know, my lady, Amunet Black?

229
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,408
Not only is she the finest female
this side of the Mississippi,

230
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,536
she's got some intel
that there are some very rare

231
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,831
and valuable items in your armory.

232
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,626
I want what's in there.

233
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:32,836
So I'mma go get it.

234
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,882
And if anyone tries anything...

235
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,842
We get the belt.

236
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:44,139
Good memory, chemist.

237
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:48,560
Keep an eye on this one.

238
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:51,522
He smells of trouble.

239
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,950
Seriously, Marcus, I am so sorry.

240
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,328
I cannot believe I made
a dinner reservation for next January.

241
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:07,412
Please don't feel bad.

242
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,391
Last week at work,
I screwed up the blooming cycle

243
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,393
for the Selenicereus grandiflorus
I've been growing.

244
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,257
Should've seen all the pollen.

245
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,689
Thank you. I mean, you're really,
you're just such a trouper.

246
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,631
This first round is on me.

247
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,219
This place is a little seedier
than I remember.

248
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,013
It's fun. Plus, they got karaoke.

249
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,931
<i>Next up,
The Ice Pack.</i>

250
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,182
- There is that.
- Yeah.

251
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,476
<i>You're as cold as ice</i>

252
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,440
<i>You're willing to sacrifice our love</i>

253
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,984
Hey! Way off-key but they're committed.

254
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,611
We need to leave.

255
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:43,698
Caity?

256
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,160
What a coinkidink.

257
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,786
What are the two of you doing here?

258
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,207
We are just grabbing a casual drink,
but it's too crowded in here.

259
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,503
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Is this
the infamous Marcus, as in Dr. Ficus?

260
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,923
- Um... Yes.
- Holy crap!

261
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,301
Hey, you two are here.

262
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,635
Mark and I are here.

263
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,572
We should totally make this
a double date.

264
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:06,512
Yes!

265
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,307
Oh, no, we'll let you
get back to it.

266
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,392
Hey, they've got great food here.

267
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,728
- Um, if you like to live dangerously.
- We don't.

268
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,147
But you want to stay, right?

269
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,167
- We can workshop some plant-y ice puns.
- Um...

270
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,735
Um, well, I've heard a lot about Frost.

271
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,321
It'd be nice to have a person
to go with the stories.

272
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,074
Yeah, yeah.

273
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,492
Great.

274
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,702
Let's double date.

275
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,375
I count three hostiles
guarding us here, two at the exits.

276
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,753
Carver's with Goldface
in the armory.

277
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,256
We have the numbers
to take back the building.

278
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,386
Except everyone on our side
has a bomb strapped to their wrist.

279
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,806
These things are ultra-sensitive.

280
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,658
You tamper with them, they'll blow.

281
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,184
The same goes for Goldface's belt.

282
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,145
We've got to do something.

283
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,439
Whatever it is, we've got to do it fast.

284
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,569
Captain, do you have any idea what
Goldface wants in the armory?

285
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,826
All I can tell you, Allen,
is if he gets in there,

286
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,412
things are gonna get a lot worse.

287
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,588
Open sesame.

288
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,633
According to Amunet's intel,

289
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:29,138
the target should be in there.

290
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,731
I love my woman.

291
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,241
Not what you're expecting, Boss?

292
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,909
Of course it's not. It's empty.

293
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,412
Go get Kramer.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,376
And her little chemist, too.

295
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,134
Where the hell are they?

296
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,799
I don't know what you mean.

297
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,183
The meta-bullets.

298
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,853
<i>Remember, Captain? The ones you had
commissioned for your task force?</i>

299
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,023
One shot takes away
any meta's powers forever.

300
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,026
Am I ringing any bells?

301
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,319
That's what you're stealing?

302
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:27,988
That's what I'm selling.

303
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,117
The power to take down
any meta in this city,

304
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,828
including, say it with me...
The Flash.

305
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:42,503
Well, that's going to bring me
a lot of gold.

306
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,839
But those bullets
aren't where they're supposed to be.

307
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,383
Captain, any thoughts on that?

308
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:50,843
Yeah.

309
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:56,475
Those bullets belong to C.C.P.D.
for only the most severe emergencies.

310
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:01,021
Also, I'd die before betraying
the metas of this city,

311
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,439
and putting them in any danger.

312
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,856
Mm.

313
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,860
I'm willing to bet you'd risk
your own life, Captain, but...

314
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,867
How about this fool's?

315
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,255
Let him go!

316
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,005
Tell me where the meta-bullets
are hidden, Captain.

317
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,425
You have till three.

318
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,053
One, two...

319
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,597
I can help you.

320
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,644
Oh, yeah, chemist?
Like you helped me steal that printer?

321
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,313
The meta-bullets have trace elements
of the dark matter.

322
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,984
- I've got a scanner in my lab.
- Let me guess.

323
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,598
I let you go, you go get it
and bring it right back to me?

324
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:50,821
Allen, what are you doing?

325
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,239
I can adjust the scanner.

326
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,938
It will find the bullets.
They have to be here somewhere.

327
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,212
When we first met,
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

328
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,800
Plot twist. You're not only
untrustworthy, you're a coward.

329
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:13,928
Watch Kramer.

330
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,171
I'm gonna take the chemist here
on a little field trip.

331
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,390
One last chance to live up to his name.

332
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,149
All right.

333
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,028
We got a Dark 'N' Stormy for Marcus,
Chardonnay for Caitlin,

334
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,740
and a whisky for Mark and me,
on the rocks, of course.

335
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,115
Thanks, Snowflake.

336
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,915
You know, there's a cactus plant
that makes great cocktails.

337
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,169
The pads of the Opuntia cacti
pair perfectly with an agave spirit.

338
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,314
I bet it would really cover the taste
of strychnine, too.

339
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,132
- Strychnine!
- Wow.

340
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,510
A genius botanist,
who can mix drinks, I like him already.

341
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,597
So, how did you two meet?

342
00:18:59,056 --> 00:18:59,972
Oh...

343
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,311
Well, we met here, actually.
Mark was...

344
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,605
Pouring beers by day
and murdering delivery men by night.

345
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,693
- What? It's true.
- She's exaggerating it.

346
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,153
Well, not exactly.

347
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,445
Okay, fine.

348
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,491
Mark and I each spent some time
on the wrong side of the law.

349
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:21,828
But I paid for my crimes,
and Mark turned state's witness

350
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,413
against some really bad guys.

351
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,083
Yeah, and the DA expunged my record.

352
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,168
So now, clean as a whistle.

353
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,842
Well, seems like you've
turned over a new leaf.

354
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,297
Hey, Dr. Ficus.

355
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:33,924
- There he is.
- So good.

356
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,300
Hey, I kind of like that.

357
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:40,305
Listen, Frost and I are going skydiving
again next weekend.

358
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:42,849
Double date round two?

359
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,320
What do you say?
I mean, you seem cool, man.

360
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,497
I don't know, I've...
I've always wanted to go skydiving.

361
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,106
I'm game. What do you say, Caity?

362
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,780
Marcus, did you know
that when Mark got out,

363
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,865
he seduced my sister

364
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,702
so that he could steal a weapon out
from right under her nose.

365
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:06,164
- After he helped us save the day.
- And she was so upset

366
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:11,336
that she just kept moping and crying
and even needed to take a sabbatical.

367
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,672
- Caitlin...
- I apologized for all of that.

368
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:14,713
And I accepted it.

369
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,217
Frost, I mean, how naive can you be?
He's already betrayed you.

370
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,428
And yet you're out there live streaming
the two of you

371
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,847
jumping out of airplanes
and making out on cliffs.

372
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:25,100
- Remember Mount Shasta?
- Hell yeah.

373
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,893
Frost, what is wrong with you?

374
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,480
You're acting like some stupid teenager
falling in love with this guy,

375
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,898
who's already hurt you.

376
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,235
And, guess what,
is definitely going to do it again.

377
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
And you know what?

378
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,865
When that happens,
I am not picking up the pieces

379
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,158
because I am done with broken hearts.
You got that?

380
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:43,869
You know, we get it.

381
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:48,165
You don't like me, but Frost
is an adult with her own life,

382
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,892
and so long as she's choosing
to spend it with me,

383
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,116
then you need to deal with it.

384
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,316
Are you really going to let him
talk to me that way?

385
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,009
- Your sister?
- Yeah, I am.

386
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:03,472
Because he's my boyfriend and anything
else is none of your damn business.

387
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Hey.

388
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,236
I think I'd like to go home.

389
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,073
- I'll pull the car around.
- Yeah.

390
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,714
I'm sorry. Do you mind?

391
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,257
Oh. My bad.

392
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,908
Maybe I should just take
a leisurely stroll down the hallway.

393
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,931
I'm gonna watch you like a hawk
watching a juicy vole.

394
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,770
Do you need to take that?

395
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:59,110
Baby girl, what time is it now
in London town?

396
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,924
You eating a nice balanced breakfast
like we discussed,

397
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,533
not just the bangers and mash?

398
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,117
Meta-bullets?

399
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,746
Yep, not exactly.

400
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,165
Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, baby...

401
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,651
I know the buyer's schedule, baby.

402
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,294
Yes, baby.

403
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,464
No, we just hit a teensy little snag.

404
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,340
But you know me.

405
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,508
I got it all worked out.

406
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,637
Okay, I love you, too.

407
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,600
I said, I love you up top,
Ammy Whammy.

408
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,937
I lub, lub, tub, Ammy Whammy.

409
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,858
I say something funny?

410
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,612
No. No, you just...

411
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,032
You seem to have a great relationship
with Amunet.

412
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,077
Police reports
say you work together now.

413
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,246
Damn right,
we have a great relationship,

414
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,456
- and it's because we work together.
- Hmm.

415
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:57,919
Ammy and I used to have separate crews,
separate heists, separate hideouts,

416
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,922
but it's like Dr. Finkel says,

417
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,640
"If you want your partner
to enter your heart,

418
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,304
you can't just open the doors.
You gotta open the windows."

419
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,933
So, you see Dr. Finkel?

420
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,520
Sharon sees us, man.

421
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,691
Okay? And she helped us realize
that we never were truly committed.

422
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,569
But now we're not just partners in love,

423
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:24,987
we're partners in crime.

424
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,483
And since we stopped holding back
and have gone all in,

425
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,410
our relationship's never been better,

426
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,661
or more lucrative.

427
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:40,045
And if I don't have those meta-bullets
in hand, within the next hour,

428
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,256
Ammy Whammy says
our buyer is going to walk.

429
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:47,093
So, you... look, the dark matter
we're looking for is microscopic.

430
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,929
So, I'm sorry,
I'm going to need more time.

431
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,265
No. You need incentive.

432
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,228
Barry, you don't have to help him.

433
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,148
Finish the scanner now.

434
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,534
Or your Captain gets to meet
the white whale.

435
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,276
Hell yeah.

436
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:07,614
She's gonna
walk the plank, y'all.

437
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,617
Ahab didn't... I'm sorry,

438
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,327
do you not know <i>Moby Dick?</i>

439
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,413
"To the last I grapple with thee."

440
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:20,168
What about <i>Wrath of Khan?</i>
"From hell's heart I stab at thee.

441
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,004
For hate's sake I spit my last..."

442
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,300
I bought you a first edition
for your birthday.

443
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,639
BA in Literature from Yale.
I'm surrounded by Philistines.

444
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:35,934
Time's up. Waste her.

445
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:37,435
No. Wait, wait, wait.

446
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:42,941
Um, look, it might not be perfect,
but the scanner is done.

447
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,878
Now, there's that service
with a smile I've been waiting for.

448
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,028
Uh...

449
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:50,782
So, all you have to do
is touch this button right here.

450
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,041
Put these in. Put these in.

451
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:02,792
How did you...

452
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,730
I've reset the scanner from infrared
to infrasonic.

453
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,006
Come on. We gotta go. Come on.

454
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,349
Time to make them go boom, boss?

455
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,702
Not when she's the only one
who can tell me

456
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,046
where the bullets are hidden now.

457
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,352
Find them.

458
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,524
Nobody hides from Goldface.

459
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,192
Nobody!

460
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,470
What does it look like out there?

461
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,494
Clear.

462
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,182
But it's only a matter of time
before we're discovered.

463
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,875
We need to figure out
our next move fast.

464
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,544
Okay. This is a storage room
for junked equipment.

465
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,838
So, let's look for anything
we can patch up and use,

466
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:50,050
tools to get these bracelets off,
anything.

467
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Hold on.

468
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,639
- Captain, look.
- It's deactivated.

469
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:58,265
How is that possible?

470
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,661
Your powers work by mimicking the powers
in nearby metas, right?

471
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,396
Yes. Whenever I'm in high stress
situations around other metas

472
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,396
it just happens.

473
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,983
For about 30 seconds,
I gain their powers. Why?

474
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,278
These bracelets release RNA
energy pulses that repress meta genes.

475
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,573
Your DNA is constantly morphing
based on your adrenal levels,

476
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,158
and your proximity to other metas.

477
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,036
The cuffs weren't designed
to handle erratic gene fluctuations.

478
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,037
So...

479
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,082
So, my mimic powers
short-circuited the bracelet.

480
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,333
This is great.

481
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,754
Okay, now you can mimic
Goldface's powers and take him down.

482
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:27,794
He'll never see you coming.

483
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:28,916
No, I am not ready for that.

484
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,026
Why not? This is the chance
we've been waiting for.

485
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,635
I said I can't do it, Allen.

486
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,303
Let's just stick with your plan.

487
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:36,781
Find something here that can help us.

488
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:37,806
We don't have much time.

489
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,484
<i>Pardonne-moi, madame.</i>
Room here for two to pay their tab?

490
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,986
Don't want this fine establishment
to think I'm a thief.

491
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,366
So, you disappear when people
want you to stick around,

492
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,910
but you stick around
when people want you to disappear?

493
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,996
I'm all kinds of complicated, Caitlin.

494
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,060
Maybe that's why you can't see
how much we have in common.

495
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,379
Yeah, believe it or not,

496
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,006
both of us care about Frost.

497
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,551
Yeah, and that's why you abandoned her.

498
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,634
I...

499
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:21,015
Fine, I screwed up before,
but Frost is special,

500
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,892
and so I'm making up for it
as best I can.

501
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,453
I'm even putting in time
with the family.

502
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,312
Yeah, well,
what do you know about family?

503
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,357
Uh, I know that mine's
dysfunctional as hell.

504
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,540
And the way you went off in there,
you kind of reminded me of them.

505
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,199
Yeah, you sounded just like
my frumpy, backstabbing nana,

506
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,285
at every Blaine family reunion ever.

507
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,078
I mean, talk about cold.

508
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,292
Congratulations.
You actually gave me flashbacks.

509
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:52,797
I'm sorry I blew up.

510
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,009
But if you care about Frost
as much as you say you do,

511
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:59,304
then you'll agree that she deserves
someone who...

512
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:02,599
Accepts her, warts and all,
just like I do?

513
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:09,314
Caitlin, like it or not,
Frost and I are all in.

514
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:13,526
There is no holding back
or hiding pieces of ourselves.

515
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,277
Like you.

516
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,692
What are you talking about?

517
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:19,616
Come on, I used to tend bar, remember?

518
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,243
This isn't about Snowflake and I.

519
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:25,163
This is about you
being more focused on hating me

520
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,539
than focusing on your own date.

521
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,401
You've been holding back all night

522
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,212
because you're afraid
to go all in with Marcus.

523
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,215
Am I wrong?

524
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,054
Look, it's...

525
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,225
It's okay to be scared.

526
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,913
But at some point
you've got to take a leap of faith

527
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:51,147
like I did with Frost
and like she's doing with me.

528
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:56,611
Trust me, it's the best decision
that either of us have ever made.

529
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,028
Hmm.

530
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:01,908
And one more thing...

531
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,495
Marcus is a really good guy.

532
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:10,041
So maybe stop thinking about
what it is you have to lose

533
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,436
and start thinking about what it is
you might gain.

534
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,503
You know?

535
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:17,673
Thanks.

536
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,176
- For what?
- Gotta go.

537
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:35,732
You find anything?

538
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:36,942
No, not yet.

539
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:38,527
Let's just keep looking.

540
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:43,116
Captain, your powers are
our only hope of stopping Goldface.

541
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:44,659
I told you, I can't.

542
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,203
- Why not?
- Because I can't control them.

543
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:54,545
Barry, the other day,
I ordered an iced coffee,

544
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,046
but when I picked it up,
it boiled in my hand.

545
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,924
Turns out the barista was a heat meta

546
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,593
and I mimicked her powers
without even realizing it.

547
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,470
Well, I...

548
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,809
I understand, but you can work
on controlling your powers.

549
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,226
I have tried.

550
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:15,440
But I can't figure it out,
and no one can teach me.

551
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:22,323
That's why you've been so anxious
about getting in touch with the Flash?

552
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,155
You want him to train you.

553
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:30,246
Why didn't you just say
that was the reason earlier?

554
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,083
Because it's hard for me
to ask for help.

555
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:35,959
And...

556
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,758
When I mimicked
that other meta's abilities,

557
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,635
if they had been more lethal,

558
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:48,139
I could have killed someone without even
realizing what was happening.

559
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,810
I was hoping Flash
could help me learn to control them,

560
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:54,771
but he's out of reach.

561
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:00,151
<i>I am madness maddened.</i>

562
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,278
<i>Come out, come out,
wherever you are, Captain.</i>

563
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
<i>Because if you don't</i>

564
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,449
I'm going to do this
the old-fashioned way

565
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:10,536
and start squeezing your brave officers
until they pop.

566
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,916
<i>Two minutes, Captain. Tick-tock.</i>

567
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:23,049
<i>Clock's ticking down, Captain.</i>

568
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:24,735
Captain, you have to go down there
right now.

569
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,879
Don't you think I know that?

570
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:30,264
Look, I did two tours
on a Kandaki battlefield,

571
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:31,641
I am not afraid of dying.

572
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,853
And I won't let any more women
or men under my command get hurt.

573
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:38,272
But, right now, I don't know
how to prevent that.

574
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:39,857
You have to use your powers.

575
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:42,151
Look, I know you're worried
about losing control,

576
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,154
but the military gave you
all the training you'll ever need

577
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,864
to harness your own instincts.

578
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,784
So, instead of worrying about trying
to control Goldface's powers,

579
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:50,909
just let it in.

580
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,288
Let it take over, and then go all in
on trusting your instincts.

581
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,541
Believe me, you can do this.

582
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:02,255
Even if I could, what good would it do?

583
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,743
It will give me the 30 seconds I need
to get this cuff off.

584
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,386
- What?
<i>- O Captain, my Captain.</i>

585
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,304
Just stall Goldface
until I can get us help.

586
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:13,228
Barry, you saw what happens when someone
tries to take off that trinket.

587
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:15,268
- Do you have a death wish?
- No. I can do this.

588
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,354
And you can handle Goldface.
You know why?

589
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,360
You are one of the bravest people
I've ever met.

590
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,739
Let's take back our house.

591
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,415
I'm done playing, Captain.

592
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,001
You've got 30 seconds
to give me what I want,

593
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,084
or Officer...

594
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:42,836
What's your name again?

595
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,130
Korber.

596
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:47,667
Is that with a C or with a K?

597
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,636
- K.
- K, thanks.

598
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,682
It's Bye, Felicia,
for Officer Korber here.

599
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,643
And for every minute
I'm empty-handed after that,

600
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:02,440
another person dies.

601
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:04,608
Thirty.

602
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,067
Twenty nine.

603
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,863
Twenty eight. 27.

604
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:12,450
Boss, you could just skip
the counting and kill her, you know.

605
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,536
You have no sense of drama.

606
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,081
Where was I?

607
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,294
Twenty seven, 26...

608
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,630
Twenty six, 25...

609
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:26,713
Let her go.

610
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,430
You don't disappoint, Captain.

611
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,437
What the hell!

612
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:43,855
Give me back my chain.

613
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,234
You want it? Take it from me.

614
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,018
Why isn't your bracelet working?

615
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:54,951
Didn't match my outfit.

616
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,052
Wow. You have seriously leveled up.

617
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:50,423
Looks like the chemist
wasn't so smart after all.

618
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:52,592
That just leaves you.

619
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:54,802
Time to bring the pain.

620
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:03,603
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

621
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:08,316
- Oh, my God, Allen, he must...
- No, he's okay.

622
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,776
I got him out just in time,
thanks to you.

623
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,655
Now, what were you thinking
breaking into a police station?

624
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,198
Who's bad idea was that anyway?

625
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,119
Seriously?

626
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:23,955
What can I say?

627
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:25,583
I'd do anything for love.

628
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:30,588
One of you guys get this?

629
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,266
Take this evidence to Processing.

630
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,893
- You're late.
- Yeah, I know.

631
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,353
- Again.
- I'm sorry.

632
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:46,812
You were amazing.

633
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:48,439
You went toe to toe with Goldface.

634
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:52,193
So I heard.
Uh, I mean, Korber told me all about it.

635
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,862
Yeah, I held my own, long enough
for the Flash to arrive.

636
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,532
Of course, he left before I got a chance
to say thank you, again.

637
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:00,660
But at least I can thank you, Allen.

638
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:04,664
I never could have stood up to Goldface
that way if it weren't for your advice.

639
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,248
Oh, it was all you.

640
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:08,751
I just aimed you in the right direction.

641
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:14,298
By the way, I got to ask,
where are the meta-bullets anyway?

642
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:19,512
I had them transferred to A.R.G.U.S.
35 weeks ago.

643
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,473
And you kept that secret the whole time?

644
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,213
Goldface was about to kill you.

645
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,060
It's called a poker face, Allen.

646
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:30,564
I should get started on the paperwork.

647
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:32,655
At least this time
I know what the charges are.

648
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:47,540
- Can we talk?
- Mark's downstairs.

649
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:50,209
We have tickets to an underground rave
in Keystone City.

650
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,002
It'll just take a minute, please.

651
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:57,591
I acted like a total bonehead tonight,
and I was rude to you and to Mark.

652
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:58,884
I am so sorry.

653
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,761
Bonehead? Try "Jackass."

654
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,096
What is your deal?

655
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:06,475
I guess I have a lot of baggage
to unpack when it comes to dating.

656
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:07,892
You think?

657
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,565
The reason I've been afraid
to go all in with Marcus is

658
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,651
because the last time I did,
I lost everything.

659
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:21,490
And I think that's why it's so hard
for me to see you with Mark,

660
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:27,371
because I envy how honest and free
and effortless your relationship is.

661
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:28,622
Effortless?

662
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:29,975
I'm sorry.
That's not exactly what I call

663
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:32,126
the roller coaster that is Frost-Blaine.

664
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,171
You're aware I stabbed him, right?

665
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:37,964
Yeah.

666
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,925
You make it seem easy, at least.

667
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,304
And Mark helped me realize something.

668
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,266
Mark? My Mark?

669
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:48,684
Yeah.

670
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:51,812
Mark showed me that if I'm gonna have
a chance at finding the same thing,

671
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:56,400
then I need to take
the same leap with Dr. Ficus.

672
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,276
So I'm gonna do it.

673
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:02,239
Hmm. That's great. I'm happy for you.

674
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,004
Thank you.
And I'm happy for you and Mark.

675
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:08,204
Even though, he is himself.

676
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:13,209
So does this mean we can do
that whole double date thing for reals?

677
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,712
I need to patch things up with Marcus,
but, after that, I'd love to.

678
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:18,546
Great.

679
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,151
Mark and I signed up
for a roller derby on the weekend,

680
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,927
and we need two extra players.

681
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,970
So, you have a mouth guard, right?

682
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:30,684
Uh, I could probably find one, maybe.

683
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,395
Cool. Practice starts
tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

684
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,479
Don't be late.

685
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:48,744
Love what you've done with the place.

686
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:49,828
It's...

687
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:52,289
It's different than the last captain's.

688
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:57,545
Flash, on behalf of this
whole department, I wanted to thank you.

689
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,554
We couldn't have stopped Goldface
without you.

690
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:02,484
Hey, if it wasn't for
your smart thinking,

691
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,348
a lot of people
would have been seriously hurt.

692
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:07,847
So, from now on, if you need me,

693
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,181
you can call me on this.

694
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,911
If we're going to keep this city safe,
we need to do it together.

695
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,941
Which is why I want to share
something else with you.

696
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,150
My true identity.

697
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,196
Allen, I know it's you.

698
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,032
Wait, what?

699
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,369
How did you find out?

700
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,414
I found this charred bracelet
in the storage room.

701
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,875
There is only one way

702
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,078
you could have escaped
a bomb exploding on your wrist.

703
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:40,128
Super speed.

704
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:45,076
You know, Joe was right all along.

705
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,465
You really are a great cop.

706
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,767
And I'd be more than happy to train you
to become an even better meta.

707
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,950
Since when do you know
how to make a Doro Wat?

708
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:13,329
Did you spend a year in Ethiopia
that I don't know about or...

709
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,956
It's called retirement.

710
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,751
I am learning to cook whatever I want.

711
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,338
Of course, all your little sister
wants to eat is chicken nuggets.

712
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,631
Hey, don't knock the nuggies.

713
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,132
I should check on her,

714
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,861
and make sure she's still asleep
and not trying to make a break for it.

715
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:28,885
Mm.

716
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:32,348
Yeah, I'm gonna pack Barr
some leftovers. He's working late.

717
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:36,644
But, first, I am going to have
a little bit more.

718
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:48,404
Dad.

719
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,406
Uh...

720
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,951
Uh, weren't you just upstairs?

721
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,410
Yeah,

722
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:58,874
and then I went to the garage
because you asked me to get the files

723
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,376
from the old Scarpola case.

724
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:02,877
Remember?

725
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,171
Um...

726
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,926
Yeah. I must have just
checked out for a second.

727
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:10,970
Mm. I get it.

728
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:13,097
That's a food coma, baby girl.
