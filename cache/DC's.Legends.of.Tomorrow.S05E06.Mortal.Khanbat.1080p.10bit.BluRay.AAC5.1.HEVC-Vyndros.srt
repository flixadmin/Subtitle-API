00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,045
[Constantine] <i>Previously</i> on
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,506
Astra's dead mother
was a powerful witch.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,133
[Natalie] Why did you bring me back?

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,968
Natalie, is that really you?

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,512
Natalie brought you here
to help me save Astra.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,556
What do you know about the Loom of Fate?

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,807
Do you wanna know what I'm hiding from?

8
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,601
- Yes, I do.
- That bloody Loom.

9
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,436
He still has ten years.

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,687
Can you make it zero?

11
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,272
Bye-bye, Johnny.

12
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,899
[coughing violently]

13
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,986
-[fast heartbeat]
-[Ray] John.

14
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>John, can you hear me?</i>

15
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:30,947
<i>What happened?</i>

16
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,324
[Gary] He just collapsed.

17
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,241
Out of nowhere.

18
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,492
[Charlie] After coughing up
a bucket of blood.

19
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,328
Come on, Johnny. Stay with us.

20
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,624
Gideon, we'll need to run a scan.

21
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,750
[Gideon] Right away, Dr. Palmer.

22
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,336
[coughing]

23
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,378
Oxygen mask, please.

24
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,257
The Loom. Where is it, Charlie?

25
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,842
Not now, John, all right?
You've got to rest.

26
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,677
- What loom?
- Astra's ghost mom.

27
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,180
She told... Oh, my God.
Hold me, hold me.

28
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,306
- Hold me.
- What the hell's going on?

29
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,016
[Gideon] As you can see from
his chest X-ray,

30
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,977
Mr. Constantine has
a very aggressive form of lung cancer.

31
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,687
I'm afraid it's terminal.

32
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,900
[lighter clicks open]

33
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,194
Well, there's no point in quitting now.

34
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:23,833
[groans]

35
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,002
There's nothing funny
about lung cancer, John.

36
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,754
[chuckles] Who's laughing?

37
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,713
[coughs]

38
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,591
If you lose your hair,
I'm shaving my head in solidarity.

39
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:32,759
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute.

40
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,888
No saucy Al is butchering me
and pumping me full of drugs...

41
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,349
[Gideon] I took the liberty
of administering a sedative.

42
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,270
Mr. Constantine needs to rest.

43
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,982
Gideon, prepare the Jumpship.

44
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,400
[female voice] Clotho...

45
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,070
<i>Where are you going?</i>

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,614
<i>You can't escape us.</i>

47
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,408
[female voice 2] Clotho...

48
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,243
<i>You can't get away.</i>

49
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,995
<i>We see you.</i>

50
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,579
[breathing heavily]

51
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,206
No, no.

52
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,127
- Oh, mate!
- Charlie.

53
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,128
You're back.

54
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,547
[sighs in relief]
How are you doing, B-easy?

55
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,883
Where you been?

56
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,095
I was just...
I was just hanging out at Constantine's.

57
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,806
How is he?

58
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,017
- Dying.
- What?

59
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,643
No, don't worry. You know John-o,

60
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,145
he's always got a trick up his sleeve.

61
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,566
Bro, that donut you made me eat
had me hallucinating.

62
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,360
Starting today, I'm on a juice cleanse.

63
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,696
Zari, this is my...

64
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,282
friend, Charlie.

65
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,326
Charlie, meet my sister.

66
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,618
Mmm. Good fashion.

67
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,245
<i>[Agent Sharpe] Team meeting
on the bridge.</i>

68
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,413
Does that mean me?

69
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,081
<i>That means you, too, Zari.</i>

70
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,082
Cool.

71
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,128
So, You coming?

72
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,048
I wouldn't miss it. [chuckles]

73
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,178
Ah, Charlie.

74
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,221
We could really use your help right now.

75
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,350
With Sara in Star City and
Rory in a mood, we are short-staffed.

76
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,601
What's Mick in a mood about?

77
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,187
Ali. His girlfriend.

78
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,314
Ray, they only...
they only had sex once.

79
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,399
Well, when you know, you know. You know?

80
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,317
[clears throat]

81
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,194
[Agent Sharpe] Okay.

82
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,363
Listen, I know
we're all worried about John. Okay?

83
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,656
And we could just sit back
and wait for a miracle.

84
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,659
But does Marie Kondo rest
just because she built an empire?

85
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,577
- No.
- No.

86
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,953
No, she tidies up.

87
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,122
And that is exactly
what we're gonna continue to do.

88
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,541
We are gonna tidy up the timeline, yeah?

89
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,002
Gideon, show them
what we've been working on.

90
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,422
Each point represents
a potential Encore,

91
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,384
which means we can catch them
before they change history.

92
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,594
I call her...

93
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,847
The Prognosticator.

94
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,438
Okay.

95
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,859
Uh, anyway, there's a Category 5
in 1997, Hong Kong.

96
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,780
A mysterious gangster is moving in
on the Triad's territory.

97
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,449
Ray, I want you and Zari to QB.

98
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,034
Oh, you don't have to tell me
to Queen Bee,

99
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,536
it'll occur naturally.

100
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,539
You know what? Hong Kong traffic
is notoriously bad.

101
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,960
- So why don't we take my new scooter?
- Whoa!

102
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,670
I call her...

103
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,214
Scoots McGoots.

104
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,424
[gasping]

105
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,925
-[chuckles] Dude!
- That's so awesome.

106
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,138
The scooter, you're all impressed by?

107
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,432
[Zari] Oh, my God. I need one.

108
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,808
Wanna go for a ride?

109
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,976
- Yeah.
- Yes.

110
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,603
Ooh! [chuckles]

111
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,689
- Away we go.
-[chuckles]

112
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,898
Okay, I'm next.

113
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,858
Careful!

114
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,526
-[Ray] Slow down.
-[Zari] All right, speed her up.

115
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,569
[Ray] Nate. Nate?

116
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,877
Never been to Hong Kong before.

117
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,087
So, what's the plan?

118
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,466
I had Gideon cook up
the same sedative she dosed John with.

119
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,093
All we have to do is inject the Encore

120
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,678
and bring him back to the ship
for nap time.

121
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,596
One problem.

122
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,055
We're just supposed
to hope the Encore shows up

123
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,973
looking for a cuppa?

124
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,642
This is no ordinary tea shop.

125
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,105
It's owned by the Triad.

126
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,067
[Agent Sharpe]
Nate, how's the perimeter sweep?

127
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,820
No sign of a gangster from Hell yet.

128
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,281
So it looks like we've arrived

129
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,617
right as Great Britain
was getting ready to hand control

130
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,202
of Hong Kong back to China.

131
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,705
Oh, that's probably not pertinent
but keep up the research.

132
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,875
- Psst
- Gary! What are you doing here?

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,168
John's trying to leave the ship!

134
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,628
You have to stop him!

135
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,631
[Gideon] You should return
to the MedBay, Mr. Constantine.

136
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,591
John, what are you doing out and about?

137
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,092
Oh, listen, big man. [coughs]

138
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,178
Look, I know you're only
trying to help, all right,

139
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,556
but nobody gets Stage IV
lung cancer this fast.

140
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,310
Some sneaky git with a grudge against me
is bending the rules of magic.

141
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,020
Oh, who could hate you that much?

142
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,147
[sighs] The list is long.

143
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,442
I'm taking the Jumpship
home to narrow it. [coughs]

144
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,028
John, no, I cannot
let you leave this ship.

145
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,072
You are in need of medical supervision.

146
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,866
You can't let me?

147
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,744
You forget who I am, old son.

148
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,084
Fine.

149
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,378
But I'm going with you.

150
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,755
Hallelujah! [gasps]

151
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,507
That was intense.

152
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,346
The Encore's a no-show.

153
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,639
<i>I say we split.</i>

154
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,266
[motorbike engine revs]

155
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,091
Thirteenth-century armor,

156
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,093
Fu Manchu mustache.

157
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,429
Guys.

158
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,681
<i>I think I know who the Encore is.</i>

159
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,311
<i>It's Genghis freaking Khan.</i>

160
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,991
How the hell did Genghis Khan
get to 1997

161
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,534
and learn how to ride a motorbike?

162
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,038
Genghis used horses
to revolutionize warfare.

00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,450
Nevertheless,

330
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,873
give me what I desire
and I will spare his life.

331
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,084
[knocking at door]

332
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,337
John, Nora's here.

333
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,923
[Constantine] All right, I'm coming.

334
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,093
[coughing]

335
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,348
Okay, Pippa,

336
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,685
can you wish our friend John healthy,
like we discussed?

337
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,438
Yes, but I want something first.

338
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,940
Pippa's made a lot of progress

339
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,443
but we're still working
on a few challenges.

340
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,694
Hey!

341
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,281
The Master of the Dark Arts
needs your help!

342
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,241
Shut up, four eyes.

343
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,493
Now you listen to me, you little squirt.

344
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,247
Now you're gonna make that damn wish
because if you don't and I die,

345
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:25,377
then I'm gonna come back and haunt you
every waking hour of your life.

346
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,840
Fairy Godmother, I wish your scary
British friend wasn't sick!

347
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,592
There you go. Easy.

348
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,302
Okay.

349
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,521
[gasps, wheezes]

350
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,731
[sighs]

351
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:53,864
[coughing violently]

352
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,534
Ah, no matter.

353
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,536
I'll try something else.

354
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,206
I wish I was home!

355
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,250
Sorry.

356
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,252
Bye, Ray.

357
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,881
Bye, Nora.

358
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,927
[exhales]

359
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,681
[Nate] So, when did
you and Charlie, you know...

360
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,351
- It's that obvious?
- Mmm-hmm.

361
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,520
After Heyworld.

362
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,981
Wow. That's nice.

363
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,652
- How was it? She shapeshift?
- That's what you want to talk about?

364
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,861
100%, but we don't have to.

365
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,448
Look, Charlie's clearly affecting you,

366
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,033
so come on, talk to me.

367
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,743
- It's stupid.
- What?

368
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,496
She left without saying goodbye.

369
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,872
Mmm.

370
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,165
Yeah, that sucks.

371
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,169
But if you were thousands of years old,
wouldn't you be over goodbyes?

372
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,297
The least she could've done is texted.

373
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,173
How hard is it to send a ghost emoji?

374
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,676
[man] Maybe it wasn't about you.

375
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,724
Dum-dum's got a good point.

376
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,977
B, chin up. You are a catch.

377
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,937
If there was a female version of you,

378
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,814
I would be all over her. Fact.

379
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,566
Like my sister?

380
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,483
Absolutely.

381
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,651
But the point is,

382
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,945
we don't know why Charlie
didn't say goodbye.

383
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,572
So just check your ego...

384
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,324
and ask her.

385
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,284
You're right.

386
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,703
- Thanks, Nate.
- My man.

387
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,001
Where's our prisoner?

388
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,757
[groans]

389
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,972
Even with Prince Charles' motorcade
route, he'll be heavily guarded.

390
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,974
<i>[Agent Sharpe] Wait.
Prince Charles is the target?</i>

391
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,852
He's here to hand Hong Kong
back to China.

392
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,689
What if the Khan wants Prince Charles
to give it to him instead?

393
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,192
An authoritarian power
wants to control Hong Kong.

394
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,610
It sounds familiar.

395
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,445
[gasps, groans]

396
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,163
The worst part of my resurrection

397
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:11,043
was finding myself buried
in an impenetrable tomb.

398
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,048
It took me 700 years to dig myself out.

399
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,801
[groans]

400
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,058
The best part of my resurrection
was the sword I was buried with.

401
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,560
[gasps]

402
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,481
[whispers] Genghis just killed a cop
with a Hell weapon.

403
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,690
Son of a bitch.

404
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,402
Okay, you got what we needed, Charlie.
Get the hell out of there.

405
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,488
Yeung.

406
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,742
What is the status of my fleet?

407
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,745
Your fleet?

408
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,375
The one you are building
to conquer the globe.

409
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,043
Right.

410
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:54,962
Fleet's great.

411
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,381
In fact, I have to go
check on it right now.

412
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,020
Don't freak out. I can explain.

413
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,191
[Charlie shifts]

414
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,193
[sighs] Never mind.

415
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,655
[female voice] Clotho...

416
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,073
[gasps]

417
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,783
<i>No matter what face you wear,</i>

418
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,786
<i>you can't hide from us.</i>

419
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,956
[groaning]

420
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,211
[gasps] No! Leave me alone!

421
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,838
[truck horn blares]

422
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,301
[both panting]

423
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,429
Are you okay?

424
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,805
Yeah.

425
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:47,931
I'm fine.

426
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,325
So? What's the verdict? Can you heal me?

427
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,160
[chitters]

428
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,038
Well, then, screw you.

429
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,581
[chitters]

430
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,790
Come with me.

431
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,833
He didn't mean that.

432
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,210
[coughing] Yeah, I did.

433
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,175
I wish you would let us
take you to the oncologist.

434
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,344
Raymond, how many times
do I have to tell you,

435
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,889
this is a disease caused by magic
and only magic can fix it.

436
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,310
"How to add years to your life"?
Ah, that should do it.

437
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,855
Although the ingredient list
is a little unusual.

438
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,815
We'll need a medieval knight.

439
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,486
I was once knighted
Sir Raymond of the Palms.

440
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,531
Great. Gary, grab a knife.

441
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,117
We're gonna perform a little
back-alley surgery on the big man.

442
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,286
Uh, what kind of surgery?

443
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,413
Well, first off, are you uncircumcised?

444
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,749
- I...I--
- Well, I'll take that as a yes.

445
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,376
- Gary, the knife.
- No!

446
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,130
We tried Nora, we tried the Puca.

447
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,343
What if there isn't a cure?

448
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,013
Isn't there anyone you...
that you need to say goodbye to?

449
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,849
What about a bucket list?

450
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,936
[wheezing]

451
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:16,853
[coughs]

452
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,522
Goodbyes are for saps

453
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,024
and bucket lists
are for mealy-mouthed cowards

454
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,152
who don't have the courage
to <i>carpe</i> the bloody <i>diem.</i>

455
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,029
I have a bucket list.

456
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,448
Thank you for proving my point, Raymond.

457
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,202
Stop being so mean.
We're trying to help you.

458
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,620
- Help me?
- Yes.

459
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,789
Captain America and the village idiot?

460
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,040
Well, I don't need your help.

461
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,084
I take care of myself. I always have.

462
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,211
What, you think
I'm gonna let Astra beat me?

463
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,505
I will fight and I Will scheme

464
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,091
and I will make a deal
with the archangel himself.

465
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,552
You hear that, Gabriel, eh?

466
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,220
Come and get me.

467
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,889
Have I got an offer for you.

468
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,856
Looks like he's not coming.

469
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,775
I'll think of something. I always do.

470
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,944
Now piss off,
I've had enough of the pair of you.

471
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,446
[yells] Go on, Piss off!

472
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,033
[wheezes]

473
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,164
Hello.

474
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,290
Who the hell are you?

475
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,042
I am the last queen of France.

476
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,253
Right. Just when I thought this ship
couldn't get more barmy.

477
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,881
[sighs]

478
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,009
[Behrad] Looking for a Time Courier?

479
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,390
Why are you in such a hurry
to leave.., again?

480
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,809
You know me.
Always looking for the next party.

481
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,645
Usually I would buy that...

482
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,397
but you just almost walked into a truck.

483
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,940
Something has you spooked.

484
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,318
Is whatever's going on
the reason why you left?

485
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,277
[sighs] Here we go.

486
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,654
LOOK, I'll admit it.

487
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,863
I liked you.

488
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,325
I was hurt when you left

489
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,119
and I've felt weird
ever since you returned.

490
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,871
Now, can you be honest with me?

491
00:24:59,081 --> 00:24:59,998
Honestly...

492
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,751
you are starting to piss me off.

493
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,003
We had sex and it was mediocre.

494
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,046
Get over it.

[gasps]

00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,967
Wow. Okay, I'm gonna ignore that.

497
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,887
If you don't want to talk, fine.

498
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,848
But we're about to go up
against Genghis Khan.

499
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,141
Don't leave now.

500
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,187
Just give me the Courier.

- Bye, Charlie.

Mediocre is not bad.

504
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,331
Charlie's gone?

505
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,500
- How could you let her leave?
- I didn't.

506
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,793
It was her choice.

507
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,629
Okay. Hey, how about we focus
on Genghis Khan?

508
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,547
You're right.

509
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,049
We need to stop him from
attacking Prince Charles' motorcade.

510
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,429
But He is on his way to a ceremony
ending 156 years of colonial rule, so...

511
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,764
Have you been researching history?

512
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,725
Oh, sorry. That's your thing, right?

513
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,518
- No. But--
- Okay.

514
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,603
- Okay, okay. Moving on, right?
- Hmm?

515
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,189
Turns out the person
Charlie impersonated is an engineer.

516
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,357
There's a shipment coming in tonight.

517
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,609
I'll bet you that's the fleet
Genghis uses for his attack.

518
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,819
What kind of fleet?

519
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,613
Whatever it is, it's the next step
of modern warfare.

520
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,991
I'll go to the clocks,
I'll try to figure it out.

521
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,159
[Agent Sharpe] Okay.

522
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,327
Zari and I will monitor
the airspace above the motorcade

523
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,328
and you'll be on the street.

524
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,581
I know it's a lot of ground to cover.
If Charlie was here--

525
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,750
I get it. I'm on my own.

526
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:34,092
[Bulldog] I can't believe you stooped
to trying to make a deal with an angel.

527
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,515
Gabriel would have turned you
into his slave.

528
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,559
Well, at least I'd be alive.

529
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,479
[scoffs] There are worse fates
than death.

530

Oi.

531
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:52,319
I will shove you where the sun
don't shine just to shut you up.

532
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,321
[scoffs] You'd probably enjoy that.

533
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,367
Hell of a way to spend
your last nights on Earth, though,

534
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,036
you arrogant bastard.

535
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,538
Especially when you could be

536
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,333
with two of the only friends
you have left.

537
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,714
Yeah. Nice one.

538
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,310
I.., I just feel so helpless, you know?

539
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,813
Me, too, Gary.

540
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,940
If he has to go, I just...

541
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,942
I want him to be at peace.

542
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,819
Well, that's not his style.

543
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,654
John's gonna go out the way he lived.

[Constantine] Like a bloody wanker, eh?

545
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,159
You know, it occurs to me

546
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,829
that I might owe you two
a bit of an apology.

547
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,580
We accept.

548

Okay. [coughs]

Okay, you're hurting me. Go on.

this room was used as an actual kitchen.

Well, there's roast in the oven.

-It'll be ready soon.
- Mmm. [coughs]

00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,996
No one should have that kind of power.

654
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,499
I think people should just decide
their own destinies.

655
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,084
Why didn't you just tell us?

656
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,671
Look, I've been keeping this secret for
my entire bloody existence. All right?

657
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,506
I've never told anyone.

658
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,385
Can we see your OG form?

659
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,511
Absolutely not.

660
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,429
Is it 'cause you're old?

661
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,098
It's because your eyes will explode,
all right?

662
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,058
And your ears, too,
if you could hear my original voice.

663
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,226
Why are you running?

664
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,646
My sisters are coming after me.

665
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,523
They have been
ever since I destroyed our loom.

666
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,192
Wait, you've been running
for thousands of years?

667
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,320
Yes. And I've always stayed
one step ahead.

668

[exhales]

669
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,699
I scattered the loom pieces
across the multi-verse,

670
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,492
which took away my sisters' powers.

671
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,203
But now that we're all in one universe,

672
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,998
thanks to Sara
and her merry band of Paragons,

673
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,000
the Loom pieces are back on one plane.

674
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,295
And now it's only a matter of time
until my sisters find me.

675
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,088
And when they do?

676
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,049
They'll kill me
and anyone that I'm with.

677
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,177
Which is Why I left.

678
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,308
And it's why I'm out that door now
that we're done playing "Ask a Fate."

679
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,061
Stop running.

680
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,730
We got your back.

681
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,277
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.

682
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,322
My sisters are no joke.

683
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,282
Well, we're the Legends.

684
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,491
[Nate] Yeah.

685
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,202
We can take out a couple old ladies.

They're a menace!

688
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,134
Oh. Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

689

-[all talking at once]
- Well, I lost my scooter at first.

690
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,014
But the good news is,
don't worry about it, I found it.

691
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,812
John, this wine is delicious.

692
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,481
And nutritious.

693
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:35,193
Well, there's no point
in saving the good stuff, eh?

694
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,903
I'm never gonna drink with you again.

Come on, mate. Stiff upper lip, eh?

I'm gonna miss you so much, you know?

to see my will until I died, but...

to make you happy, not insufferable.

I promise to take great care
of this place.

I'll vacuum--

Why don't we talk about what you had
on your bucket list, eh, Ray?

- Really?
- Yeah.

Give me something meaningful, ey.

Well, uh, eventually...

713

I plan on asking Nora to marry me.

Can I be your flower boy?

715

Oh. That's very sweet, Gary.
Odd, but very sweet.

Why haven't you asked her yet, big man?

717
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,887
I've been engaged twice before.

718
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,641
Both times didn't end as I had hoped.

719
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,560
You know, life, it is...

720
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,813
too short to dilly-dally, Raymond.

721
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:58,526
You can take that from a man
who has nothing but regrets.

722
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,904
So, if you love that witch...

723
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,199
you bloody well marry her, all right?

Okay.

No, no.

Poison does that.

It's the same poison
your mother used to kill herself.
