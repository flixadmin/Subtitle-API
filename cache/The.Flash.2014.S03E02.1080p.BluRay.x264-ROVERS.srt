1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,525
BARRY: <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,721
BARRY: <i>We just beat Zoom.</i>

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,370
Why does it feel like I just lost?

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,562
I feel more broken than I've ever felt.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,764
Wherever you need to go,
whatever you need to do, do it.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,001
I'll be here.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,001
You're safe.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,284
So, what should we call
this brave new world?

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,283
I was thinking "Flashpoint."

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,124
My name is Edward Clariss.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,567
<i>Rivals should know each other's names.</i>

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,531
It's like I'll be thinking of a
moment from my past and it vanishes.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,285
EOBARD: <i>This isn't your home, Barry.</i>

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,885
It's a mirage.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,124
<i>Things are back to how they should be.</i>

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,961
Well, for me, anyway. For you...

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,724
I guess you'll just have
to wait and find out.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,967
Where's Iris?

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,804
WALLY: <i>You know Iris isn't here.</i>

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,127
They don't talk, Barry.

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,130
Oh, God, What did I do?

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,804
BARRY: <i>I made a big mistake.
I just couldn't take it anymore, you know?</i>

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,442
<i>What happened with Zoom,
my dad dying, my mother's death.</i>

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,086
<i>Me becoming the Flash, all of it.</i>

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,328
<i>I wanted a new life,
I wanted to start over</i>

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,483
<i>and that's what I did!</i>

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,007
<i>But somehow I made things worse.</i>

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,401
No.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,171
So I reset everything. I put everything
back to the way that it was before.

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,607
Except some things weren't the same
anymore. Not even a little bit.

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,529
Take a breath.

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,329
- You were talking way too fast.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,000
- What happened?
- I really screwed up, Felicity.

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,846
And this time,
I don't know if I can fix it.

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,365
Okay, let me get this straight.
You ran back in time.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,601
Yeah.

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,330
Stopped Reverse-Flash
from killing your mom,

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,126
and then lived in an alternate reality
where both your parents were alive.

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,321
Yeah.

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,603
And then you restored the timeline,
came back to the moment you left

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,121
- and noticed that things were different?
- Exactly.

43
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,482
Does that just happen
when you travel through time?

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,170
Do things just change like that?

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,046
No. I mean, not like this.
I don't know, I don't know, Felicity.

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,691
I don't know what I'm going to do.

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,282
Okay, why don't you just run me through,
walk me through, what happened

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,682
and we'll, uh, try and figure it out.

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,521
So what changed?

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,565
BARRY: <i>I knew once I got back last night
some things had changed,</i>

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,245
<i>but before I could figure out
exactly how much,</i>

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,721
<i>I had to deal with someone this morning.</i>

53
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,408
You are not gonna get too far
on that thing anymore, are you?

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,201
I will be taking these back to
the jewelry store you stole them from.

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,880
But, uh, you can keep these if you'd like.

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,324
Good luck with that.

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,721
BARRY: <i>After he was taken care of,
I went to S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,367
<i>and that's when I found out
a lot more had changed than I realized.</i>

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,847
What kind of idiot still thinks
I can't outrun bullets?

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,930
That guy should be the criminal poster boy
for what not to do against the Flash.

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,282
- So what are we gonna call him?
- You mean, like, a nickname?

62
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,126
Yeah, Cisco does it for all of them.
He's like the master of it.

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,284
Can'tjust call him, "Suspect
on a motorcycle." What do you think?

64
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,521
I don't know.

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,889
I'll take this one. Uh, "The crook"?

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,489
- Lame, that five fingered...
- How about, "Thief."

67
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,011
He robs stuff.
Let's just call him, "Thief."

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,087
Gotta get to the gym. Excuse me.

69
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,806
The gym? What, is he, like, working out
now, or...

70
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,484
You know, Barry, sometimes
your jokes just aren't very funny.

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,761
I should get back to the paper.

72
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,201
It's okay. I was just leaving.

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,643
Hey, guys. Hey, Joe, look, hey, I'm sorry.

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,650
Look, I know you guys aren't
speaking to each other right now.

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,610
But I was just thinking
maybe we could talk about

76
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,284
why that is, for a minute.

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,641
- No. No, we can't.
- Dude.

78
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,165
Okay, I'm sorry, look, I'm sorry.

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,330
I just thought, I don't know,
maybe it would be good for you guys.

80
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,329
Just to hear it said out loud.

81
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,165
This is because of what he did, Barry.
Not me.

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,885
- Iris...
- What?

83
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,008
What could you possibly have to say?

84
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,371
I'll just see you at the station,
all right?

85
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,126
Nice job with, uh, "Thief."

86
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,363
- Uh, give me a lift to CCU?
- JOE: <i>Sure.</i>

87
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,006
So you're still
taking engineering classes?

88
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,567
Yeah.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,810
Yeah. Cool.
All right, well, good luck with that.

90
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,522
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

91
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,041
Are you trying to make me
as mad at you as I am at him?

92
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,885
No, no. Look, I'm sorry. I...

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,000
Guess I don't fully understand
why you're so upset at him.

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,489
Then maybe
you shouldn't bring it up again.

95
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,401
Yeah.

96
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,766
How about we talk about us instead?

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,765
"Us"? You mean, you and me,
like, trying this thing?

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,606
I just thought with everything
that's happened lately,

99
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,888
and everything that you've been through,

100
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,930
I wanted to make sure
that you still felt the same.

101
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,687
Well, Iris, I did what you said.

102
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,248
I went where I needed to go,
I did what I needed to do.

103
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,408
And I'm ready.

104
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,769
I never told you to do that.

105
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,570
Yeah, no, you did.
Right there, on the porch,

106
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,529
right after we beat Zoom, right before...

107
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,564
- You kissed Iris?
- Well, not anymore!

108
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,801
I've kissed Iris West twice

109
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,242
and I have managed
to erase both times from existence.

110
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,771
Man, I hate it when that happens.

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,247
It's just the least of my problems today.

112
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,089
Joe, hey. Hey, man,
um, can we talk for a second?

113
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,725
Yeah. I just gotta drop this off
for Singh.

114
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,447
Oh, Captain Singh's back.
That's just terrific.

115
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,130
Yeah, why, did he go somewhere?

116
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,482
Oh, no, maybe, I don't know, I...

117
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,605
Is that cowl cutting off
all the oxygen in your brain?

118
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,165
What? No, I'm fine, why?

119
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,765
Because you've been acting
real odd lately.

120
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,769
Asking why Iris wasn't at the house
last night

121
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,445
and that stunt you pulled at S.T.A.R. Labs
this morning.

122
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,483
You know damn well
why she's not talking to me.

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,927
Of course. Because she...

124
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,647
Because I should've told her
her mother was alive. But I didn't.

125
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,447
Yeah, but she forgave you for that.
One would think that she would've.

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,568
I don't know if she ever will. Or not.

127
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,406
But you sticking your nose into it,
isn't helping, Barr.

128
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,801
Good intentions and all.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,161
I was... Okay.

130
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,131
- We found another husk this morning.
- Husk?

131
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,448
Singh wants this processed ASAP.

132
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,247
Yes, the skin husks
we've been finding around the city?

133
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,164
The ones we think are attached
to the meta-humans.

134
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,680
<i>This is now the fourth one.</i>

135
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,966
Well, let's figure out what's
happening before there's a fifth.

136
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,446
Yes, sir.

137
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,327
- What...
- Deep breaths.

138
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,162
Um, hello?

139
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,489
Yes, hello, Mr. Allen,
I can still see you're there.

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,047
And no, I don't want your help, thank you.

141
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,842
What are you doing here? "Julian Albert,
Meta-Human CSI specialist"?

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,526
I did tell you the meta-human conference
was only for two days.

143
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,330
Okay. But this is...

144
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,006
Still our lab, unfortunately.

145
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,483
Yes, County forgot to mention
that significant detail

146
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,682
before assigning me but...

147
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,963
Here we are. Looks like
you and I get to be roomies

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,401
for a little longer than we'd hoped.

149
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,041
Roomies...

150
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,362
There's a whole new guy at work
that you didn't even know about?

151
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,204
Yeah, and he's worked there
for almost a year.

152
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,885
And he doesn't like me very much,
apparently.

153
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,049
Oh, that's impossible.
Everybody likes Barry Allen.

154
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,049
You're like pudding.
Everybody likes pudding.

155
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,005
Not everyone.

156
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,367
Thirty-seven.

157
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,484
CISCO: <i>I hated that we never spoke.</i>

158
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,246
<i>I think the thing that haunts me the most</i>

159
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,410
<i>is the fact that I never told him
I loved him.</i>

160
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,964
Or that I idolized him.

161
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,484
<i>I have memories of Dante all the time.</i>

162
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,442
<i>But they don't feel like gifts.</i>

163
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,601
They feel like reminders
of what I did wrong.

164
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,248
<i>I will never make
another memory with Dante again.</i>

165
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,445
Excuse me.

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,161
What are you doing here?

167
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,931
Oh, I see. Now you wanna be there for me.

168
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,085
I'm just trying to understand.

169
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,121
My brother's dead.

170
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,131
There's nothing to understand.

171
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,000
Exit's that way.

172
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,524
So you altered the timeline,
Joe and Iris don't talk anymore,

173
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,003
there's a guy at work, new guy,
who doesn't like you.

174
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,528
You never kissed Iris.
And Cisco's brother is dead.

175
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,683
Admittedly, that is an issue.

176
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,967
And what if there's more?

177
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,611
Well, has anything here changed?

178
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,441
No, I don't know.
Everything seems the same, I think.

179
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,766
Good.

180
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,281
Can I use... Hold on.

181
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,686
- I'll be real careful.
- Uh...

182
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,530
I got it. Don't worry, I got it.

183
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,807
Yeah, I don't know. I mean,
everything looks okay.

184
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,281
<i>Wait...</i>

185
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,887
Who's that young boy with Digg?

186
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,650
No way, he didn't have a kid before?

187
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,326
He had a kid. He has a kid, yeah.
Baby Sarah.

188
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,725
Baby John.

189
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,890
No. Are you...

190
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,644
Oh, my God. It really can affect us.

191
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,325
Okay, you know what,
I don't want to know anymore.

192
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,370
Okay, I know this is a lot of pressure,
but everything's gonna be all right.

193
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,961
- I screwed up everyone's life.
- Yeah, well, maybe you should tell them.

194
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,810
I'm not going to tell them.
I mean, how's that gonna help?

195
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,247
That's just gonna make everything worse.
I don't know how to fix this.

196
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,481
Okay, well, you're gonna figure it out.

197
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,690
If there's one thing I've learned from you
is that, with you anything is possible.

198
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,570
Why, 'cause I'm the Flash?

199
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,087
No. Because you are Barry Allen.

200
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,483
And sweet, loving, kind Barry Allen
that everybody likes.

201
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,411
The Barry Allen who's just like pudding

202
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,881
can fix this.

203
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,201
So go and fix this.

204
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,247
Yeah. Okay, you're right, yeah.

205
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,201
Now!

206
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,601
- Right now?
- Yes.

207
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,364
Okay. All right.

208
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,886
Stop!

209
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,249
MAN: <i>Find me...</i>

210
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,124
Who? Who?

211
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,563
I am Alchemy.

212
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,169
I have visions of another life.

213
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,729
Please make them stop.

214
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,449
Is that what you really want?

215
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,608
<i>To make the visions stop?</i>

216
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,246
Or do you want them to come true?

217
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,324
<i>To be fast again?</i>

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,241
<i>To have speed?</i>

219
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,561
Yes.

220
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,081
Do you want that other life?

221
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,764
That's what I want.

222
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,641
Once again you will have power

223
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,321
and no man will be your rival!

224
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,204
JOE: Julian, I thought you could use
some help on this one.

225
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,681
You know, the two heads thing and all.

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,447
I don't need any help, detective.
Especially from him.

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,047
What is that?

228
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,282
Another epidermal husk, Allen.

229
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,931
<i>A fully intact human pelt comprised
of nothing but the stratum corneum.</i>

230
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,561
You see what I mean?

231
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,641
Do we have any theories
as to what's causing them?

232
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,444
Well, I'll take a wild guess at it.

233
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,246
And say it's the same thing
that created the last four husks.

234
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,449
Spalling could be caused
from toxic epidermal necrolysis

235
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,087
maybe some kind of moist desquamation
from intense radiation exposure.

236
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,281
We've had a lot of...

237
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,165
Radioactive metas, yes, thank you, Allen.
I read all the case studies.

238
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,685
I'll tell you what. When I figure it out,
I'll enlighten you then, shall I?

239
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,686
Thanks.

240
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,047
How have I worked with this guy
for the past year?

241
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,971
- Yeah, you say that all the time.
- I'm sure I do.

242
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,560
Julian,

243
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,722
are you certain that
Barry can't take a sample or something

244
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,002
- to speed things along?
- Ah...

245
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,847
I'm sure, detective. Quite sure.

246
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,681
You might want to get that
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

247
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,961
Yeah.

248
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,210
CAITLIN: You know there's really
not that much here.

249
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,489
Yeah. No, I know
it's basically touched DNA.

250
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,011
I had to steal a sample

251
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,124
because our meta-human expert
wouldn't let me take one.

252
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,810
Oh, you mean Julian Albert?

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,604
Yeah, you know him?

254
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,530
Yeah. We've known him for a while.
He's the best.

255
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,442
- Um, you need me?
- No. I think I got this, but thank you.

256
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,721
Okay.

257
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,643
Cisco told me you showed up
to his bereavement group last night.

258
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,367
Yeah, I did. He also tell you
it didn't go so well?

259
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,364
It's only been a few months since
Dante was killed by that drunk driver.

260
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,284
I'm sure he just needs
a little bit more time.

261
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,369
Wait, but why is he so mad at me?

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,128
Oh, no. I'm staying out of that.

263
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,882
Cait, he'll barely look at me
unless other people are in the room.

264
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,811
Maybe it's just easier
when the rest of us are around.

265
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,121
Do you think maybe you could convince him

266
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,163
to come with you to my house
for dinner tonight?

267
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,361
Why?

268
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,927
So I can try to fix things between us.

269
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,690
Maybe between Joe and Iris, too.

270
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,886
Just all of us together again in one room
and try to work this out once and for all.

271
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,046
Think you can do that?

272
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,687
Okay. But how are you gonna
get Joe and Iris there?

273
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,127
Joe? Hey, Joe, um, so I talked to Iris

274
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,243
and she just has a few things
that she wants to say to you.

275
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,930
Barr, I thought I told you
to stay out of this.

276
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,690
Oh, no, no, no. This was all her. I swear.

277
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,005
So she just, out of the blue, decided
now she wants to talk to me.

278
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,765
Hey, um, so Joe said that he'd give you

279
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,769
what you needed
about the husk for a story.

280
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,766
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,241
Uh, what? He just decided
out of the blue to tell me?

282
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,448
No one at the precinct will say anything.
Even Julian.

283
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,641
Oh, I hate that guy.

284
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,600
Yeah, you always say that.
Um, when does he wanna do it?

285
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,962
Uh, tonight. At the house.
He said he's making your favorite.

286
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,446
Okay, he's out of his mind.

287
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,721
He knows I will not go back there,

288
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,207
even if he does make
one of Grandma Esther's recipes so...

289
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,931
- When?
- Uh, tonight.

290
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,446
Tonight, yeah, at the house.

291
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,883
At the house? She vowed
she'd never set foot in the house again.

292
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,929
- Unless you made dinner.
- Dinner?

293
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,451
Yeah, like old times.
Or one of her favorites.

294
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,449
Like Grandma Esther's recipes, maybe?

295
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,131
Okay. I suppose I could make something.
Which dish?

296
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,684
He said he'd make the chicken.

297
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,451
- I hate the chicken. I like the noodles.
- Noodles, okay.

298
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,681
Why are you out of breath?

299
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,841
I'm not out of breath.

300
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,411
Joe also thought
maybe just to take some pressure off

301
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,881
that he'd invite Caitlin and Cisco.

302
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,289
Okay, um, what time?

303
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,646
7200.

304
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,006
All right.

305
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,968
Um, 7:00 will work by the way.

306
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,281
Okay. But which dish?

307
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,720
And I was thinking maybe
to take some pressure off,

308
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,921
you can invite Caitlin and Cisco?

309
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,361
That's a good idea. 'Cause if
we're gonna do this I gotta get started.

310
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,766
Yeah. I got it. No problem. Yeah.

311
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,047
- Barr...
- Yep.

312
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,287
Which dish?

313
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,801
Noodle dish, yeah. Noodle dish.

314
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,090
This hits the spot, huh?

315
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,009
You can thank Grandma Esther.

316
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,806
No, I mean it's good, I just meant, um...

317
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,285
All of us actually just here together.

318
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,880
I was actually thinking, um, that

319
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,803
maybe it'd be fun if we all went away
together for a few days.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,411
Just, like, a little Team Flash vacay.

321
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,761
And do what?

322
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,651
Bond. Reconnect.

323
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,888
You mean, like, a retreat?

324
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,966
With trust exercises?

325
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,044
Epic fail, party of six.

326
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,684
I just feel like we're not the team
that we were or can be.

327
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,240
No one?

328
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,047
I'd be down for it.

329
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,685
Okay. So, other than Wally,

330
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,848
I'm the only one that thinks
that's a good idea?

331
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,884
I don't think
the Flash really takes vacations.

332
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,084
Especially with all these husks
showing up all over town.

333
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,527
Speaking of husks,

334
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,127
I'm glad you're finally ready
to open up about them.

335
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,410
Iris, I already told you
I can't tell you anything about this case.

336
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,923
Really? Because
that's not what I was told.

337
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,242
Strange. I was under the impression
you had some things to say to me, too.

338
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,766
Isn't that right, Barr?

339
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,803
Told you, epic fail.

340
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,051
Okay, look, yeah. I arranged this.
I put all this together.

341
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,720
I'm sorry, guys. Look, I just...
We're not acting like a team

342
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,491
and I just wanted things
back to how they were. Just fixed.

343
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,721
If you wanted things fixed

344
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,770
maybe you should have gone back in time
and stopped my brother from dying.

345
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,291
You want me to change the timeline
to save Dante?

346
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,968
Why would you do that?
It's not like he's your brother.

347
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,288
Meta-human app. We gotta go.

348
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,844
Remember me, Flash?

349
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,646
Clariss?

350
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,126
Clariss?

351
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,124
Oh, you do remember, Flash. Good. Yeah.

352
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,966
Because I remember everything, too.

353
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,407
- How are you here?
- <i>It doesn't matter.</i>

354
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,321
You see what does matter
is that I know your little secret.

355
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,768
You changed the timeline.

356
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,290
Because if I recall correctly,

357
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,687
the only speedsters in my other life

358
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,003
were me and that smart-ass Kid Flash.

359
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,807
Until you showed up
and stole everything from me.

360
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,284
I didn't steal anything from you, Clariss.
I...

361
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,081
I was just trying to put things back
to the way they're supposed to be.

362
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,647
This is how my life is supposed to be!

363
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,770
For years I felt like
something was missing.

364
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,605
And now I know why.

365
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,690
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to do this to you.

366
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,406
Yeah, well, you did. And here I am.

367
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,681
Your rival, back again.

368
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,844
Believe me, Flash, this time,

369
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,890
you're not gonna steal my life so easily.

370
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,050
We finally get rid of Zoom
and there's another evil speedster?

371
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,282
- Who is this guy now?
- CAITLIN: <i>I can help you with that.</i>

372
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,642
I finally got the results back
from the tests I ran

373
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,484
on the husk
that Barry gave me this morning

374
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,766
<i>and it's weird</i>

375
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,760
because there's no traces of dark matter,
but there are traces of the speed force.

376
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,485
And that's the husk from this speedster?

377
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,324
Appears so. His name is...

378
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,811
Edward Clariss.

379
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,006
And somehow Barry is exactly right.

380
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,482
Can I talk to you for a second?

381
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,286
Yeah.

382
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,169
<i>S.T.A.R. Labs isn't the only one
with access to the city's security cams.</i>

383
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,285
It's pretty obvious
that this guy knows you.

384
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,806
You want to tell me what that's about?

385
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,648
This is why you've been acting
so weird lately

386
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,843
trying to get me and my dad talking again,

387
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,208
tricking all of us into dinner tonight.

388
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,002
Because you're keeping something from us.

389
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,366
You need to tell me what is going on,
Barry. Right now.

390
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,769
And if you lie 110 me...

391
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,170
This thing between us,
it cannot happen.

392
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,284
I'm sorry, I did this, all of this.

393
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,882
It's my fault
and I've been trying to fix it

394
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,364
but I think that there's
only one way to do that now.

395
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,324
I'm sorry, Iris.

396
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,561
Flash?

397
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,929
Flash. Here, put these on.

398
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,925
We need to talk.

399
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,925
Where are we?

400
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,447
The Motorcar Diner in Central City.

401
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,602
Yeah, I meant what year.

402
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,048
In 1998.

403
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,289
You want to get something to eat?
'Cause I'm starved.

404
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,364
The corned beef hash here
is the best I've ever had.

405
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,604
That's why you pulled me
out of the Speed Force? To buy me a meal?

406
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,444
Because you were about
to reset the timeline again

407
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,603
after screwing it all up.

408
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,761
Oh, yeah, I know about that.

409
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,041
How did you know...

410
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,210
After your not-so-subtle reaction
when you first met me,

411
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,411
Harry told me all that happened
with Zoom and your mom and your dad.

412
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,605
So I decided I'd keep my eye on you
for a bit.

413
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,611
He tell you anything else?

414
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,804
He did. I'm your father's doppelganger.

415
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,930
Sorry about that.

416
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,327
It's just really weird.

417
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,649
And really sad, too, I'm sure.

418
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,971
Having a loss like that in your life,
I see why you'd want to erase it.

419
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,484
Who wouldn't try to save their parents?
I understand that, Barry. Completely.

420
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,404
But the thing is,

421
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,285
there are consequences to time travel.

422
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,121
I have heard all of this before.

423
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,163
Not from me, you haven't.

424
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,931
I'm not some doctor with a theory, Barry.

425
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,125
I'm a speedster, like you,
who's traveled in time

426
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,845
and made these same mistakes
you are making right now.

427
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,330
Here, let me show you something.

428
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,927
- You know what...
- Humor me, kid.

429
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,489
This coffee cup, right here,

430
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,366
- think of it as the space-time continuum.
- Yeah.

431
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,001
Whenever you go back in time, it breaks.

432
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,690
- Now...
- For real, I mean...

433
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,844
You can reset the timeline,
you can try to fix it,

434
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,885
but no matter how hard you try,

435
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,368
it's never going to be exactly how it was.

436
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,529
Look, I've learned all this stuff
that I didn't know before, okay?

437
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,450
- I'm not gonna make the same mistakes.
- Mistakes...

438
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,045
Yeah, what you just said right there,

439
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,366
that is the paradox of time travel
and also the paradox of life,

440
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,563
I mean, if I only knew then
what I know now.

441
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,328
Why have these powers
if I can't go back and fix what I broke?

442
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,568
We're not gods. We're men.

443
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,169
Who for whatever reason,
have been given extraordinary abilities.

444
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,089
The question you need to ask yourself is,

445
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,845
what kind of hero are you going to be?

446
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,006
Are you just going to take a do-over
every time you make a mistake?

447
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,725
<i>Or will you live with them</i>

448
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,244
and move forward?

449
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,921
Where's Barry?

450
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,568
I need to tell you all something.

451
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,046
The truth.

452
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,606
The truth about what?

453
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,281
Okay,
uh, after Zoom killed my dad,

454
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,406
after we defeated him, um...

455
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,122
I wasn't in a great space

456
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,760
and I felt like
the only way I could fix that

457
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,080
was to run back in time and save my mom.

458
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,965
You stopped the Reverse-Flash
from killing your mom?

459
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,281
Yeah.

460
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,802
Wait, so, is she alive?

461
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,805
She was, for a few months.

462
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,088
I lived with her and my dad.
I had a completely different life.

463
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,089
I wasn't even the Flash for most of it.

464
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,441
I don't understand.

465
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,803
You created a whole other existence?
How is that possible?

466
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,720
Um...

467
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,610
This is the timeline.

468
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,003
This is the point that we exist on it
right now.

469
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,644
This past point is where
my mom was murdered.

470
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,166
So when I saved her,
I created a new reality.

471
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,640
A new timeline. I was living in...

472
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,841
A mirror universe.

473
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,685
It's called a Flashpoint, apparently.

474
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,843
But you decided to leave it. Why?

475
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,129
Life started to spin out of control.

476
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,642
This guy, Clariss,
he was a speedster there, too.

477
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,371
He was known as "The Rival."

478
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,126
He caused a lot of problems. So, um...

479
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,206
I decided to run back in time again.

480
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,364
<i>And let things happen
as they were supposed to,</i>

481
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,445
in hopes of resetting the timeline.

482
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,883
- But...
- But what?

483
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,164
But, um, when I came back

484
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,201
things weren't the same.

485
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,205
You mean people. Like us.

486
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,451
Yeah, yeah.

487
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,731
Uh, I created another timeline.

488
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,164
Uh, this is the one we're living in now.

489
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,971
It's not as different as the last one.

490
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,481
Not in large ways,
but in some ways and smaller ways,

491
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,004
and, uh, meaningful ways for all of you
or anybody that's close to me,

492
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,169
and I can't ever really
put it back together.

493
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,929
Barry, that's a lot to take in.

494
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,210
Yeah, it is.

495
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,001
We got along in that other life,
my dad and I, didn't we?

496
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,609
That's why you've been working so hard
to get us talking again.

497
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,524
Okay, here's the thing, um,

498
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,685
I will tell you what's different,
all of you, if you want to know.

499
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,247
But you have to live
with those differences

500
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,568
because I can't change it again.

501
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,762
But at least you'll know.

502
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,287
And you all deserve that choice.

503
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,124
So you decided it was okay to change
things when someone in your family dies.

504
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,122
But when it's someone in my family...

505
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,443
I'm gonna go talk to him.

506
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,121
<i>Hey.</i>

507
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,208
What are you working on?

508
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,325
These are the gauntlets from my suit.

509
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,805
And you probably
know nothing about that, do you?

510
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,129
I'm really trying here, Cisco.

511
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,971
Barry, I'm the one who's been trying,

512
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,566
I've been trying this whole time
to get you to do this one thing for me.

513
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,004
<i>But you kept saying, "No, Cisco."</i>

514
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,323
"I can't, Cisco.
I would never do that, Cisco."

515
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,403
And now you're telling me
you went and did it for yourself?

516
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,651
Were you listening?
It went bad. It went really bad.

517
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,445
I don't care!

518
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,007
At least I'd have my brother back.

519
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,004
Yeah, you would have him back. But...

520
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,844
Because of it, somebody might have
something happen to them

521
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,128
that's just as awful
as what happened to Dante.

522
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,800
<i>Trust me, you don't want that
on your conscience.</i>

523
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,608
It's a heavy burden to bear.

524
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,447
And I don't know
how many times I've said this,

525
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,211
but I'm really sorry about Dante, man.

526
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,284
Sorry doesn't change anything.

527
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,681
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

528
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,851
But I can't go back. I can't change it.

529
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,727
All I can do is move forward.

530
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,207
I really hope you can, too.

531
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,847
Hey, um, I need your help.

532
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,360
It's the four words I seem to hear you
most often say, Barry.

533
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,247
That and, "I hate that guy."

534
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,731
Which the feeling's mutual, so.

535
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,844
Mmm-mmm.
Okay, um, this is gonna be hard for you,

536
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,086
but I just, for a second, need you
to imagine that we're actually friends.

537
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,401
Can't do it.

538
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,046
Friendly.

539
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,687
Equally as challenging, Barry.

540
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,208
But I'll give it a whirl.
What are you after?

541
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,084
I need to read your report
on one of the husks.

542
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,241
Which one?

543
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,568
The one from this morning. Edward Clariss.

544
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,603
- Edward Clariss?
- Yeah.

545
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,921
Why?

546
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,449
It may help me figure out
a case I'm working on.

547
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,287
Well, the nutshell is,

548
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,564
the hyaluronic acids were found
to be above normal.

549
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,286
- Androgen degradation atypically low.
- Mmm-hmm.

550
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,601
<i>Cellular regeneration</i>

551
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,564
<i>- seemed to occur at</i> a <i>staggering rate.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

552
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,605
It's quite a bit different from the
previous husks that we found. About it.

553
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,962
Could I maybe just take a peek at it?

554
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,605
I'm sorry,
it's just something I need to see

555
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,127
to know what I'm looking for.

556
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,966
- Sure.
- Great. Thank you.

557
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,763
Wait, why does this say the body's
place of discovery was Williamson

558
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,645
when it was found
on the waterfront in Leawood?

559
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,962
The body ended up in Leawood.

560
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,241
There was a strong current this morning,

561
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,960
so chances are that it originated
from Williamson.

562
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,963
Somewhere near the old Prescott sawmill.

563
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,281
- <i>You done?</i>
- Yeah.

564
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,130
Uh, yes. Thank you.

565
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,005
CLARISS: <i>You found me again, Flash.</i>

566
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,164
I wondered how long it'd take you
this time to figure it out.

567
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,481
Wasn't too hard.

568
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,211
See you didn't bring your sidekick
with you, though.

569
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,488
Nope. Just me.

570
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,724
That's too bad. I brought one.

571
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,684
Oh, and, Flash,
a little, uh, quaking in your boots

572
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,171
wouldn't be inappropriate.

573
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,006
So?

574
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,402
He changed our lives, Iris.
And he kept that secret from us.

575
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,489
You really just want us
to be okay with that?

576
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,081
All I'm saying, Wally,
is that he made a mistake.

577
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,850
Yeah. He did.

578
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,171
Cisco, we all make mistakes
to protect the people that we love.

579
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,883
I mean, you told Captain Cold
that Barry was the Flash

580
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,650
in order to protect your brother.

581
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,326
Okay, not my finest moment.

582
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,521
That's my point.

583
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,727
It was one decision made in one moment.
One very heart-wrenching moment.

584
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,048
Look, guys, we're like a family here,
okay?

585
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,210
And sometimes families get mad
at each other for screwing up.

586
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,566
<i>I know that all too well.</i>

587
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,211
But they also forgive.

588
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,890
Because after a while it just seems silly
when you stop and think about it.

589
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,082
Guys, Iris is right.

590
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,082
We all have secrets, we've all screwed up.

591
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,251
But this is Barry we're talking about.

592
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,924
Who, apparently, is in trouble.

593
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,083
Who are you?

594
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,331
I am Alchemy.

595
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,602
Okay, well, what do you want?

596
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,881
To help people
achieve their true potential.

597
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,804
Such as he has.

598
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,486
And why are you doing this?

599
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,291
Because I'm preparing this world.

600
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,446
Remember what happened here last time,
Flash?

601
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,285
It's where I died.

602
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,250
And I'm not going to waste
this second chance I've been given.

603
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,801
This time I'm going to show you
who's the fastest man alive.

604
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,441
Barry!

605
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,962
- Barry!
- His comms aren't working.

606
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,525
<i>He's at the Prescott Mill.</i>

607
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,811
That's right around the corner.

608
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,325
We gotta do something.

609
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,803
Having fun yet, Flash?

610
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,844
'Cause I'm having a blast!

611
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,522
Time to look for a new rival.

612
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,643
Stay away from my friend.

613
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,245
Thank you.

614
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,725
Sorry it took so long.

615
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,290
You're just in time.

616
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,601
Nothing, no mention of Alchemy anywhere,

617
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,928
no mask-wearing monk metas,
not even close.

618
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,523
I didn't find any known aliases
in any of the records at C.C.P.D.

619
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,206
And Clariss won't say anything, either.

620
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,609
All right, well, keep at him. Alchemy's
the one that gave Clariss back his speed.

621
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,723
He's kind of like a doctor that way,
don't you think?

622
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,401
Come on, don't pretend like

623
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,722
"Doctor Alchemy"
doesn't have a nice ring to it.

624
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,485
Okay, well, that explains

625
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,722
why he didn't have
any traces of dark matter in his cells.

626
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,888
He didn't get his powers
from the particle accelerator,

627
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,321
he got them from Alchemy.

628
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,722
- What's that?
- Doctor Alchemy.

629
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,124
How could he do that?

630
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,289
I don't know,
but we need to figure it out,

631
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,811
there's going to be more.

632
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,563
Alchemy... Doctor Alchemy has said
that he is preparing this world.

633
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,006
- Preparing the world?
- Mmm-hmm.

634
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,924
For what, like, the second coming
or something?

635
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,921
I think that everyone that had powers
in Flashpoint is going to get them back.

636
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,443
JOE: <i>Well, we already found
four other husks.</i>

637
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,803
Which means there's at least that many
running around Central City right now.

638
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,526
We need to find him
before he changes more people's lives.

639
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,649
<i>IRIS: Speaking of changing lives.</i>

640
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,286
We all talked about it, Barry. And...

641
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,165
We don't want to know
what our lives were like in Flashpoint.

642
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,650
You're sure?

643
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,327
To quote the wise words of Harry,
"What's the point, Allen?"

644
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,601
I gotta get to the precinct.

645
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,804
Uh, stop by Jitters on the way?

646
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,481
Yeah. It's on me.

647
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,608
Oh, good. Then I'm coming, too.

648
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,327
Yo.

649
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,166
Um, I've just been thinking.

650
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,689
It was pretty cool having someone
out there with me last night.

651
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,566
Maybe we could make that a thing
every once in a while.

652
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,850
I got some things to work on
before I start doing that.

653
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,521
Yeah.

654
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,527
Maybe someday.

655
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,809
That'd be pretty bitchin'.

656
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,166
Glad to see everything
starting to get back to the way it was.

657
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,407
Yeah.

658
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,365
I mean, mostly.

659
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,560
You have nothing to worry about, Cait.

660
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,209
I think out of everyone, actually, you're
the only one that wasn't really affected

661
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,771
<i>when I messed with the timeline.</i>

662
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,005
I mean, unless you're secretly
moonlighting as an ophthalmologist.

663
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,565
A what?

664
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,848
Kidding, nothing. Just a Flashpoint joke.

665
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,081
I'll see you later.

666
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,121
What's that?

667
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,884
It's the finished Edward Clariss report.

668
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,764
<i>Or should I say "The Rival?"</i>

669
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,565
At least that's what the Flash called him
last night

670
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,085
when he took him in to Iron Heights.

671
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,403
- Hmm.
- <i>I thought you might want to see it.</i>

672
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,926
You know, to do with your other case.

673
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,887
Ah. Actually it turns out
there was no connection.

674
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,769
<i>- You know I have to ask you...</i>
- Hmm.

675
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,722
- How did you know his name?
- What?

676
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,483
Yesterday, you came in
and you asked for Edward Clariss's report.

677
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,291
But I didn't tell you
who that husk belonged to.

678
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,606
So that means you stole a sample,
when you showed up to my crime scene.

679
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,645
How did you do that?

680
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,766
I...

681
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,082
Oh, wow.

682
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,962
You've really got this good guy
routine thing down, haven't you?

683
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,322
And everyone just buys it.

684
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,600
There is something not right about you,
Allen.

685
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,607
They don't see it, but I do.

686
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,326
- Is that right?
- <i>Yes.</i>

687
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,841
You know why I don't actually like you,
don't you?

688
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,764
I don't trust you.

689
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,284
And I don't like things
that I don't trust.

690
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,684
See you tomorrow... Roomie.

691
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,291
- BARRY: <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

692
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,881
Hi.

693
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,803
I was hoping you'd be here.

694
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,442
Yeah. Dad and I just polished off
Grandma Esther's noodle dish.

695
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,330
Oh, did you leave me some?

696
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,880
Too slow, Flash.

697
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,367
Oh...

698
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,691
So you guys are...

699
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,162
We're good.

700
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,040
Are you sure you don't wanna know
about the other timeline?

701
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,246
No. I guess, in my mind,

702
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,330
wherever you go, you'll always be Barry.

703
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,529
And I'll always be Iris.

704
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,363
And we always find each other.

705
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,891
ALCHEMY: <i>You failed.</i>

706
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,801
<i>You failed, Clariss.</i>

707
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,444
I'm sorry, please.

708
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,930
Let me try again.

709
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,560
Alchemy?

710
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,249
No, no, no, no, no.

711
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,521
English - SDH
