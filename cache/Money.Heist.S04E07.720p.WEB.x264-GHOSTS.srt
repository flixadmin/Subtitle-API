1
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,250
<i>- What's the status on the roof?
- All clear up here, sir.</i>

2
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Suarez.

3
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:33,708
Martínez!

4
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,375
Colonel, we have Gandía.

5
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,083
Gandía, talk to me.

6
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,708
<i>Colonel,</i>

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,500
<i>I've eliminated Nairobi and Tokyo.</i>

8
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,625
<i>I'm going out for another attack.</i>

9
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,208
<i>- I'll take a radio. This is the frequency.
- Radio!</i>

10
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,541
Suarez, I want all units ready to go.

11
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,436
Units alpha and beta, get in position.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,750
<i>I want everyone on alert.</i>

13
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,541
<i>Everyone in position.</i>

14
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,000
Colonel, they opened fire!

15
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,458
Gandía! Gandía,

16
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,000
<i>respond. Answer me! Gandía, do you copy?</i>

17
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,000
<i>I'm here.</i>

18
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,708
<i>They're closing in on me, sir.
I'm caught in the fucking cross fire.</i>

19
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,125
What's your position?
Can we give you covering fire?

20
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,000
<i>Negative, Colonel.
Heading to the roof, sir.</i>

21
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,291
<i>Requesting immediate evac!</i>

22
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,708
Suarez, for Christ's sake,
send a fucking helicopter now.

23
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,833
- Let's go!
- Delta 1, get ready for takeoff.

24
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,958
Rescue operation at the Bank of Spain now!

25
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,458
<i>Delta 1.</i>

26
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,000
<i>They've started to fire.
I can't see anything!</i>

27
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,875
Colonel. Colonel!

28
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,541
<i>Smoke! Smoke!
Sir, smoke's coming out through the roof.</i>

29
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,166
Hang in there, Gandía.
The helicopter's on its way.

30
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,291
Get to the roof. We'll cover you.

31
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,250
<i>I'm on the roof now.
I have a mask, and I'm dressed in black.</i>

32
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,333
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

33
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,916
Our man's dressed in black.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,458
<i>Give him cover at all times.
Be ready for possible crossfire.</i>

35
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,625
Go, go, go!

36
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,916
Now!

37
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,666
Go, go, go, go!

38
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,666
They're on the roof. They've opened fire!

39
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,750
We need cover fire! We need cover fire!

40
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,708
<i>I can't see them!
There's too much smoke!</i>

41
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,416
- Where in the fuck is that helicopter?
- Delta unit, position.

42
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,416
<i>Two minutes, 50 seconds, sir.</i>

43
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,000
Delta unit, begin approaching our target.

44
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,500
<i>Rescue protocol.</i>

45
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,958
I want the extraction
to be quick and clean.

46
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,750
<i>Helicopter in position.</i>

47
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,625
Get 'em out of there, for fuck's sake!

48
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,833
Okay, Delta 1, get in there.

49
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,875
<i>I've got a visual.</i>

50
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,500
<i>I'm locked on one of the suspects.
Permission to fire, sir.</i>

51
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,833
<i>Permission to fire, sir.</i>

52
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:27,291
45 HOURS EARLIER

53
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,083
<i>Mutt, I told you I was gonna kill you.</i>

54
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,166
No!

55
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,291
No!

56
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,833
Ten, nine,

57
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,875
eight, seven,

58
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,458
six, five,

59
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,083
four, three,

60
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,000
two, one!

61
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,958
What happened?

62
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,375
Your friend Nairobi threw a grenade at me.

63
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,708
Is she okay?

64
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,083
Tell me what happened to Nairobi!

65
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,541
I don't know what happened.

66
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,583
But that bitch
is definitely still standing.

67
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,541
Is she recovering?

68
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,166
I think so.

69
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,083
She had a hell of a surgeon.

70
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,086
You know that blood's dripping
from you like a stuck pig, right?

Do you really have to change
outfits here in front of all these people?

81
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,166
This isn't an outfit.
It's a uniform worn by filthy executives

82
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,583
who check the Nikkei Index while dining
with their mistresses. It's revolting.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,041
It got you into an interview
with the governor of the Bank of Spain.

84
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,041
Isn't it good enough
for a simple cocktail?

85
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,000
You should have parked the car.

86
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,750
Martín complains far less.

87
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,833
Sure.

88
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,041
What? Now what's wrong with Martín?

89
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,666
He follows you everywhere.

90
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
So?

91
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,208
He's in love with you.

92
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,875
He's in love with me.

93
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,708
And you know that
because you've seen his diary,

94
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,333
or did he confess it to you in tears,
drinking away his misery?

95
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,616
I've seen how he looks at you.

96
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,583
How he smiles
at every single one of your crazy ideas.

97
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,346
He agrees with everything about your plan,

98
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,333
but he is unable to think critically,
reasonably.

99
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,875
He's in love, and that prevents him
from being objective.

100
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,333
He's completely objective.
He's an engineer.

101
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,166
He calculates complex equations,
and this might surprise you,

102
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,750
but none of those calculations
involve feelings in any kind of way.

103
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,708
You know as well as I do
the plan's disastrous.

104
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,666
The plan is so marvelous.

105
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,916
The plan has some parts,
details that are marvelous,

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,500
but it doesn't work as a plan.

107
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,791
It does not work.

108
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,750
- Why did you bring me in?
- Because I want to share it with you.

109
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,386
It's the biggest heist of my life,
and I want my brother to be there.

110
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,625
You've called me to come up with the ideas
he's not providing.

111
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,541
And you...

112
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,142
You know how to get the gold out,
but not how to get the gang out.

113
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,125
Also, you don't have any idea
how you'll spend the rest of your lives

114
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,583
with 90 tons of gold on you
without being discovered.

115
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,541
An analytical mind, even a limited one,

116
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,666
would've considered that
before anything else.

117
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,750
But not you two.

118
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,666
Because you're in love with the plan,

119
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,250
and he's simply in love with you.

120
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,791
We're guided by passion, true,
but you're blinded by hatred.

121
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,041
Hatred for romanticism.

122
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,809
Well, maybe that's because
one of the principal themes of romanticism

123
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,208
is suicide. Andres, this plan is suicide.

124
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,666
Still being a pessimist?

125
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,510
It's not his best day,
but he'll get over it.

126
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,500
When he's stressed out,
he gets very negative.

127
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,583
Well...

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,375
I'm gonna head to the bathroom.

129
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,166
Would you like to accompany me, Sergio?

130
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,958
Have you ever had the privilege
of experiencing

131
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,208
masterful fellatio
from a man with great skill?

132
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,791
I'm joking.

133
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,916
<i>Numb,</i>

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,333
<i>disoriented, a blank stare,</i>

135
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,166
<i>and, most of all, feeling like
you're floating outside of reality.</i>

136
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,083
<i>Those are the symptoms
of emotional shock.</i>

137
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,958
<i>Of course, it could also go the other way.</i>

138
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,250
<i>Uncontrollable rage</i>

139
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,083
<i>that can only be stopped...</i>

140
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,541
<i>with revenge.</i>

141
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,666
Cleared.

142
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:27,958
Clear.

143
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,291
Blood.

144
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,583
Mother fuck.

145
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,708
Clear.

146
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,166
<i>We found the panic room, sir.</i>

147
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,833
Gandía locked himself inside.
He's wounded. He's got Tokyo.

148
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,583
How bad is the wound?

149
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,791
<i>A grenade exploded right next to him.</i>

150
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,750
He'll try to negotiate,
and this time we have the advantage.

151
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,833
- If he wants to live, he won't hurt Tokyo.
- I wouldn't be so sure of that.

152
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,583
Professor...

153
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,208
Gandía executed Nairobi.

154
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,166
Are you saying that's a yes?

155
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,708
We'll pay them back a hundred times
for what they've done to Nairobi.

156
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,916
<i>At that moment,
the Professor no longer felt any pain.</i>

157
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,458
<i>He was detached from his emotions
and operated like a machine.</i>

158
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,916
We're going to destroy that tent
in seven steps.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,333
<i>The only thing on his mind
was his next strike.</i>

160
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,291
And the first starts with the truth.

161
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,625
Professor, if you want to tell the truth,
you need to talk to Rio.

162
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,791
There's things you need to know.

163
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,833
Professor...

164
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,333
<i>From that moment on,</i>

165
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,666
<i>everything, absolutely everything we did
was about attacking.</i>

166
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,309
<i>- Professor.
- In the next few hours,</i>

167
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,458
<i>the Professor would launch
a barrage of missiles.</i>

168
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,958
You said getting us out was impossible
but you'd do it.

169
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,833
Are you going to keep your word?

170
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,958
I said when we melted the gold
and got it out of there,

171
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,250
I'd get you out too.

172
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,583
And I will.

173
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,875
Palermo, go get Tokyo.

174
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,750
I'm going to the foundry. Denver, with me.

175
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,625
<i>All units at full alert.</i>

176
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,333
<i>Advancing with the TEDAX robot.</i>

177
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,708
<i>We're ready to deactivate the bombs
at the entrance.</i>

178
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,000
Nairobi's dead.

179
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,416
From now on, I'm in charge.

180
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,166
We have to be extremely efficient.
How many tons do we have?

181
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,125
Forty-four.

182
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,875
- What is this? Fucking recess?
- Forty-four is three less than the target.

183
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,458
Raise the temperature to 1,750.
We need to step up the production rate.

184
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,791
- Is anyone in there?
- No.

185
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, there should be. Let's get in there

186
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,123
'cause we have to get this gold out,
no matter what.

187
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,166
Denver!

188
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,763
Don't leave
a single gram of gold in there.

189
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,291
I wanna get out of here.

190
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,458
Come on. Let's do it. Let's go!

191
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,375
- Professor.
<i>- Not the Professor.</i>

192
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,938
We have a problem. We need to use
a firewall. Transferring you.

193
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,208
Okay. Hurry up.

194
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,791
<i>Commencing procedure
to deactivate the first explosive.</i>

195
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:48,291
<i>Everyone take cover. Units one and two,
get ready for immediate intervention</i>

196
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,041
<i>once it's deactivated.</i>

197
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,666
Stupid fucking firewall.

198
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,392
- <i>Professor.</i>
- Yes.

199
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,083
I shouldn't be telling you this,
but they're planning a massacre.

200
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,988
<i>They're going to storm the bank.</i>

201
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,125
<i>They're trying to contact Gandía
so they can coordinate an attack.</i>

202
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,666
Understood.

203
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,333
Did you give Lisbon my message?

204
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,750
Yeah.

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,958
Antoñanzas, you stay and watch Murillo.

206
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,708
Don't let anyone in.

207
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,666
For Christ's sake,
why didn't tell anyone about this before?

208
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,708
What would that get me?
A little bit of pity?

209
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,333
Oh, Alicia...

210
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,625
Paris.

211
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,916
<i>She was very moved.</i>

212
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,041
<i>She looked as happy as a puppy.</i>

213
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,958
<i>I wish you could have seen her.</i>

214
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,458
Thank you, Benito.

215
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,934
- Listen up.
<i>- I'm listening.</i>

216
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,918
The police are coordinating
an attack with Gandía.

217
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,719
We need to knock down the phone
in the panic room. Cut off everything.

218
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,333
Also, this is very important...

219
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,208
Do not kill Gandía. I need him alive.

220
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,791
With Tokyo in there,
that's gonna be difficult, sir.

221
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,833
I said alive. It's the key to the plan.

222
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,500
Find the electromagnetic waves
and cut the cables.

223
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,708
When he's incommunicado,

224
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,751
with no cameras to the outside,
you open the door.

225
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,958
Use circular saws, the hammers.
Make as much noise as you can.

226
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,875
<i>He needs to know we're coming
so he'll focus on the door.</i>

227
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,541
And then through the back,
without him realizing it,

228
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,750
we make a small hole,
and we inject narcotic gas.

229
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,541
When he's asleep,
we knock the door down.

230
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,666
<i>- Understood?</i>
- Understood.

231
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,625
<i>Bombs are deactivated, sir.</i>

232
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,791
Good. Get me Gandía.

233
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,166
Bingo.

234
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,750
Cuckoo!

235
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,083
Those are all my friends.

236
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,000
Colonel!

237
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,166
Colonel!

238
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,291
Colonel!

239
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,125
Sure looks like you're fucked,
doesn't it, asshole?

240
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,958
<i>I don't care if it's hard.
Of course, I'll do it.</i>

241
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,291
Are you sure?

242
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,625
<i>You can count on me.</i>

243
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,708
Thank you, Rio.

244
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,166
Thank you.

245
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:31,291
THE ALGERIAN DESERT

246
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,708
<i>Did you find anything?</i>

247
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,625
Find anything where?

248
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,958
This is a desert.

249
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:42,000
You can't get a taxi and say,
"Take me to the torturer's house, please."

250
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,333
I gave you local backup.

251
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,958
Listen, Professor. I speak Spanish.

252
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,375
I speak German, Italian, French,
English, Croatian, Serbian,

253
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,291
but I don't speak fucking Berber.

254
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,833
I need coordinates.

255
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,041
Give me ten minutes.

256
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,250
Shakir, I need the satellite images now.

257
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,666
<i>You have ten minutes.</i>

258
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,125
Palermo, they're going in.

259
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,416
- It seems like the police were...
- ...Bank of Spain...

260
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,916
Special operation units

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,208
are approaching the building, and it looks
like they're trying to forcefully enter.

262
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,500
<i>The police were approaching,
ready to attack with full force.</i>

263
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,750
<i>Then the Professor
launched the first missile.</i>

264
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,833
Open the doors.

265
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,041
Hold!

266
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,916
What the fuck is happening?

267
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,625
<i>The first missile
was to honor the memory of Nairobi.</i>

268
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,416
They're the governor's personal guards.

269
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,375

BURIED ALIVE

296
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,208
<i>He covered Madrid with posters

<i>to the national and international press.</i>

299
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,083
<i>I was illegally detained on January 20th</i>

<i>- by the Panamanian police...
- </i>Colonel. Inspector?

301
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,000
<i>Then I was transferred on a secret
flight with CNI Colonel...</i>

302
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,041
<i>Luis Prieto.</i>

303
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,208
<i>We landed somewhere around Maghreb,</i>

304
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,000
<i>and they tortured me until April 4th.</i>

305
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,625
<i>They put me in a cell that was so small...</i>

306
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,375
<i>my only option was to stand.</i>

307
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,416
<i>They left me... to shit and piss myself.</i>

308
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,250
<i>They just left me there,</i>

309

310

<i>One night...</i>

<i>and they forced me to dig my own grave.</i>

314

<i>They put me in a coffin,

316
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,375
You buried the kid alive?

317
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,166
Of course, we buried him alive.

318
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,958
Why would you do something like that?

319
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,375
Why do you think we sent him to Algeria?
To slap him on the wrist?

320
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,976
You should've left him in a ditch
or something. Maybe quicklime.

321
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,125
A block of cement.

322
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,791
But buried alive? Fuck me!

323
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:56,666
Everyone heard him describe it with all
the details. It's horror movie shit.

324
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,434
When it comes to empathy, we just
shot ourselves in the fucking head.

325
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,298
The <i>New York Times</i>
published the video.

326
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,250
Some countries are calling for
a commission in Strasbourg.

327
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:08,125
Even Amnesty International is using it
as evidence to open an investigation.

328
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,041
We're fucked.

329
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:12,125
id that place you took him
have any phones, security cameras,

330
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,625
Wi-Fi, or anything that could be used
against us?

331
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,000
It was in the middle of nowhere.

332
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,083
There were no cameras, no internet.
Shit, not even any roads.

333
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,767
- That's why we went there.
- That place is the asshole of the world.

334
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,831
Not even the Algerian secret service
knows about it.

335
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,291
Also, the kid looks as good as new.

336
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,975
He doesn't have any bruises,
no internal bleeding, nothing at all.

337
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,125
- We were very delicate.
- Okay.

338
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,000
We're gonna deny the fuck out of this.

339
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:37,916
It's their word against our word.
And you're going to do it, Luis.

340
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,208
Me?

341
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,833
Yeah, you. You've got balls, so go for it.

342
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,166
Full pageantry with a press conference.
An urgent meeting.

343
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,458
Transparency, Luis.

344
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,875
Transparency.

345
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:52,541
With all this shit, my sugar is low.
Where did they put the fucking cookies?

346
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:37,833
Darko.

347
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,083
Benjamín.

348
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,875
Thank you for coming.

349
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,958
If Agustín, Moscow, trusted you...

350
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,041
consider me your friend.

351
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,833
My daughter, is she okay?

352
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,958
Manila is doing very well.

353
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,750
- Are they all miners?
- All of them.

354
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,666
And they're trustworthy.

355
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,333
Asturians.

356
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:09,750
Except for...

357
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,083
that guy.

358
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:13,958
He's Polish.

359
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:15,875
Captain,

360
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,125
<i>obrigado.</i>

361
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,541
I welcome you all.

362
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:22,916
Follow me, please.

363
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,000
Where are we going, Professor?

364
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,083
To class.

365
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:29,416
I'm gonna explain what we'll be doing
in the next 30 hours.

366
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:39,458
We're gonna carry out a plan
that anyone with common sense

367
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,333
would think is completely insane.

368
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,208
So how about we forget common sense?

369
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,791
Fucking sauna. Shit!

370
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,125
Do you go to saunas?

371
00:25:56,666 --> 00:26:00,708
You've got a lot of repression, don't you?
Getting horny in the army locker room.

372
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,083
Isn't that right?

373
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,875
You know you and I are alike?

374
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,500
The only difference is
we're on opposite sides.

375
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,041
I could offer you a job.

376
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:27,916
You know what?

377
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,291
I'd prefer
if you offered to fuck me instead.

378
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,791
Is there a rule that forbids two soldiers
from different sides from fucking?

379
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,875
That's not treason, right?

380
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,875
They should add it
to the Geneva Convention.

381
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,500
"Cease fire!

382
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:52,833
It's time...

383
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:54,916
to fuck!"

384
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,666
What the fuck do you want?

385
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,041
I don't want anything.

386
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,625
You make me horny.

387
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,333
Hey.

388
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,625
I've been thinking a lot in there,
you know?

389
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,458
And I... I don't really know
what's going on with me.

390
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,298
And I don't understand what's going on
with you, but I love you so much.

391
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:08,666
And I want you to know that, whether
or not we're together, I'm here for you.

392
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,166
What is this, Denver?

393
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,083
What are you saying?

394
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,458
He killed Nairobi.

395
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,250
Anything can happen in here.

396
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,458
Even things we thought were impossible
can happen.

397
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,833
I know it was easy in Indonesia because,
at the end of the day,

398
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:24,458
you were with
the only guy that you could talk to.

399
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,375
But in here it's different,
and I accept that.

400
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,333
And I love you.

401
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:34,625
You got here. You made a comparison.
And I came out the loser. I get it.

402
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,291
No one's comparing you, Denver.

403
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:40,500
Really. And this thing
with Rio is... nothing.

404
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,708
I just want you to know
that if you need that...

405
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,208
If you need to be with Rio...

406
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,625
then go ahead.

407
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,625
That's not what I need.

408
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:56,208
I don't even know what I need, Denver.
Not right now.

409
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,583
We're in the middle of this madness,
and I can't think

410
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:02,750
or make decisions or anything right now.

411
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,833
But you and I met each other in a heist.

412
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,041
And we made a lot of decisions.

413
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,375
Us.

414
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,166
Arturo, what did you do?

415
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:37,791
Hmm?

416
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,708
What did you do to me when I was asleep?

417
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:44,666
I don't know what you're talking about.

418
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,333
You took advantage of me.

419
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,125
I've no idea what you're talking about,
but this isn't a good time.

420
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,208
You drugged me.

421
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,833
You gave me tranquilizers. You insisted.

422
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,541
You gave me more than I needed,
and they knocked me out.

423
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:58,291
But before I went out,
I felt you close to me.

424
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,875
I felt you touching my neck,
touching my breasts.

425
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,041
I wasn't fully conscious,

426
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:05,583
but I could feel you lowering my zipper,
and you kept touching me.

427
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
<i>You lifted my panties, Arturo.</i>

428
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:10,458
<i>I woke up, and then I blacked out again.</i>

429
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,208
I kept seeing flashes of it.
I woke up, and my bra was torn.

430
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,333
Amanda!

431
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,125
What's happening here
is you're very nervous,

432
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,833
- and that's normal...
- No.

433
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:23,958
- ...'cause of this insanity, right?
- No.

434
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,916
I'm sure you're confused.
You saw some flashes,

435
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,500
and you believe those flashes,
but they didn't actually really happen.

436
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,750
Or maybe... maybe...

437
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,666
you had an erotic dream about me.

438
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,583
A wet dream.

439
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,958
It's natural. I don't mind being
the object of your desire, but...

440
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:40,291
don't accuse me of something I didn't do.

441
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,041
You raped me, Arturo.

442
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,791
You drugged me and you raped me.

443
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,000
Listen to me.

444
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,666
You brat.

445
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,250
I didn't rape you.

446
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,583
I didn't take advantage of you.

447
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,541
You're accusing me
of something very, very serious.

448
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,000
Something I despise.

449
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,333
Something I detest.

450
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:03,458
Everyone knows I've always been
a fierce advocate for women's rights.

451
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:05,541
An advocate for the respect.

452
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,666
So I'm not gonna let you do that.

453
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,166
Nothing happened.

454
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,875
You were scared. You had a panic attack.

455
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,083
It makes sense. Right?

456
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,833
Can you believe this?

457
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,041
Can you believe this?

458
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,000
There's Bogotá.

459
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,250
Now you're really fucked.

460
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:49,583
It's the shrapnel in your neck.

461
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,791
Brachial plexus.

462
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:55,125
It controls a lot of muscles in your arm,

463
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:56,708
in your hands...

464
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:58,875
shoulder.

465
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,541
- You know a lot of stuff, huh?
- Hmm.

466
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:04,583
I've picked up some things
from the Professor.

467
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,708
- Oh, yeah?
- Um-hum.

468
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,125
Hard to breathe?

469
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,166
Normal.

470
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:14,625
It's your diaphragm.

471
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:17,875
Very sad.

472
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,833
You want me to release you?

473
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,916
If you don't let me go, you're dead.

474
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,875
If you release me...

475
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,708
I'll help you.

476
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,208
I'm gonna untie your hands
so you can get all the shards out.

477
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,500
But you'll still...

478
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,166
have your neck tied.

479
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:49,250
I'll turn my back to you.

480
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,333
But I just have to move one finger...

481
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:57,500
...and I'll blow all that knowledge out
of that pretty little brain of yours.

482
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,250
MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR
19:45 HOURS

483
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,125
Good evening.

484
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,750
My name is Luis Prieto.

485
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:11,458
I'm a colonel
from the National Intelligence Agency.

486
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,291
I stand before you at the request
of the Minister of the Interior

487
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,791
to deny all the accusations
being brought about

488
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,541
concerning the alleged torture
of Anibal Cortés,

489
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,125
as well as to clarify any doubts
you may have in relation to his arrest.

490
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,666
How did Ágata Jiménez die? Alias Nairobi.

491
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,375
At this time,
we are still gathering information.

492
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:35,708
All I can say is that she was taken down
during a skirmish

493
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,591
by the chief of security
for the Bank of Spain

494
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:38,875
who managed to get free.

495
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,375
Was Cortés illegally detained in Panama?

496
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,958
The arrest was made
in compliance with the law,

497
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,291
in accordance
with an international order for his arrest

498
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,791
officially issued by Europol.

499
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:53,583
Cortés claims he was held
in a 45-centimeter-wide cell.

500
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:54,750
Is that true?

501
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,541
No rule of law
and no democratic country in the world

502
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,305
would allow something like that to happen.

503
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:03,125
He claims to have been buried alive.

504
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,958
Do you deny that too?

505
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,708
That he was left to defecate himself?

506
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:12,750
That they gave him 40 coffees
and cold showers?

507
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,125
<i>...cold showers.</i>

508
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:17,458
All of those statements
are as absurd as they are grotesque.

509
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:21,250
<i>Prieto did what the Professor
expected him to do.</i>

510
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:24,458
<i>He lied, lied, and lied again.</i>

511
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,166
<i>He did it even better
than the Professor thought he would.</i>

512
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,708
They've also successfully...

513
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:31,166
<i>With sarcasm and arrogance.</i>

514
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,333
They'll be overconfident.

515
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,166
They'll be completely overconfident

516
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,041
because they think
it's their word against ours.

517
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:41,375
And that is what's
going to make them drown

518
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:42,958
in the quicksand of their own lies.

519
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:47,625
No one would expect
that the National Intelligence Agency...

520
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,083
is less intelligent than us.

521
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:55,250
But we're gonna show them.

522
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:58,625
And there's no stopping us...

523
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,125
because we're already there.

524
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,125
We're going back to the same scapegoat:

525
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,041
police brutality.

526
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,500
It's a baseless accusation,
and it's unacceptable.

527
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Talk now.

528
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:41,291
We tortured Anibal Cortés
for about two months, something like that.

529
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,833
<i>We were paid 200,000 euros to do it,</i>

530
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,791
<i>by Colonel Prieto
from Spanish Intelligence.</i>

531
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,875
<i>And that was his third missile.</i>

532
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,875
Colonel Prieto. Excuse me, Colonel Prieto.

533
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:55,583
Right this moment,
we're receiving video evidence

534
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:57,875
that contradicts your previous statement.

535
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:00,625
Do you know a Turkish citizen
by the name of Osman?

536
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,166
Hmm, no, I don't know him.

537
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,000
The following e-mail

538
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,583
was sent from your account to this Osman.

539
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,500
It was an order to him. I'll quote it.

540
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,958
"Use any means within your reach
to obtain the information."

541
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,041
You didn't send it?

542
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,208
I'm sorry.
I don't know what you're talking about.

543
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,500
Maybe this video will refresh your memory.

544
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,750
<i>This is the grave
where we buried Anibal Cortés alive.</i>

545
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,458
That's the wooden coffin.

546
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:29,000
We had him in there
for two or three hours.

547
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:31,125
He dug the hole himself.

548
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,833
Are you going to deny this evidence too?

549
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:36,750
Or are you going to claim that this grave,

550
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:40,041
located in a place called Timimoun
in Algeria,

551
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:43,333
a place to which you refer
in several e-mails is a setup.

552
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,958
Well, of course, it's a setup.

553
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,416
I have nothing further to say.

554
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,875
Tamayo's going to be like a tennis player
alone on the court

555
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,541
trying to return
every single one of the balls

556
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,791
that are being fired at him nonstop.

557
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,416
<i>They put me in a coffin.</i>

558
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,250
<i>Two hundred thousand euros to do it.</i>

559
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,250
<i>He'll be so concentrated</i>

560
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,976
on returning the balls we're throwing
at him, he won't have the time

561
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,083
or the energy to think about the heist,
not even for a moment.

562
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,125
<i>Because his whole world
will be shattering to pieces.</i>

563
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,458
Colonel, we're ready to resume the attack.

564
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,684
- We're not going to resume anything.
- Listen...

565
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,166
Don't you see what's going on?

566
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,375
Don't you realize we're being absolutely
crushed in front of the whole world?

567
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:37,000
That's what we need, to accidentally kill
a hostage and crown ourselves in shit.

568
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:40,017
- Colonel, we have the advantage...
- We have the advantage, my fucking ass.

569
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,416
Do I have to remind you that you've tried
to go in there four times already? Four!

570
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,958
You think there's free drinks in there,
or what?

571
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:49,333
When you're dealing with a fire
and the fire's getting worse,

572
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,666
you can only think about one thing.

573
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,500
- Putting it out.
- Putting it out.

574
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,416
Putting it out.
Not for Spain's credibility.

575
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,750
Not to defend the honesty
of the National Intelligence Agency. No.

576
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,291
For your own freedom.

577
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,500
Okay, listen up, everyone.

578
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,791
I need everybody out,
except for the essential personnel.

579
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,666
Take a breather, have a coffee,

580
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,916
and in five minutes,
we'll get back to work.

581
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,416
Oh, Alicia.

582
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,541
We tried to get out there and deny it...

583
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,208
but that damn Professor
was waiting for us

584
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,625
with the evidence in his hands.

585
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,791
Now the only way out
is by taking the blame.

586
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,625
And who's gonna do that?

587
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,750
For the CNI, Prieto.

588
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,250
For the police, you.

589
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:50,791
We need you to act as a firewall
so that the institutions come out clean.

590
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,708
What do I do? What do I say?

591
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,083
You want me to tell them
I did it all by myself?

592
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,541
That it was...

593
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,041
a professional endeavor?

594
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:08,916
To see if they'd give me a medal
for police merit?

595
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:12,708
They've got Prieto's e-mails,
so they probably have yours.

596
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:16,166
You have to confess,
resign from the heist.

597
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,750
And...

598
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:21,541
take the blame
for all of the illegal acts.

599
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,000
Since I'm going down,

600
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:27,416
why don't we add stuff
and say I killed Manolete and Kennedy,

601
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,041
the 23F.

602
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:30,833
I shot the Pope.

603
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,958
Yeah, might as well go for everything, no?

604
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,791
Shit's gonna hit the fan
in every possible scenario.

605
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,458
But if you help us, we won't forget
about what you did for us.

606
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,708
I'll have the CNI discredit the evidence.

607
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:46,666
The state attorney
and the prosecution are on our side.

608
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,458
You'll be put with a judge
who's favorable to you.

609
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,750
Someone who owes us.
Someone who we have by the balls.

610
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,313
Granted, you won't get your job back,

611
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,583
but don't worry about it

612
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,186
because we'll make sure
you're getting paid from a reserve fund.

613
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:05,458
I promise you,
you will not set foot in prison.

614
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:06,791
That's fucking bullshit.

615
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:15,125
Well...

616
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,500
I guess I don't have any other choice.

617
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,583
Right?

618
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:24,916
Alicia...

619
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:26,958
be strong.

620
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,416
We're with you on this.

621
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,583
Sierra...

622
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,166
and Colonel Prieto.

623
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,083
They're going to be
the first ones to fall.

624
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,083
And why?

625
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,208
Because that's how we'll cripple the tent,

626
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:58,416
and then, we can protect
all of our people inside of the bank.

627
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,333
Tamayo will barely be able
to keep control.

628
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,333
When everyone's properly protected
inside the bank,

629
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:06,791
- what are we gonna do, Benjamín?
- Huh? Maybe...

630
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,750
You tell me.

631
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:13,041
We'll rescue another member of the gang.

632
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,541
We're going to rescue someone

633
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:20,750
held in custody
by a convoy of 26 police officers.

634
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:25,333
- That's impossible, Professor.
- It's almost impossible,

635
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,500
but there is one possibility...

636
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,750
if we can answer the following:

637
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:35,666
Where are they going transfer her
and when?

638
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:38,750
And we'll know that information...

639
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,125
because I'm gonna make
the transfer happen.

640
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,875
Just the one on your neck left.

641
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,041
How does it look?

642
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:41,750
It doesn't look good.

643
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:46,083
If I pull it out wrong,
you could be paralyzed.

644
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,375
Pull it out. Pull it out. Don't hesitate.

645
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,916
Lower your head a little more.

646
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,750
The camera.

647
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:29,083
Holy fucking shit! Gandía's dead.

648
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,916
Bogotá, Tokyo killed Gandía!
Knock the door down!

649
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,458
Fuck!

650
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,458
<i>Then came the fourth missile.</i>

651
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:52,125
Our colleague, Lisbon,
has been illegally detained.

652
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,083
She's been kidnapped and is being held
at the police command post

653
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:58,833
outside the Bank of Spain
without legally informing any judge.

654
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,125
<i>No right to a defense.</i>

655
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,291
What the fuck?

656
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,666
<i>Also, they faked her execution.</i>

657
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,583
<i>And to prove it,</i>

658
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,666
<i>here's the recording of that moment.</i>

659
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,000
<i>- Suarez.
- Lower your weapon.</i>

660
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,283
<i>- Where is the Professor?
- Raquel,</i>

661
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,541
<i>tell them I surrender. Buy some time
until I get there. Raquel, tell him.</i>

662
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:20,351
<i>- Where is the Professor?
- I don't know where he is.</i>

663
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:22,333
<i>Tell them I'm almost there.
Raquel!</i>

664
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:24,708
- <i>Where is the Professor?</i>
- I don't know!

665
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,166
Get them out, Raquel.

666
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,666
<i>Get out of there! Get out of there!
Get out of there!</i>

667
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,583
I don't know where the Professor is.

668
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,375
That's the wrong answer.

669
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:34,375
<i>I'm almost there.
Get out!</i>

670
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:37,958
Just get out!

671
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,541
<i>This was self-defense.
Understand?</i>

672
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:44,000
<i>You got me, Solana? She shot first.</i>

673
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:47,583
<i>Take the gun, clean off the prints
and put it in her hand.</i>

674
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,208
I'm requesting an open investigation

675
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,125
to confirm the veracity of these facts.

676
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Tied up like a dog,
and you still took him out. Great.

677
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,625
- Check if there's a pulse.
- Yeah, I have a pulse.

678
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:16,250
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're talking about Gandía.

679
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:19,666
There he is, a little indisposed,
the poor guy.

680
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,750
- He's alive.
- Good.

681
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,208
Is someone letting me out or what?

682
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:30,875
Are you okay?

683
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:57,875
How's Nairobi?

684
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:38,125
<i>The last of the missiles arrived
at the tent in a government vehicle,</i>

685
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:41,208
<i>wearing a badge and with a court order.</i>

686
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,250
Your attention, everyone.

687
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,625
Stop what you're doing.

688
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:52,583
- I'm Colonel Tamayo. I'm in charge.
- I don't care who's in charge, Colonel.

689
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,125
We're Internal Affairs.

690
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:55,833
What the fuck's going on here?

691
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:57,791
Where can I find your prisoner,
Raquel Murillo?

692
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,291
Raquel Murillo,

693
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,708
you are under arrest for the crimes
of belonging to an armed group,

694
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:21,541
kidnap, an attack against the authorities
and the institutions of the State.

695
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:24,250
You have the right to remain silent.

696
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:27,916
You have the right to an attorney
or other means of legal help.

697
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:31,916
You have the right to request
medical assistance if you're feeling ill.

698
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,625
You have the right to consult...
