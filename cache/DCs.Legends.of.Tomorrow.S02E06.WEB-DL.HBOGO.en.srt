1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,520
<i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,800
<i>and all of history is vulnerable
to attack,</i>

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,720
<i>which is why we must
travel through time</i>

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,760
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called time Aberrations</i>

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,160
<i>and to erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,600
<i>We are a team of outcasts
and misfits,</i>

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,520
<i>so please don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,240
<i>We're Legends.</i>

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,600
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,600
Thank you, Mister...

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,240
Hex. Jonah Hex.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,680
Temporal Aberrations cause
these things called timequakes.

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,160
If there was a way of locating
their epicenters,

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,680
maybe we'll be able to fix
the Aberrations before they happen.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,680
Whoa, there, wanderer.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,880
Don't see many folks around here.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,760
Been a while since this old mine
turned up anything worth taking.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,560
Then I guess I'll be on my way.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,080
And let you be on yours.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, ain't you heard?

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm the one that does
the letting around here.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,000
Or do you need a reminder?

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,120
Wait. I know things
about these mines.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,840
Things I can't tell you if I'm shot.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,240
Oh, you'll tell me.

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,880
Or I'll shoot you, otherwise.

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,520
Now lower that iron
and start talking.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,920
The ore in there? It's rare.

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
And powerful.

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,680
More powerful than gold.

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,400
And how would you
be the one to know that?

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
I can show you.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,400
With your permission.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,720
Found it using this.

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,600
There's enough in that mine
for the both of us.

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,840
We're the only ones who know.

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,720
We can be like partners.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Give it here.

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,760
Nice doing business with you,
partner.

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,680
What's with bad guys
and ancient amulets?

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,280
Any idea why Darhk wants this?

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,760
{\an5}All I know is,
it's never a good idea

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,800
{\an5}when your nemesis
starts accessorizing.

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,440
And he's teamed up with a Speedster.

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,440
- What's a Speedster?
- Someone with super speed.

46
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
That's how Darhk escaped.

47
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,120
{\an5}The energy of the Speed Force
grants the Speedster

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Chronokinesis, temporal manipulation.

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
English, Professor.

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,880
{\an5}It means that his running real fast,
lets him time travel.

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,080
I'll be in my room.

52
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,760
Martin, I need you to gather
everything you can on Speedsters.

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,000
And, Nate's right,

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,080
{\an5}this amulet looks a lot like the one
we recovered off the Nazis.

55
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,440
There's got to be a connection.

56
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,040
Let me guess. I'm on library duty.

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,480
{\an5}We're dealing with a Speedster here.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,880
{\an5}How long we gonna keep this secret
from them, Grey?

59
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
{\an5}Come on, future Barry's message.

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,000
{\an5}Yes, I know what you're talking
about, Jefferson.

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,440
{\an5}And we have been through this.

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,240
Barry implored us not
to share any info...

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
You okay?

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm fine,
it's just... just a headache.

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
{\an5}You would tell me
if something was up, right?

66
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,880
{\an5}Because if we start keeping things
from each other...

67
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,880
I just need to rest.

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,760
Saving history can be extremely
wearing on the body.

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm thinking this amulet dates back
to Late Antiquity

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,640
{\an5}and is Judeo-Christian in origin.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Great.

72
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,480
Is... is that great?

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,920
{\an5}Well, I can't find a reference of it
anywhere.

74
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
{\an5}Like, none.

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,080
{\an5}Historically speaking,
this doesn't exist.

76
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,880
{\an5}Well, this is right in front of us,
so I'd say it does exist.

77
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,920
And we know that Damien Darhk
and the Speedster

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
are willing to kill for it.

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
Sounds like you got
some more homework to do.

80
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
What?

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,040
{\an5}I... I just thought, becoming
a superhero,

82
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,160
{\an5}I would spend less time in
the library than my old job.

83
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
{\an5}That's all.

84
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,760
{\an5}Well, research skills
are a kind of superpower.

85
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,440
{\an5}And you can turn to steel.
So you got two.

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,400
{\an5}Saved by the Aberration.

87
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,400
{\an5}Oh, what's the Trouble Alert say?

88
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,440
Look, I told you, don't call it that.

89
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,160
The timequake's epicenter is
Liberty, Colorado, 1874.

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,920
Hah! Back to the Wild West.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
You guys were in the Old West?

92
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,840
- Yeah, town made me a Sheriff.
- That's cool.

93
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,480
All right. Well, I will go tell
Jax and Stein.

94
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Who wants to tell Rory?

95
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
- Not it.
- Not it.

96
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
What?

97
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,720
{\an5}Okay. I'll do it.

98
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,040
I don't know how to use them,
but I'm wearing spurs.

99
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,640
{\an5}I remember my first time
in the Wild West.

100
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,440
{\an5}I drove a real-life desperado
out of town.

101
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,000
{\an5}- That's cool.
- And that was my hat.

102
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
{\an5}Thanks.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,520
- That's cool.
- What's this?

104
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,040
{\an5}Oh, that's nothing.

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,560
{\an5}Don't open that.
You don't have to open...

106
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
You opened it.

107
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,280
Did you draw your own
superhero costume?

108
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
No.

109
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,320
{\an5}Absolutely not. Yeah, I did.

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
{\an5}And I only did,
because when I steel up,

111
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
my clothes stretch out
and they fit all weird.

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
{\an5}And besides, don't I deserve a suit?

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,240
{\an5}I mean, am I just
the research guy here?

114
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
{\an5}Look, I... I know what it's like
to be a rookie.

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,040
{\an5}Just follow my lead,
and you'll be fine out there.

116
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
{\an5}Oh, I know a few things
about the Old West.

117
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,000
Like, for instance, nobody says,
"howdy."

118
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,200
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh...

119
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
{\an5}you know how to ride a horse, right?

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,040
{\an5}Yeah, I can figure it out.

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,160
This loaded?

122
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,480
Yes. It is?

123
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Oh.

124
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,720
{\an5}Whoa, whoa, whoa!

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,040
{\an5}Guys, I think my horse is broken!

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,240
Where's the Professor?

127
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,880
Uh, he's feeling a little off.

128
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
More whiskey for me.

129
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,440
<i>- Yee-haw!
- Whoo-whoo-whoo!</i>

130
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,040
Sounds like a commotion
of some kind.

131
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,640
Hold back, let's get a better look.

132
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,400
<i>Yee-ha!</i>

133
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,120
Look at him up there, boy!

134
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,880
Ah, it's a hanging.

135
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,720
Is that Hex?

136
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,600
You know that man?

137
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,960
We got to help him.

138
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,320
Well, we got to take
his crew out first.

139
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
- They look armed.
- Don't worry, guys.

140
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,520
I got this!

141
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,360
What?

142
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,920
Well, well, well,
you look a lot less mean

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
with that noose around your neck,
don't you, Hex?

144
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,760
You think this is finished?

145
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,080
Looking pretty finished to me.

146
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,400
Don't you think, boys?

147
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,120
You son of a bitch!

148
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,880
You might want to slow down there.

149
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,040
Because these here parts
ain't big enough for the...

150
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,360
five of us.

151
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,560
And who the hell are you?

152
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,760
What he said.

153
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,200
On second thought,
I don't give a damn!

154
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,000
Hold still, Hex.

155
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,200
Nice shot.

156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,560
Now you get on that horse
and you ride till you feel like

157
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,560
you can't ride any further, then...

158
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
you ride some more.

159
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,040
- Now go on, get! Go on!
- Yeah.

160
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Whoo!

161
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,480
Hyah! Whoo!

162
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Hyah!

163
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,400
Woo-ah!

164
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
Face.

165
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,840
What?

166
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Nothing.

167
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,280
Oh, hell.

168
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,960
They're back.

169
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,320
Saved by a filly.
Ain't that the damnedest?

170
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,920
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,440
How'd you know I needed saving?

172
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,120
Because we got an alert
that history was being changed,

173
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,080
and the coordinates led us
to your hanging.

174
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,240
Well, I guess it's nice to know
that I matter.

175
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,640
Leaving already?

176
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,000
I didn't get to shoot anyone.

177
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,400
I need a drink.

178
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,760
Where's Rip?

179
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,280
He's MIA.

180
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Damn.

181
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
How the hell did you
miscreants manage

182
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,960
to not get yourselves killed
without him?

183
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,960
Miss Lance has been
serving as Captain.

184
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
But she's a lady.

185
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,360
You are a lady, right?

186
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,600
You know I could take your life
just as easily as I saved it.

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Oh, fiery.

188
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,280
Whoever breaks her's
in for a wild ride.

189
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,880
Too bad this filly's
into other fillies.

190
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,720
You don't say.

191
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
So how did you end up
in the noose?

192
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,040
Well, I was collecting the bounty
on a pissant

193
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,960
by the name of Quentin Turnbull.

194
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,560
- As in Turnbull Country?
- Never heard of it.

195
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,440
That's because it's not supposed
to exist.

196
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,160
This book has changed
since the last time I saw it.

197
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,200
- Check this out, Gideon.
<i>- Right away.</i>

198
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,160
That's a map of the United States
from 1876.

199
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,400
All right, who is Turnbull?

200
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Two-bit, yellow-bellied
cattle rustler.

201
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,000
Who controls all of the land
west of the Rocky Mountains.

202
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,960
Looks like we found our Aberration.

203
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,280
Am I supposed to have the faintest
idea what the hell this means?

204
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,920
It means that we need to stop
Turnbull from taking over the West.

205
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Looks like you got yourself
a posse, partner.

206
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Where is everybody?

207
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,880
Ever since Turnbull set up shop
about six months ago,

208
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,000
everyone's been run out of town
or made to work in the mine.

209
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,560
Mine? What kind of mine?

210
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,400
- Gold?
- Hell if I know.

211
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,800
Nobody's been mining for gold through
these parts for half a century.

212
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,120
Listen to me. These parts...
I sound like I'm a cowboy.

213
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,080
Well, he's pulling something out of
the ground that's making him rich.

214
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,520
Turnbull also owns the saloon.

215
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,520
The hotel, the laundry...

216
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
and the whorehouse.

217
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,000
The answer's no, Mick.

218
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,200
Turnbull's got an office
above the saloon.

219
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,280
It's also got about a dozen men
making sure nobody gets close to him.

220
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,880
I think I know how we can.

221
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,400
Mick.

222
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,120
Why don't you mosey on in there?

223
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,400
Have yourself a good time.

224
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,520
If you insist.

225
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,320
I'm not sure I understand your plan.

226
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,920
You just set a match to a powder keg.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,840
And if Turnbull doesn't want
his saloon to burn down,

228
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,200
then he's gonna have to come out
of his office and deal with it.

229
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,320
Better yet, get your boy to get
in a fight with Turnbull,

230
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
and bring him out here on the street.

231
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,920
Amaya, your job is to make sure Rory
keeps his pistol in his pants

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,240
until he's outside the saloon.

233
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,320
Clearly, I drew the short straw.

234
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,040
So what you want us to do?

235
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Reckon I can post up nearby
with a long gun.

236
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,720
- Are you chewing tobacco?
- Tootsie Roll.

237
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,400
Get rid of your hats and your guns.

238
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,760
What? I thought we were supposed
to be some badass cowboys?

239
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,560
You guys want to know how Turnbull
went from being a cattle rustler

240
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,080
to running his own country?

241
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm gonna need you to infiltrate
his base of operations.

242
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,280
As what?

243
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,120
You all are tax collectors?

244
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,280
We're here to go over your books
and make sure everything's in order.

245
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,920
And we're in a bit of a hurry, so...

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
Yes, we're on the next train
back to Washington D.C.

247
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,520
Well, there ain't no train
to Washington.

248
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,840
Pass won't be open till spring.

249
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,400
He means mule train.

250
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
This guy.

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,360
How do I go from desperado
to accountant?

252
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,280
At least, Mick's having fun.

253
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
Stuck here doing research
while everyone else is out drinking.

254
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
It's like high school all over again.

255
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,760
A shot.

256
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,800
Make it two.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're with him?

258
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,080
Unfortunately.

259
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,560
Guys, I think I found something.

260
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
According to this ledger,

261
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,680
Turnbull's stockpiling some kind
of ore in a nearby mining camp.

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
And you are?

263
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,000
I work for Mr. Turnbull.

264
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,640
Who are you?

265
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,080
My friends and I are with
the Internal Revenue Service...

266
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,800
Ah, Mr. Turnbull don't like
no taxmen.

267
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,320
Well, nobody likes paying taxes,

268
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
but they are an essential part
of the Federal Government...

269
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
Mr. Turnbull don't like
the Federal Government, neither.

270
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,800
Is that why he's trying to start
his own country?

271
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,120
Oh, now I see why'd you have to go
and say something like that.

272
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,320
Now I got to pump some lead into you

273
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,920
so you don't go blabbing
to the wrong person.

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,960
Hey, hey, would you shoot
an unarmed man?

275
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,440
I think that's a yes.

276
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,960
So what's your history with Turnbull?

277
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,760
Come again?

278
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,720
Well, you said that you had dealings
over the years.

279
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,000
I can tell a vendetta when I see one.

280
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,880
I'm kind of an expert
when it comes to revenge.

281
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,240
This is what it's like working
with a woman?

282
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,400
You just sit around
and talk about your feelings?

283
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,880
Well, if your feelings
are what almost got you hung,

284
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,440
then, yeah.
I'd say they're worth talking about.

285
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,240
Not in my century.

286
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,560
Now that we've got outlaw outfits,

287
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,680
it's time to find out what Turnbull's
stockpiling at his mining camp.

288
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,640
Or we could do the responsible thing

289
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,320
and head back to the ship
with the rest of the team.

290
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,040
You're joking, right?

291
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,800
Time to cowboy up.

292
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh!

293
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,200
- Another blackjack.
- Must be my lucky day.

294
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
- You're cheating.
- I'm winning.

295
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,000
Sweetheart, that's for you.

296
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,400
I'll see you around.

297
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,040
Piano man. Play something else.

298
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,280
I've had more fun at a funeral.

299
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,040
Bartender!

300
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,120
And who might you be?

301
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,720
Name's Turnbull.

302
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,920
Never heard of him.

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,600
That's my name on the sign
in front of the saloon.

304
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,840
Or can't you read?

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,560
So it's your money I'm winning?

306
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,720
Well, that's interesting.

307
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,680
I'd say your luck has run out,
partner.

308
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,520
You just gonna stand there
and make threats?

309
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,920
Or you gonna back it up?

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,160
<i>Amaya, what's going on in there?</i>

311
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,200
You wanted Rory to start a fight.

312
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,480
I'd say your plan's working.

313
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,400
Man, these clothes smell like ass.

314
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,320
People didn't wash
in the Wild, Wild West?

315
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,840
Well, we're criminals, remember?

316
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,080
It's important to smell the part.

317
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,200
Game faces, boys.

318
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,320
We got company.

319
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,280
I don't recognize you three.

320
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,280
That's probably because
of our new bandanas.

321
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,760
This one off his rocker?

322
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,560
You could blow his brains out,
only he doesn't got any.

323
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,360
Nice work.

324
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,800
Gideon, let's run the neural imaging
scan again.

325
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,560
There... there must be something
you missed.

326
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,360
<i>The odds that I misdiagnosed your
condition are infinitesimally thin.</i>

327
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,080
<i>The algorithm programmed
into my medical diagnostic systems...</i>

328
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,440
Please just do it.

329
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,880
<i>As you wish, Professor.</i>

330
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,040
<i>Biometric scan reveals
all brain functions</i>

331
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,840
<i>are within normal parameters.</i>

332
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,960
<i>Physiologically,
there's nothing wrong with you.</i>

333
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,320
Are... are you implying that my
symptoms are psychosomatic?

334
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Because...

335
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Please...

336
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,960
I need you to run the test again.

337
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Oh, my God.

338
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,400
What is it?

339
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,640
It's dwarf star.

340
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,080
One of the rarest minerals
in the universe.

341
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,240
How does this help Turnbull
take over the West?

342
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,440
I used dwarf star to power
the ATOM suit.

343
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,640
The piece I had was the size
of your little finger.

344
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,520
There's enough potential energy here
to power the entire Wild West.

345
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,120
Or blow it up.

346
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Question is, how does Turnbull
even know what it is?

347
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,720
Bet you this has something
to do with it.

348
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,760
It's some sort of tracker,
definitely not from the 1800s.

349
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,480
Probably stole it
from the time pirate.

350
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,240
- We got to get this out of here.
- Yeah.

351
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,240
Oh, I should've mentioned,

352
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,920
it's also the densest material
in the universe.

353
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,880
Let's get the rest of the team.

354
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,920
Amaya, it's been forever.
What the hell is going on in there?

355
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,920
Your plan's caught something
of a snag.

356
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Explain.

357
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,760
<i>Well, it's hard to...</i>

358
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,040
But Mr. Rory and Mr. Turnbull...

359
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,440
like each other.

360
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
<i>What?</i>

361
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,520
<i>What happened to Rory
starting a fight?</i>

362
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,560
I think it's more likely that him
and Turnbull get matching tattoos.

363
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,760
Then they told me to put my hands up
and my pants fell down.

364
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,560
Because of all the loot
I was carrying!

365
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,560
You see, that's what them damn fools

366
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,680
in government back in Washington
don't understand,

367
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,800
that men like you and me,
we wasn't meant to live in cages.

368
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,920
Hell, that's why our forebearers
busted away from England

369
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,480
to begin with, so we could be free!

370
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
And that's what
<i>Turnbull Country</i> is all about.

371
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,920
It's about keeping
the Wild West wild.

372
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,080
I'll drink to that.

373
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,880
Will you have some of that?

374
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,720
Are you gonna sit around
while those two bend elbows?

375
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,880
What are you doing?

376
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm gonna collect my bounty,
whether you like it or not.

377
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,120
Stick to the plan, Jonah.

378
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,920
Your guy on the inside
ain't sticking to no plan,

379
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,120
why the hell should I?

380
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
<i>Sara? What do you want me to do?</i>

381
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,920
Brace yourself.

382
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,520
Turnbull!

383
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,640
Well, if it ain't
the great Jonah Hex himself.

384
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,800
Whoo, you got quite a pair to walk
into my establishment like this.

385
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,400
You're like a cockroach.
Hard to kill.

386
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm taking you in.

387
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,080
Alive or dead.

388
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,880
Your choice.

389
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,840
I choose...

390
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,480
dead!

391
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,040
Actually, Jonah...

392
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,320
I'm glad you decided to pay me
this little visit.

393
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,400
You see I've been working
on a little something.

394
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,080
It seems that ore
that I discovered...

395
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,760
Well, it's got special qualities.

396
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,360
Let's party!

397
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,080
Come on!

398
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,000
Why do you guys
get to have all the fun?

399
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,800
We just got back
from Turnbull's mine.

400
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,240
The reason for the Aberration?

401
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,640
He's digging up dwarf star.

402
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,240
Get back to the ship.

403
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,840
That's right, run,
you yellow-bellied cowards!

404
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,160
Finally! Some excitement.

405
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,480
Mick, no!

406
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,880
And here I thought you and me
was gonna be friends!

407
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,600
I don't have friends.

408
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Nate?

409
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,280
- Nate? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

410
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,520
I'm the Man of Steel, remember?

411
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,720
Oh, my gosh.

412
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,840
Gideon, prepare to run diagnostics.

413
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,680
What's to run? I've been shot!

414
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,560
<i>The bullet has lodged itself
between several</i>

415
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,120
<i>of Dr. Haywood's internal organs.</i>

416
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,480
How's that possible?
He's made of steel.

417
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,280
Because it wasn't a normal bullet.

418
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
It was dwarf star.

419
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,520
<i>I estimate his chance
of survival at 51 percent.</i>

420
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,000
Would it kill you to say
better than average, Gideon?

421
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,240
We had a plan.

422
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,560
You went off book.
Now you're gonna cut the crap,

423
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,160
and tell me what the hell is going on
between you and Turnbull.

424
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,560
I don't answer to you, Miss Lance.

425
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,200
It's Captain Lance.

426
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,000
And if you did answer to me,

427
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,000
Nate wouldn't have gotten shot.

428
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,960
Now, I know you don't like
taking orders from a woman...

429
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,480
but you're gonna like getting your
ass kicked by one even less.

430
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,680
I've been after Turnbull
for eight years now.

431
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,760
I almost got him twice.

432
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,200
He wants to see me
pushing up daisies

433
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,920
just as bad as I want to see him
do the same.

434
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,120
Because why?

435
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,480
Little town in Oklahoma.

436
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,320
Goes by the name of Calvert.

437
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,560
Turnbull and his men
were harassing it.

438
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,640
And they hired me to fight back.

439
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,960
Calvert, that's the town
that Rip left in the lurch.

440
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,240
My little rebellion...

441
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,440
made other towns think they didn't
need to pay protection money

442
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,800
to Turnbull and his gang.

443
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,040
So one night...

444
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,000
Turnbull gathered every man, woman,
and child in Calvert.

445
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,680
Locked us in the church.

446
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,080
Set it on fire.

447
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,160
Somehow, I escaped.

448
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,840
The good Lord saw fit to leave me
with a souvenir.

449
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,440
Oh, what the hell am I telling
a woman this for?

450
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,680
You'd never understand.

451
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Wrong.

452
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,880
Like I said,
vendetta's kind of my thing.

453
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,560
I've got a Turnbull.

454
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,480
And he's still out there.

455
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,600
Well, here you are with a timeship.

456
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,080
Been there, tried that.

457
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,720
Killing Darhk would create ripples
in history that I can't control.

458
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,800
But there are things
that I can control.

459
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,160
I can help you capture Turnbull.

460
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,360
Even though I screwed up?

461
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,840
Been there too.

462
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm starting to think
that screwing up is...

463
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,840
just an essential part of surviving.

464
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,400
So how's your headache?

465
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Oh, it's fine.

466
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,480
Nothing a little aspirin
couldn't help.

467
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,720
Funny, that's not what
Gideon told me.

468
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
What's going on?

469
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,120
And don't lie, because you know
I can always tell.

470
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
All right,. While you were away, I...

471
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,960
I had a vision.

472
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,760
A vision? Like a hallucination?

473
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,600
It's possible it could merely be a...

474
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,760
a side effect from multiple
time jumps.

475
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,720
Whoa, Grey! Grey!

476
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,400
Grey?

477
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,360
That is not a reaction
to time travel.

478
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,520
What did you just see?

479
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,080
A... a woman.

480
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,080
Someone I've never met,
but her face, it keeps...

481
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,360
flashing in my mind.

482
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,720
It's like...

483
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,760
I'm having memories of a stranger,

484
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,880
but she's... she's not...

485
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,360
not really a stranger.

486
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
But I...

487
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,120
I haven't the slightest notion, why?

488
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,160
Trying to work out your frustration?

489
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,640
Something like that.

490
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,520
What happened out there today?

491
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,480
You lost control.

492
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,520
Says you.

493
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,320
That man back in town, the drinker,
the gambler, the animal...

494
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,640
that wants to watch the whole
world burn...

495
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,160
that's the real me.

496
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,240
I happen to know a thing
or two about animals.

497
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,800
They're not vicious by nature.

498
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,120
Unless they're attacked.

499
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,280
If you're trying to tell me to...

500
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,960
to tell you some sob story about
how horrible and painful my life is,

501
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,240
forget it.

502
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm no victim.

503
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
Sara's told me all the things
that you've done for this team.

504
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,160
And you don't sound like an animal

505
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,680
who just wants to watch
the world burn.

506
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,040
They like to pretend
I'm part of the team,

507
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,880
that they have me on a leash.

508
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,440
No.

509
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Now...

510
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,080
if you'll excuse me.

511
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,800
Some superhero.

512
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,080
Maybe I am better suited
for the library.

513
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,520
Don't be so hard on yourself.

514
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,760
You had no idea that Turnbull
laced the bullets with dwarf star,

515
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,520
or that you were even
vulnerable to it.

516
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,400
When I was a kid...

517
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,800
there was this bully, Shane Blocklin.

518
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,680
And one day, I decided,

519
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,600
"I'm gonna stand up to old Shane."

520
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,000
Long story short,
he breaks my nose in two places.

521
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,800
But from that point on, I was, uh...

522
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,280
I was different.

523
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,920
I was afraid.

524
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,440
And then I meet you guys,
and I get these superpowers.

525
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,560
And I said to myself,

526
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,840
"Nate, you don't have
to feel afraid again."

527
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,760
Well, maybe now you know how I felt
after you destroyed my ATOM suit.

528
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,480
When we were out fighting
with the Shogun,

529
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,600
without my suit, I was afraid.

530
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,880
Well, you hid it well.

531
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,240
That's because I realized that...

532
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,240
weakness, or not being invulnerable,
is what makes me a hero.

533
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,720
There's no bravery without fear.

534
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,200
That was a really good
inspirational speech.

535
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,400
- Really?
- Yeah.

536
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,720
Well, I have a few other aphorisms
in my back pocket.

537
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,720
Like, courage is the mastery of fear,
not the absence of fear.

538
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,960
Strength is...

539
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,280
You know what, buddy?

540
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,400
You nailed it.

541
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,320
Sorry, got a little carried away
with my train of...

542
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
That's it.

543
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,440
I think I know how Turnbull's
gonna make his own country.

544
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,400
When I saw how much dwarf star
ore he had in that mine,

545
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,520
I started to wonder. How could
he transport such a heavy shipment?

546
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
He'd have to use...

547
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,720
- The railroad.
- The railroad.

548
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,360
Okay, get to the part where we care,
Ray.

549
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,000
I think he's gonna use the railroad
and the dwarf star to...

550
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
wait for it.

551
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,600
I don't want to wait for it.

552
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,680
Close Summit Pass.

553
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,600
- Oh, my God, Ray's right.
- Thank you.

554
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,480
Summit Pass connects
East-West via railroad.

555
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,400
Not if Turnbull uses this...

556
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,680
- the magic.
- Dwarf star?

557
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,080
Yeah, to blow the thing up.

558
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,640
Well, if he destroys the pass,

559
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,040
there's no way of transporting
soldiers and supplies

560
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
from the East coast.

561
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,400
The U.S. Army is effectively
locked out of the West.

562
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,760
So it's simple. We just stop
Turnbull from blowing up the pass.

563
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,120
Yeah, simple.

564
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,560
You don't have a suit.
You just had invasive surgery.

565
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,000
Stein's out of commission.

566
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,280
We'll think of something.

567
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,200
"Courage is the mastery of fear,
not the absence of it."

568
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,160
Yeah, what about Turnbull?

569
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,560
If that train goes boom...

570
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,680
he's not gonna be on it.

571
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,160
I overheard one of his people saying,

572
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,880
Turnbull just called for a meeting
at his mine.

573
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,240
You, Jax, and Ray, stop the train.

574
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,280
The rest of us,
we'll deal with Turnbull.

575
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,120
You sure about this?

576
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,320
Of course.

577
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,720
This isn't my first rodeo.

578
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,400
I wanted to say that.

579
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,920
There's our train.

580
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,560
Loaded with enough dwarf star
to punch a hole in a mountain

581
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,200
and cut off the pass to the East.

582
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,960
How do we stop a moving locomotive?

583
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,520
We don't.

584
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
I do.

585
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,120
I think.

586
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Yeah!

587
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
- So what do you think?
- I think I liked him.

588
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,360
That's three of them
for every one of us.

589
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,840
Hex and I will draw their attention.

590
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,840
While you two go make sure
Turnbull can't pull

591
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,360
anymore dwarf star out of the ground.

592
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
We'll need about five minutes

593
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,320
to plant enough dynamite
to seal the mine.

594
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,280
It's about time we got
to light something up.

595
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,400
Just light the fuse and run.
Don't stick around for the fireworks.

596
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,520
Yeah, yeah.

597
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,160
All right, I've got a plan
to get us close to Turnbull.

598
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,160
Are you ready to follow
my orders this time?

599
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,280
Aye, aye, Captain.

600
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,040
Good. Now, put these on.

601
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,640
Quentin Turnbull!

602
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,360
Who's asking?

603
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,960
I heard you're looking for someone.

604
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,440
Jonah Hex!

605
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,200
Well, hell, looks like I'm gonna
have to kill you for the third time.

606
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,360
I'm impressed, boy.

607
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,800
Jonah, Jonah, Jonah.

608
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,320
Back in the belly of the whale.

609
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,840
A lily-livered whale who killed women
and children.

610
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,520
Whoa, no, that was before.
I've changed.

611
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,400
I got purpose now.

612
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,400
Matter of fact, why don't I show you
what I'm working on

613
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,800
so you know why you died?

614
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
You come along too, boy.

615
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,480
Anyone who can bring in Hex,
always got a place on my crew.

616
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,840
Nate, what are you doing, man?

617
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,120
Hold on!

618
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
Keep your distance!

619
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,640
What are you gonna do?

620
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,320
I'm gonna cut them off at the pass.

621
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,480
I've always wanted to say that.

622
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,840
You can't get in front
of a moving train!

623
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,360
You said it yourself,
there is no bravery without fear!

624
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,480
Which is good, because
I am scared as hell right now.

625
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,600
Yeah!

626
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,720
Colt Single Action Army.

627
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,280
<i>The gun that won the West.</i>

628
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Some folks like to call it,
The Peacemaker.

629
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,000
Only I don't much care for peace.

630
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,320
Yeah, thanks to what
I pulled out of this mine,

631
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,880
I got my own weapon now.

632
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,120
Something that's gonna tip
the scales.

633
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,880
Win the West back for the folks
it belongs to.

634
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,320
The outlaws!

635
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,200
Hyah!

636
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,800
- Okay. I'm in position.
<i>- And out of your mind!</i>

637
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,040
<i>You couldn't even stop
a bullet made with that stuff.</i>

638
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,400
<i>That train is loaded
with dwarf star, man!</i>

639
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,600
You guys aren't helping.

640
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,360
You got a whole minute
to get out of here.

641
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,840
You mean we have a minute.

642
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,680
That's what I meant.

643
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,520
Should we tell them about the minute?

644
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,200
No.

645
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Good.

646
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,920
I was hoping you were gonna say that.

647
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,800
Who's next?

648
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,600
Mick, we got to go!

649
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,680
Mick, now!

650
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,640
Put the animal away.

651
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,160
Okay.

652
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,040
Oh, yeah.
Those bullets ain't nothing.

653
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,320
Wait till you see what I got now.

654
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,920
Now, get on in there!

655
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,560
You ain't no man!

656
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,960
You burned down Calvert!

657
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,680
You murdered all those people!

658
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,600
For what?

659
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,480
For power?

660
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,400
Oh, get it over with!

661
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,800
Alive or dead?

662
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,000
Alive!

663
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,200
You lucky son of a bitch.

664
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,200
I got this. I got this.

665
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,160
I got this.

666
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,640
I got this, I got this,
I got this, I got this.

667
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,760
Did you see that? Did you see that?

668
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Tell me you saw that.

669
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,840
Yo, that was badass, dude.

670
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,120
Totally badass.

671
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,480
- You all right?
- No.

672
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,520
But I stopped a train.

673
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
I think he's good.

674
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Whoo!

675
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,440
I stopped a train!

676
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,000
That's a mighty fine job
you did back there.

677
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,040
Captain.

678
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,840
I'll drink to that.

679
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,120
So now that you have your man,
what are you gonna do with him?

680
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,360
Turnbull?

681
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,360
If I had my way, he'd be in
for a long, painful demise.

682
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,360
I'd let him bleed out from the gut.

683
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,680
But I'm gonna turn him over
to the authorities.

684
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,320
So you don't have to worry about your
Aberration.

685
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,640
Only territory Turnbull's gonna be
claiming is a cold, dark prison cell.

686
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,800
Then our work here is done.

687
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,600
You do a mighty fine job bearing
a burden few men could deal with.

688
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,120
Good thing I'm a woman then.

689
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,080
Yes, ma'am.

690
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,080
I best get Turnbull.

691
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,920
Collect my bounty.

692
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,000
Now, you try to stay out of trouble.

693
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,240
Not likely.

694
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,360
Wouldn't imagine so.

695
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,440
It really is beautiful.

696
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,880
It's no wonder that human beings
have worshiped fire for millennia.

697
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,240
Fire gives us life...

698
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,200
but also has the power to destroy
everything in its path.

699
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,440
Your point?

700
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,800
Or are you gonna keep talking
in metaphors?

701
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Yeah, I know what a metaphor is.

702
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,200
But don't tell them.

703
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
You were right.

704
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,400
The animal who wants
to watch the world burn...

705
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,440
that is who you are.

706
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,200
But it's not all that you are.

707
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,800
Your point?

708
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,440
Don't deny the animal.

709
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,600
But don't let it control you either.

710
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,640
I can help you.

711
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,080
Believe me, I know a thing or two
about controlling wild beasts.

712
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,720
Oh, there you are.

713
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,360
So I've been thinking about
your memory flashes.

714
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,080
Manopause moments, or whatever
it is you want to call them.

715
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
I got a theory.

716
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,360
What if when you interacted with
your younger self in 1987, you...

717
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,240
Inadvertently changed my past

718
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,720
so... so that my memories
from my new life

719
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,400
are supplanting the memories
from my old life,

720
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,200
thus creating temporal dissonance.

721
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,960
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

722
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,680
Oh, it's a brilliant theory,
which I... I happen to share with you

723
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,920
but it... it doesn't explain...

724
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,600
Who the mystery lady is.

725
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,480
Or...

726
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,480
that I'm fairly certain I love her.

727
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,640
Man, Clarissa is gonna
kill you when you get home.

728
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,840
Assuming there even is
a Clarissa to go home to.

729
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,000
Hey, heard you were looking for me.

730
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,480
Oh, yeah, I just wanted to thank you
for saving all that dwarf star ore.

731
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,360
I have enough to power
20 ATOM suits now.

732
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,880
That's cool, man, so we all get one?

733
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,400
Actually, there's something
I've been working on

734
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,240
before I start building
a new exo-suit.

735
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,200
It's not exactly what was
in your drawing.

736
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,560
I made a few improvements.

737
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,960
Shut the front door.

738
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,720
Yeah. I figure you earned it.

739
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,080
Steel.

740
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,240
Cool name.

741
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,280
Hey, are you guys done bro-ing out?

742
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,520
I mean, well, not really but...

743
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
- We can.
- Good.

744
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,840
Because our friends back in 2016,
they need our help.
