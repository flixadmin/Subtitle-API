I'll make sure the Night's Watch

He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall

You named me your Hand.

Yes.

54
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:11,239
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

72
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:36,317
He polished his shield for a week
so that it was like a mirror.

73
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,724
And he crouched behind
it and crept forward,

74
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,844
hoping the dragon
would only see its own reflection.

75
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,999
But the dragon saw a dumb man
holding a mirrored shield.

76
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,681
And burned him to a crisp.

77

(LAUGHS)

78
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:50,642

And rather than send a raven

you decided to enter my country in secret

We received a threatening message.

The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

116

That necklace was stolen from my room.

Oh, excellent.

But I've seen war.

I've seen the bodies piled
on the battlefields.

I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

I'm afraid he does.

00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,919
I cannot disobey my king's command.

134

And my son, Prince Trystane,
will accompany you both.

If the alliance between
the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,

137
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,321
their engagement must stand.

00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:33,357
I accept.

139
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:34,837
One more thing.

140
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,921
My brother was named to the Small Council
before his death.

141
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:42,796
Your father understood the importance
of keeping Dorne in the fold.

142
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:43,923
With Oberyn gone,

143
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:47,284
Trystane will take his place
on the Small Council.

144

You have my word.

145
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,883
The word of a Kingslayer.

146
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:56,521
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

147
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,557
You are mother to four of my nieces,
girls I love very much.

148

For their sake,
I hope you live a long and happy life.

Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

150

May I inquire as to the
fate of my man Bronn?

151
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:21,565
Tell me, in King's Landing,

152
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:24,799
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

153

He said it was just a fleabite.

154
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,922
The fault is mine. Bronn is merely
a soldier following my orders.

155
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:36,438
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

Prince Trystane must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

I'll let him decide.

158
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:48,881
I have learned the value of mercy
from my father.

159
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:52,119
- I'll set your man free.
- You're a good man.

160
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:54,924
On one condition.

Why do we play? I'm better than you.

163
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:07,477
I'll always be better than you.

164
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:10,366
Have I ever missed once?

165
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,564
I don't think I have. I can't recall.

166
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:15,283
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

167
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:19,517
Which do you love most?

(WINCES)

00:15:20,956 --> 00:15:22,367
That one hurt, didn't it?

170
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:25,564
You going to cry?

171
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,400
Give up, little sister.

172
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,717
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

173
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,083
You will. You're thinking too much.

174
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:36,005
Now you're nervous. "What if she's right?"

175
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:40,477
Luck.

176
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,247
Now it's my turn.

177
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,678
You're too slow.
You've always been too slow.

(CELL DOOR UNLOCKS)

00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,358
Am I gonna be happy at
the end of this walk?

180
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:06,359
You'll find out very soon.

The most beautiful woman in the world.

184
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:18,081
And that's the truth.

185

- Slut.

00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:28,242
I didn't realize
there were knights of the Blackwater.

188
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:29,756
Only the one.

189
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:32,316
I believe you've already
met Prince Trystane.

190
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:34,726
Prince.

191
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:36,487
Sorry about the other day.

00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:39,002
JAIME: Prince Trystane here
is a man of mercy.

193
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:41,556
He's agreed to grant you your freedom.

194
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,918
I'm glad to hear it.

195
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:47,837
Pie looks good.

196
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,396

TYCHO: Lord Tyrell.

216
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:43,085
On behalf of the Iron Bank,

217
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,842
may I be the first to welcome you
to the Free City of Braavos.

218
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:48,685
I hope yourjourney was trouble-free.

219
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:52,442
A bit of chop the last few days.
Nothing too awful.

220
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:55,281
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

221
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:57,518
And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

222
00:18:57,676 --> 00:19:03,319
Ah, the vintners say this might be the best
year for red grapes in half a century.

223
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:06,081
If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,

224
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:11,117
I'll be sure to send
a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.

225
00:19:11,196 --> 00:19:13,767
I'm afraid I don't partake.

226
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,077
Oh.

227
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:25,598
Some consider usury
distasteful, dishonorable.

228
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:27,326
Pure nonsense, of course.

229
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:29,478
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

230
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:34,687
Did you know that at one point Maegor III
tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?

231
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:37,163
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

232
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:39,603
and cut off both their hands.

233
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,844
Most unfortunate for the glovers.

234
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,918
MACE: If a man charges
no interest on a loan,

235
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,638
then he has nothing to gain
and everything to lose, so why chance it?

236
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:51,880
Whereas the promise of reward
makes a man willing to gamble.

237
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:55,403
We are not gamblers
here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

238
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,843
You are the world's best gamblers.

239
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:01,682

have a good deal of work to do.

244
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:19,762
MACE: Nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?
TYCHO: I don't have that gift.

245
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:22,203
It's not a gift. It's a skill.
Anyone can learn it.

So give me a kiss by the Long Canal

Wasn't bad, though.

The Tyrells can all rot in hell.

They were going to make
that boy-fucker Renly king.

This is the place, lads.

We'll take half a dozen.

Too old.

The thin man wasn't hungry today.

00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:09,004
Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

- Mmm-mmm.

- Of course, she's my niece.

I wasn't talking about her.

00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:17,678
You think I disapprove?

312

Why?

313
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:22,280
Because people disapprove
of that sort of thing where you are from?

314
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:25,485
They disapproved of Oberyn and me
where you are from.

315
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:29,117
Here, no one blinked an eye.

316
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:34,407

no one would have blinked an eye at you

and who we're not.

The only thing that stays the same
is that we want who we want.

I know your daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,638
that happened to the man I love.

323
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:07,837
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

The Dance of Dragons.

329
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,356
What's it about?

330
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:42,722
It's the story of the fight

331
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:44,798
between Rhaenyra Targaryen
and her half-brotherAegon

332
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:47,083
for control of the Seven Kingdoms.

333
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:49,966
Both of them thought
they belonged on the Iron Throne.

334
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:53,207
When people started declaring
for one of them or the other,

335
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:55,324
their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

336
00:28:55,396 --> 00:28:58,798
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

337
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:04,561
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

338
00:29:04,636 --> 00:29:07,401
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

339
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,197
They never truly recovered.

340
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:12,324
The Dance of Dragons.

341
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,238
Why is that a dance?

342
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:18,159
It's just what they call it.

343
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:19,840
Hmm. Doesn't make much sense.

344
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,805
I think it's poetic.

345
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:31,327
If you'd had to choose

346
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:34,559
between Rhaenyra and Aegon,

347
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:37,722
who would you have chosen?

348
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:40,762
I wouldn't have chosen either.

349
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:43,442
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

350
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,757
Sometimes a person has to choose.

351
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:51,119
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

352
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:55,966
If a man knows what he is

353
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,206
and remains true to himself,

354
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:05,923
the choice is no choice at all.

355
00:30:06,476 --> 00:30:08,956
He must fulfill his destiny

356
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:14,638
and become who he is meant to be.

357
00:30:17,036 --> 00:30:19,198
However much he may hate it.

358
