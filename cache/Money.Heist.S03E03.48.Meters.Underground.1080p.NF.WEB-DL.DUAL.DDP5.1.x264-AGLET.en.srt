{\an8}Code red. Seal the doors<i> </i>of the bank.

Even if sealed,

43
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,916
{\an8}it's a huge building, Professor.

44
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,125
{\an8}Many windows, few men.

45
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,875
{\an8}We can't defend it all.

46
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,375
{\an8}Good point, Helsinki.

47
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,416
{\an8}Very good point, but you see,

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
{\an8}this building

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,333
{\an8}has tricks.

50
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,416
{\an8}This is the part of the Bank of Spain
we're focused on.

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,541
{\an8}Its entire structure
is reinforced with concrete walls

52
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,541
{\an8}and steel sheets
that measure 180 centimeters thick.

53
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,500
{\an8}From the outside,

54
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,000
{\an8}it's basically a giant safe.

55
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,541
And from the inside, it's impenetrable.

56
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,500
Once code red has been activated, no one…

57
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,541
no one will be allowed in
or out for one hour.

58
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:58,125
That's the time we have to get our hands
on a piece that's absolutely crucial

59
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,541
for stage two of the plan.

60
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,333
What piece?

61
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,750
The governor of the Bank of Spain

62
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,291
will be in his office

63
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,208
surrounded by his five personal bodyguards

64
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,541
who won't exactly have a sense of humor.

65
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,625
It's much like a spooky Carnival ride.

66
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,583
<i>Everyone can sense something is</i>

67
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,333
<i>gonna jump out at them but</i>

68
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,500
nobody knows when and where
it's gonna happen.

69
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,291
Excuse me, Governor,
my name is Lieutenant Lorenzo.

70
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,208
You need to come with us.

71
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,125
We have an armored car
ready to evacuate you.

72
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,041
Thank you.

73
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,375
At this moment, I'm not leaving my office.

74
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,625
Sir.

75
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,666
It's an order from General Salas Núñez.

76
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,000
It's from the JEMAD.

77
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,875
No, I received the order,
but I'm not following it.

78
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:56,250
I'll not leave the Bank until
the last of the employees have left.

79
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,875
So, if you want is to escort me,

80
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,125
you'll just have to sit back and wait.

81
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,916
Want some coffee?

82
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,041
Amanda, if you would.

83
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,500
Come in, come in.

84
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,125
<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>I wondered what Nairobi was thinking.</i>

85
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,333
<i>I only had one thought in my mind,</i>

86
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,750
<i>draw my gun and start shooting.</i>

87
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,791
Relax.

88
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,208
Take a seat.

89
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,583
May I ask which regiment you belong to?

90
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,208
We belong to the paratroopers.

91
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,416
The BRIPAC.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,916
Brigade six.

93
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,333
Mm.

94
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,250
We've cleared mines in Mali, Lebanon,

95
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,166
Afghanistan.

96
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,958
<i>There were five bodyguards.</i>
<i>Nairobi and I had two guns.</i>

97
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,541
<i>So, we could incapacitate two men each.</i>

98
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,750
<i>But one would be left standing.</i>

99
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,708
That's a dangerous job.

100
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,625
- Mm-hmm.
- By the way…

101
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,125
How do you deactivate a live mine?

102
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,958
It depends.

103
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,125
With mines, there are several
different types and they…

104
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,291
they each have different mechanisms.

105
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,916
There's the Green Parrots,
the Butterflies, the PMF1…

106
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,208
Some are set off using methods

107
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,041
that would defuse others.

108
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,625
Some explode when detecting movement.

109
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,291
Others explode when…

110
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,000
when you open them.

111
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,958
There are some that explode even when
you get a little too close to them.

112
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,208
May I use the bathroom?

113
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,916
Of course. You can use mine.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,875
Excuse me.

115
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,375
Amanda, please.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,833
Over there.

117
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,916
But the worst are the Russian ones.

118
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,125
<i>The Professor had prepared us</i>
<i>for every eventuality.</i>

119
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,166
<i>But let's be honest.</i>

120
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,958
<i>It was one thing in theory</i>

121
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,083
<i>and another in practice.</i>

122
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,541
Let's go!

123
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,208
Let's go! Let's go!

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,208
You're safe in here.

125
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,708
There's nothing to worry about
among writers and poets, right?

126
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,416
Stay calm.

127
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:55,833
Rise your hands.

128
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,041
Like you're in a robbery.

129
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:05,958
Come on.

130
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,208
Good.

131
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:09,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

132
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,291
my name is Palermo.

133
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,500
And I have two pieces of news for you.

134
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,375
One good, one bad.

135
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,416
The bad news is that the Bank of Spain
is under attack.

136
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,625
And the good news…

137
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,583
…is that we're the ones
attacking you, muchachos.

138
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,750
Get back, back!

139
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,416
Everyone, calm down!

140
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,333
Everyone, calm down!

141
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,333
Stay calm!

142
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,166
VP13.

143
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,125
VP13?

144
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,875
There's an electronic deployment system

145
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,541
which works via seismic sensor control.

146
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,000
Touch one

147
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,125
and you take it up your ass.

148
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,416
Afghanistan was full of them.

149
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,541
I see they trained you well.

150
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,791
Wait, don't move, sir.

151
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,875
Are you all right, Lieutenant?

152
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,583
Lieutenant!

153
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,875
Boo!

154
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,708
Mr. Governor,

155
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,125
now you have to come with us.

156
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,208
Get up.

157
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:07,875
With me.

158
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,791
What are you doing?

159
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,625
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

160
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Don't move.

161
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,458
Drop your weapon.

162
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,041
Put the guns down.

163
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,541
Drop your weapon. Now!

164
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,291
Well…

165
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,875
It seems like the two of us
have reached a stalemate.

166
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,750
Why don't you put your gun down?

167
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,333
What the fuck makes you think
this is a stalemate?

168
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,208
You won't shoot the governor,

169
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,458
but I'll put a bullet
in this bitch's head.

170
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,625
That's right.

171
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,333
Gandía!

172
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,375
Let go of the girl.

173
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,583
Calm down, Amanda. It's all right. Okay?

174
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,208
Everything's fine.

175
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,750
- Gandía, let go of the girl.
- No.

176
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,458
I don't want anyone harmed.
That's an order.

177
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,333
Let go the girl, Gandía!

178
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,791
I'm going with them.

179
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,958
I don't want you to do anything.

180
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:51,875
That's it.

181
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,958
I don't know what's your plan is.
There's no way you're getting out.

182
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,625
Then I guess we're not leaving.

183
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,166
Shit!

184
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,666
Fuck!

185
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,583
Holy shit!

186
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,583
Shit!

187
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,375
But what the fuck just happened?

188
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,333
What the fuck just happened? Shit!

189
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,541
- What are you doing?
- They're going down. We have to go up.

190
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,000
- We need to go down.
- What do you mean?

191
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,583
If we stay here, we're dead.
We need to go down.

192
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,458
We're all in, Tokyo style.

193
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,458
It's party time.

194
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,625
From now on, you're all part
of our wonderful family of hostages.

195
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,250
You'll enjoy some days
of total disconnection, hmm?

196
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,500
So take your masks
and put them on, please.

197
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,708
Put on your masks on, goddamn it! Move!

198
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,250
And so that nobody feels tempted
to play the hero,

199
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,166
you'll hand your cell phones
to my colleague, Denver.

200
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,916
Here's what we're gonna do.

201
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,708
Anyone here who has kids,
put up your hand.

202
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,666
All right.

203
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,875
We'll place a red tag on your phones

204
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,083
so you'll be able to call them once a day.

205
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,458
Why are you doing this, you moron?

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,541
Because I want to.
I'm the hostage coordinator.

207
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,416
Did you take a little course or something?

208
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,625
Are you papa of the year?

209
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,041
Everyone hand over your phones, now!

210
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,166
Oh, my God!
Grow a pair, Helsinki.

211
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,875
He's such a cutie. What's his real name?

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,333
You should ask his father.

213
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:13,875
Cincinnati.

214
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:14,958
No way!

215
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:15,875
It's the truth.

216
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,166
The love of my life

217
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,750
liked the name Cynthia
when she thought was a girl,

218
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,666
but…

219
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,333
We couldn't really tell from the scan.

220
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,541
- How come?
- I could only get the first one done.

221
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, where was that? Do you remember?

222
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,625
- Yeah.
- In a clinic in Sulawao.

223
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,583
- It was Sulawesi.
- Sulawesi.

224
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,708
- Sulawesi.
- Sulawao, Sulawesi…

225
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,958
It was like a grimy mechanic shop.

226
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,208
Oh my God!

227
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,666
We didn't return.

228
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,750
I had a bullet removed
in a tractor garage during the war.

229
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,166
- You never told me that, my love.
- I did.

230
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,250
- Where?
- In my ass. Wanna see?

231
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,500
- No…
- No!

232
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,708
No, show them your pet, Helsi.

233
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:51,666
- No.
- Your little pet.

234
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,625
Come on. Show them. Introduce them.

235
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,708
- Come on. Show us.
- We're family here.

236
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,291
All right. Ready?

237
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,750
- Hey, no, no, no.
- No!

238
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,875
No…

239
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,125
Fatty, want me to train your teddy bear?

240
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,125
I'm good at training animals. Understand?

241
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,625
- Did you want a girl or a boy, Mónica?
- Didn't really matter what we got.

242
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,291
You know, it didn't make a difference.
As parents you love it.

243
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,458
No matter what it is, am I right or no?

244
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,875
It's a boy.

245
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,416
A boy?

246
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,083
A boy?

247
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,083
It's a boy.

248
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,916
It's a boy!

249
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,125
A boy! A boy! It's a boy!

250
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,166
It's a boy! It's a boy!

251
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,083
It's a boy! It's a boy!

252
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,500
It's a boy!

253
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,750
It's a boy!

254
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,166
A boy! A boy!

255
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,750
It's a boy.

256
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,416
I thought something happened
to the kid. Damn.

257
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,333
It's a boy!

258
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,541
The whole town hear him yelling
"It's a boy! It's a boy!"

259
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,666
That's right! So, it went from Cynthia…

260
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:32,916
Cinthy…

261
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,458
Cincy-nati. Cincinnati.

262
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,416
Sure, that's logical.

263
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,583
It was logical. It makes sense
because he's named after a city.

264
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,500
Just like the family.

265
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:42,916
This family.

266
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,625
Cincinnati.

267
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,375
You know?

268
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,958
A boy.

269
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,625
It's a boy. A boy.

270
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,041
A beautiful boy.

271
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,625
To Cincinnati.

272
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,666
Cheers.

273
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,958
Cheers.

274
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,791
Look, friends.

275
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,333
I wanna thank you
for everything you guys are doing.

276
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,833
On behalf of Rio and me.

277
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,791
- Thank you.
- To Rio.

278
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,041
To Rio.

279
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,041
- Cheers.
- <i>Salud.</i>

280
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,500
Tokyo, we're doing all this for you but…

281
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,708
for all of us as well.

282
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,916
Right now, they're convinced
they can't lose.

283
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,333
Chasing us like dogs,
forcing us out of our holes…

284
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,458
Torturing us and violating
our human rights. They don't care.

285
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,541
Doesn't matter if we hide like rats,

286
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,458
they'll come after us again.

287
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,791
One by one.

288
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,250
There's only one way out.

289
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,083
We have to face them.

290
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,541
Listen.

291
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,541
In this world…

292
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,500
everything is governed by balance.

293
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,416
There's…

294
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,666
what you stand to gain

295
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,583
and what you stand to lose.
At this moment…

296
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,041
they think they have nothing to lose.

297
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,791
And when you believe
you've got nothing to lose,

298
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,166
you're overconfident.

299
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,250
Good.

300
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,541
We'll be the ones

301
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,208
that are going to show them…

302
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,583
just how much

303
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,666
they have to lose.

304
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,125
Where's the governor?

305
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,750
Where is he?

306
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,666
Palermo!

307
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,541
We have a big problem.

308
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,708
Tokyo.

309
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,333
Easy, easy.

310
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,625
- Tokyo.
- Calm down, calm down. Calm down.

311
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,708
On three, shoot and drop to the ground.

312
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,583
One…

313
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,958
Two…

314
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,750
Drop your weapons, you rats!

315
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,708
Gentlemen, let me introduce myself.

316
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,291
My name's Palermo
and I'm in charge of this heist.

317
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,875
So, please, turn your guns on me.
I'm your most prized target.

318
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,958
On her!

319
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,041
Stay on her.

320
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:56,958
Good.

321
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,833
It seems we've got a few seconds left
before it starts,

322
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,583
so let's have a chat about anatomy,
what do you think?

323
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,208
A human being has two eyes.

324
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,208
Which, unlike a chameleon's,

325
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,583
are fixed and found
at the front of the face.

326
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,250
That leaves you with quite some handicap
in the event of a shoot-out.

327
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,416
Don't you think?

328
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,291
Shoot and your girls will be dead.

329
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,541
I'm talking to you, Gandía.

330
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,333
I know you spend
every Sunday at the shooting range,

331
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,041
that you buy gun magazines.

332
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,125
Your whole fucking life
you've been waiting for this moment

333
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,083
to become a hero.

334
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,375
Let me recommend something.

335
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,416
Think carefully about Marisa,

336
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,916
picture your son Juanito's angelic face

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,083
and put down the gun, you son of a bitch.

338
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,666
Fine.

339
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,833
Okay.

340
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,333
Fine.

341
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,291
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>the Professor realized</i>

342
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,625
<i>that this heist was very different</i>
<i>from the one at the Royal Mint.</i>

343
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,791
<i>This one didn't come from his head</i>

344
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,250
<i>and he didn't have enough time</i>
<i>to make it his own.</i>

345
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,333
<i>If he'd had a rewind button,</i>
<i>he would have pressed it in an instant.</i>

346
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,458
<i>But he didn't have one.</i>

347
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,166
Tokyo, are you okay?

348
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,375
Say something! Are you okay?

349
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,833
Go help Palermo!

350
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,375
<i>We unloaded ammo on their vests,</i>

00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,333

366
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,666
Everyone up against the wall!

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,333

370
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:15,916
Move!

371
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,041
- Almost.
- We're almost there.

372
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,875
All right, stay calm. Calm down.

373
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,000
- Painkillers!
- Painkillers!

374
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,791
Calm down, Palermo.
I'm gonna take this off. Nice and slow.

375
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,083
Nice and slow.

376
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,125
Carefully. Very good.

377
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:39,291
Great, that's good.
Now open your eyes real slow.

378
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,291
There we go.

379
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:41,916
Come on.

380
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,208
Very good.

381
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,416
I can't keep my eyes open for long.
I can't.

382
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,583
Can you see?

383
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,750
I can't fucking see shit.
What's happening?

384
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,166
Oh, fuck.

385
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,625
Okay. Okay.

386
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,583
Do you see the light?

387
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,625
Like the floodlights at Maracanã Stadium.
Does it make a difference?

388
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,625
You an eye specialist now, Tokyo?

389
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,375
Tokyo, he needs an eye doctor.

390
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,875
- Let's call the Professor.
- Yeah.

391
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,000
I can see the glass.

392
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,958
Stockholm, first aid kit number four.
The surgical one.

393
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,875
- Right now!
- Go, go, go.

394
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,958
What's on your mind, Tokyo?

395
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:16,875
I'm gonna get it out.

396
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,833
- How do you plan to do that?
- With tweezers.

397
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,500
I wouldn't mess with that, Tokyo.

398
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,083
Let's call the Professor,
release three hostages

399
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,416
and get him a specialist.

400
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,416
- Denver. Shut the fuck up and leave!
- Okay.

401
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,875
Listen to me, Palermo.

402
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,750
My hand's steadier
than a fucking Swiss' watch, okay?

403
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,791
Now, I'm gonna get that glass out.

404
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,750
Do you know why
a laser is used for eye surgery?

405
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,750
- Yes.
- Just a tiny detail.

406
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:42,833
The precision. It requires extreme
precision to perform surgery on the eye.

407
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,250
Come look at this, Denver.

408
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,791
Ms. Tokyo here wants to use
the very same tweezers

409
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,625
she uses to trim her think bush.

410
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,000
Jesus Christ!

411
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,708
This is ridiculous!

412
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,708
I dare you to say that again.

413
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:55,625
Say it again.

414
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,583
What was that?

415
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:03,583
I'm sure you're right, the hair
in your bush is very silky and smooth.

416
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:08,958
Say, "I'll never mention
my colleagues' fucking pussies again."

417
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,916
I will never mention
my colleagues' pussies again.

418
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,166
I don't hear you.

419
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,541
I said I'll never mention
your pussy again, bitch.

420
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,166
That's fucking great, Palermo.

421
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,583
We're at your service.

422
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,625
Good. We'll deal with my eyes later.

423
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:24,375
- Denver, on my right.
- Yeah, what's up?

424
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:27,541
Give me your arm.
You're going to be my lieutenant, okay?

425
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,041
- I'm gonna be your guide dog now?
- Be quiet!

426
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,916
- Tokyo!
- Yes.

427
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,041
We're sitting on 14 tons of steel below.
Tell me Nairobi is with Bogotá.

428
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:36,958
She is.

429
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,458
Come on!

430
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,833
Listen to me. Is this your big plan?

431
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,583
You going to tie us up
and treat us like dogs?

432
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,500
No, my dear.

433
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:49,958
We're all family in here. If you need help
taking a piss, let me know.

434
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,666
I'm gonna kill you.

435
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,625
Governor, if I may.

436
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,375
Get out of here. Move!

437
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:02,500
See this? I'm gonna hold onto it for you.

438
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,291
May I have your attention, please?

439
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:08,750
We've placed 460 kilograms of explosives

440
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,666
in the windows and in all the doors,
at every entrance and in all of the exits.

441
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,500
So, if anyone tries to escape…

442
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,375
Boom!

443
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,416
They'll escape, but in pieces.

444
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:22,583
It's not worth the trouble.

445
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:27,958
Unfortunately, we're all shacked up in
here together for a few days, all right?

446
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,458
But during this time

447
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:32,750
all of you

448
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,250
will have our protection.

449
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,375
And in return,
you are going to protect all of us.

450
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,333
Marvelous.

451
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,583
And now, whenever you like,
you may all take off your masks.

452
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,125
Now!

453
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,250
Hey there!

454
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:53,958
How is it going?

455
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:57,291
Now that we can all see
each other's beautiful faces,

456
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,416
let me introduce Mr. Bogotá.

457
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,541
He'll be picking four volunteers.

458
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:06,708
My name is Bogotá.
I came to do the hard part of the job.

459
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,375
We'll be working at 65 degrees Celsius.

460
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:13,041
That's essentially a fucking crematorium.

461
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:17,166
We're doing shifts
of 12, 14, 16 or 24 hours.

462
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,625
Whatever you can handle.

463
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,458
So, who's in?

464
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:34,416
Name!

465
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,166
Agustín.

466
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,791
- Agustín Montero.
- Why are you here?

467
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:39,708
I came

468
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:41,583
to exchange money.

469
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:46,250
Congratulations. Step forward, sir.
Our first volunteer.

470
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,041
Next up.

471
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,416
Miguel Fernández Talanilla
from Totana, Murcia.

472
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,583
Very good.

473
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:54,583
- What do you do, Miguel?
- I work here in system operations.

474
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,500
I mean, IT.

475
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,291
- Unqualified.
- Unqualified. Okay, next!

476
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,916
Name and why are you here?

477
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:04,833
Alfonso.

478
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,333
I have… I had an appointment
with the debt department.

479
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,750
Step forward. Congratulations,
you are our second volunteer. And next!

480
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,416
Name. Why are you here?

481
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,875
Amanda. I'm the governor's secretary.

482
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,416
Unqualified. Next up, come on!

483
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,333
Name!

484
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,166
Matías Caño.

485
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,916
Qualified! Come on, step forward.

486
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:26,458
No, ma'am.

487
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:29,875
Don't call me "ma'am." I'm not a ma'am.
Step forward. You're volunteering.

488
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,875
I'm no volunteer.

489
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,375
Look at me. Do you see this finger?

490
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:38,583
This is the finger
that points out the volunteers

491
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:41,916
and it keeps pointing at you
over and over and over again.

492
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,083
So do me a favor, step forward
because you're a volunteer.

493
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,041
Listen, woman, I'm no volunteer.

494
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:52,208
- What did you say your name was?
- Matías Caño.

495
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,125
What?

496
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,416
Matías Caño.

497
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,875
Very well, Matías Caño.

498
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,500
You're coming with me right fucking now.

499
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,000
Let's go.

500
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,125
Let's go!

501
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,416
To the elevator.

502
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,291
Stay there!

503
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:19,125
Get in!

504
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,500
What was that?

505
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,541
Are you an idiot?

506
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,125
What was shit about not being a volunteer?

507
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,500
I thought I'd make it believable.

508
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,375
"Believable"? You think
you're fucking Anthony Hopkins?

509
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,416
I had to act like a hostage.

510
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,708
Are you fucking kidding?

511
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:45,666
From the producers of "My balls," coming
to a theater near you, "Blacksmith Actor"?

512
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,166
I thought I did a good job.
It was really fluid.

513
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,958
I'll make fluid come out of you…

514
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,166
Six years!

515
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,250
Six years working with this guy

516
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:59,791
and I always have this urge
to slam his head into a goddamn wall.

517
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:29,833
Listen up, guys.

518
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,250
We're playing hardball now.

519
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,083
And your balls are on the line.

520
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:42,750
Sergio!

521
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:45,208
The CNI has arrived.

522
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:18,958
Tap them.

523
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,916
Colonel Tamayo.

524
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,833
Inspector.

525
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,625
- When was the explosion?
- 12:04.

526
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:28,500
Then we heard a shootout.
They've placed explosives everywhere.

527
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,291
- How were the charges detonated?
- We're still not sure.

528
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,500
Plastic explosive. RDX. Expertly made.

529
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,166
- It's a decoy.
- No, it doesn't look like it, Colonel.

530
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,833
There's explosives at the front,
the roof, inside, on the windows…

531
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,250
I've studied them.
They won't blow up the Bank of Spain.

532
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,000
With all due respect,
these people are capable of anything.

533
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:48,250
I could go out there and take a piss
and nothing would happen.

534
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,958
- Listen to me, Colonel.
- Please!

535
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,541
Alfonso.

536
00:31:58,916 --> 00:31:59,958
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

537
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,916
<i>I'm absolutely fucked, Luis.</i>

538
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:03,750
Can't do it.

539
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,208
I'm sorry. You take over.

540
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,333
Don't worry about it.

541
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,083
Go and rest.

542
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,291
Luis.

543
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:17,958
Call her.

544
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,250
I sent her to interrogate Aníbal Cortés.

545
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,000
Call her.

546
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:36,958
Everyone,

547
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,625
we know each other already.

548
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,708
I'm Colonel Tamayo from Intelligence.
I'm taking over this operation.

549
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,166
First of all,
I want the queen of all bitches here now.

550
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,000
Call Alicia Sierra.

551
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:48,375
<i>Get her on the phone now.</i>

552
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,875
Come on, back to work.
Get me Inspector Sierra right now.

553
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:57,833
It's her.

554
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:04,250
Inspector Sierra, there's a call for you
from Colonel Tamayo.

555
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,291
- Talk to me.
- <i>Alicia, it's Tamayo.</i>

556
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,791
<i>Did you get anything out of him?</i>

557
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,958
Nothing that can help us, Luis.

558
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,416
Send him back to his mommy,
she'll make him some soup.

559
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,583
<i>He's worn out</i>
<i>from all the chitchat and all the drugs.</i>

560
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,416
Put him on a plane
and bring him to Madrid.

561
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,083
You've got work to do here.

562
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,125
Bring me on board, Luis.

563
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:36,166
Tell me you want me
to force that fucking shepherd

564
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,791
and his flock out of the bank.

565
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,208
Exactly.

566
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:41,791
Fuck me.

567
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,416
I'm so happy my water's gonna break.

568
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:59,166
I hate I have to tell you this

569
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,083
in front of all this beauty.

570
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,208
I have to confess
something a bit unpleasant.

571
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,875
I have the same illness as mother.

572
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,625
How long?

573
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:31,750
Three years.

574
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:38,250
At least that.
You know how pessimistic doctors are.

575
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,500
It'll end up being six

576
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,041
or nine.

577
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,625
Like the lives of a stray cat.

578
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,583
Andrés. Andrés.

579
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:04,208
We'll call the whole thing off
and go abroad to find treatment.

580
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,791
First of all, there's no cure.

581
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,750
Second of all,
I'll have a much better time stealing.

582
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:13,375
Do you really want to spend your
little time you have left in jail?

583
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,166
If a painter told you
he had three years left to live,

584
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,208
would you tell him to stop painting?

585
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,666
Andrés, please…

586
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,583
Look.

587
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:28,500
Would you have told Michelangelo
to stop sculpting <i>David?</i>

588
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,083
No. No, of course not.

589
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:34,708
You would have said,
"<i>Forza, </i>Michelangelo!"

590
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:37,958
"Continue doing your passion."

591
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,333
Painter? Poet? Same thing.

592
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:43,916
"Gentlemen…

593
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,208
continue your quest for beauty."

594
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,208
This heist, Sergio…

595
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,291
is a tribute to beauty.

596
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,041
It'll be our masterpiece.

597
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,708
Sixteen minutes

598
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,875
and 15 seconds.

599
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,083
Sixteen minutes

600
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,000
and 15 seconds.

601
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,083
That's all we got.

602
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:23,208
From the moment you touch this door,

603
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:25,416
this vault will begin to flood with water.

604
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,250
Sixteen minutes and 15 seconds.

605
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,083
Until all that water reaches here.

606
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,750
Either we make a hole

607
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:39,208
and weld the interconnecting tube
in that time,

608
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,125
or else

609
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,291
we all end up in prison

610
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,708
for nothing.

611
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,833
For breaking a door.

612
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,625
But that…

613
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,375
That's not gonna happen.

614
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,458
No, no, no. Not to us.

615
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,791
Why is that not going to happen to us?
Because… Bogotá.

616
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,000
What are we?

617
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,125
The fucking bosses.

618
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,750
What are we?

619
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:07,875
The fucking bosses.

620
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:11,666
No, no, no… That's no good.

621
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,291
That's not gonna melt
through a 14-ton door.

622
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:16,458
So, again. What are we?

623
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:18,125
The fucking bosses!

624
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,541
What are we?

625
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:20,750
The fucking bosses!

626
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,291
What are we?!

627
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,625
The fucking bosses!

628
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,916
Now we're talking! Raise your lances!

629
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,000
What you see before you is not a door.

630
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,875
It's just fucking butter.

631
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,708
And all of you…

632
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,208
…you're gonna melt right through it.

633
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,666
Burnt butter! Positions!

634
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,625
Come on, Sergio.

635
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,125
It's not so bad. Imagine it.

636
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:55,041
Imagine it. You're good at that.

637
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,416
Set out on a journey with me, hmm?

638
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:02,375
It's a 14-ton steel door.

639
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,041
And in front of it,

640
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,458
the best blacksmiths in the world.

641
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,708
Ready?

642
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,500
And now!

643
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,500
When we touch that door,
the vault will flood with water.

644
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,250
7,500 liters per minute.

645
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:38,000
- Ticktock, ticktock!
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!

646
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,500
Don't stop!

647
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:42,375
<i>Once it's full,</i>

648
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,333
you'd be crushed

649
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,583
if you opened the door.

650
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,958
But we're not going to open that door.

651
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,833
Exactly.

652
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,250
We're just going to penetrate it.

653
00:38:57,666 --> 00:39:00,583
Bring the ram! Move, move, move!

654
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,625
Now!

655
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:16,833
The tube!

656
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:19,666
Come on! Go forward, go forward.

657
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,250
In the 16 minutes

658
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:24,250
that it'll take for the vault to fill up,
we'll play…

659
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,875
…Jacques-Yves

660
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,000
Cousteau.

661
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,541
One, two, three.

662
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,458
Push! Go, go, go!

663
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,750
Go, go, go!

664
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,083
Go!

665
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,166
The door stays closed
and the welder enters.

666
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:51,458
Here.

667
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,208
Okay, okay. We're ready.

668
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,083
It's all up to you.

669
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,791
The oxygen first.
Put on the oxygen first.

670
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,916
- I've got time.
- What?

671
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,291
- I've got time!
- Are you kidding? The oxygen! Bogotá!

672
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:29,083
Why, God damn it, why?
There always has to be a fucking hero.

673
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:31,750
The fucking hero
showing off his big fucking balls.

674
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:36,250
And in there, the water's rising
and rising and rising by the minute,

675
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,291
so begins the real fantasy
of the new millennium,

676
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,750
to weld from both sides

677
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,791
a small antechamber, fully interconnected.

678
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,375
With the water rising every minute,

679
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,875
don't you think this is better
than a James Bond movie?

680
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:01,625
Not even James Bond could weld that
chamber in such a short amount of time.

681
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:02,541
Exactly!

682
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:05,958
That's why we'll hire
the best welder in the entire world.

683
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:14,791
If the water reaches the welded joint
and it's not perfectly sealed…

684
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,250
the water will push through the cracks
with such forces

685
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:25,250
we'd need several days
to get that man out.

686
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:27,583
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he'd be dead!

687
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:29,875
He'd be dead!

688
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:34,166
But what job comes without risks, huh?

689
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,625
Go, go, go!

690
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,291
No time to waste!

691
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,916
Look, little brother, hey,
let's not think about that right now.

692
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,791
Come on! One more minute!

693
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,583
Just give me one more minute!
One more damn minute.

694
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,250
Tell me.
Who could ever conceive such a plan?

695
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:09,750
Who?

696
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:21,541
I'm going in!

697
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,791
An antechamber fully interconnected…

698
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,750
like a bathyscaphe.

699
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,458
And then,

700
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:45,250
sweet brother of my den, come the bubbles.

701
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:54,375
You used to love
documentaries about the ocean.

702
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,916
Now, here's your childhood dream
come true.

703
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,416
Watching the flotation level out.

704
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:13,000
You're alive!

705
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:15,958
You turn around…

706
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,125
<i>and see how the bubbles are rising…</i>

707
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:25,958
they are splendid.

708
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:30,291
Perfection sliding through
the golden bricks,

709
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,666
until they crash against the roof.

710
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,875
You feel like you're in a space station.

711
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:55,375
But no.

712
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:08,583
You're in the vault of the Bank of Spain.

713
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:16,166
There… floating…

714
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:25,583
It'll be like swimming
through a sunken galleon

715
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,500
with 90 tons of 24-karat gold.

716
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:31,708
What do you think?

717
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,666
It's the most beautiful thing
I've heard in my life.

718
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:48,833
I knew it.

719

I'm back and I brought a present.

738
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:22,833
I found these cute little earrings.
What do you think?

739
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:25,791
Think I can pull them off?
Look at this bling!

740

That's right! Dance!
