1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,561
<i>Oh, there's a woman.</i>

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,361
Yeah.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,801
A woman.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,411
Who I love.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,005
And I got close.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,329
In the bleak midwinter...

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,368
At some point in the near future,

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,761
Mr Churchill will want to speak to you
in person.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,686
Mr Shelby,

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,565
he has a job for you.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,440
We will be in touch.

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,850
Oh, thank you.

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,365
I'm going to take him.

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,290
Some of us know the words.

15
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,845
Trot on.

16
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,891
Trot on.

17
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,681
Trot on.

18
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,009
Here come the fucking cavalry.
Late as usual.

19
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,004
Dearly beloved.

20
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,449
We are gathered here today
to join together in holy matrimony

21
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,851
Thomas Michael Shelby
and Grace Helen Burgess.

22
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,050
Those flowers need to go there.

23
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,043
<i>Do you, Thomas Michael Shelby,</i>

24
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,889
take Grace Helen Burgess
to be your lawful wedded wife?

25
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,561
<i>I do.</i>

26
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,527
Do you, Grace Helen Burgess,

27
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,002
solemnly swear to love, honour,

28
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,527
<i>and obey till death do you part?</i>

29
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,647
<i>I do.</i>

30
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,963
<i>I now pronounce you
husband and wife.</i>

31
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,046
Get out of it!

32
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,526
Go on, take the photograph!

33
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,161
Tommy.

34
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,483
Arthur, get the bastards in the house.

35
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,282
I will. I will. John! John-Boy!
Get 'em in the house, all of 'em.

36
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,088
Go on, all of you! Back to the house!
Go on!

37
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,242
All right, Pol. Tell the Lee girls
I've counted all the paintings.

38
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,210
And, Pol, some people here
are not on the list.

39
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,642
Curly, Charlie. Kitchen.

40
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,688
- Time?
- Five minutes.

41
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,730
Actually, we were told on the train
there'd be cocaine.

42
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,371
Jeremiah, John-Boy, kitchen, let's go.

43
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,171
I swear to God them fucking Cavalry boys
are asking for it.

44
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,449
Uh, I was told to ask someone young.
Will there be cocaine?

45
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,967
Sweetheart, I am young, informed
and, uh, very well-equipped.

46
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,485
You chose your man wisely.

47
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,329
Come on, kitchen now.

48
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,289
Arthur, this lady
wants to play in the snow.

49
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,886
No, no snow today. No snow today.

50
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,730
<i>Kitchen, come on.</i>

51
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,162
I just wish Tommy was here.

52
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,440
- Where are they?
- I don't know, Tommy.

53
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,856
- Arthur, John, where are they?
- I don't know.

54
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,690
- I am telling you now, we got lost.
- Come on.

55
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,525
You really need to do a map.

56
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,040
Right, boys, you're all here.

57
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,684
Today, this is my fucking wedding day.

58
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,206
Yeah, and you said
there'd be no bloody uniforms.

59
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,886
Nevertheless... Nevertheless, John...

60
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,247
Despite the bad blood,

61
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,129
I'll have none of it on my carpet.

62
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,204
Now for Grace's sake,
nothing will go wrong.

63
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,921
Those bastards out there are her family.

64
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,403
And if you fuckers do anything
to embarrass her,

65
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,964
your kin, your cousins, your horses,
your fucking kids, you do anything...

66
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,724
- Tom?
- To... What?

67
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,801
What about snow?

68
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,567
Yeah, their women are sports,
I'll say that...

69
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,563
No. No. No.

70
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,041
No cocaine.

71
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,328
No cocaine. No sport.

72
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,767
No telling fortunes. No racing.

73
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,731
No fucking sucking petrol
out of their fucking cars.

74
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,642
And, you, Charlie,
stop spinning yarns about me, eh?

75
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,768
I'm just trying to sell you
to them, Tom.

76
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,561
But the main thing is,

77
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,765
you bunch of fuckers,

78
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,164
despite the provocation
from the cavalry,

79
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,086
no fighting.

80
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,281
Oi!

81
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,086
No fighting.

82
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,286
No fucking fighting.

83
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,961
No fighting.

84
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,447
No fucking fighting!

85
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,201
Good.

86
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,881
Get the fuck off me!

87
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,291
You're needed downstairs.

88
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,124
Grace, you're needed downstairs.

89
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,406
People are hungry.

90
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,242
I was putting Charles to sleep.

91
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,842
I'll come down,
but not with you like this.

92
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,046
All right, fine.

93
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,281
Tommy.

94
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,084
I thought today was the reason
for the way you've been acting lately.

95
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,447
I know there's business on your mind.

96
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,088
- And I know there always will be.
- Yeah.

97
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,640
Look, I am sorry
that they wore their uniforms.

98
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,564
Yeah, they fucking did, eh.
They fucking did.

99
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,324
But I can tell it's more than that.

100
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,648
You've been like this for weeks.

101
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,561
I need you to tell me

102
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,322
that it's business making you like this.

103
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,323
And not regret over me.

104
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,240
Say it out loud
and I'll know if it's true.

105
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,565
It's business, Grace.

106
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,448
And bad, bad business it is, all around.

107
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,850
And I'm scared, Grace.

108
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,765
I'm scared for you.

109
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,410
I'm scared for the baby.

110
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,096
And this is how I am when I'm scared.

111
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,248
It is unfamiliar to you, but not to me.

112
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,167
I can... I can fucking be scared
and carry on.

113
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,130
And it's not pleasant to look at
and no joy to be around.

114
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,165
All right?

115
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,402
I'm sorry.

116
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,442
We just made vows to share everything.

117
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,002
Tell me what it is you're afraid of.

118
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,207
Stand up. Stand up, stand up.

119
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,081
Arthur's speech.

120
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,324
I'm scared of fucking Arthur's speech.

121
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,926
All right?

122
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,571
Me, too.

123
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,969
Tommy, what are you doing?

124
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,087
Tommy.

125
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,051
There's half the British Army
waiting for us downstairs.

126
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,929
They're King's Irish.
We waited two weeks in the mud for them.

127
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,488
Tommy.

128
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,245
There are things, that if I take them
off, I won't be able to put back on...

129
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,288
That's good.

130
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,170
Hello, Mrs Shelby.

131
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,204
I'm sorry for being busy in my head.

132
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,203
Now let's complete the ceremony.

133
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,169
Hey, listen. Listen, listen.

134
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,562
What do you call an animal
with a prick halfway up its back?

135
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,487
A cavalry horse.

136
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,730
He got... He gets it.

137
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,283
Fuck it. Fuck it.

138
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,522
Where the bloody hell are they?

139
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,410
You're best man, Arthur.
Go and find them.

140
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,481
Yeah.

141
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,290
That's completely nonsense.

142
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,409
You know, we're part of a serious
political movement and organisation.

143
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,802
They're not "secret little meetings,"
they're just meetings.

144
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,008
We talk about the world,
about the people in it,

145
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,970
about our current political landscape
and what's going on.

146
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,600
You know, we really need to re-evaluate
the way our government...

147
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,486
- He's strange.
- He's looking over.

148
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,561
What?

149
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,848
He's coming. He bloody is.

150
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,928
Fuck. It's the wrong one.

151
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,336
What do you mean "the wrong one"?
How many are there?

152
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,964
There's two, giving me the eye.

153
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,008
I prefer the other one.
He looks harmless.

154
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,604
It must be that bloody lipstick
Tommy brought you back from New York.

155
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,691
I couldn't help noticing
you are unaccompanied.

156
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,321
I also am alone. May I join you?

157
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,206
- Tommy?
- Oh.

158
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,646
Didn't see a thing. Did not see a thing.
Sorry, brother.

159
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,125
I need you downstairs.

160
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,210
It's all right. We're done.

161
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,486
- You good?
- Yeah.

162
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,925
- Never been better.
- Yeah?

163
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,604
- Are you drunk?
- Huh? No.

164
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,401
No.

165
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,361
Here.

166
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,768
All right, it's just one drink, then.

167
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,089
Linda's a good woman, Arthur.

168
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,881
Good whisky.

169
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,687
A good man needs to
hold out sometimes, eh?

170
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,209
So, uh, do I mention this
in my speech, then, eh?

171
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,806
Not unless you want to get cut, Arthur.

172
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,211
Sorry, sister.

173
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,811
Right. Look.

174
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,488
Tell the maids
to break out the champagne.

175
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,925
We'll be down in a minute.

176
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,002
Champagne, yeah. OK.

177
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,207
- I got it right here. I'm ready.
- Good. Good.

178
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,090
Where are you from?

179
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,727
I'm a refugee.

180
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,441
From where?

181
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,240
Russia.

182
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,561
In the past few months,

183
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,450
Thomas has developed
some business interests with Russia.

184
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,528
I see he has confided in you.

185
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,967
Hmm.

186
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,566
You need his permission
to even speak to me.

187
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,851
My senior position
within the Shelby company

188
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,561
means I don't often have
to ask permission from anyone

189
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,051
to do anything.

190
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,484
So perhaps you'll just tell me

191
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,009
why the fuck you're talking Russian
business on Thomas's wedding day.

192
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,176
Hold on, wait a second. So
you're saying I'm not allowed a man...

193
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,531
It's about your choice of man.

194
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,816
I'm not allowed a man on my arm?

195
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,285
Thomas says
that they're the rules.

196
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,283
Fucking parish bastard!

197
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,761
Michael, speeches. Come on.

198
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,684
Arthur. You know
why he didn't come, don't you?

199
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,125
Why who didn't come?

200
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,611
My bloody man.

201
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,205
Oh, you mean the wop?

202
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,490
I just heard there was a fire
at his restaurant midnight last night.

203
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,006
And a smashed back window
and a smell of petrol.

204
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,211
Lizzie, we tried to talk some sense
into you.

205
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,006
We did checks on him.

206
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,056
He's had five different names
in the last six years,

207
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,776
and he's got connections
with the Naples boys.

208
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,801
Come on, Michael.

209
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,291
What do you know about love?

210
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,169
About when lightning strikes.

211
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,006
So, it was lightning, hmm? Not petrol.

212
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,416
I thought you were
off the whisky, Arthur.

213
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,886
Yeah, I am. Having a couple
now and again

214
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,480
to remind myself why I don't drink it.

215
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,444
You set fire to his restaurant
to stop him coming.

216
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,729
You have no right to choose
who I step out with in my own time!

217
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,487
Lizzie, you now have an important
position in this company.

218
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,609
You got the order, same as us.

219
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,409
You can do it.

220
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,248
Until further notice...

221
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,681
No fraternizing with the foreigners.

222
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,925
Yeah, well, you can tell Tommy from me

223
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,651
all the girls in the office think
he's losing his fucking mind!

224
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,691
To the bride.

225
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,966
The bride.

226
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,485
- The bride.
- The bride.

227
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,524
And now, according to tradition,

228
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,001
my best man will say a few words.

229
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,081
Go on! Here he goes! Go on, Arthur!

230
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,609
I'd like to, erm...
I'm not one for speeches.

231
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,921
- Sing, then!
- I will later, John.

232
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,926
But, er... I do, er.

233
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,685
I do have some words written down here

234
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,210
on this piece of paper.

235
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,401
This doesn't include everything
that I want to say.

236
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,608
Arthur, just, uh...
just read what we wrote down, eh?

237
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,963
- I will. I will.
- Mmm-hmm.

238
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,280
But...

239
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,644
First... First, uh, a few words from...
From the heart.

240
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,481
Um...

241
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,651
This man here, my brother Tommy,

242
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,010
helped me survive through
some of the worst times.

243
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,882
It's a wedding, Arthur, tell a joke.

244
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,121
Yeah, tell a joke.

245
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,041
What I am trying to say is that...

246
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,362
My brother
and the love of a good woman

247
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,842
pulled me through that time.

248
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,525
Now Tommy also
has the love of a good woman.

249
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,923
Her name's Grace.

250
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,721
Like the grace of the good Lord.

251
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,681
And even though

252
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,684
the circumstances of their union
was tragic...

253
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,047
All right. Let's, uh... Arthur.

254
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,168
Let's raise a toast, eh?

255
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,969
To, uh...

256
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,601
To love, to peace, to marriage.

257
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,409
- And to marriage.
- To marriage.

258
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,768
Well done, Arthur,
beautiful speech. Really nice.

259
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,886
Really, really nice.

260
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,002
Where is he fucking going?

261
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,086
- I think I messed it up.
- No, not a bit.

262
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,881
- Hmm.
- You spoke with such truth.

263
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,410
And God heard you.

264
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,085
Can I have a word
with my brother, please, Linda?

265
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,610
- What he was going to say was beautiful.
- Mmm-hmm.

266
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,731
Alone, please.

267
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,846
All right. Come here.

268
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,127
Come here.

269
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,802
We talked about this, Arthur.

270
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,689
That's why we wrote it all down.

271
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,691
Most of Grace's side don't even know
her husband killed himself.

272
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,966
They think it was an accident.

273
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,246
- Oh, I know.
- You know.

274
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,646
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

275
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,290
What do you think I am? Hmm?

276
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,928
What do you think I am, Tommy, eh?

277
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,450
- You think I'm a fucking idiot!
- All right, boys.

278
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,683
- Come on, have a good night.
- You think I would say it...

279
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,366
- Come on, then. That's it.
- You keep walking, you nosy bastards.

280
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,091
- Arthur.
- You stay away from me.

281
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,811
- Fuckin hell.
- You stay away from me. I've had enough.

282
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,441
Ah!

283
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,847
Shit.

284
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,249
Yeah. Yeah.

285
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,725
Ah, shit.

286
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,040
Three shots I've had. That's it.

287
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,770
- I know.
- I drew the line.

288
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,887
I know.

289
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,440
I know you've turned a corner, Arthur.

290
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,851
- Yeah.
- I know.

291
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,967
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

292
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,326
- I'm your best man.
- I know.

293
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,850
I wasn't going to tell no one.

294
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,126
It's all right.

295
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,888
It's done. Get up. Get up.

296
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,761
Get up.

297
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,086
Right.

298
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,130
The Russians have made contact.

299
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,847
We have to get used to
how these bastards operate.

300
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,441
For them,

301
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,921
family is a weakness,
and they go after them.

302
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,447
For me, family is my strength.
And there's business to be done.

303
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,329
And I need you.

304
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,641
Now, fuck speeches, fuck weddings.

305
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,481
You're my best man every fucking day.

306
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,610
- OK.
- Yeah.

307
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,731
Now go and get John, get him sobered up.

308
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,211
Find johnny Dogs.

309
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,681
It's the Russians
through the smoke tonight.

310
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,085
All right.

311
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,241
Good.

312
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,441
And, Arthur?

313
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,442
In future, it's not always right
to listen to Linda.

314
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,361
- Yeah? Yeah.
- Yeah.

315
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,009
It's full of gypsies and blacks.

316
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,209
Grace says he exports automobiles
to the colonies.

317
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,524
Pol, now.

318
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,811
So what does he say?

319
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,366
He won't meet you
unless you give us the name.

320
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,044
What name?

321
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,283
We were told to ask for a code name
when contact was made.

322
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,209
Constantine. The code is Constantine.

323
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,007
Tommy said no racing, no gambling.

324
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,730
Yeah, he's changed his mind.

325
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,007
- Right. Don't worry, Finn, OK?
- Right.

326
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,082
Cavalry boys ride like a sack of stones,
all right?

327
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,687
John. John, there's an awful lot
of King's shillings around here today.

328
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,127
Now, out of loyalty to the regiment,

329
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,282
they'll all be putting their money
on this bad boy

330
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,364
that I filled up
with morphine and water.

331
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,364
Here. Tommy's all right if I, uh,
do the book, is he?

332
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,843
He said betting's OK, but all proceeds
go to the Shelby Foundation charity.

333
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,002
Oh, is this charity of his
for real, then?

334
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,970
He says he wants to be seen
giving back to the poor of Birmingham.

335
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,644
So that'll be me, John.

336
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,166
Myself.
If I can't earn a shilling here tonight.

337
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,287
Huh?

338
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,647
They'll make him
the fucking Lord Mayor next.

339
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,529
Mmm, that's the idea, Charlie-Boy.

340
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,411
Fucking hell.

341
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,041
Right, all you lot
make as much noise and fuss as you can.

342
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,531
Especially fucking you.

343
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,256
So we're a fucking distraction, John,
is it?

344
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,327
Huh?

345
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,529
Tommy is doing business on a night
he should be just fucking.

346
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,607
Right, place your bets with me.

347
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,728
Your favourites. Your favourites.

348
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,847
Come on, boys.

349
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,402
'Cause I hope my boy Finn
doesn't fall off that fucking horse.

350
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,961
Come on.

351
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,041
For charity.

352
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,646
Shut up.

353
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,846
Oh, you found it.

354
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,686
We nearly gave up.

355
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,080
Did he tell you
what my business with him is?

356
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,524
The same shit the Turks used to smoke.

357
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,207
I wonder,

358
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,166
why does he trust his aunt
more than his brothers?

359
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,249
Go and watch the race, boys.

360
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,810
The Turk's clean.

361
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,124
I am Russian.

362
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,569
Same fucking thing.

363
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,681
So you make contact on my wedding day.

364
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,728
You now have very powerful enemies.

365
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,530
At the Soviet Embassy
and within your own government.

366
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,045
You are being watched,

367
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,091
at your house, your office, your clubs,

368
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,211
your bars.

369
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,090
You best be quick or I'll be missed.
Where's the money?

370
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,527
The Duke's niece
is bringing it from London.

371
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,329
I was told money on contact.

372
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,367
Ten thousand in US dollars.

373
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,564
My employer only trusts
members of his family with cash.

374
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,528
She will be at Snow Hill Station
at 10:00.

375
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,410
A woman alone in Birmingham
with $10,000 in cash.

376
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,242
- And she also has a revolver.
- Oh, I see.

377
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,924
I thought you trusted women.

378
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,923
I don't trust Birmingham.

379
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,729
I'll have her picked up.

380
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,167
- By who?
- By the police, pal.

381
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,246
This is our city.

382
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,522
Fucking beautiful horse, Tom.

383
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,327
Beautiful.

384
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,124
- He's a natural, that boy.
- Yeah.

385
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,407
Good posture. Rides like Dad.

386
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,527
All right, listen to me.

387
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,525
Tell Johnny Dogs and his boys
to light a fire in the woods,

388
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,364
a big one, to take meat.

389
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,363
And send Finn to watch the gates.

390
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,124
Moss is bringing someone.

391
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,601
You don't?

392
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,845
I just needed to bring you somewhere
nobody could see.

393
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,526
But your friend gave this to me.
He said you all did it.

394
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,606
Not me.

395
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,808
But it's all right. Go on.

396
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,485
I see you don't, either.

397
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,046
- Don't be silly, everyone does.
- So go on, then.

398
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,044
- Cut the snow.
- We call it Tokyo.

399
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,088
We call it whatever
the customer calls it.

400
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,202
In London,
we were told you are all gangsters.

401
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,809
So that's why you got on the train
to dirty, old Birmingham.

402
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,804
For a dirty, old night.

403
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,770
You don't look like the others.

404
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,171
That's the idea.

405
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,806
I put it all together,
but I don't partake.

406
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,084
You see, I've got a bright future,
you see.

407
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,960
Mapped out.

408
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,401
But you want me to be like them,
don't you?

409
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,611
There's a cavalry officer
stationed in Ceylon.

410
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,809
And when his tour of duty ends in March,
we'll be engaged.

411
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,082
So I have a bright future, too.

412
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,491
Mapped out.

413
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,448
But you want to try things first.

414
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,885
No. Keep it.

415
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,731
As if I were a whore.

416
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,891
Well, if that's the game
you want to play.

417
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,926
Polly.

418
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,801
Hello, Grace.

419
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,371
You look absolutely beautiful.

420
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,324
Welcome to the family.

421
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,769
Oh, I see. Tommy's orders.

422
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,000
No upsets tonight.

423
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,448
Your hair, everything, beautiful.

424
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,600
Do you know where he is?

425
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,125
Yes. Yes, I do.

426
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,766
You know, Tommy really wants to keep
certain things a secret from me.

427
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,243
It's very hard when you're man and wife.

428
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,451
We were late coming down
because we were having sex.

429
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,763
So afterwards, he told me everything.

430
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,884
Royalist Russians buying weapons
to fight the Bolsheviks in Georgia.

431
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,764
A lost cause, Tommy says.

432
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,526
And Churchill, he's the go-between.

433
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,286
But it's against government policy
so everything must be kept a secret.

434
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,006
You know it's begun?

435
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,408
They started the business tonight?

436
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,926
No.

437
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,126
I didn't.

438
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,843
But you just told me.

439
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,365
So, thank you.

440
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,240
Let's not forget
I used to do this for a living.

441
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,369
Oh, I haven't forgotten, sweetheart.

442
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,208
It's only Thomas that's forgotten
what you are.

443
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,328
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen.</i>

444
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,801
<i>The bride and the groom
will now dance alone.</i>

445
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,450
Polly just told me
there is business being done.

446
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,326
I didn't ask them to come.

447
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,211
Tommy, please don't let
anything happen tonight.

448
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,207
Just get this business done
and get away from things like this.

449
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,090
I'll run the foundation,

450
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,006
you run the tracks and sell cars.

451
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,686
Promise me.

452
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,807
Hmm?

453
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,245
A wedding vow.

454
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,166
I promise.

455
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,924
No guns in the house

456
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,161
and Charles will never see one.

457
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,484
I love you, Thomas Shelby.

458
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,126
You keep us safe.

459
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,371
I love you.

460
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,967
And I promise I will make us safe.

461
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,604
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
you may now join.</i>

462
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,000
Gate house, come on.

463
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,362
Tommy, Arthur, Collins.

464
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,130
May I introduce you to the
Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna,

465
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,563
from Tbilisi, Georgia.

466
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,323
Grand Duchess, may I introduce you
to the Shelby brothers.

467
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,484
Small Heath, Birmingham.

468
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,205
And, uh, good luck with this one, Tom.

469
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,731
Give me the money.

470
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,487
I was told to give it to Mr Kaledin.

471
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,169
Whoever it is up there,
he gave the wrong name.

472
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,643
We asked him the name
and he gave the wrong one.

473
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,362
- What name did he give?
- No.

474
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,283
I don't trust any of you.

475
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,210
Now you give me the money.

476
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,731
I know Mr Kaledin by sight from Tbilisi.
Is his hair dark?

477
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,882
The instructions I was given

478
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,724
was anyone using the wrong code name

479
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,371
was an infiltrator
for the Soviet Embassy.

480
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,816
Just let me go to the house.

481
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,242
I do not want this shit
anywhere near my fucking house.

482
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,800
All I know is "no variations."

483
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,808
That's from Churchill himself.

484
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,009
Whoever it is up at the house,
he gave the wrong fucking name.

485
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,410
And you do this to me
on my fucking wedding day.

486
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,448
The money is in the car, Mr Shelby.

487
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,245
Fetch it out and count it.

488
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,121
Good. Finn.

489
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,921
Yeah. We're good.

490
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,487
You can go. Moss...

491
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,967
Can you do it?

492
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,085
Can you kill?

493
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,686
Moss, you take the "Duchess"
back to Birmingham.

494
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,361
Righto Tom.

495
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,166
Come on, love.

496
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,327
That's right.

497
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,524
You have got to tell me the reason,

498
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,001
otherwise I'll never be able
to trust you.

499
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,445
The truth is,

500
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,650
that I slept with the wife of
one of the colonels who sat for me.

501
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,564
But that was 12 years ago.

502
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,286
And the aristocracy
don't believe in forgiveness.

503
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,890
Neither do the Shelbys.

504
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,811
So, we kill him?

505
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,601
He's a red.

506
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,322
We're being paid by the whites.
It's part of the contract.

507
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,811
Contract.

508
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,129
We should never have got into this, Tom.

509
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,885
There was no choice.

510
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,845
"A factory break-in,"
that's what you said.

511
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,082
Yeah. And that's what it is.

512
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,646
There's just some shit
that goes with it.

513
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,885
And who shovels it? Hmm?

514
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,611
Who fucking shovels it? Eh?

515
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,571
I fucking know.

516
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,244
- Arthur?
- I fucking know.

517
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,526
Arthur.

518
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,484
There's 10 times where
that's coming from, 10 times.

519
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,483
For lifting vehicles
off a fucking shop floor.

520
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,484
Vehicles, Tommy. Fucking vehicles.

521
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,449
Nothing about tanks.

522
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,846
Arthur, you listen to me.
You listen to me, all right?

523
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,287
There are powerful people
in this country

524
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,805
who want to help these mad bastards,

525
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,441
including the King, Churchill
and half the fucking Tory Party.

526
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,241
And if we refuse, Arthur,
if we fucking refuse,

527
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,122
they will see to it
that we hang for one of our many sins.

528
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,851
Now, we've never earned money
like this. Never.

529
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,281
We'll use it to buy
the wharf at Boston docks.

530
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,044
That's why I've asked for dollars.

531
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,729
And when it's done,
it's business as usual.

532
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,970
Come on, brother. It's my wedding night.

533
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,841
- Where's John?
- Looking for Esme.

534
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,001
Right.

535
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,324
Ruben Oliver, portrait artist.

536
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,163
I really enjoyed the depiction of you
in the dining room.

537
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,969
Nice to meet you, Mr Oliver.

538
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,485
Johnny, ragtime.

539
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,005
So, where were we?

540
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,923
- Crimea.
- Oh, I mean before I bored you with war.

541
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,929
- Politics.
- Ah, yes.

542
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,890
You're the only one in your family
who is a communist?

543
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,291
Some of them are,
they just don't know it.

544
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,409
And you are
a very close family, yes?

545
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,205
Mmm, always within punching distance.

546
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,606
What does that mean?

547
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,842
It means, "Yeah, we're a close family."

548
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,687
Arthur?

549
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,922
I do apologise for the interruption.

550
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,611
There is a woman here
to see you, Mr Kaledin.

551
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,090
She just arrived.

552
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,331
So, Tatiana made it from London safe?

553
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,289
- Yes.
- Where is she?

554
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,850
Out by the stables.

555
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,530
Can I use the lavatory?

556
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,044
You can piss outside by the stables.

557
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,241
No!

558
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,010
Very sensible idea, Mr Shelby.

559
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,321
Clear the air away from the ladies.

560
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,724
We are rather like generals here,
aren't we?

561
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,922
Watching our men do battle.

562
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,924
We are a bit too close to the fighting
to be generals, surely.

563
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,125
You know, Mr Shelby, some of us only
agreed to come today to bless this union

564
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,806
because of your exemplary war record.

565
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,087
But as Grace's uncle

566
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,209
and a kind of father to her
for many years,

567
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,241
I'm still deeply uneasy

568
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,041
about the many stories of corruption
and violence.

569
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,166
Drink the fucking wine and smile.

570
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,891
That's what I'm doing.

571
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,288
Oh, you got me good.

572
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,248
Oh, you fucking bastard.

573
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,721
No foul!

574
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,887
No foul!

575
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,645
Don't shoot.

576
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,846
No!

577
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,256
Oh, for the love of God, don't shoot.

578
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,009
No! No!

579
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,320
- No!
- For the love of God...

580
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,368
- No! No! No!
- For the love of God...

581
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,206
- No!
- For the love of God.

582
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,082
What was that?

583
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,162
It's probably just a car back-firing.

584
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,728
It wasn't the day I was expecting.

585
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,366
Nor me.

586
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,526
It's over now.

587
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,329
Tomorrow it'll be just us.

588
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,646
Come here.

589
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,091
Go on. You've had a great night.

590
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,171
The water froze in my car.

591
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,404
Uh, they said I could stay.

592
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,609
I know, this is preposterous.

593
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,522
Plenty of other rooms to stay in.

594
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,401
- Goodnight, Mr Oliver.
- You have my card.

595
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,010
Anytime you're in London,

596
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,762
we could have tea.

597
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,569
I went looking for you.

598
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,605
I thought you'd be in here.

599
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,126
I knew it.

600
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,482
I wanted to end with a bit of peace.

601
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,281
Yeah.

602
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,041
Look what I found.

603
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,731
It's beautiful. Thanks.

604
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,083
Arthur, you mustn't worry about
what happened with the speech.

605
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,688
What was in your heart was beautiful.

606
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,806
God hears all the speeches
that don't get said.

607
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,127
And isn't it nice to still be yourself
at this time of night?

608
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,364
Close your eyes, Arthur,
and spend a minute thinking about that.

609
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,525
It's all right.

610
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,806
It's all right.

611
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,924
More money than all those
fucking toffs put together, eh?

612
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,329
And you're willing to gamble it all
on one robbery.

613
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,730
I'm a gambling man, Pol.
