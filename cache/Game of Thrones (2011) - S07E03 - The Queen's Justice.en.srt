3
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,537
The bastard of Winterfell.

4
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:37,709
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

5
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,083
I believe we last saw
each other atop the Wall.

6
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:49,000
You were pissing off the
edge if I remember right.

7
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,458
Picked up some scars along the road.

8
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,959
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

9
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,458
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

10
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,291
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

11
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:06,374
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

12
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,958
Unluckily for me.

13
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,001
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

14
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,374
Welcome to Dragonstone.

15
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,208
Our queen knows it is a long journey.

16
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,583
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

17
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:23,334
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

18
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,334
Of course.

19
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,626
(MEN MURMURING)

20
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,501
Please, this way.

21
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:02,833
Where are you from?

22
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,124
I can't place the accent.

23
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,958
I was born on the Island of Naath.

24
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,042
Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there.

25
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:12,124
Palm trees and butterflies.

26
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,542
Haven't been, myself.

27
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,501
This place has changed.

28
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:29,000
TYRION: And Sansa? I
hear she's alive and well.

29
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,501
- JON: She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

30
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,083
A sham marriage. And unconsummated.

31
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:40,249
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

32
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,166
Anyway...

33
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:45,000
she's much smarter than she lets on.

34
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,374
She's starting to let on.

35
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,292
Good.

36
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:50,333
TYRION: At some point,

37
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:54,291
I want to hear how a Night's Watch
recruit became King in the North.

38
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,083
As long as you tell me how a Lannister

39
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,875
became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.

40
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:01,000
A long and bloody tale.

41
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,751
To be honest, I was
drunk for most of it.

42
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,917
My bannermen think I'm
a fool for coming here.

43
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:10,333
Of course they do.

44
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:13,043
If I was your Hand, I would
have advised against it.

45
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,583
General rule of thumb...

46
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,708
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

47
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,458
True...

48
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,583
but I'm not a Stark.

49
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:27,918
(SCREECHING)

50
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,459
(PANTING)

51
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,084
I'd say you get used to them...

52
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,292
but you never really do.

53
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:51,084
Come, their mother is waiting for you.

54
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,042
I wondered why you weren't
there to meet our guests.

55
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:10,042
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

56
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:12,500
Don't you want to see him again?

57
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,124
I've done my part.

58
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,541
I've brought ice and fire together.

59
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,833
Strange.

60
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:22,333
You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,

61
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:26,000
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

62
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,374
I didn't take you for a bashful girl.

63
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,583
My time whispering in the ears
of kings has come to an end.

64
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, I doubt that.

65
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,625
Give us common folk one taste of power,

66
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,458
we're like the lion who tasted man.

67
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:43,708
Nothing is ever so sweet again.

68
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:46,959
Neither of us is common folk anymore.

69
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:50,875
I did not part on good terms

70
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,875
with the King in the
North or his advisor.

71
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:54,876
Why?

72
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,584
Because of mistakes I made.

73
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,584
Terrible mistakes.

74
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:07,541
I would only be a
distraction if I stayed.

75
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,750
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

76
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:11,750
Good.

77
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:14,000
If you don't mind my saying,

78
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,750
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

79
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:20,209
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

80
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,333
Oh, I will return, dear Spider.

81
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:27,124
- One last time.
- My lady...

82
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,708
I have to die in this strange country.

83
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,542
Just like you.

84
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,416
MISSANDEI: You stand in the presence

85
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:19,208
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

86
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,416
rightful heir to the Iron Throne,

87
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,374
rightful Queen of the
Andals and the First Men,

88
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,792
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,

89
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,500
the Mother of Dragons,

90
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,708
the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

91
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,501
the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.

92
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,292
This is Jon Snow.

93
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,084
He's King in the North.

94
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:51,958
Thank you for traveling so far, my lord.

95
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,208
I hope the seas weren't too rough.

96
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:55,792
The winds were kind, Your Grace.

97
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:59,792
Apologies, I have a Flea
Bottom accent, I know,

98
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:02,666
but Jon Snow is King in
the North, Your Grace.

99
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,500
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me...

100
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,750
Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.

101
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,666
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

102
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:11,291
I never did receive a formal education,

103
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:12,625
but I could have sworn I read

104
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:15,917
the last King in the
North was Torrhen Stark,

105
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:19,083
who bent the knee to my
ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

106
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:22,291
In exchange for his life and
the lives of the Northmen,

107
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:27,333
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
House Targaryen in perpetuity.

108
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,833
Or do I have my facts wrong?

109
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,166
I wasn't there, Your Grace.

110
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,583
No, of course not.

111
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:36,166
But still, an oath is an oath.

112
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,583
And perpetuity means...

113
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:41,042
what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?

114
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:42,541
Forever.

115
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,625
Forever.

116
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,458
- So I assume, my lord...
- (SIGHS)

117
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,667
...you're here to bend the knee.

118
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:53,751
I am not.

119
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,875
Oh.

120
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,709
Well, that is unfortunate.

121
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,708
You've traveled all this way

122
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,875
to break faith with House Targaryen?

123
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:06,374
Break faith?

124
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,708
Your father burned my grandfather alive.

125
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,416
He burned my uncle alive.

126
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,750
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms...

127
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:14,834
My father... was an evil man.

128
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,876
On behalf of House Targaryen...

129
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,750
I ask your forgiveness

130
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:24,708
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

131
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,583
And I ask you not to judge a daughter

132
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,959
by the sins of her father.

133
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,917
Our two houses were
allies for centuries,

134
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:36,792
and those were the best centuries

135
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:38,917
the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.

136
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,416
Centuries of peace and prosperity

137
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:44,249
with a Targaryen sitting
on the Iron Throne

138
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,249
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

139
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,000
I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.

140
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:54,416
Honor the pledge your
ancestor made to mine.

141
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:58,083
Bend the knee and I will
name you Warden of the North.

142
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:00,291
Together, we will save this country

143
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,918
from those who would destroy it.

144
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:14,792
You're right.

145
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:17,291
You're not guilty of
your father's crimes.

146
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:22,124
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

147
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,124
Then why are you here?

148
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,959
Because I need your
help, and you need mine.

149
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,124
Did you see three dragons

150
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,083
flying overhead when you arrived?

151
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,166
I did.

152
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,458
And did you see the Dothraki,

153
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,666
all of whom have sworn to kill for me?

154
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,625
They're hard to miss.

155
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:45,666
- But still, I need your help?
- DAVOS: Not to defeat Cersei.

156
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:49,000
You could storm King's Landing
tomorrow and the city would fall.

157
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,249
Hell, we almost took it and
we didn't even have dragons.

158
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,374
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

159
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,000
Why not?

160
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,708
The only reason I can see

161
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,958
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

162
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,000
It's the fastest way to win the war,

163
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,833
but you won't do it,

164
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,042
which means, at the very least,

165
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,501
you're better than Cersei.

166
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:14,375
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

167
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,875
Because right now, you and I
and Cersei and everyone else,

168
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:22,500
we're children playing at a game,

169
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,583
screaming that the rules aren't fair.

170
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,708
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

171
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:30,208
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

172
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,083
he's refused to bow, and
now he's calling me a child.

173
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:36,875
I believe he's calling all of
us children. Figure of speech.

174
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:40,208
Your Grace, everyone you know
will die before winter's over

175
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,374
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

176
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,042
As far as I can see, you
are the enemy to the north.

177
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:46,709
I am not your enemy.

178
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,042
The dead are the enemy.

179
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:51,584
The dead?

180
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:54,458
Is that another figure of speech?

181
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,083
The Army of the Dead is on the march.

182
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,166
The Army of the Dead?

183
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,333
You don't know me well, my lord,

184
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:03,666
but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?

185
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,208
No, I don't think you're
either of those things.

186
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,333
The Army of the Dead is real.

187
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,792
The white walkers are real.

188
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:12,708
The Night King is real. I've seen them.

189
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,249
If they get past the Wall

190
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,751
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

191
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,375
we're finished.

192
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,250
I was born at Dragonstone.

193
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,583
Not that I can remember it.

194
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:37,042
We fled before Robert's
assassins could find us.

195
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:40,249
Robert was your
father's best friend, no?

196
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,083
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

197
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,626
to murder a baby girl in her crib.

198
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,001
Not that it matters now, of course.

199
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:55,083
I spent my life in foreign lands.

200
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,458
So many men have tried to kill me,

201
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:00,958
I don't remember all their names.

202
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,042
I have been sold like a broodmare.

203
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:08,583
I've been chained and betrayed,

204
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:11,374
raped and defiled.

205
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,625
Do you know what kept me standing

206
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:16,583
through all those years in exile?

207
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:19,541
Faith.

208
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,792
Not in any gods,

209
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:25,333
not in myths and legends.

210
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:27,958
In myself.

211
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,124
In Daenerys Targaryen.

212
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,666
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

213
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,042
until my children were born.

214
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:41,833
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

215
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,208
They did for me.

216
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,666
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms,

217
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,793
and I will.

218
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,666
You'll be ruling over a graveyard

219
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,001
if we don't defeat the Night King.

220
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,625
The war against my
sister has already begun.

221
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,000
You can't expect us to halt hostilities

222
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,833
and join you in fighting

223
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,334
whatever you saw beyond the Wall.

224
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,750
You don't believe him.

225
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:15,666
I understand that. It
sounds like nonsense.

226
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:19,458
But if destiny has brought Daenerys
Targaryen back to our shores,

227
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:22,666
it has also made Jon
Snow King in the North.

228
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,792
You were the first to
bring Dothraki to Westeros?

229
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:29,166
He is the first to make allies
of wildlings and Northmen.

230
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,249
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

231
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,333
He was named King in the North.

232
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:33,708
Not because of his birthright.

233
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,083
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

234
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:41,124
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

235
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,834
because they believe in him.

236
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,208
All those things you don't believe in,

237
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,750
he faced those things.

238
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,958
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

239
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,541
He risked his life for his people.

240
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,333
He took a knife in the
heart for his people.

241
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,084
He gave his own...

242
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,000
If we don't put aside our
enmities and band together,

243
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:06,083
we will die.

244
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:09,750
And then it doesn't matter whose
skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

245
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,083
If it doesn't matter, then
you might as well kneel.

246
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:14,249
Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys,

247
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,875
help her to defeat my sister,

248
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:18,042
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

249
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,792
There's no time for that.

250
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:21,708
There's no time for any of this!

251
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,208
While we stand here, debating...

252
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,166
It takes no time to bend the knee.

253
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,000
Pledge your sword to her cause.

254
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:28,751
And why would I do that?

255
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:33,750
I mean no offense, Your Grace,

256
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:34,958
but I don't know you.

257
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,792
As far as I can tell,

258
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:40,083
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

259
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:43,417
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

260
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:47,208
The lords of the North

261
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,042
placed their trust in me to lead them,

262
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:54,084
and I will continue to
do so as well as I can.

263
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,793
That's fair.

264
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,166
It's also fair to point out

265
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:04,291
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

266
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:08,042
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

267
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:09,958
you are in open rebellion.

reward for your heroism.

326
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:50,125
There's only one reward I want.

327
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:54,125
You shall have what
your heart desires...

328
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,709
when the war is won.

329
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:07,541
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

330
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:10,708
and Jaime Lannister leading our armies,

331
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,750
the sons and daughters of Westeros

332
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:15,042
shall defend our country.

(CROWD CHEERING)

334
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:24,291
There's nothing quite like it, is there?

335
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,042
The love of the people.

336
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:28,166
Though I suppose you wouldn't know.

337
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:31,500
This same mob spat at
my sister not long ago.

338
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:33,249
And if you turn on us,

339
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,458
they'll cheer to see your
head mounted on a spike.

340
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,958
Or yours.

341
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,083
They just like severed heads, really.

342
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:44,333
Listen, if you have any advice at all,

343
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:45,917
I would love to hear it.

344
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:48,958
When we have an hour or
two to speak as brothers.

345
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,666
Advice?

346
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:54,333
Does she like it gentle or rough?

347
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,000
A finger in the bum?

348
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,292
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not
now. We'll talk later.

349
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,083
CERSEI: I want you to know I understand.

350
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:21,666
Even though we're enemies, you and I,

351
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,334
I understand the fury that drives you.

352
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:25,833
I was there that day

353
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,626
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

354
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,500
If I close my eyes,

355
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:35,500
I can hear the sound of
Oberyn's skull breaking.

356
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,708
The sound of your scream.

357
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,208
I never heard a sound like that.

358
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,167
I thought, "That's true love."

359
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:45,042
Oberyn looked beautiful
that day. He really did.

360
00:23:45,043 --> 00:23:46,416
No one moved like him.

361
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:49,541
No one had such skill with a spear.

362
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:52,625
Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.

363
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:55,083
If only he hadn't taunted him.

364
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:59,042
He could've walked away and
left poor Ser Gregor to die.

365
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:01,083
But that wasn't your
lover's way, was it?

366
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:03,917
Now he's buried somewhere.

367
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:06,666
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

368
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,584
That must be difficult for you.

369
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,541
When my daughter was taken from me,

370
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:17,666
my only daughter...

371
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,458
well, you can't imagine how that feels

372
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,708
unless you've lost a child.

373
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:25,374
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

374
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,083
to give her to the wet nurse.

375
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:31,583
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

376
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,833
I never got to have a mother,

377
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,249
but Myrcella did.

378
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,917
She was mine, and you took her from me.

379
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:40,959
Why did you do that?

380
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:48,918
Doesn't matter now.

381
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:00,249
Your daughter's a beauty, too.

382
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,875
Those brown eyes.

383
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,584
Those lips.

384
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:08,249
Perfect Dornish beauty.

385
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,124
I imagine she's your favorite.

386
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:13,291
I know, I know, we're not
supposed to have favorites,

387
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,459
but still, we're only human.

I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

391
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:26,792
That gag makes it impossible to
understand what you're saying.

392
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,626
It must be frustrating.

393
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:34,792
We all make our choices.

394
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:37,208
You chose to murder my daughter.

395
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:39,458
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

Not at all, really.

399
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:53,917
I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy

400
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:56,291
and imagine ways of killing my enemies.

401
00:25:56,292 --> 00:26:00,167
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the
woman who murdered my only daughter.

I thought about having Ser Gregor

crush your skull the
way he did Oberyn's.

404

It would be poetic, I
suppose, but fast, too fast.

00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:13,167
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

406

She's so beautiful.

Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know.

Clever enough to learn what
poison you used to murder Myrcella.

- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

486
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:39,750
How are your profits

487
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:42,291
now that Daenerys has
freed all the slaves?

488
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:46,458
The slave trade has entered
a downturn, it's true.

489
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:48,333
From what I gather,
she considers herself

490
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:51,666
more of a revolutionary than a monarch.

491
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:55,583
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

492
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:58,583
The Lannisters owe the Iron
Bank quite a lot of money,

493
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,750
but Lannisters always pay their debts.

494
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:05,167
Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?

495
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:10,750
Your father's daughter, indeed.

496
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,083
Give me a fortnight.

497
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:14,291
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

498
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,708
And when you return to Braavos,

499
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:20,167
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

500
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:47,626
I came down here to brood over my
failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

501
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,708
You're making it difficult.

502
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:55,375
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

503
00:32:57,084 --> 00:32:59,625
You make me feel like I'm
failing at brooding over failing.

504
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:01,333
I'm a prisoner on this island.

505
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:05,291
I wouldn't say you're a
prisoner on this island.

506
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:06,792
You're free to walk the castle,

507
00:33:06,793 --> 00:33:08,708
the beaches, to go wherever you want.

508
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:10,875
Except to my ship.

509
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:12,291
You took my ship.

510
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:14,249
I wouldn't say we took your ship.

511
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,750
I'm not playing word games with you.

512
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:18,625
The dead are coming for us all.

513
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:20,291
Why don't you figure out what to do

514
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,374
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

515
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,249
and I'll figure out what to
do about your walking dead men.

516
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,458
It's hard for me to
fathom. It really is.

517
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:30,584
If someone told me about the
white walkers and the Night King...

518
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,250
You probably don't believe me.

519
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,875
I do, actually.

520
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,417
You didn't before.

521
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,333
"Grumkins and snarks," you called them.

522
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:51,416
Do you remember?

523
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,500
You said it was all nonsense.

524
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:56,625
It was nonsense. Everybody knew it.

525
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:59,750
But then Mormont saw them

526
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:01,166
and you saw them.

527
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,833
And I trust the eyes of an honest man

528
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,834
more than I trust what everybody knows.

529
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,416
How do I convince
people who don't know me

530
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:11,166
that an enemy they don't believe
in is coming to kill them all?

531
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:14,500
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

532
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:16,666
I'm looking for an answer.

533
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:20,958
People's minds aren't made
for problems that large.

534
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,416
White walkers, the Night King,

535
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:25,500
Army of the Dead...

536
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:27,124
it's almost a relief to confront

537
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:30,001
a comfortable, familiar
monster like my sister.

538
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:35,292
I need to help prepare my
people for what's coming.

539
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,334
I can't help them from here.

540
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:42,084
I'd like to leave.

541
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,042
It seems unlikely that you
became King in the North

542
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,709
by giving up that easily.

543
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:53,000
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

544
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,792
Don't go south.

545
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,458
Don't answer a summons from
the Mad King's daughter,

546
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:58,876
a foreign invader.

547
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,958
And here I am,

548
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,500
a Northern fool.

549
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,958
Children are not their fathers,

550
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,667
luckily for all of us.

551
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,374
And sometimes there's
more to foreign invaders

552
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,583
and Northern fools than meets the eye.

553
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,792
Daenerys could have sailed for
Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

554
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,625
Instead, she stayed where she was

555
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:24,291
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

556
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:26,625
some of whom are on this
island with us right now.

557
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,208
While you're our guest here,

558
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,750
you might consider asking them

559
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:32,500
what they think of the
Mad King's daughter.

560
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:35,583
She protects people from monsters,

561
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:37,124
just as you do.

562
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,583
It's why she came here.

563
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:41,124
And she's not about to head north

564
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,583
to fight an enemy she's never seen

565
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:45,083
on the word of a man she doesn't know.

566
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:47,500
After a single meeting,

567
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:50,292
it's not a reasonable thing to ask.

568
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,918
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

569
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:04,917
What do you mean?

570
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:07,166
Maybe you are a Northern fool.

571
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:10,834
I'm asking if there's
something I can do to help you.

572
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:15,333
- Dragonglass?
- TYRION: Yes.

573
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,792
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

574
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,792
He says you have a
tremendous amount of it here.

575
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,583
Why are we talking about glass?

576
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:23,458
We just lost two of our allies.

577
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:26,834
Which is why I was speaking
to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

578
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:32,958
And what does the King in the
North want with dragonglass?

579
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,291
Apparently, it can
be turned into weapons

580
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,416
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

581
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,583
Or stop them.

582
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:41,875
Destroy them.

583
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,501
Unsure about the nomenclature.

584
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:48,416
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

585
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:51,291
and white walkers and Night Kings?

586
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,917
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

587
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:57,166
But a wise man once said that
you should never believe a thing

588
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,709
simply because you want to believe it.

589
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:05,583
Which wise man said this?

590
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:07,458
I don't remember.

591
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,876
Are you trying to present your
own statements as ancient wisdom?

592
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:14,291
I would never do that.

593
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:15,334
To you.

594
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,833
The reason I believe Jon
Snow is because he's here.

595
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:23,249
All of his advisors would
have told him not to come.

596
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,333
I would have told him not to come.

597
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:27,666
And he's here anyway.

598
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:30,083
You don't have to believe him.

599
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,124
Let him mine the dragonglass.

600
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,750
If he's wrong, it's worthless.

601
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,833
You didn't even know it was here.

602
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:38,374
It's nothing to you.

603
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:41,666
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

604
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:44,374
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

605
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,958
with a possible ally.

606
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:50,333
Keep him occupied while we
focus on the task at hand...

607
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,709
Casterly Rock.

608
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,750
What was that Ser Davos said

609
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,792
about taking a knife in
the heart for his people?

610
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:00,583
Did you notice that?

611
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:03,042
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

612
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:05,209
It's dreary in the North.

613
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:10,709
(SCREECHING)

614
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,584
Amazing thing to see.

615
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:27,125
I named them for my
brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar.

616
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,751
They're both gone now.

617
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,417
You lost two brothers as well.

618
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:39,459
People thought dragons were
gone forever, but here they are.

619
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:44,043
Perhaps we should all be
examining what we think we know.

620
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:52,291
You've been talking to Tyrion.

621
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:55,042
He is my Hand.

622
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:57,667
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

623
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,626
I don't.

624
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:08,625
You know I'm not going to let
Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

625
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:09,792
I never expected that you would.

626
00:39:09,793 --> 00:39:11,042
And I haven't changed my mind

627
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:13,124
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

628
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,959
I haven't either.

629
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:20,501
(SIGHS)

630
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:28,500
I will allow you to mine the
dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

631
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:31,501
Any resources or men you
need, I will provide for you.

632
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,001
Thank you.

633
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:46,167
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

634
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:52,043
You'd better get to work, Jon Snow.

635
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:04,043
(CHATTER)

636
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:18,333
How much do we have?

637
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:20,416
4,000 bushels, my lady.

638
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,583
What does that mean?

639
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:23,666
For the current occupants of the castle,

640
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:27,333
it's enough food for
a year, perhaps more.

641
00:40:27,334 --> 00:40:30,750
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

642
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:33,208
Uh, I'm not entirely certain.

643
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:35,042
I-I'll check Maester Luwin's records.

644
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:38,541
He kept a copy of every raven scroll.

645
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:40,666
You're telling me we
don't have enough food,

646
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:43,876
especially not if the armies of the
North come back to defend Winterfell?

647
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,374
No, my lady, most likely not.

648
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:49,500
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

649
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:51,583
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

650
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,875
this is the best place to be.

651
00:40:53,876 --> 00:40:55,833
We need to start building
up our grain stores

652
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:58,416
with regular shipments from
every keep in the North.

653
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,708
If we don't use it by winter's
end, we'll give it back to them.

654
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,042
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

655
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,750
they won't have enough time to
bring wagonloads of grain with them.

656
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:08,166
Very wise, my lady.

657
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:09,959
Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?

658
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,249
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

659
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,625
No, my lady.

660
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:20,708
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

661
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:22,124
They should, indeed.

662
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,333
Pardon me, my lady.

663
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:26,918
You there, why isn't
there leather on these?

664
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:30,709
Command suits you.

665
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:34,500
The Northerners are all facing north,

666
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:36,583
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

667
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:38,124
So they should be.

668
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,792
I know Cersei better than anyone here.

669
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:42,875
If you turn your back on her...

670
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,444
You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.

671
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,274
I only meant to say...

672
00:41:47,394 --> 00:41:50,333
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

673
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:52,417
Thank you for your wise counsel.

674
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:55,917
One of two things will happen...

675
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:58,208
either the dead will defeat the living,

676
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:00,166
in which case...

677
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,249
all our troubles come to an end,

678
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,625
or life will win out.

679
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:06,625
And what then?

680
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:10,626
Don't fight in the North or the South.

681
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:17,084
Fight every battle, everywhere,
always, in your mind.

682
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:20,875
Everyone is your enemy,

683
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:23,792
everyone is your friend...

684
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:27,917
every possible series of
events is happening all at once.

685
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:31,500
Live that way and
nothing will surprise you.

686
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:34,083
Everything that happens
will be something

687
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,001
that you've seen before.

688
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,001

00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,709

00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:37,708
I wish Jon were here.

00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:40,584
Yes, I need to speak to him.

694
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:47,375
You're Father's last
living trueborn son.

695
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,083
You're Lord of Winterfell now.

696
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:55,333
I can never be Lord of Winterfell.

697
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:57,166
I can never be lord of anything.

698
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,417
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

699
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:02,291
I don't know what that means.

700
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:04,708
It's difficult to explain.

701
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,918
Try. Please, for me.

702
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:11,583
It means I can see everything.

703
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:13,917
Everything that's ever
happened to everyone.

704
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:16,917
Everything that's happening right now.

00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:21,708
It's all pieces now, fragments.

706
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:23,917
I need to learn to see better.

707
00:44:23,918 --> 00:44:27,333
When the Long Night comes again,

708
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,959
I need to be ready.

709
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:34,416
How do you know all this?

710
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:35,958
The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.

711
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,875
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

712
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:40,625
I told you it's difficult to explain.

I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

I'm sorry it had to
happen here in our home.

It was so beautiful that night.

718
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:03,959
Snow falling, just like now.

719
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:09,043
And you were so beautiful...

720
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:12,793
in your white wedding dress.

721
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,542
I have to go back inside, Bran.

722
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:21,626
I'll stay a bit longer.

723

A bit. Less than before.

appears to be active.

Unlikely.

732
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:08,541
One could almost be forgiven

733
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:12,124
for thinking that the entire upper
layer of diseased skin was debrided

734
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:16,500
and the underlying region
treated with some sort of unguent.

735
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:19,792
Don't know anything about that.

736
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:21,875
I just started feeling better.

737
00:46:21,876 --> 00:46:25,542
I assumed it was the rest that did it.

738
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:30,124
And the climate.

739
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:32,083
The climate.

740
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,875
You're free to go, ser.

741

for the infectious,

you in my study this evening.

How bad is it?

745
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:48,417
Suppose I'll find out this evening.

746
00:46:53,542 --> 00:46:56,249
- Where will you go?
- (GRUNTS)

747
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,959
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

748
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:04,249
I knew it would kill me

749
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,917
or I'd kill myself before it could.

750

Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

751

Your father saved me more than once.

It's the least I could do.

757
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:30,000
Perhaps our paths will cross again.

00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,417

- Yes.

760
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:04,500
Who told you to treat him?

761
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:05,833
No one.

762
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:09,124
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

763
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,833
I seem to remember you.

764
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:14,667
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

765
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:19,458
I forbade it because it is
dangerous and rarely successful,

766
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:21,792
especially on someone of that age.

767
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:24,000
You could have infected
yourself and others.

768
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:27,459
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

769
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:31,666
But you didn't.

770
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:34,291
It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.

771
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:37,708
Many maesters whose chains
are heavy with healing links

772
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:40,166
have attempted it and failed.

773
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,249
Yet you succeeded.

774
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,375
How?

775
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:48,667
I read the books and
followed the instructions.

776
00:48:59,043 --> 00:49:01,250
That man is alive because of you.

777
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:05,167
You should be proud.

778
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,750
Thank you, Archmaester.

779
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:11,751
Come here.

780
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:19,374
All these manuscripts and
scrolls are rotting away.

781
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:22,043
I need you to make copies of them.

782
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:28,417
You were expecting a reward.

783
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:33,918
Your reward is not being immediately
expelled from the Citadel.

784
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:37,083
You'd better get started.

785
00:49:37,084 --> 00:49:38,750
And careful of the paper mites.

786
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:40,084
They like flesh as well.

787
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:50,708
We need to find Euron
Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

788
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:54,208
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

789
00:49:54,209 --> 00:49:55,750
To send our remaining ships after him...

790
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:58,417
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

791
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,792
Would you have to go yourself?

792
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,792
Euron's ships could be anywhere

793
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:07,792
or in more than one place.

794
00:50:07,793 --> 00:50:10,208
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

795
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:11,249
for who knows how long.

796
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,875
I wouldn't be alone.

797
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,458
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

798
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,249
What can anyone do to them?

799
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,249
MISSANDEI: They can
still do something to you.

800
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,042
It only takes one arrow.

801
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:23,584
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

802
00:50:25,918 --> 00:50:28,042
What about Casterly Rock?

803
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:30,000
The Unsullied will be there soon.

804
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:32,583
And what will they face?

805
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:35,000
A difficult situation.

806
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:37,124
They know we're coming.

Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

is to destroy House Lannister.

809

- TYRION: Well-trained and well-provisioned.

Just as my father said they would.

824
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:38,374
Interesting thing about my father...

825
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,291
he built our house up from near ruin.

826
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:44,458
He built our army, he built
Casterly Rock as we know it,

827
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:46,541
but he didn't build the sewers.

828
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,625
That was beneath him,

829
00:51:48,626 --> 00:51:51,500
so he gave the job to the
lowest person he could find...

830
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:53,042
me.

831
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,875
He was right, I was low.

832
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:57,000
The company I kept, low.

833
00:51:57,001 --> 00:51:58,541
Women, mostly.

834
00:51:58,542 --> 00:52:00,208
They weren't welcome at the Rock.

835
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:02,500
Father disapproved of
that sort of behavior.

836
00:52:02,501 --> 00:52:04,124
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

837
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,583
I couldn't have them in my chambers,

838
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:07,833
so in the process of
building the sewers,

839
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,584
I threw in something for myself.

840
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:14,625
It was a passage that began

841
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:16,333
in an out of the way cove by the sea

842
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:19,750
and ended beneath one
of the main guard towers.

843
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:22,959
No better place for low
pursuits than beneath the ground.

844
00:52:24,584 --> 00:52:28,333
Casterly Rock is an
impregnable fortress.

(GRUNTS, WHEEZES)

846
00:52:30,584 --> 00:52:34,249
But as a good friend of mine once said,

00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:38,208
"Give me 10 good men and
I'll impregnate the bitch."

And so it begins.

850
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:54,583
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

851
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:56,458
They will be outnumbered.

852
00:52:56,459 --> 00:52:58,793
They will have less
armor and fewer weapons.

853
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:07,541
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

854
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:10,500
The Unsullied will be
fighting for something greater.

855
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:12,500
They will be fighting for freedom

856
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:14,291
and the person who gave it to them.

857
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,792
They will be fighting for you.

858
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,250

And now the rains weep o'er our halls.

Did we fight well?

871
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:53,792
Uh, as well as could be expected.

Golden roses, indeed.

Your brother and his new queen

875
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:04,875
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

876
00:56:04,876 --> 00:56:08,166
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

877
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:09,750
Well, it is to me,

878
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:12,083
but my fond childhood memories

879
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:13,625
won't keep Cersei on the throne.

880
00:56:13,626 --> 00:56:15,750
So you just let them take it?

881
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:17,792
For now. They won't be able to hold it.

882
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:20,333
Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships,

883
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:22,333
we emptied the larders before we left.

884
00:56:22,334 --> 00:56:24,583
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

885
00:56:24,584 --> 00:56:28,000
and march all the way across Westeros.

886
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:31,166
And you took your army, your real army,

887

and went where they weren't.

As Robb Stark did to
me at Whispering Wood.

Yes. You must be very wise by now.

My father always said
I was a slow learner.

If he was so clever,

893
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:49,666
why didn't he take Highgarden

No more learning from my mistakes, eh?

898
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,875
How will you do it?

899
00:57:06,876 --> 00:57:09,333
With that sword?

900
00:57:09,334 --> 00:57:11,708
That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?

901
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:14,042
Not that he ever used it.

902
00:57:14,043 --> 00:57:15,709
What did he call it?

903
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:19,666
Widow's Wail.

904
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,876
He really was a cunt, wasn't he?

905
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:28,875
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

906
00:57:28,876 --> 00:57:32,917
Or watched them being done on my orders.

907
00:57:32,918 --> 00:57:36,083
I never lost a night's sleep over them.

908
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:38,124
They were necessary.

909
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,166
And whatever I imagined necessary

910
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:44,083
for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.

911
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:48,709
But your sister has done things...

912
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,708
I was incapable of imagining.

913
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:55,541
That was my prize mistake...

914
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:58,084
a failure of imagination.

915
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:01,875
She's a monster, you do know that?

916
00:58:01,876 --> 00:58:04,042
To you, I'm sure.

917
00:58:04,043 --> 00:58:05,917
To others as well.

918
00:58:05,918 --> 00:58:09,416
But after we've won and there's
no one left to oppose us,

919
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:13,750
when people are living
peacefully in the world she built,

920
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:17,459
do you really think they'll wring
their hands over the way she built it?

921
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:22,083
You love her.

922
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:23,875
You really do love her.

923
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,333
You poor fool.

924
00:58:26,334 --> 00:58:28,083
She'll be the end of you.

925
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:30,625
Possibly.

926
00:58:30,626 --> 00:58:32,416
Not much to be gained

927
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:34,458
from discussing it with
you, though, is there?

928
00:58:34,459 --> 00:58:37,166
What better person to discuss it with?

929
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:39,083
What better guarantee could you have

930
00:58:39,084 --> 00:58:43,124
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

931
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:46,166
But perhaps you're right.

932
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:47,750
If she's driven you this far,

933
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:50,167
it's gone beyond your control.

934
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:53,458
Yes.

935
00:58:53,459 --> 00:58:54,918
It has.

936
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:58,042
She's a disease.

937
00:58:58,043 --> 00:59:01,000
I regret my role in spreading it.

938
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:02,583
You will, too.

939
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:04,334
I think we're done here.

940
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:08,793
How will it happen?

941
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:12,249
Cersei had several ideas.

942
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,666
Whipping you through the streets

943
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:16,333
and beheading you in
front of the Red Keep.

944
00:59:16,334 --> 00:59:20,167
Flaying you alive and hanging you
from the walls of King's Landing.

945
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:25,125
I talked her out of those.

946
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,792
Will there be pain?

947
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:46,374
No. I made sure of that.

948
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,709
That's good.

949
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:02,501
I'd hate to die like your son.

950
01:00:03,709 --> 01:00:05,166
Clawing at my neck,

951
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:08,042
foam and bile spilling from my mouth,

952
01:00:08,043 --> 01:00:11,875
eyes bloodred, skin purple.

953
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:14,249
Must have been horrible for you,

954
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,708
as a Kingsguard, as a father.

955
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:20,291
It was horrible enough for me.

956
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:22,958
A shocking scene.

957
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:25,751
Not at all what I intended.

958
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:32,292
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

959
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,416
Tell Cersei.

960
01:00:39,417 --> 01:00:41,876
I want her to know it was me.
