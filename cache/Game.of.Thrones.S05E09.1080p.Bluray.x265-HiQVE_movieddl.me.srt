1
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,848
- Look out!
- Fire!

2
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,725
A band of 20 men, maybe less.

3
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,041
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

4
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,284
Burned our food stores to the ground,
all our siege weapons destroyed.

5
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,522
- Dozens of tents were...
- Horses?

6
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,841
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

7
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Twenty men rode into our camp
without a single guard sounding the alarm?

8
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,041
The Northerners know more about their land
than we ever will.

9
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,451
Put last night's guards in chains.

10
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,682
Either they fell asleep
or they conspired with the enemy.

11
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,207
- Find out the truth and then hang them.
- Your Grace.

12
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,602
Unless there's a thaw,
we can't press forward to Winterfell

13
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,126
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to Castle Black.

14
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,964
We're not returning to Castle Black.

15
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,408
Forgive me, I never claimed
to be an expert in military matters,

16
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,121
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

17
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,880
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

18
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,250
Halt!

19
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,686
Halt!

20
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,363
There it is!

21
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,882
Open the gates.

22
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,762
It was a failure.

23
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,365
It wasn't.

24
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,767
I went to save them. I failed.

25
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,045
You didn't fail him.

26
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,121
Or him.

27
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,807
Or her.

28
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,527
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

29
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,281
I don't think that fact's lost on them.

30
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,886
You have a good heart.

31
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,047
It'll get us all killed.

32
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,164
Get out of my way.

33
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,930
You sent for me?

34
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,128
Find some healthy horses
and a few knights to guard you.

35
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,401
I'm sending you back to Castle Black.

36
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,322
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

37
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,971
to send food, supplies, fresh horses.

38
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,684
In return, when I take the throne,

39
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,525
I'll make sure the Night's Watch
has all the men it requires.

40
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,922
He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall
if he so wishes.

41
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,250
You named me your Hand.

42
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,846
Yes.

43
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,763
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

44
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,171
especially in time of war.

45
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,242
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

46
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,561
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

47
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,211
And if Jon Snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

48
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,884
what does the boy say?

49
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,440
I didn't name you Hand
for your expertize in military matters.

50
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,649
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

51
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,726
Perhaps Queen Selyse
and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

52
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,165
My family stays with me.

53
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,122
At least let me take Shireen.

54
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,568
A siege is no place for a little girl.

55
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,961
My family stays with me.

56
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,367
What's this one now?

57
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,240
The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling
by Grand Maester Munkun.

58
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,684
Now that sounds like a proper story.

59
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,451
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

60
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,841
He polished his shield for a week
so that it was like a mirror.

61
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,248
And he crouched behind
it and crept forward,

62
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,368
hoping the dragon
would only see its own reflection.

63
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,523
But the dragon saw a dumb man
holding a mirrored shield.

64
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,205
And burned him to a crisp.

65
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,166
Thus ending the dragon-slaying career
of Ser Byron Swann.

66
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,282
I made you something.

67
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,043
- Do you like it?
- He's beautiful.

68
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,922
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

69
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,446
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

70
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,204
Of course I will.

71
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,251
But why am I getting a present?

72
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,729
Because you deserve it.

73
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,966
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

74
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,168
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

75
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,970
Made it this far without reading.

76
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,407
Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

77
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,722
Wish I'd listened to him.

78
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,488
This is my own poor way
of saying "thank you."

79
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,288
For teaching me to be a grown-up.

80
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,402
I'll be gone for a few days.

81
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,527
I want to hear all about
The Dance of Dragons when I'm back.

82
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,728
You'll read it yourself.

83
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,771
Prince Doran.

84
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,286
Forgive us. We started without you.

85
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,169
Please, sit.

86
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,724
Princess Myrcella.

87
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,401
Uncle.

88
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,250
What a lovely dress.

89
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,446
You don't like it?

90
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,170
- You must be cold.
- Not at all.

91
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,126
The Dornish climate agrees with me.

92
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,001
Prince Trystane.

93
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,281
How's your jaw?

94
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,165
A fleabite.

95
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,924
What are you doing in Dorne?

96
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,207
Looking after the safety of my niece.

97
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,489
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

98
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,483
you decided to enter my country in secret

99
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,729
and abduct our guest by force?

100
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,087
We received a threatening message.

101
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,001
The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

102
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,362
That necklace was stolen from my room.

103
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,290
Oh, excellent.

104
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,362
A last meal before the beheading?

105
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,090
Oh, I can't behead you.

106
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,401
Many in Dorne want war.

107
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,767
But I've seen war.

108
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,650
I've seen the bodies piled
on the battlefields.

109
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,849
I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

110
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,922
I don't want to lead my
people into that hell.

111
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,765
No, you want to break bread
with the Lannisters.

112
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,003
And that is precisely what we are doing.

113
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,721
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

114
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,689
King of the Andals and the First Men,

115
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,485
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

116
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,050
King Tommen insists
on his sister's return to the capital?

117
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,446
I'm afraid he does.

118
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,443
I cannot disobey my king's command.

119
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,120
She will return with you to King's Landing.

120
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,528
And my son, Prince Trystane,
will accompany you both.

121
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,321
If the alliance between
the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,

122
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,845
their engagement must stand.

123
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,881
I accept.

124
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,361
One more thing.

125
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,445
My brother was named to the Small Council
before his death.

126
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,320
Your father understood the importance
of keeping Dorne in the fold.

127
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,447
With Oberyn gone,

128
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,808
Trystane will take his place
on the Small Council.

129
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,041
You have my word.

130
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,407
The word of a Kingslayer.

131
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,045
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

132
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,081
You are mother to four of my nieces,
girls I love very much.

133
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,970
For their sake,
I hope you live a long and happy life.

134
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,441
Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

135
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,961
May I inquire as to the
fate of my man Bronn?

136
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,089
Tell me, in King's Landing,

137
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,323
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

138
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,970
He said it was just a fleabite.

139
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,446
The fault is mine. Bronn is merely
a soldier following my orders.

140
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,962
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

141
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,964
Prince Trystane must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

142
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,724
I'll let him decide.

143
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,405
I have learned the value of mercy
from my father.

144
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,643
- I'll set your man free.
- You're a good man.

145
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,448
On one condition.

146
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,601
Why do we play? I'm better than you.

147
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,001
I'll always be better than you.

148
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,890
Have I ever missed once?

149
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,088
I don't think I have. I can't recall.

150
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,807
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

151
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,041
Which do you love most?

152
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,891
That one hurt, didn't it?

153
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,088
You going to cry?

154
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,924
Give up, little sister.

155
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,241
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

156
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,607
You will. You're thinking too much.

157
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,529
Now you're nervous. "What if she's right?"

158
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,001
Luck.

159
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,771
Now it's my turn.

160
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,202
You're too slow.
You've always been too slow.

161
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,882
Am I gonna be happy at
the end of this walk?

162
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,883
You'll find out very soon.

163
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,684
Say it one more time, handsome.

164
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,091
Who am I?

165
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,166
The most beautiful woman in the world.

166
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,605
And that's the truth.

167
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,843
Slut.

168
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,082
Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

169
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,766
I didn't realize
there were knights of the Blackwater.

170
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,280
Only the one.

171
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,840
I believe you've already
met Prince Trystane.

172
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,250
Prince.

173
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,011
Sorry about the other day.

174
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,526
Prince Trystane here
is a man of mercy.

175
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,080
He's agreed to grant you your freedom.

176
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,442
I'm glad to hear it.

177
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,361
Pie looks good.

178
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,920
There was one condition.

179
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,647
Perhaps some soup instead.

180
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,770
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

181
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,723
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

182
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,722
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

183
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,849
Oysters, clams, and...

184
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,651
How much for your little clam?

185
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,971
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

186
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,850
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

187
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,768
Come on.

188
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,888
Some oysters, girl!

189
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,081
I'm talking to you.

190
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,006
Is, uh...

191
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,521
- Girl!
- Tie her up!

192
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,645
Are you deaf? Girl!

193
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,685
Girl!

194
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,490
My lord.

195
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,203
SAILOR; My lord.

196
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,805
Lord Tyrell.

197
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,609
On behalf of the Iron Bank,

198
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,366
may I be the first to welcome you
to the Free City of Braavos.

199
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,209
I hope yourjourney was trouble-free.

200
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,966
A bit of chop the last few days.
Nothing too awful.

201
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,805
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

202
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,042
And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

203
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,843
Ah, the vintners say this might be the best
year for red grapes in half a century.

204
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,605
If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,

205
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,641
I'll be sure to send
a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.

206
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,291
I'm afraid I don't partake.

207
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,601
Oh.

208
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,122
Some consider usury
distasteful, dishonorable.

209
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,850
Pure nonsense, of course.

210
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,002
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

211
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,211
Did you know that at one point Maegor III
tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?

212
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,687
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

213
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,127
and cut off both their hands.

214
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,368
Most unfortunate for the glovers.

215
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,442
If a man charges no interest on a loan,

216
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,162
then he has nothing to gain
and everything to lose, so why chance it?

217
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,404
Whereas the promise of reward
makes a man willing to gamble.

218
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,927
We are not gamblers
here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

219
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,367
You are the world's best gamblers.

220
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,206
And all those bets you won built this.

221
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,046
We should celebrate.

222
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,691
I'm afraid I still
have a good deal of work to do.

223
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,286
- Nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?
- I don't have that gift.

224
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,727
It's not a gift. It's a skill.
Anyone can learn it.

225
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,210
So give me a kiss by the Long Canal

226
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,251
And give me two kisses in Salty Town

227
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,291
For we're going to die tomorrow

228
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,642
The bareheaded beggar
The king with his crown...

229
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,842
Thought that old shit
would never stop singing.

230
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,084
Wasn't bad, though.

231
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,640
The Tyrells can all rot in hell.

232
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,210
Treasonous cunts.

233
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,090
They were going to make
that boy-fucker Renly king.

234
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,288
This is the place, lads.

235
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,971
The sleekest little minks in Braavos.

236
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,611
- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

237
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,648
But I never was good at sharing.

238
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,848
Sell your fish somewhere else.

239
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,730
Oh, let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry.

240
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,681
Come here, sweetness.

241
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,651
They say oysters get the juices flowing.

242
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,367
We'll take half a dozen.

243
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,649
Three coppers.

244
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,968
Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

245
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,086
Too old.

246
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,841
Brea.

247
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,566
Too old.

248
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,128
I have just the one. Anara.

249
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,564
Our most expensive girl.

250
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,810
But well worth it, I assure you.

251
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,609
Too old.

252
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,410
Do you have what I want or not?

253
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,168
Of course. Of course.

254
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,605
These fresh?

255
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,331
Come on, the lads are hungry.

256
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,129
Nothing better for your cockstand
than fresh oysters.

257
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,130
- Here. Thank you.
- I'll have one.

258
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,164
Any vinegar?

259
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,049
Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!

260
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,964
Good.

261
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,130
I'll tell you when we're done.

262
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,883
You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?

263
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,165
Of course.

264
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,530
I'll have you whipped, girl.

265
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,841
Go, go on. Out, out, go.

266
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,725
Valar Morghulis.

267
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,571
And?

268
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,325
The thin man wasn't hungry today.

269
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,528
Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

270
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,726
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

271
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,522
A girl has work to do.

272
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,128
Your rebellion is over.

273
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,162
You can swear your allegiance to me now,

274
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,609
or you can die.

275
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,081
I believe in second chances.

276
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,811
I don't believe in third chances.

277
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,208
You write like a seven-year-old.

278
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,011
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

279
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,321
- He didn't try to make you pay?
- Mmm-mmm.

280
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,568
Maybe he's changed.

281
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,130
The queen will be thrilled to know
you're bringing her daughter home.

282
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,201
She will.

283
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,611
- You love her very much, don't you?
- Of course, she's my niece.

284
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,004
I wasn't talking about her.

285
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,202
You think I disapprove?

286
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,327
Why?

287
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,804
Because people disapprove
of that sort of thing where you are from?

288
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,009
They disapproved of Oberyn and me
where you are from.

289
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,641
Here, no one blinked an eye.

290
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,931
100 years ago,
no one would have blinked an eye at you

291
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,604
if you'd been named Targaryen.

292
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,801
It's always changing,

293
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,770
who we're supposed to love
and who we're not.

294
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,010
The only thing that stays the same
is that we want who we want.

295
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,002
I know your daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

296
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,162
that happened to the man I love.

297
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,361
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

298
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,803
Father.

299
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,606
Aren't you cold?

300
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,003
No. What are you reading?

301
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,565
The Dance of Dragons.

302
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,880
What's it about?

303
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,246
It's the story of the fight

304
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,322
between Rhaenyra Targaryen
and her half-brotherAegon

305
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,607
for control of the Seven Kingdoms.

306
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,490
Both of them thought
they belonged on the Iron Throne.

307
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,731
When people started declaring
for one of them or the other,

308
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,848
their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

309
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,322
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

310
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,085
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

311
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,925
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

312
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,721
They never truly recovered.

313
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,848
The Dance of Dragons.

314
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,762
Why is that a dance?

315
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,683
It's just what they call it.

316
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,364
Hmm. Doesn't make much sense.

317
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,329
I think it's poetic.

318
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,851
If you'd had to choose

319
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,083
between Rhaenyra and Aegon,

320
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,246
who would you have chosen?

321
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,286
I wouldn't have chosen either.

322
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,966
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

323
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,281
Sometimes a person has to choose.

324
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,643
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

325
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,490
If a man knows what he is

326
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,730
and remains true to himself,

327
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,447
the choice is no choice at all.

328
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,480
He must fulfill his destiny

329
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,162
and become who he is meant to be.

330
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,722
However much he may hate it.

331
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,969
It's all right.

332
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,845
You don't even know what I'm talking about.

333
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,844
It doesn't matter. I want to help you.

334
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,450
Is there any way I can help?

335
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,800
Yes, there is.

336
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,605
Good. I want to.

337
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,767
I'm the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

338
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,922
And I'm your daughter.

339
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,203
Forgive me.

340
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,847
Where's my father? I want to see my father.

341
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,890
It will all be over soon.

342
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,161
No.

343
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,088
Where's my father?

344
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,640
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

345
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,087
Please, let me see my father.

346
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,050
Father, where are you?
Don't let her do this.

347
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,407
Please let go!

348
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,169
Let me see my father! Where are you?
Please!

349
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,525
- It's what the Lord wants.
- No.

350
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,725
- Please! Let go! No!
- It's a good thing.

351
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,842
- A great thing.
- Stop!

352
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,968
- Please!
- Hear us now, my Lord.

353
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,725
- You can't do this!
- For you, we offer up this girl...

354
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,201
- Please!
- ...that you may cleanse her with your fire

355
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,248
and that its light may lead our way.

356
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,402
No, please let me see my father.

357
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,285
If we don't act, we'll all starve here.
All of us.

358
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,204
But if we make this sacrifice...

359
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,411
Accept this token of our faith, my Lord,
and lead us from the darkness.

360
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,642
Lord of Light, show us the way.

361
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,563
Mother, please!

362
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,130
Mother, please!

363
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,850
- Mother!
- We can't.

364
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,287
- There's no other way. She has king's blood.
- Please don't do this!

365
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,283
- Please don't!
- Lord of Light, protect us.

366
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,285
- Father, please!
- For the night is dark and full of terrors.

367
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,884
Father, don't do this! Please!

368
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,328
Mother, no! Please, help!

369
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,767
Don't do this!

370
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,571
Please, Father! Mother, help!

371
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,723
- No.
- No, please! Don't do this!

372
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,168
Don't do this, please, Mother!

373
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,086
Please, Mother! Help!

374
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,049
Mother, help!

375
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,801
Please don't do this, Mother!

376
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,042
Please, Mother!

377
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,206
Please! No!

378
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,124
No!

379
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,284
Where have you been?

380
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,567
Just making sure everything is in order.

381
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,051
Free Citizens of Meereen!

382
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,327
By the blessings of the Graces,

383
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,121
and her majesty the Queen,

384
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,960
welcome

385
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,487
to the Great Games!

386
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,611
My Queen, our first contest.

387
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,527
Who will triumph:

388
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,410
the strong,

389
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,284
or the quick?

390
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,082
I fight and die for your glory,

391
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,842
oh glorious Queen.

392
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,729
I fight and die for your glory,

393
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,883
oh glorious Queen.

394
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,281
They're waiting for you.

395
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,770
Clap your hands.

396
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,891
That one, the smaller man.

397
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,530
No question,
that's where you should put your money.

398
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,886
The smaller man it is.

399
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,849
I'm not putting my money anywhere.

400
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,082
Kings and queens never bet on the games.

401
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,640
Perhaps you should
go find someone who does.

402
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,566
People used to bet against me
when I fought in the pits.

403
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,405
He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

404
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,403
I've spent much of my life in this arena.

405
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,963
And in my experience, large men do triumph
over smaller men far more often than not.

406
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,884
Has your experience
ever involved any actual fighting?

407
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,610
You yourself?

408
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,445
Have you ever tried to kill another man
who was trying to kill you?

409
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,604
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

410
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,331
the crowd saw me,
all skin and bone back then,

411
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,370
then they saw a pile of angry muscles
ready to murder me.

412
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,727
They couldn't get
their money out fast enough.

413
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,247
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

414
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,766
or here.

415
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,449
And the big men were always too slow

416
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,330
to stop my dagger
from going where their muscles weren't.

417
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,166
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one
standing across from me

418
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,404
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

419
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,889
You don't approve?

420
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,930
There's always been more than enough death
in the world for my taste.

421
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,970
- I can do without it in my leisure time.
- Fair enough.

422
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,610
Yet it's an unpleasant question,

423
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,810
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

424
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,282
It's easy to confuse
what is with what ought to be,

425
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,204
especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.

426
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,850
I'm not talking about myself.

427
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,241
I'm talking about
the necessary conditions for greatness.

428
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,448
That is greatness?

429
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,764
That is a vital part
of the great city of Meereen,

430
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,763
which existed long before you or I

431
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,084
and will remain standing
long after we have returned to the dirt.

432
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,083
My father would have liked you.

433
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,002
We ask again: Who will triumph?

434
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,521
One day your great city
will return to the dirt as well.

435
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,728
- At your command?
- If need be.

436
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,651
A Meereenese champion?

437
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,521
And how many people will die
to make this happen?

438
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,729
If it comes to that,
they will have died for a good reason.

439
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,928
Those men think
they're dying for a good reason.

440
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,650
Someone else's reason.

441
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,326
So your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

442
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,289
They don't know their own minds,
but you do?

443
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,970
Well said. You're an eloquent man.

444
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,804
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

445
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,327
In my experience, eloquent men are right
every bit as often as imbeciles.

446
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,968
Or a Westerosi knight?

447
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,481
I fight and die for your glory,

448
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,890
oh glorious Queen.

449
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,806
- Your Grace...
- Shut your mouth.

450
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,282
- You can end this.
- She cannot.

451
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,044
You can.

452
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,966
Protect your queen!

453
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,284
Go!

454
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,410
Your Grace!

455
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,051
Come with me. I know a way out.
I know a way...

456
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,161
Stay close.

457
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,005
This way.

458
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,201
The other side. Follow me.

459
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,122
Protect your queen!

460
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,849
Drogon!

461
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,246
Valahd.
