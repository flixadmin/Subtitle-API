{\an8}For the last two and a half years,
many of you called me a hero.

21
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,708
{\an8}- Hero!
- Hero!

22
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,500
{\an8}- You're a hero!
- No, no, no. Make no mistake.

23
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,833
{\an8}I'm no hero. I'm just an ordinary man.

24
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,291
{\an8}A man had enough courage

25
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,500
{\an8}to refuse to kneel
before a group of terrorists.

26
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,291
{\an8}Let me tell you.
That's why I can be here today.

27
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,666
{\an8}My dignity remains intact.

28
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,916
{\an8}Meanwhile, those rats

29
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,500
{\an8}are still hiding somewhere in their holes.

{\an8}There are some people who find
those terrorists charming and likable.

35
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,625
{\an8}Yeah, believe me.
They think they're funny.

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,166
{\an8}And I ask myself,
"Is it funny to be a criminal?"

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,500
{\an8}- No!
- No!

38
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,833
{\an8}Does a terrorist deserve
to be considered a hero?

39
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,083
{\an8}No!

40
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,000
{\an8}Is the so-called Professor
some kind of Robin Hood?

41
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,208
{\an8}- No!
- No! Helsinki…

42
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,833
{\an8}the monster from the Balkans.

43
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,041
{\an8}For 24 hours straight,

44
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:55,666
{\an8}this bum had a freaking bomb
strapped to my body.

45
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,875
{\an8}- Can he be anyone's idol?
- No!

46
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,541
{\an8}- No!
- No, never.

47
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,458
{\an8}I can only hope

48
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,625
{\an8}that he feels guilty

49
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,916
{\an8}and this weighs on his conscious
for the rest of his miserable life.

50
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,125
{\an8}I attacked the so-called Denver
with a pair of blunt scissors.

51
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,250
{\an8}He had an M16.

52
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,083
{\an8}Suicidal?

53
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,041
{\an8}Maybe, but thanks to that,
the first hostages could escape.

54
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,708
{\an8}In exchange, he took what I loved most.

55
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,041
{\an8}Mónica Gaztambide.

56
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,125
{\an8}- Forget her!
- My mistress!

57
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,791
Because I've made mistakes along the way.

58
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,541
Yeah, I admit that I've been unfaithful.

59
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,791
I've also been selfish and despicable.

60
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,833
And as a result,

61
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,750
I lost absolutely everything in my life.

62
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,666
These days, when I wake up in the morning,

63
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,916
my only thought is
"What happened to my poor son?"

64
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,416
You know, that looks like shit
but I bet it's fresh.

65
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,166
Whoa! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

66
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,458
Love you, love you, love you!

67
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,541
You know, life…

68
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,958
Life is lost if you stop making decisions.

69
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,833
We get carried away
by that unstoppable inertia.

70
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,583
I was a hostage.

71
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,750
But at some point…

72
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,791
at some point,
we all become hostages to something.

73
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,833
Yes.

74
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,166
And when you accept that,

75
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,916
that's when you make your mind up.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,541
- Yes!
- I make my own decisions!

77
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,041
I face my problems! Everyone!

78
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,125
I make my own decisions!

79
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,333
I face my problems!

80
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,958
I make my own decisions!
I face my problems!

81
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,583
<i>Everyone, you got it!</i>

82
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,625
<i>I face my problems!</i>

83
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,291
<i>I make up my own decisions!</i>
<i>I face my problems!</i>

00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,000
<i>But with some luxury.</i>

92
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,166
<i>But all of this is about to be fucked</i>

93
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,291
<i>because of a decision</i>
<i>that will enter my mind right now.</i>

94
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,375
We've been here over two years.

95
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,291
Two years in paradise.

96
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,208
Paradise is wonderful
when your life is dull

97
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,208
and full of traffic and

98
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,250
as an escape every now and then.

99
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,875
You need a change of scenery, right?

100
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,166
And that doesn't include me,

101
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,458
does it?

102
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,458
This lasted a while.

103
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,166
Rio…

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,333
I need to get out of here.

105
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,500
I need noise.

106
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:13,791
I need people.

107
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,041
To not know where I'll be tomorrow.

108
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,875
I understand.

109
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,166
I think I'll leave here too.

110
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,500
An adventure will do us both good.

111
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,083
I'm not sure how long I'll be gone.

112
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,666
Better to think it's forever.

113
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,666
Tokyo!

114
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,208
Tokyo!

115
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,791
If you wanna talk.

116
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,708
It's a satellite phone. I bought it
off the black market with Helsinki.

117
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,416
- Rio…
- It's unregistered.

Turn it on at 6:00 p.m. every three days.

119
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,708
If one of us wants to talk,
just turn it on for five minutes

120
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,416
and then turn it off if I don't answer.

121
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:00,875
Okay?

122
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,416
My number's on the back.

123
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,583
Go on, it's gonna get dark soon.

124
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,291
Party time?

125
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,416
Party time!

126
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,250
<i>I can behave like a proper girl</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

127
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,083
<i>But, little by little, the naughty girl</i>
<i>inside of me starts to take over.</i>

128
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,458
<i>Until I simply explode.</i>

129
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,833
<i>And when I transform into a satellite,</i>

130
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,416

00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,750
Hey, Tokyo.

156
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,666
Confirmed. It's Tokyo.

157
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,416
<i>Police is on the way.</i>

158
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,250
I'm sorry for the wait.

159
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,458
<i>How are you?</i>

160
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,041
Well, I'm here. Three days
of doing nothing on this fucking island.

161
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,375
- <i>Police are in Cinta Costera.</i>
- Let's go.

162
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,541
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>
<i>I can't stand the Gunas' food.</i>

163
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:49,291
Shit, in all my life, I only ate pizzas
and burgers, fries and packs of hot dogs…

164
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,000
<i>That's what I fucking wanna eat.</i>

165
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,041
I don't wanna be here
with these people anymore.

166
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,916
You can't get a laugh out of them.

167
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,125
Police are in
the Chorrillo neighborhood.

168
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,583
Come on, come on, come on!

169
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,750
I wanna party with you

170
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,291
to chunda chunda.

171
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,708
And we get wasted and our pupils
look like fucking raccoons'.

172
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,916
<i>That's what I want, Tokyo, fuck!</i>

173
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,416
Even for just one date.

174
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,250
Ah, you wanna go on a date?

175
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,000
Of course I wanna go on a date.

176
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,583
Then why don't you pick a city?
And I'll be there.

177
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:28,916
Rio de Janeiro.

178
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,583
Shit.

179
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,916
What?

180
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,708
Patrol boats.

181
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,833
What?

182
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,000
Patrol boats!

183
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,250
Run, Tokyo! They found us.

184
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,458
- We're about to reach the plaza.
- Okay.

185
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,125
Alpha team, move through the alley.

186
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,416
Go back. Surround the building.

187
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,583
Alpha team,
through the Pedro Barrio passage.

188
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,166
- We're inside.
- Move! Move!

189
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,875
{\an8}<i>Eagle to Fox 1,</i>
<i>we can't see the target.</i>

190
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,166
Clear.

191
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,416
Cubeta, go through
Bodegón alley. It's a shortcut.

192
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,708
Come on, come on, come on!

193
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,583
Listen Cubeta, she's in the courtyard.

194
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,458
We are surrounding her, Colonel.

195
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,208
I got you now, bitch! I got you!

196
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,500
- Bravo 2 in position.
- Bravo 1 in position.

197
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:30,083
Drop the weapon!
We have you surrounded. Drop it!

198
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,666
Drop your gun. Drop it!

199
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,000
Go, go!

200
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,291
- Lower your weapons!
- Easy. Guns down.

201
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,833
Negative. It's not her.

202
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,875
- Shit!
- Fucking bitch.

203
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,041
That way, that way!

204
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,958
Go, go, go!

205
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,041
Let's go, come on!

206
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,000
<i>Guilty.</i>

207
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,041
<i>Guilty.</i>

208
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,291
<i>That's how I felt</i>

209
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,875
<i>while thinking about every moment</i>
<i>of happiness I'd spent with Rio…</i>

210
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,875
<i>since we got our freedom.</i>

211
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:04,750
{\an8}PORTUGAL'S MARITIME BORDER
THREE YEARS UNTIL D-DAY

212
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,458
Everyone.

213
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,125
Two hundred nautical miles.

214
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,958
We just entered international waters.

215
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes! We did it, Helsi!

216
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,583
Yes, that's it!

217
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,916
Professor!

218
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,750
Come on!

219
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:53,916
Rich!

220
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,625
Finish the champagne.
We have some new concepts to look at.

221
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,666
Professor…

222
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,000
Come on.

223
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,083
We have ten fucking billion now.
You think I'm gonna go back to class?

224
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,625
We've escaped,
but now comes the most difficult part.

225
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,000
Managing to survive.

226
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,916
Don't open them yet.
Wait until you're alone.

227
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,916
What's this?

228
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,833
Safe houses. Every couple has their own.

229
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,000
I gather you and Helsinki
will stay together.

230
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:34,916
Huh?

231
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,791
- Why the hell not.
- Great.

232
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,166
You'll be safe,
under protection and surveillance.

233
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,666
Interpol won't be able to do anything.
Denver, not now.

234
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,833
What did I do?

235
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,416
I said open them when you're on your own.

236
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:56,666
I'm the only one who should know
where you are at every moment.

237
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,750
What are those numbers?

238
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,250
AUSTRALIA, AFRICA, ASIA, LATIN AMERICA

239
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,250
Each number corresponds to a continent.

240
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:10,041
A continent where you could go
in case you need help.

241
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,750
So memorize them.

242
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,500
Now.

243
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:23,250
{\an8}COLOMBIA, 72 DAYS UNTIL D-DAY

244
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,416
<i>These are phone numbers.</i>

245
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,916
<i>In case of an emergency,</i>
<i>dial the number that matches your location</i>

246
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,125
<i>and you'll be connected to a transporter.</i>

247
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,166
These transporters are inactive units
that will bring you to me

248
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:02,750
safely.

249
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,666
<i>Yes?</i>

250
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,625
My name is Tokyo,

251
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,041
I'm looking for my transporter.

252
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,166
Aren't you going with them?

253
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,833
Yeah, I'm going.

254
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,291
And you?

255
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:30,750
Me?

256
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,416
Where are you going?

257
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,166
I hope the day never comes
when you need to find out.

258
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,458
<i>But the day came.</i>

263

Come on.

264
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,333
Enter the temple and they'll come for you.

265
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,250
<i>It took me 11 days to reach</i>
<i>the temple where my transporter left me.</i>

266
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,000
<i>After an oil tanker, two cargo planes</i>

<i>…my guardian angel appeared.</i>

269
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,958
Welcome to Thailand.

270
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,416
I don't think
I've ever been so happy to see someone.

271
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,666
Professor…

272
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,416
Have you heard from Rio?

273
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,166
Mama!

274
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,500
Mama!

275
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,083
PALAWAN, 62 DAYS UNTIL D-DAY

276
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,416
Mom, are you okay? You good?

277
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,625
Are you cold?

278
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,125
Come out of the water. Okay?

279
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,666
Come on. Let's get out. Okay?

280
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,916
Yes, yes.

281
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,916
- Mommy, what happened?
- It's okay. Grandma's fine.

282
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,833
Adorable.

283
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,833
Mom went into the water again
with her clothes on.

284
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,625
I fell in the water.

285
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,708
Raquel.

286
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,916
My love, how did your trip go?

287
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:23,708
Pack your bags.

288
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:25,625
But why?

289
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Tokyo's here.

290
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,083
Raquel, Raquel…

291
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,333
Until we find out what happened,

292
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:37,125
it's best if you leave
with your daughter and mother to Mindanao.

293
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,708
Even though this place is not safe,
you're gonna stay?

294
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,625
It's for the best.

295
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,875
Because you have to solve Tokyo's problem.

296
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:49,875
On your own.

297
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,916
If you are thinking of hiding me from her,

298
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,791
you need to think of a better plan.

299
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:38,041
Hey.

300
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,625
- Why is this bitch here?
- Calm down. She's one of us now.

301
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:42,916
Let's say I changed.

302
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,958
You know who changes sides in wars?

303
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,750
- Fucking traitors.
- Tokyo.

304
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,416
- Only absolute shit.
- Tokyo.

305
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,875
You know what happens to those rats?

306
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:55,041
They change sides once, twice,

307
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:56,875
a hundred million times.

308
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,958
- Tokyo, please.
- She'll turn against you.

309
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,833
She's gonna betray you
like she betrayed them.

310
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,791
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh no?

311
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,250
How do you know? Tell me!

312
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,333
- I know.
- Yeah?

313
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,708
- I have absolute certainty.
- "Absolute certainty"?

314
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,041
You think with your dick now?

315
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,458
If the Professor says
I'm one of you, then I am.

316
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,541
Is that clear?

317
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,166
Oh, tough bitch.

318
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,125
We won't get along like that, Inspector.

319
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,333
Lisbon.

320
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,583
My name is Lisbon.

321
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,583
Well, now, after that very…

322
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,833
endearing reunion, let's go have some tea.

323
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,583
Please.

324
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:51,583
Hands up! Get down!
I told you to get down!

325
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,583
Get down!
Hands behind your back!

326
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,458
Don't move!

327
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,458
How long ago was that?

328
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,250
Eleven days.

329
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,083
Where did you get
the satellite phones?

330
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,333
When we split into two ships,

331
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,291
we went to Casablanca for 24 hours.

332
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,375
We got them off the black market.

333
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:16,708
From a Libyan.

334
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,833
- Casablanca…
- They weren't registered.

335
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,583
Well, it looks like they were.

336
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,041
Not only that…

337
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,708
That person reported you.

338
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,375
And most likely got paid
for the information.

339
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,125
Professor…

340
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,916
Are you positive that Rio was caught?

341
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,750
If not, he would have called
his transporter like you did.

342
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,916
No one's published anything.

343
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,208
It's been 11 days already.

344
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,666
It's the biggest news
the government could release.

345
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,958
Why would they keep it a secret?
It's a mother fucking bombshell. And…

346
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,333
How long can they keep him incommunicado?

347
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,333
Seventy-two hours.

348
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,708
Where do they have him?

349
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,375
They're not torturing him.

350
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,458
I don't know, Tokyo. I don't know.

351
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,916
You can bet he's being tortured.

352
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,791
All democratic countries

353
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,208
have a backyard to play dirty
if things get ugly.

354
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,541
And we've made things very ugly.

355
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,500
Well, you have.

356
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:36,791
They can't torture him.

357
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,416
It's the 21st century.

358
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,541
Of course they can.

359
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:46,000
At a height of 35,000 feet
above jurisdiction,

360
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:50,375
on CIA flights or in Guantanamo…

361
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:54,333
Even Spain organized a terrorist commando.
Tokyo, are you fucking serious?

362
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,375
Professor.

363
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,708
We need to get Rio out.

364
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:01,708
Are you listening?

365
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,458
We need to rescue Rio.

366
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,291
Did anyone else buy phones?

367
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,375
Yeah, Helsinki.

368
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,208
We need to get the gang back.

369
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,625
Professor!

370
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:35,916
Professor!

371
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,750
Tell me you're gonna save Rio.

372
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:43,250
And how, Tokyo?

373
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:48,333
We don't even know what country,
prison or goddamn hole he's in right now.

374
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:50,916
We know nothing.

375
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,416
Nothing.

376
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,375
Professor!

377
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,208
Professor!

378
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,708
I'm happy to see you. Very happy.

379
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:51,333
- Miss Gaztambide.
- You can call her "Mrs."

380
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:54,208
We got married.
A Balinese ceremony on an elephant.

381
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:57,666
Tokyo!

382
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,041
Tokyo!

383
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,916
Tokyo! Tokyo!

384
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:03,708

00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:25,000
Professor!

389
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,416
Slow down, Helsinki!

390
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:30,958
Slow down! What are you, nuts?

391
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,416
Helsinki!

Oh, my dress!

396
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,375
What's up?

397
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,250
You gonna hug me or what?

398
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,791
- Cheers to the baby.
- Be quiet or the baby will wake up.

399
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,583
Say it with an Argentinian accent.

400
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,833
<i>Che, boludo. </i>Congratulations.

401
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,041
That is the worst Argentinian accent
I've heard in my life.

402
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,833
- Your house is beautiful.
- It feels like heaven here.

403
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,000
- And Rio?
- He knows it.

404
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:21,958
Rio isn't coming.

405
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,958
He was arrested.

406
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:29,750
When?

407
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,583
17 days ago on an island in the Caribbean.

408
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,083
It hasn't been made public yet.

409
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,375
He's in some shit hole being tortured.

410
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,083
How did they find him?

411
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:45,625
He was using a satellite phone.

412
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,541
Was he in trouble?

413
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,333
No.

414
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,666
There were rules.

415
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,291
No Europe.

416
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,041
No access to phones.

417
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,875
What the fuck are we doing here?

418
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,166
You're here for safety reasons.

419
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,750
What safety reasons?
Rio didn't know where we were.

420
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:13,750
Guys…

421
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:16,375
we have to help him.

422
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:20,291
Come on, come on, come on.
What the fuck are we doing here?

423
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,791
Are you actually thinking
we're gonna rescue Rio?

424
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,833
Yes, Denver.

425
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,041
That's what I'm thinking.

426
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,291
Mother fucker.

427
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:43,500
You made me cross the world
with a small baby to tell me this shit?

428
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,333
- Are you smoking opium, Professor?
- Denver, sit down.

429
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,208
What do you think this is? A video game?

430
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,208
- You're not my fucking boss!
- Sit down.

431
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:52,500
You owe me this fucking life!

432
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,291
Do you understand that?!

433
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,916
You owe me all of this.
That fucking backyard.

434
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,375
Even that fucking sea
because you can't bring my father back.

435
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,458
Do you get that?

436
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:04,875
I have a son.

437
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:09,666
I fucking swear I'm not gonna let him
suffer as much as I did.

438
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,916
Go and ask him

439
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,583
if he wants his father's body
to be full of bullets.

440
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,125
- Ask him.
- Denver.

441
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,750
They have him in a bathtub
with a bag over his head.

442
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:22,666
- Do you understand?
- I am sorry but that's his problem.

443
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,875
That face

444
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,083
you're looking at right now

445
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,750
is the same face your dad was looking at
while you were trying to open the tunnel.

446
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,416
She didn't leave his side for a second.

447
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,083
Tokyo was there.

448
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,041
Rio made a mistake.

449
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,000
You also made mistakes.

450
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:55,666
You took your father up to the roof.
You two could've been killed.

451
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,791
But the gang was there.

452
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,458
Helsinki, you took the car
to the scrapyard, but didn't crush it.

453
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,125
We fixed it.

454
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,083
The gang was there.

455
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,291
You were late to stop the machines,

456
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:12,833
Nairobi.

457
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,250
And the police came in.

458
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,875
You escaped through the tunnel
because Berlin…

459
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,375
stayed there to hold them back.

460
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,250
He gave us the seconds we needed.

461
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,083
The gang was there.

462
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,000
The one who isn't here…

463
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:38,500
is Berlin…

464
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:41,541
and Oslo…

465
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:45,625
and Moscow.

466
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,416
What the fuck?

467
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:04,416
She's one of us.

468
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,416
I made a mistake.

469
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,083
I lost control.

470
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:15,833
The gang was there.

471
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,250
Now Rio's made a mistake

472
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,208
like the rest of us.

473
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,208
I can't ask you to feel what I feel, but…

474
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,333
But I really feel responsible

475
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:44,625
that some

476
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,708
son of a bitch

477
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,916
is giving him electric shocks
as he hangs from his ankles.

478
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,041
I'm going!

479
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,375
Not alone, Nairobi.

480
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,791
Because if you're going, I'm going too.

481
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,458
Here we fucking go.

482
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,583
How will we rescue Rio?

483
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,875
With a robbery.
That's what we're good at.

484
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,041
Rescue him with a robbery?

485
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,791
We will begin

486
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,250
with a robbery.

487
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,250
But…

488
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,833
But actually we're gonna
defy the establishment.

489
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:15,583
This time, we won't be those guys
who take hostages to make their own money.

490
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,416
We'll be the ones who take a stand.

491
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,375
The ones who say, "Enough is enough."

492
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:28,125
What they're doing to Rio
is a declaration of war.

493
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,708
And we're the resistance.

494
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:32,750
No?

495
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,208
What are we gonna rob?

496
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,875
The gold.

497
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:39,791
Gold?

498
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,125
Not just gold.

499
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,208
<i>The</i> gold.

500
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,541
The only gold that matters.

501
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,250
The National Reserve at the Bank of Spain.

502
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:56,625
Isn't that gonna be a big mess?

503
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,291
Never been a bigger one.

504
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:02,083
You just thought of this now,
while watching the sunrise?

505
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,666
No, it's not my plan.

506
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,458
Your father's?

507
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,208
No, not my father's.

508
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:25,208
{\an8}FLORENCE, FIVE YEARS UNTIL D-DAY

509
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,375
Andrés.

510
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,333
Little brother.

511
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,666
Welcome to Italy.

512
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,416
A country
full of art and class…

513
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,583
where everyone dresses with style.

514
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,375
Unlike you.

515
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,166
You look like a salesman.

516
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,958
Come with me.

517
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,958
Off to my humble abode.

518
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,833
I have so many things I wanna tell you.

519
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,375
This is your home?
"The abode in the country"?

520
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,833
You begin by looking for something
with two bathrooms and a garden,

521
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:45,125
and you end up renovating a monastery.

522
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:53,333
- I know how to break into the Royal Mint.
- Through the front door?

523
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:55,750
The back.
On the truck with the currency paper.

524
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:01,208
Andrés, there's people here.

525
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:04,375
Relax, we don't bother each other.
They're the perfect neighbors.

526
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,166
- They're monks.
- Cistercians.

527
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,458
They live on one wing
and we're on the other.

528
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,750
Besides, they're sworn to silence.

529
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:14,625
They've taken a vow of silence,
not at gunpoint or before a judge,

530
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,291
but before God Almighty.

531
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,125
Makes things much more interesting, right?

532
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:22,541
And…

533
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:24,333
um… what did you tell them?

534
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,250
That I'm an intellectual
in need of austerity and solitude,

535
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:30,000
so I can write a treatise
on theological philosophy.

536
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,250
And they believed you?

537
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,916
I also paid for the renovations

538
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,125
so they didn't have to turn
this beautiful place into a hotel.

539
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:38,375
They don't need much. They love me.

540
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,666
Sometimes I sing
Gregorian chants with them.

541
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:44,125
Watch your head.

542
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,583
Andrés, do you sleep in a cell?

543
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,750
Well, I intended to, but I fell in love…

544
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:54,875
with this chapel.

545
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,375
Look at this beauty.

546
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:32,291
Sergio, my dear friend. How are you?
Long time no see. Come here.

547
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,291
What is this?

548
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:37,541
Do you remember that old plan
to steal gold from the Bank of Spain?

549
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:41,833
It's remarkable. We can obtain up to
90 tons of gold from the inside there.

550
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:45,875
We found a way to do it
and I think you're gonna love it.

551
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:49,583
It's the most brilliant civil engineering
since the Panama Canal. I guarantee it.

552
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:52,708
No. Wait a minute. Wait.
I've told you a million times.

553
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,458
You can get the gold, but, Andrés,

554
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,875
there's no way you'll leave
the Bank of Spain alive.

555
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:01,500
Well, that's just a small detail.
The gold comes first.

556
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,916
- Then the people, right Andrés?
- That's right.

557
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,041
- What do you mean "small detail"?
- Let's think about all that later.

558
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,583
Brother, do you notice
something different about me?

559
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,208
- No.
- I have to tell you about a woman. Come.

560
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:15,791
Take a look.

561
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:17,583
My sweetheart.

562
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,083
May I present Tatiana.

563
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,458
She's very beautiful.

564
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,125
She's madly in love with me.

565
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,583
She's a goddess.

566
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,250
I think he's gonna like her.

567
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,875

AGAIN

579
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,500
Well, most of you already know the rules,

580
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:59,333
but since there are some new faces,
I'll remind you.

581
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:02,250
First of all, there will be
<i>no</i> personal relationships.

582
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:07,333
All right, that rule's been…

583
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:12,500
The second rule is that we're not allowed
to use first or last names.

584
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:13,625
Professor.

585
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:18,208
Let's cut the bullshit. How will we
be breaking into the Bank of Spain?

586
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,208
By making a lot of noise.

587
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,833
MADRID, D-DAY

588
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,208
<i>Nowadays,</i>

589
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,541
<i>wars start with bombings.</i>

590
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:08,208
<i>So did ours.</i>

591
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:34,625
<i>That day, in Madrid,</i>
<i>it rained over 140 million euros.</i>

592
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,250
<i>That was our way of saying</i>

593
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,333
<i>"We're back."</i>
