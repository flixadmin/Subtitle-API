1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,007
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,094 --> 00:00:05,656
Gotham falls, we rise.

3
00:00:09,836 --> 00:00:12,849
<i>After the bridges blew,
the city was up for grabs.</i>

4
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:16,265
<i>Gangs are carving up territory.</i>

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,250
We are running out of food.

6
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:23,788
<i>Ammunition.</i>

7
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,825
We are surrounded by hostile forces.

8
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:32,749
Say hello to Butch.

9
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:42,556
Put out the word.
100,000 rounds of ammunition

10
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:44,727
to whoever kills Jim Gordon.

11
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:49,668
<i>You want to cure her?</i>

12
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:51,285
You have to go to the witch.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,500
And where do I find this witch?

14
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:56,098
You have to help us.

15
00:00:56,176 --> 00:00:57,987
My brothers and sisters,

16
00:00:58,198 --> 00:00:59,609
they're killing us.

17
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:05,050
His name is Will Thomas.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,749
Parents died in a home invasion

19
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:08,584
a few weeks after the bridges came down.

20
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,671
Guys that broke in
took him to some sort of factory

21
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:14,770
where he was held alongside
dozens of other stolen kids,

22
00:01:14,848 --> 00:01:16,459
all chained together.

23
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,760
God.

24
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,512
Who are these guys?

25
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:21,747
Call themselves The Soothsayers.

26
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:24,294
- You ever heard of them?
- No.

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,137
But who can keep track these days?

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,934
- Which district?
- Granton. Near the water, he said.

29
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:31,012
Had them digging some sort of tunnel.

30
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:33,252
Will broke free
from his restraints last night

31
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:36,190
and walked nine miles through
the Dark Zone to find us.

32
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,705
What kind of tunnel?

33
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:39,732
Unclear.

34
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:44,149
There's an abandoned waterworks
by the old dock in Granton.

35
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,789
Detective Gordon?

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,377
My friends.

37
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,088
You'll save them, won't you?

38
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:55,631
I'll look into it.

39
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,516
The Soothsayers
won't be happy I escaped.

40
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:00,745
They'll punish the others for it.

41
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:03,506
Please, Mr. Gordon.

42
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,091
I promised them I'd bring help.

43
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,761
I know it's a sad story
and emotions are high,

44
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:13,196
but need I remind you that
every two-bit criminal out there

45
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:14,839
is looking to kill you
to claim Penguin's bounty?

46
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,081
So you're saying we do nothing?

47
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,147
No, I'm saying the second
you step outside that door,

48
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,295
someone's gonna take a shot at you,

49
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,453
and if it's not you that's getting hit,

50
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,091
it's gonna be the schmo
standing next to you,

51
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:23,681
which is most likely gonna be me.

52
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:25,327
Captain.

53
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,921
There's a call from the mainland.

54
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:30,859
<i>All of us here believe</i>

55
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,070
<i>that if peace is to be sustained
on the island,</i>

56
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,967
<i>confrontations must be avoided.</i>

57
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:37,412
We have kids in danger out there.

58
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,389
We're their only hope for rescue.

59
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:42,090
<i>Your dedication to your job
is admirable, Captain,</i>

60
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:43,559
<i>but you lack perspective.</i>

61
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:46,004
<i>Travel into harm's way,
and you may save a few lives,</i>

62
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,332
<i>but you'd also be jeopardizing</i>

63
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,084
<i>thousands of others
should you be killed.</i>

64
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,615
<i>The collective opinion over here
is that you stand down</i>

65
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:54,827
<i>and keep those
within your Green Zone safe.</i>

66
00:02:54,897 --> 00:02:56,819
I don't need opinions, I need supplies.

67
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:58,448
When can I expect them?

68
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:01,036
<i>Until Gotham airspace
can be declared safe again,</i>

69
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,208
<i>we cannot sacrifice any more pilots,</i>

70
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:05,982
<i>whether they're ours
or Wayne Enterprises'.</i>

71
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,764
So you can save a few lives
for thousands, but I can't?

72
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,782
<i>Mr. Gordon...</i>

73
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:18,231
Jim.

74
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:22,348
I need five men and transport
for 20 kids or more.

75
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,416
We only have a few squad cars

76
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:26,055
and that rust bucket transporter.

77
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,717
That'll have to do. How are we on ammo?

78
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:29,272
Well, we got what we got from Penguin,

79
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,790
and we got a box of shotgun shells

80
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,102
and a box of nine mils.

81
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:33,923
What did the bureaucrats
on the mainland say?

82
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:35,445
Do nothing, protect the Green Zone.

83
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:38,183
Four shells each. Half a mag each.

84
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,450
Boy said The Soothsayers are here.

85
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,550
That means we have to pass
through Sirens territory,

86
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:44,381
but it's only three
or four miles from then on.

87
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,438
Three or four miles into the Dark Zone?

88
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,241
God only knows what's out there.

89
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:50,293
Barbara's been stockpiling vehicles

90
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:52,060
and everything else
as payment to enter her club.

91
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:53,801
It's worth a shot.
She's gonna be thrilled

92
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:56,632
to see you after what
happened with Tabitha.

93
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:58,607
We're gonna need housing
for those kids when we get back.

94
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,553
- Yep.
- <i>If</i> we get back.

95
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:49,980
Let him go.

96
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:59,207
- Are you with her?
- Who?

97
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,856
The witch.

98
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:05,511
I'm not with the witch.

99
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:07,072
I just came here for her help.

100
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,650
Come for her magic, have you?

101
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:11,033
So did others from our district.

102
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,468
And look at them now.

103
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:13,962
They came for help, too,

104
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,471
and she took their souls.

105
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:17,606
But she'll never kill again.

106
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,475
We have her this time.

107
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,220
You captured her?

108
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:23,045
She's locked
in the storeroom back there.

109
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:25,464
We stripped it clean
before we locked her in.

110
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:28,797
The plants, you see.

111
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,791
She talks to them.

112
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:34,250
Makes them do things.

113
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:39,111
So we took her light, water;
put salt on the floor.

114
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:41,075
She's helpless now.

115
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,315
I need to talk to her.

116
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,140
No.

117
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,132
We sent for more of us.

118
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:49,288
When they come, we burn her.

119
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:54,162
Listen.

120
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
My brother is missing.

121
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,372
I know this witch took him.

122
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,383
I need to find out
what she did with him.

123
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,252
Please, let me talk to her.
Five minutes is all I need,

124
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:05,087
and then you can do whatever you want.

125
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:07,256
Your brother's dead.

126
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:09,392
She'll kill you, too.

127
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,344
Five minutes.

128
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,045
In there.

129
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,369

This place is busy, despite things.

142
00:08:19,462 --> 00:08:22,191
So, what brings you crawling out
into the open tonight?

143
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:23,303
Come to join the party?

144
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,685
One last hoorah
before someone wastes you?

145
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:26,998
I'm here to ask a favor.

146
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:31,261
A favor, right.

147
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,120
Is this after you stood by and did nothing

148
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:35,972
while my best friend on this Earth

149
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,210
was stabbed through the heart?

150
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:39,546
- I put him down.
- You restored his limp.

151
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:41,280
- He should be dead!
- Barbara.

152
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:43,019
Everybody out!

153
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,233
Now!

154
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:47,420
I said move!

155
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,455
Planning revenge?

156
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:56,409
Well, someone has to do
something about that freak.

157
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:59,854
He has an army. It would be suicide.

158
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,081
Look around, Jim.

159
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:06,302
We're all slowly dying.

160
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:09,597
Just some of us get to choose how.

161
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:13,309
I'm sorry about what happened
to Tabitha.

162
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,470
Things got out of control.

163
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,306
I'm just trying to keep
this city from falling apart.

164
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:28,285
You're too late.

165
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:34,509
So, this favor?

166
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:38,000
I need transportation.

167
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:40,906
- Trucks, maybe.
- Where are you going?

168
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:42,921
It's a police matter.

169
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,094
You know, they should really
write that on your tombstone.

170
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,279
They're downstairs in the basement lot.

171
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:53,559
Knock yourself out.

172
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:57,137
Drive right into this nightmare
you created.

173
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:59,126
You won't last the night.

174
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,025
Here he comes, Gotham.

175
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,578
Your judge, your jailer,
your most hated son!

176
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:08,883
Have at him!

177
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:11,102
Rip him to shreds!

178
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,905
No one deserves to die more than he.

179
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,238
<i>All right, we're entering the Dark Zone.</i>

180
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:37,090
<i>Everybody, stay sharp.</i>

181
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:50,835
<i>This place was a cesspit</i>

182
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:53,138
before the rest of the world
turned its back on us.

183
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:54,817
I wonder what's left here now.

184
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:57,075
I doubt many stayed up here.

185
00:10:57,128 --> 00:11:00,274
This whole grid never regained power.

186
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:12,588
Damn it! You were saying, Jim?

187
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,456
It's a freaking arrow, Jim.

188
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:20,522
It's a freaking arrow!

189
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,717
Welcome to the badlands.

190
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:49,716
Come on.

191
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:51,468
Come on, come on.

192
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,835
Get up!

193
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:56,382
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Leave him alone.

194
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:01,128
Causing trouble again, Gabriel?

195
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:02,877
We need water and food.

196
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:05,252
Some of us haven't slept in two days.

197
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,193
You know, you could've woken me

198
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,312
when that sneaky rat left in the night.

199
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:15,176
But you didn't, and now, he's out there,

200
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:17,421
and he's causing all kinds
of problems for us.

201
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:28,823
The smoke. You should take it.

202
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,141
It'll give you energy.

203
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,579
Inhale enough...

204
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:36,513
...and it'll let you see the future.

205
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:45,570
You fail to see the importance
of our work here, Gabriel.

206
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:48,292
But you see,
once this tunnel is complete,

207
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:51,328
we will have exclusive access
to the mainland.

208
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:55,009
People will be forced
to do business with us.

209
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,532
Food, booze, guns,

210
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,400
smoke.

211
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,800
All will come from the tunnel.

212
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:06,153
We've been digging for over a month.

213
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:08,035
We've only gotten a hundred feet.

214
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:09,486
It's too narrow.

215
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:12,116
The roof is leaking. Once we hit
the river, it'll flood

216
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:14,184
- and kill anyone inside.
- So negative!

217
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:15,486
Gabriel.

218
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,488
Shame.

219
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:21,029
I had such high hopes for you.

220
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:25,035
That one day you would
wear the mask and share

221
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:27,381
in our good fortune.

222
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,133
Never mind.

223
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:32,303
Sykes. Man, you got to come out front.

224
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:47,336
Who was on watch?!

225
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:50,045
Put your weapons down.

226
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:55,192
Is that James Gordon?

227
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:59,196
<i>The</i> James Gordon?

228
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:04,020
It's our lucky day, fellas.

229
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:06,203
Kill this one, and we're bullet rich!

230
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,702
In Penguin's graces we will be.

231
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:19,060
I said put 'em down.

232
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:33,114
Give us the kids
you're holding captive. We'll leave.

233
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,149
Kids?

234
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:37,118
I don't know what you're talking about.

235
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:39,236
What are the cattle prods for?

236
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,265
Fun.

237
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,393
Stay here.

238
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:54,687
He moves, kill him.

239
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,481
It's okay.

240
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:09,316
It's all right. I'm a cop.

241
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:12,723
Will's alive?

242
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,598
He found you and sent you
to rescue us, didn't he?

243
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,090
He did.

244
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,193
Will made it! He's alive!

245
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:21,111
We need the keys.

246
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:24,081
There are trucks outside.

247
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:26,167
We'll drive you to the Green Zone,

248
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:27,597
find you a new home.

249
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:29,073
Thank you. God bless you.

250
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:32,587
Okay, guys. We're gonna get out of here.

251
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:34,478
Gonna help us get out. One at a time.

252
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:36,636
Yeah, we're gonna be okay.

253
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:40,564
Why would anyone be a cop
in a world like this?

254
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,370
Well, the Halloween shop
was all out of gas masks,

255
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:47,588
so it was either this or sexy nurse.

256
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:52,915
You know what?

257
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:56,257
My guess is these cops ain't
got enough ammo to shoot a duck.

258
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:59,755
Wrong. Penguin gave us a boatload.

259
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:02,356
Penguin wants your boss skinned.

260
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:04,286
Let's take 'em, boys.

261
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:08,085
Come on! Go! Go!

262
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:22,952
Hey!

263
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,249
Go!

264
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:33,066
You okay? Come on.

265
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,104
Take cover! Go! Go!

266
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,259
- The alley! Go! Go!
- Come on!

267
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:22,594
Bruce?

268
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,227
Thank God.

269
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:29,233
You have to help me.

270
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:34,205
I didn't kill those men
out there in the vines,

271
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,197
- you have to believe me.
- You'll forgive me

272
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,122
if I find it hard to do so.

273
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,213
It wasn't me.

274
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:46,484
- It was the park.
- The park?

275
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,818
The trees, the plants, the roots

276
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,185
underground...

277
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:55,505
They're speaking to one another.

278
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:58,246
When those men came to kill me...

279
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:01,902
....the plants came to my protection.

280
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:08,356
Then maybe we can help each other.

281
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,391
I have...

282
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:14,362
a friend... who was shot.

283
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:16,197
The bullet severed her spinal cord.

284
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,565
The doctors can't seem to help her.

285
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:21,597
But a woman at the hospital said
that you might be able to.

286
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:24,205
Normally, I would say no.

287
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:29,244
But this park...
ever since we were cut off

288
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,412
from the rest of the world,
it's been behaving differently.

289
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,468
There are things growing here
I have never seen before.

290
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:38,653
You okay in there?

291
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,622
Our friends are on their way.

292
00:18:40,657 --> 00:18:43,012
Time's running out for you, witch!

293
00:18:45,906 --> 00:18:48,419
There's a seed.

294
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:51,958
It's growing under the oaks.

295
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:55,136
It's said to have magical qualities.

296
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,804
When digested, it heads

297
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,281
for damaged tissue and bone,
healing them.

298
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,443
If I help you find it...

299
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,581
...will you protect me
from those men out there?

300
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,103
Yes! Yes!

301
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:37,916
Yes, it worked!

302
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:41,021
No... more...

303
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,049
sleepwalking for me.

304
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,802
Good morning.

305
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:56,113
See, it was just some...

306
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,097
random stupid thing
brought on by stress.

307
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:02,387
It's all in your head.

308
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,125
There's nothing there.

309
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:40,291
Who the hell are you?

310
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,799
What? Are you serious?

311
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:46,381
Very. You don't remember?

312
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,934
- No.
- Oh.

313
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:51,036
Name's Tank.

314
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:55,301
You're part of the Street Demonz gang?

315
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,739
Yeah.

316
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,453
You know that.

317
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:00,528
Why should I?

318
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:03,147
What are you doing here?

319
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,283
You brought me here.

320
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:07,285
- I brought you here?
- Last night.

321
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:11,124
Did I, uh...

322
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:13,241
hit you, et cetera?

323
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:17,278
Any idea why?

324
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:19,247
You wanted information,

325
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:21,299
and I wouldn't give it to you.

326
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:25,205
I'm gonna guess you gave it to me.

327
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:28,548
Huh. I can't remember.

328
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,097
We're gonna have to do this
all again, aren't we?

329
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:35,473
Guess so.

330
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:38,285
Fine.

331
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:43,354
Gordon, where are you?

332
00:21:43,664 --> 00:21:45,614
We need to hide.

333
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,527
Follow me.

334
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:02,290
It's not safe out there.

335
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,210
We've got to get out of the daylight.

336
00:22:06,262 --> 00:22:08,162
We're sitting ducks.
How are they holding up?

337
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:09,347
We'll be fine.

338
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:11,299
Jim, we're not alone.

339
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:13,634
Someone lit that candle.

340
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,550
In the old west, settlers used
to leave a candle burning

341
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:20,508
to lead others to safety.

342
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:22,443
Maybe there's still good
people left in Gotham.

343
00:22:23,563 --> 00:22:25,313
All right, fine.

344
00:22:25,348 --> 00:22:27,093
We'll take a look around.

345
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:29,617
Stay here.

346
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,963
If you see something, shout.

347
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:35,514
Radio check.

348
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,575
Ah, forget it.

349
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:39,660
We're out of range of
the precinct's antenna.

350
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:42,363
Look, if those other trucks
made it back to safety,

351
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:44,365
maybe they'll send someone back
here to get us, huh?

352
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:47,195
Maybe. Until then, I'll take the
next floor, you do the basement.

353
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:51,472
Oh. Check out the basement in a
creepy hotel by myself? Sure.

354
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:53,198
What could go wrong, right?

355
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:04,359
Let's get settled.

356
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:46,140
Hello?

357
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,397
Is somebody there?

358
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:55,227
GCPD.

359
00:24:01,494 --> 00:24:03,461
Come out, now.

360
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:09,417
Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's all right.

361
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,417
Oh, my God.

362
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:46,464
Oh. Not good.

363
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:48,121
Oh, God. This...

364
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:49,423
This is not good.

365
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:53,316
Jim!

366
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:04,016
Fine. I'll tell you.

367
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,423
You wanted to know where the
Street Demonz base was.

368
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:10,126
That's it?

369
00:25:10,188 --> 00:25:12,391
And you wanted to be sure
the boss would be there.

370
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,487
- Emmanuel Vasquez?
- Yeah.

371
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,121
Okay. How did I seem?

372
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:23,375
Was I confident, flamboyant,

373
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,890
charisma for days?

374
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:26,145
Or a little more conservative,

375
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:27,781
kind of repressed, a little nerdy?

376
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:31,408
You seemed stiff, man of few words.

377
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:33,360
In a daze, actually.

378
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:37,414
Interesting.

379
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:39,375
Okay, let's go.

380
00:25:39,443 --> 00:25:41,418
Where?

381
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:43,403
To where you told me to go.

382
00:25:43,506 --> 00:25:45,339
To the Street Demonz' base.

383
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:48,208
To Vasquez.

384
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:50,294
I want to know why I went there.

385
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:03,190
- Oh, no!
- Push her back inside. Lock the door.

386
00:26:03,276 --> 00:26:04,391
Stay calm.

387
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,980
Okay? Her name is Ivy.

388
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,297
She's a witch,

389
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,099
and will burn for what she's done.

390
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:12,101
I take full responsibility for her.

391
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,302
If she's done what you say,

392
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,188
she will pay for her crimes, but...

393
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,480
You are so utterly naive.

394
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,416
You didn't have to kill them.

395
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,451
I wanted to.

396
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:31,171
Why are you here?

397
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,006
I'm here for my friend.

398
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,340
Our friend.

399
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,425
Selina.

400
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,212
Selina's the one that's hurt?

401
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,595
She's paralyzed and has
lost the will to live.

402
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,302
Good.

403
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:50,473
That bitch destroyed the last
of the Lazarus Water.

404
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Let her suffer.

405
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,112
I don't believe you mean that.

406
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,899
You've known each other for a long time.

407
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:59,493
You grew up on the streets together.

408
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:07,373
You know, I wasn't lying when
I said this park is changing.

409
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:11,798
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

410
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,050
It consumes them,
and then it flourishes.

411
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,203
I think I shall plant

412
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,926
your body in the ground, Bruce.

413
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:29,137
What will grow from you, I wonder?

414
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,314
Those men you killed were right.

415
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:35,876
You are a witch.

416
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:39,987
A murderous, callous witch.

417
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:43,243
You trying to bait me, boy?

418
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:45,417
I wouldn't waste my breath.

419
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,364
I can see there's no good left in you.

420
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,532
If you were trying to
help this park flourish,

421
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,086
it would be full of beauty and color.

422
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,371
Instead it smells of death.

423
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,874
It's a work in progress.

424
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:01,993
It's a nightmare.

425
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:08,322
If I do help you, you'll leave me alone?

426
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,439
Follow me.

427
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,115
It's okay.

428
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,601
I'm Jim. What's your name?

429
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,702
I-I can't remember.

430
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:28,007
Where are your parents?

431
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:29,155
Dead.

432
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,601
When the lights went out in the city,

433
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:33,459
a gang came, they murdered them. I ran.

434
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:36,455
- She found me.
- Who?

435
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:37,616
The ghost.

436
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,249
She was kind at first.

437
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:41,762
But she can be very cruel.

438
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,832
Jim!

439
00:28:43,934 --> 00:28:45,332
We're not alone. There's a crazy woman.

440
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:46,409
She's killing people.

441
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:48,129
The ghost. We got to go.

442
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,863
- She hates strangers.
- There's no such thing as ghosts.

443
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:51,395
We'll protect you from whoever she is.

444
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,675
- You can't.
- Why? Who is she?

445
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,574
She makes me call her Mother.

446
00:28:57,628 --> 00:29:00,403
- We got to go.
- He's not lying! Come on, Jim.

447
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,558
Hey!

448
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,414
Hey! Come on!

449
00:29:11,803 --> 00:29:13,386
Kid!

450
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:19,653
Hey, kid!

451
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,174
The lights will make you dizzy.

452
00:29:21,257 --> 00:29:22,458
And then you'll fall asleep.

453
00:29:24,718 --> 00:29:26,162
You won't feel a thing.

454
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:35,052
Jim, I don't feel so good.

455
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:51,287
You can't fight it. Give in to it.

456
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:57,263
Jim!

457
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,062
- Who are you?
- I'm the only mother that boy knows.

458
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:18,147
You're a crazy bitch who kills people,

459
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,085
takes their stuff
and burns their bodies.

460
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,391
I'm protecting him.

461
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,073
When I found him, he was barely alive.

462
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:26,463
Those animals out there,

463
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,979
they would have killed him or worse.

464
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:30,880
I taught him how to survive.

465
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:39,277
Hey!

466
00:30:54,392 --> 00:30:56,132
Where is everybody?

467
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:58,405
- Beats me.
- Come on.

468
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,035
Oh, boy.

469
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:10,144
Holy crap.

470
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:12,798
That's Vasquez.

471
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:16,213
Did you do this?

472
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:19,167
Honestly, I don't remember.

473
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:22,143
What about that?

474
00:31:22,354 --> 00:31:24,821
_

475
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:27,523
Penguin did this.

476
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:29,708
I think not.

477
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:34,033
Well, whoever did
just started one hell of a war.

478
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:19,464
Here.

479
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,089
Is that human blood?

480
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:38,514
If Selina ingests this, it'll
find its way to her wound.

481
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:40,559
Its roots will wrap around her spine,

482
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:43,378
fusing the nerves
and cartilage together.

483
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:45,376
It'll cure her?

484
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:47,345
Maybe.

485
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:50,800
- Just maybe?
- Everyone's different.

486
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:53,318
Depends on how strong she is.

487
00:32:53,812 --> 00:32:56,120
One thing is for sure though...

488
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,607
the seed will alter her forever.

489
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:00,765
- How?
- Some say

490
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:03,879
the darker angels of our nature
are unlocked and set free.

491
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:10,814
Can she live with that?

492
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:14,967
Can you?

493
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,910
I don't know if there's any other way.

494
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:19,880
Then go. Give it to her.

495
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,168
What's the matter, Bruce?

496
00:33:24,222 --> 00:33:26,963
Don't know if you can trust me?

497
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,414
- I don't.
- Good.

498
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:34,278
Then you're finally becoming a man.

499
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:43,937
- Where will you go?
- Where I'm going is none of your business.

500
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:46,056
Best hurry.

501
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:49,098
That root will die if left out
in the open for too long.

502
00:33:56,996 --> 00:33:58,234
Uh...

503
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,441
Where have you guys been?
You've been gone for a while.

504
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:01,753
Chasing ghosts.

505
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:03,097
They're like rats in the walls.

506
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,566
This whole place is their spiderweb.

507
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:05,846
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

508
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:09,434
We got to go. Not everyone
wants your help, Jim Gordon.

509
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:11,379
Detective Gordon, your hand's bleeding.

510
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,084
We need to leave.

511
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,885
Come on.

512
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:20,090
- How many bullets you got left?
- Two.

513
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:45,433
Looky here, boys!

514
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:48,237
I'll tell you what,

515
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:52,144
you give me my workers back,

516
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:54,290
and I'll let you and your partner go.

517
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:01,181
I'm just kidding.

518
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:03,099
Of course I'm not gonna do that.

519
00:35:03,149 --> 00:35:04,968
I'm gonna kill you all!

520
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:08,719
Wait just a minute,

521
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:10,645
please.

522
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:17,121
The prize for this man's head is mine.

523
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:30,941
How is she?

524
00:35:31,944 --> 00:35:33,577
Not great.

525
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,530
I mean, she hasn't said a peep
since you've been gone.

526
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:40,244
You all right?

527
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,429
Did you find the witch?

528
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:43,864
It was Ivy.

529
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,472
What's that?

530
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,609
Ivy said it could help Selina.

531
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,171
- What, and you trust her?
- What choice do I have?

532
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:59,038
Listen, I want to help Selina
as much as you,

533
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:01,545
but Ivy is a maniacal,
cold-hearted killer.

534
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:03,794
- You know that, don't you?
- Give it to me.

535
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:12,113
Selina, I have doubts.

536
00:36:13,243 --> 00:36:15,713
Bruce, I was willing
to kill myself yesterday.

537
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,394
Nothing's changed since then.

538
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:20,705
So if Ivy wants to kill me,

539
00:36:21,284 --> 00:36:22,932
she can have at it.

540
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:32,543
What do I do, just swallow it?

541
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:34,150
Yeah.

542
00:36:50,894 --> 00:36:52,363
Still here.

543
00:36:57,613 --> 00:37:00,871
I know Ivy's lost her mind.

544
00:37:00,984 --> 00:37:02,116
But...

545
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:05,674
after her mom and dad died,
she was just...

546
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:07,674
sleeping on the streets.

547
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:10,776
And it was a cold winter, and...

548
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,650
she started to get really sick.

549
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:16,862
So I...

550
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,838
took her under my wing, I guess,

551
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:25,118
and...

552
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:26,941
showed her where to get food,

553
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:30,300
where to get a roof over her head.

554
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,350
And after some time,

555
00:37:33,403 --> 00:37:35,105
she started to get color in her face.

556
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:41,194
And I just...

557
00:37:42,158 --> 00:37:44,612
kept checking in on her.

558
00:37:45,936 --> 00:37:47,832
Almost every day.

559
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:54,207
She may look old now, but...

560
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:56,955
she'll always be that little girl to me.

561
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,053
- No, no, no, Selina.
- Doctor!

562
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:08,287
- Selina.
- Doctor!

563
00:38:08,306 --> 00:38:09,345
Selina, stay with me.

564
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,964
Stay back. Give us room.

565
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:13,579
No, Selina.

566
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,523
She's burning up.

567
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:17,981
Pulse is low. What happened?

568
00:38:18,054 --> 00:38:19,711
Oh, God, what have I done?

569
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:25,388
Put it down, Knucklehead!

570
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:28,353
You two clowns ain't got
a single bullet between you.

571
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:29,554
Wrong.

572
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:31,223
I got two.

573
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:33,149
Prove it.

574
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:35,125
I won't say it again, freak.

575
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:37,813
Gordon comes with me.

576
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,258
I'll tell you what!

577
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,231
I'll take his head,

578
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:43,114
and you can havethe rest of him!

579
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,565
Hi, Jim.

580
00:39:20,629 --> 00:39:22,579
About our last chat...

581
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:26,360
...I may have been a little rash.

582
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:28,555
This what got you all hot and bothered?

583
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,414
- They need a bath.
- Crazy bi...

584
00:39:38,327 --> 00:39:40,160
Wow.

585
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:42,062
Your last bullet, just for me, huh?

586
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,379
Must be love.

587
00:39:45,414 --> 00:39:47,381
Not all square yet though.

588
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,511
You're gonna help me do
what we all know needs doing.

589
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,213
Oh, yeah? What's that?

590
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,550
Kill Penguin.

591
00:39:57,237 --> 00:39:59,387
How 'bout we table this
until I can get them safely

592
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:01,289
into the Green Zone, huh? Come on.

593
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:13,284
Wow.

594
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:15,569
You're safe now. Go on.

595
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:17,838
You made it.

596
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:19,813
You had me worried.

597
00:40:19,908 --> 00:40:22,301
All sorts of chatter out there
about people hunting

598
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:24,212
you down for Penguin's reward money.

599
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,214
Well, they'll just have to try harder.

600
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:29,517
He did have help from
the unlikeliest of places.

601
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,220
You're welcome.

602
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,670
Show me what you got.

603
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,257
Nice place.

604
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:39,426
250 apartments.
Running water, hot and cold.

605
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:41,195
Gas. No electricity yet.

606
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,563
Is there a bar?

607
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:47,913
Once the kids we liberated moved in,

608
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:49,437
word got out pretty fast that there was

609
00:40:49,456 --> 00:40:51,122
a safe place to live in the city.

610
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,383
Citizens are heading here in droves.

611
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,545
This place will be full by sundown.

612
00:40:59,447 --> 00:41:01,414
Then we'll find another.

613
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:03,584
I just want to thank you,
Captain Gordon.

614
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:06,659
My family, we've been drifting
from one place to the next

615
00:41:06,684 --> 00:41:08,506
ever since the blackout.

616
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,476
You've delivered us.

617
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:15,732
Seriously?

618
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:18,038
I'll see you around, killer.

619
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:21,348
We have some unfinished
business, you and I.

620
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,357
Whatever she took
put her body into shock.

621
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:28,151
Her temperature skyrocketed.

622
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:30,393
Her WBC count was off the charts.

623
00:41:30,452 --> 00:41:34,385
Then, two hours ago,
everything stabilized.

624
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:36,584
I have no idea why.

625
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,505
She was still in a lot of
pain, so we sedated her.

626
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,365
She's been sleeping for a while now.

627
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:46,123
I think it'd be best to
come back in the morning.

628
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:48,463
Thank you, Doctor.

629
00:41:51,131 --> 00:41:54,602
Right. Master Bruce,
I think we should, uh...

630
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,225
we should get some shut-eye.

631
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:58,646
Come on.

632
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:25,012
Bruce.

633
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,865
It's a miracle.

634
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,146
How do you feel?

635
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:43,728
Different.

636
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:47,126
Any pain?

637
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,548
No.

638
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,883
Selina, I thought I'd killed you.

639
00:42:55,498 --> 00:42:57,149
I'm better.

640
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:02,000
Even better than before, in fact.

641
