I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

15
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,293
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

16
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:02,294
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

17
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:03,885
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

18
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:05,686
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

19
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:08,055
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

20
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:11,692
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

21
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:13,695
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

22
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:15,897
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

23
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:17,699
No. We have
three of them.

24
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,667
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

25
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:22,739
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

26
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:37,786
What is she saying?

27
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,924
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

28
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:46,929
That's Jameson.

29
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:12,217
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

30
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:13,654
I'm awake.

31
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:16,088
Missed me.

32
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,789
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

33
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,024
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

34
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:23,061
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

35
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:25,563
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

36
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,866
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

37
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:30,135
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

38
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:31,771
My meeting?

39
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:33,638
Oh, shit. Yeah.

40
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,542
My meeting.

41
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:42,048
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

42
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,950
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,852
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

44
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:47,686
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

45
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:50,623
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

46
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,059
And please do not forget
your helmet.

47
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,627
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

48
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,129
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

49
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:57,864
That's hot.

50
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,766
Feed the cat.

51
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:01,067
I will.

52
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,601
I love you!

53
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:04,204
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

75
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:15,911
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

76
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:17,912
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,383

00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:33,397
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,869
But, uh...
What's the deal?

85
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:41,238
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

- The man's a visionary.

He wants to talk
about his rockets,

89
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:49,813
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

Uh...

92
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:54,884
I'm gonna level with you.

93
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:57,287
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

94
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,724
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

95
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:03,727
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

96
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:06,131
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

97
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:11,067
He's a crook.

98
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,271
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

99
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:16,442
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

100
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:19,377
There isn't a better investigative

So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

103
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:25,917
All right, all right.

104
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,288
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

105
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,956
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

106
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,758
It's not...
It's not what I do.

107
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,293
Well, my mother
always told me

108
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:38,262
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

109
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,465
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

110
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,899
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

111
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,334
- Oh.
- That's you...

112
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,003
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

113
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,205
- Nah.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:47,406
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

115
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:49,408
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

116
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,877
That's what my mom told me.

117
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,911
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

118
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:57,149
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

119
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,218
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

120
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,086
The guy you work for
is a complete...

121
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:03,155
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

122
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:04,790
and my firm works for him.

123
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,259
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

124
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:10,363
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

125
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:13,131
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

126
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,867
Ow! Really?

127
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:16,669
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

128
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:17,970
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

129
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:19,372
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

130
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:21,908
No, I still have
currency in New York.

131
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,210
I was going places.

132
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:25,311
I wasn't running.

133
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,080
I was going places.

134
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:28,915
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

135
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,784
- Me?
- You are my home.

136
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:34,522
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

137
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,194
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

138
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,462
Let's just get the check.

139
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:11,193
I'm gonna get a drink.

140
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,874
Shh.

141
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,458
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

142
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,027
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

143
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,297
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

144
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:23,999
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

145
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,135
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

146
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:28,405
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

147
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,607
to go out there
and create things that others

148
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:33,009
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

149
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:36,079
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

150
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:38,014
Come here. What's your name?

151
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:40,050
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

152
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:41,693
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

153
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:44,321
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

154
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:46,391
But you know what?
In the end,

155
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:49,326
we're the ones
who change the world.

156
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:52,263
Take good care
of that, Allie.

157
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:54,030
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

158
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:55,399
- Say hi.
- Hi.

159
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:56,601
Hello, kids.

160
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:58,636
Um, sorry to interrupt,

161
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:01,004
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

162
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:03,207
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

163
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,510
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

164
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:08,980
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

165
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:10,861
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

166
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:12,686
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

167
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,653
we just start
at the beginning?

168
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,690
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

169
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:20,224
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

170
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:23,027
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

171
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:24,530
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

172
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,597
it tripled their
life expectancy.

173
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,267
But it's okay.

174
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:31,303
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

175
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:33,304
All right, you create

176
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:35,007
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

177
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:36,676
- And then...
- Rockets.

178
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:38,680
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

179
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:40,682
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

180
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,215
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

181
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:45,050
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

182
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:46,653
is crucial
in our quest to cure

183
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:48,588
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

184
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,155
But if you think about
everything we've found...

185
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,590
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

186
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,526
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

187
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:56,029
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

188
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:57,529
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

189
00:12:57,531 --> 00:12:59,365
from your pharmaceutical
companies

190
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,166
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

191
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:02,367
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

192
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:03,704
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

193
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:06,005
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

194
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:07,607
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

195
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:09,609
How does it...
How does it, um...

196
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:11,544
I don't know,
how does it go about,

197
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:14,615
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

198
00:13:14,617 --> 00:13:16,450
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

199
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:18,451
I'm talking
about the allegations.

200
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:20,054
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

201
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:21,554
your entire empire
has been built

202
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:23,625
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

203
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:26,060
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

204
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:28,262
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

205
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:29,597
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

206
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,164
end up killing people.

207
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,667
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

208
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:34,034
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

209
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:35,469
Right. What about
the legal cases?

210
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:37,036
Sorry?

211
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:39,173
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

212
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:41,108
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

213
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,443
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

214
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,044
And they're just some
of the people who walked

215
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:46,046
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

216
00:13:46,048 --> 00:13:47,716
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

217
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:49,416
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

218
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:50,685
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

219
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:52,487
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

220
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:53,355
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

221
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:54,221
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

222
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:55,089
Is that a threat?

223
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:56,727
Have a nice life.

224
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,396
I know what
you're going to say, but...

225
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:05,066
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

226
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,101
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

227
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,641
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

228
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:17,078
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

229
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,817
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

230
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,784
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

231
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,351
We do the work.

232
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:25,824
We substantiate
our accusations.

233
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:28,124
We provide evidence.

234
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:31,460
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

235
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:39,401
You're fired, Eddie.

236
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,404
I can't trust you.

237
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:43,809
Have a nice life.

238
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,924
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

239
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:48,679
Hey.

240
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,681
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

241
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,214
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

242
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:53,249
Your ego requires
constant attention,

243
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:55,318
and you're stubborn as hell.

244
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,553
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

245
00:14:57,555 --> 00:14:59,725
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

246
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:03,762
What you did
got me fired.

247
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,599
You used me.

248
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:16,643
Annie? Annie.

249
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:51,278
Oh, my God.

250
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:56,416
You're beautiful.

251
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,470
Test 36.

252
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:57,006
Biological interactions

253
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:59,341
between two different organisms.

254
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:01,945
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

255
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,980
in order to survive
for any amount of time

256
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,815
in an oxygen-rich environment.

257
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,018
Well, why are
all these hosts

258
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,786
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

259
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,755
That's what
we're trying to find out.

260
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:14,994
The bonding process
is starting.

261
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:21,499
It's equalizing.

262
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,573
But why? Why this rabbit?

263
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:33,046
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

264
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,013
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

265
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,581
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

266
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,452
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

267
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,757
but also we would
be able to survive there.

268
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,458
"We"?

269
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,594
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

270
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,562
to even begin to think
about something like...

271
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,998
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

272
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,500
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

273
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,183
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

274
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,038
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

275
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,908
Hey, how are your kids?

276
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:05,443
Let's begin human trials.

277
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,580
Good work.

278
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:30,037
Hey, Jack.

279
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:34,006
Do you ever feel
like your life

280
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:37,643
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

281
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,355
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

282
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,413
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

283
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,883
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

284
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:44,582
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

285
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,119
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

286
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:49,123
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

287
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:50,824
Some people
are trying to watch that.

288
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:52,127
Oh, you are, are you?

289
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:54,730
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

290
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:58,133
I used to be.

291
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:00,033
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

292
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:02,669
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

293
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:05,640
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

294
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:07,040
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

295
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,010
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

296
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:11,044
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

297
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:13,046
playing hard to get.

298
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,518
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

299
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,155
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

300
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:23,159
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

301
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:27,527
Cost you $5.

302
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,664
$5 for a paper that's free?

303
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,666
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

304
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:34,468
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

305
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,939
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

306
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:38,006
You did that for me?

307
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:39,608
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

308
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:43,679
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

309
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:46,114
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

310
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:47,782
I'll throw in the paper.

311
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:50,517
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

312
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,989
but not to sing,
all right?

313
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:53,755
Deal.

314
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,657
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

315
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:59,493
No. You're welcome.

316
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:01,797
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

317
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,066
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

318
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:06,068
you know, aches and pains.

319
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,237
You look like shit.

320
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:09,638
Excuse me?

321
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,008
You look like shit.

322
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:15,211
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

323
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:17,946
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

324
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:19,816
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

325
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,818
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

326
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,952
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

327
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:27,156
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

328
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:29,959
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

329
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:31,694
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

330
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:32,862
That is the problem.

331
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:40,737
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

332
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:43,139
Please.

333
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,606
Let's go.

334
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:46,288
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

335
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:52,149
The full payment is due.
Now.

336
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:54,251
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

337
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:55,955
I don't like to wait.

338
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:15,242
Life hurts, Eddie.

339
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:17,243
It just does.

340
00:22:34,593 --> 00:22:37,594
I gotta go.

341
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:41,667
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

342
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,305
What a dick.

343
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:17,671
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

344
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:19,205
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

345
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:20,673
I can use a pseudonym.

346
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,142
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

347
00:23:22,144 --> 00:23:24,143
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

348
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:31,050
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

349
00:23:31,052 --> 00:23:32,921
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

350
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:44,364
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

351
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:48,201
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

352
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:50,670
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

353
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:52,306
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

354
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:56,043
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

355
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:59,046
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

356
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:00,681
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

357
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:22,937
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

358
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:27,376
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

359
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:29,045
History starts now.

360
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:31,747
This is day one.

361
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:35,017
This is first contact.

362
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:37,386
Let's get to work.

363
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:52,370
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

364
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:56,707
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

365
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:05,448
Put me through.

366
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,285
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

367
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:11,087
There's no need.

368
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,123
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

369
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,159
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

370
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,294
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

371
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:21,030
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

372
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:24,200
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

373
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:26,269
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

374
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:29,342
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

375
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,880
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

376
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:38,215
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

377
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:43,020
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

378
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,923
Look around you.
Look at the world.

379
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:47,391
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

380
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:49,528
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

381
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:52,830
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

382
00:25:52,832 --> 00:25:54,465
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

383
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:57,501
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

384
00:25:57,503 --> 00:26:00,039
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

385
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:06,043
We will.

386
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:09,116
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

387
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:12,519
<i>Yes.</i>

388
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:16,423
Open it.

389
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:31,503
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

390
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:33,239
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

391
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:35,408
Oh, please, please, please!

392
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,561
His vitals are holding steady.

393
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:58,265
- Where the hell did it go?
<i>- Incredible.</i>

394
00:26:58,267 --> 00:26:59,835
<i>Where did it go?</i>

395
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,005
<i>Where is it?</i>

396
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:45,315
Bring in the next volunteer.

397
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:17,079
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

398
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:18,480
I was...

399
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:21,216
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

400
00:28:21,218 --> 00:28:25,387
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

401
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:30,696
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

402
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:32,494
I mean...

403
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:34,299
You have to know
how to disappear.

404
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,369
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

405
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:41,306
Whoever you are, you suck.

406
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:44,273
Okay.

407
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:46,342
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

408
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:47,678
I need your help.

409
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,379
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

410
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,114
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

411
00:28:51,116 --> 00:28:53,116
We're done.

412
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:54,718
No...

413
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,054
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

414
00:28:58,056 --> 00:29:00,123
Everything that you
accused him of,

415
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,458
you were right.
It's all true.

416
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,992
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

417
00:29:02,994 --> 00:29:05,061
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

418
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:07,397
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

419
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:09,233
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

420
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:11,302
and they are dying.

421
00:29:11,304 --> 00:29:13,403
They are all dying.

422
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:14,974
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

423
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:17,143
Come here.

424
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:20,377
Why would I believe you?

425
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:21,545
Because it's true.

426
00:29:21,547 --> 00:29:23,314
I believed in him, and I...

427
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:25,249
I told myself
that it was worth it

428
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:27,419
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

429
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:28,782
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

430
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:30,287
I can't do that.

431
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:32,090
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

432
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,725
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

433
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:35,393
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

434
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:37,062
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

435
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:39,264
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

436
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:41,634
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

437
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:44,401
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

438
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:46,707
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

439
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:50,242
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

440
00:29:50,244 --> 00:29:52,544
genuinely,
and you have proof,

441
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:55,615
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

442
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:57,650
I am.

443
00:29:57,652 --> 00:29:59,652
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

444
00:29:59,654 --> 00:30:01,119
because I am done.

445
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:02,489
I am done
with all of this shit.

446
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:04,724
What shit?

447
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:07,693
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

448
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:09,264
All right? Good night.

449
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:29,450
Eddie?

450
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:31,820
Well, hey. Whoa.

451
00:30:32,054 --> 00:30:35,087
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

452
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:36,422
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

453
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:38,191
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

454
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:39,795
Eddie...

455
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:41,629
This is Dan.

456
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,665
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

457
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,399
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

458
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:47,042
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

459
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:48,134
- Really?
- Yeah.

460
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:50,137
I'm a big fan of your work.

461
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,472
- Thank you.
- Really?

462
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:54,678
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

463
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:57,112
Yeah, I was one of them.

464
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:00,648
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

465
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,370
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

466
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,155
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

467
00:31:13,195 --> 00:31:15,365
He has a key. You know he has a key?

468
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,734
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

469
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:24,205
Yeah. Well, uh...

470
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:26,608
So, uh, what you up to?

471
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,812

from being any of your business, right?

Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

473
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:35,416
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

474
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:37,385
No, he's a doctor.

475
00:31:37,387 --> 00:31:39,423
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

476
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,423
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

477
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:43,860
I would say
that he misses you,

478
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,628
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

479
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,329
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

480
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:48,732
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

481
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:50,869
You look good, by the way.

482
00:31:51,103 --> 00:31:52,301

doing here, Eddie?

483
00:31:52,303 --> 00:31:53,383
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

484
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:56,371
A lot.

485
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,774
You know, we were gonna
get married.

486
00:31:57,776 --> 00:32:00,342
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

487
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:02,247
I can't really believe
that we're not...

488

No, we can't.

502
00:33:56,632 --> 00:33:58,598
Yeah, got it, right.

503
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,635

away from an uninhabitable Earth.

504
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:04,470
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

505
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:06,572
to scout real estate.

506
00:34:06,574 --> 00:34:08,441
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

507
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:10,577
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

508
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:13,647
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

509
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:16,483
On the way back,
they found a comet.

510
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:18,787
A comet?

511
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,855
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

512
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:23,792
Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

513
00:34:23,794 --> 00:34:25,592
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

514
00:34:25,594 --> 00:34:27,030
You're talking about aliens?

515
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:29,664

00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:35,071
Yes.

519
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:36,505
But we don't
call them that.

520
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,374
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

521
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:43,045
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

522
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:47,515
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

523
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:50,384
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

524
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:54,857
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

525
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,356
So they can live in space?

526
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,792
We call them hosts.

527
00:34:57,794 --> 00:35:00,595
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

Yes. There's no protocol

00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:13,305
This is dead.

627
00:43:13,973 --> 00:43:15,273
Dead.

628
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:16,907
Eddie, sit down.

629
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:18,876
Okay, all right. Okay.

630
00:43:18,878 --> 00:43:20,444
- Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Stop that.

631
00:43:20,446 --> 00:43:22,080
- Sir, sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
- Eddie, quit it.

632
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:23,214
Put it down. Eddie!

633
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:25,250
Snap out of it!

634
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:28,286
No.

635
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:30,054
All right. It's no good.

636
00:43:30,056 --> 00:43:31,489
Bobby,
are you all right?

637
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:32,626
- Hey!
- Whoa!

638
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:34,525
Hey, hey, hey.

639
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,607
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

640
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,163
I'm hot.
Is anyone else hot?

641
00:43:39,165 --> 00:43:40,365
Are you hurt?

642
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,600
- Sir, excuse me.
- No! Shh!

643
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:43,301
Wait,
where are you going? Eddie?

644
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:44,902
This is unacceptable.
I'm gonna call the police.

645
00:43:44,904 --> 00:43:46,338
What are you doing?
No, please don't.

646
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,906
- No.
- Eddie, please.

647
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:49,007
Oh, my God.

648
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:51,276
Ah.

649
00:43:55,851 --> 00:43:57,483
- Now I'm gonna call the police.
- No, no. Please don't call the police.

650
00:43:57,485 --> 00:43:59,563
Here, call an ambulance. I'm a doctor.
This man is my, um...

651
00:43:59,587 --> 00:44:01,253
Patient.

652
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:02,921
Oh, it's much better.

653
00:44:02,923 --> 00:44:04,323
You are insane.

654
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:05,838
- He's killing people.
- Who's killing people?

655
00:44:05,862 --> 00:44:07,259
- Carlton Drake.
- Oh, God, Eddie,

656
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:08,427
- not this again.
- Yes, he is. He is!

657
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:10,963
And I have proof!

658
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:12,197
Ugh.

659
00:44:18,472 --> 00:44:21,109
- Hey, Eddie...
- Hmm?

660
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,449
Eddie.

661
00:44:28,651 --> 00:44:30,050
Eddie?

662
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:32,521
Eddie, can you hear me?

663
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:35,109
This is Dan speaking to you.

664
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:39,025
Hey, Dan.

665
00:44:39,027 --> 00:44:40,494
- <i>Welcome back.</i>
- Where am I?

666
00:44:40,496 --> 00:44:41,962
<i>Uh, you're in the MRI.</i>

667
00:44:41,964 --> 00:44:43,530
<i>Okay, we've given you
a little sedative.</i>

668
00:44:43,532 --> 00:44:46,300
- Where is Anne?
- <i>Anne is not here right now.</i>

669
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:47,704
<i>We're gonna run
some tests, okay?</i>

670
00:44:47,937 --> 00:44:49,203
<i>It's gonna be completely
painless.</i>

671
00:44:49,205 --> 00:44:51,038
<i>So, you know,
just try to stay still.</i>

672
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,709
<i>Uh, relax, and, um...</i>

673
00:44:53,943 --> 00:44:55,009
<i>Yeah, here we go.</i>

674
00:45:01,217 --> 00:45:02,550
Eddie, what's happening
in there?

675
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:04,151
<i>Eddie, you okay?</i>

676
00:45:08,424 --> 00:45:10,157
Shut it down.

677
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,227
Hey, hey, hey.

678
00:45:13,229 --> 00:45:14,428
You're okay. Yeah.

679
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,565
Coming out. You all right?

680
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:18,165
- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.

681
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,668
- You okay?
- Yeah.

682
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,603
- All right.
- Just take a deep breath. Okay? You're okay.

683
00:45:21,605 --> 00:45:23,605
Yeah.

684
00:45:23,607 --> 00:45:25,406
<i>Now, listen, you're not the
first person to freak out in there.</i>

685
00:45:25,408 --> 00:45:27,242
I get claustrophobic, too.

686
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:28,746
Dr. Lewis?

687
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:31,112
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

688
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:32,682
Oh, I just saw Morris.

689
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:35,753
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

690
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,932
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

691
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:40,021
Yeah, my pleasure.

692
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:41,724
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

693
00:45:41,726 --> 00:45:43,325
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

694
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:45,394
Sorry. Gemini.

695
00:45:45,396 --> 00:45:47,028
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

696
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,463
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

697
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:50,032
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

698
00:45:50,034 --> 00:45:51,367
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

699
00:45:51,369 --> 00:45:53,009
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

700
00:45:55,106 --> 00:45:56,505
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

701
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:57,740
Did you have
the same reactions

702
00:45:57,742 --> 00:45:59,408
regardless
of the temperature...

703
00:46:02,313 --> 00:46:04,015
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

704
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,354
The creature
and the host are one.

705
00:46:11,356 --> 00:46:12,791
Everything was fine.

706
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:15,627
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

707
00:46:15,629 --> 00:46:18,629
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

708
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:20,163
But the organism
is unaffected?

709
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:21,532
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

710
00:46:21,534 --> 00:46:23,735
But once again,
it's killing the host.

711
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:24,777
It's consuming his organs.

712
00:46:26,105 --> 00:46:27,439
Oh, watch this.

713
00:46:31,778 --> 00:46:34,098
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

714
00:46:35,347 --> 00:46:38,348
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

715
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,788
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

716
00:46:42,288 --> 00:46:44,087
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

717
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:45,529
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

718
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:48,325
We're gonna need another host.

719
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:50,361
Such poor design.

720
00:46:50,363 --> 00:46:53,196
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

721
00:46:53,198 --> 00:46:54,466
Sorry to interrupt.

722
00:46:57,237 --> 00:46:58,839
Thought you'd like
some good news.

723
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,775
I'm sorry.

724
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:12,853
<i>Hungry!</i>

725
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:15,253
Oh, goddamn.

726
00:47:15,255 --> 00:47:17,155
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

727
00:47:17,157 --> 00:47:19,357
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

728
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,659
Thank you.

729
00:47:20,661 --> 00:47:22,226
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

730
00:47:22,228 --> 00:47:24,800
Until the cable car stops.

731
00:47:29,738 --> 00:47:31,838
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

732
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,841
Excuse me.

733
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,245
Oh, hey, Anne.

734
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:43,216
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

735
00:47:43,218 --> 00:47:44,886
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

736
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,220
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

737
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:49,858
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

738
00:47:50,093 --> 00:47:51,825
but it would
explain the fever.

739
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,425
<i>That would make sense.</i>

740
00:47:53,427 --> 00:47:57,297
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

741
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:59,198
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

742
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,567
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

743
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:02,202
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

744
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:04,437
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

745
00:48:04,439 --> 00:48:06,339
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

746
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,274
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

747
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:11,411
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

748
00:48:11,413 --> 00:48:13,446
but super, super fast?

749
00:48:13,448 --> 00:48:15,215
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

750
00:48:15,217 --> 00:48:16,583
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

751
00:48:16,585 --> 00:48:18,451
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

752
00:48:18,453 --> 00:48:20,621
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

753
00:48:20,623 --> 00:48:23,523
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

754
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,492
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

755
00:48:25,494 --> 00:48:26,827
and we are gonna
clear that out.

756
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:28,396
- Yes.
<i>- Never gonna happen.</i>

757
00:48:28,398 --> 00:48:30,901
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

758
00:48:31,135 --> 00:48:32,800
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

759
00:48:32,802 --> 00:48:35,336
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

760
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:36,805
Who are you talking to?

761
00:48:36,807 --> 00:48:38,707
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

762
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:41,609
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

763
00:48:56,894 --> 00:48:58,360
Yeah?

764
00:48:58,362 --> 00:49:00,003
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

765
00:49:00,164 --> 00:49:01,898
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

766
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,398
Whatever.

767
00:49:06,335 --> 00:49:08,336
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

768
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:10,778
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

769
00:49:12,777 --> 00:49:15,279
I was troubled by

770
00:49:16,313 --> 00:49:17,915
what we've been doing.

771
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:19,716
I get it.

772
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:20,985
I get it.

773
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:23,687
We've all been troubled.

774
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:26,257
It's the nature
of what we do.

775
00:49:27,892 --> 00:49:30,963
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

776
00:49:32,664 --> 00:49:33,965
I need that from you.

777
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:39,502
I can't do that.

778
00:49:39,504 --> 00:49:42,942
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

779
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:45,243
your friend.

780
00:49:46,578 --> 00:49:48,311
The person who was here.

781
00:49:48,313 --> 00:49:50,314
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

782
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:52,851
You know that, right?

783
00:49:52,853 --> 00:49:55,351
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

784
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:57,624
where you can help
to keep them alive.

785
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:02,294
Hey. Dora.

786
00:50:03,896 --> 00:50:06,767
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

787
00:50:10,003 --> 00:50:11,303
Will you trust me?

788
00:50:18,277 --> 00:50:19,844
Eddie Brock.

789
00:50:19,846 --> 00:50:21,014
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

790
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:32,359
You were our best.

791
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:34,693
Open it.

792
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:40,032
No! No!

793
00:50:40,034 --> 00:50:42,036
No! No! No!

794
00:50:46,874 --> 00:50:48,643
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

795
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:51,476
Huh?

796
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:06,026
Stay put.

797
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:07,894
- Hey, Eddie.
<i>- Who the hell is this guy?</i>

798
00:51:07,896 --> 00:51:10,098
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

799
00:51:10,364 --> 00:51:12,032
Whoa.

800
00:51:12,034 --> 00:51:14,801
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

801
00:51:14,803 --> 00:51:16,502
I'm putting my hands up.

802
00:51:16,504 --> 00:51:18,805
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

803
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:21,775
I...
No, I am not.

804
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:23,078
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

805
00:51:23,312 --> 00:51:24,711
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

806
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:26,413
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

807
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:28,414
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

808
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:30,617
- Eddie...
<i>- I will take care of this myself.</i>

809
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:32,518
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

810
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,324
Take him down.

811
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:47,904
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

812
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,115
- What is that?
<i>- Not "what." Who.</i>

813
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:01,951
Oh.

814
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,462
Shit.

815
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:36,718
<i>Outstanding.</i>

816
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,754
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

817
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:39,855
Why would we do that?

818
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,661
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

819
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:51,502
What the shit, man?

820
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:59,110
No! No, no, no!

821
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:07,917
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

822
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:10,188
Apparently, I have a parasite.

823
00:53:18,864 --> 00:53:21,200
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

824
00:53:21,434 --> 00:53:22,868
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

825
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,740
He's achieved symbiosis.

826
00:53:29,742 --> 00:53:31,176
Are you seeing this?

827
00:53:31,178 --> 00:53:33,179
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

828
00:53:34,914 --> 00:53:36,180
Treece...

829
00:53:36,182 --> 00:53:38,185
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

830
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,894
<i>Eddie.</i>

831
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,938
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

832
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,040
It's not real.
You're in my head.

833
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:03,608
'Cause you're just a parasite.

834
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:04,645
"Parasite"?

835
00:54:11,853 --> 00:54:13,921
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

836
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:19,892
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

837
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:21,694
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

838
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:24,096
We can discuss this
like two men.

839
00:54:24,098 --> 00:54:25,599
What is that? What is that?

840
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:36,109
What?

841
00:54:36,111 --> 00:54:38,576
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

842
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:41,113
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

843
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:42,216
Launch the drones.

844
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,713
<i>Duck.</i>

845
00:55:15,085 --> 00:55:16,717
Whew!

846
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:18,621
- Thank you.
<i>- You are welcome.</i>

847
00:55:24,661 --> 00:55:26,830
Oh!

848
00:55:34,971 --> 00:55:37,451
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

849
00:55:44,181 --> 00:55:45,915
Oh, God, no!

850
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:09,938
Holy shit!

851
00:56:17,181 --> 00:56:19,215
Treece, do not
let him get away.

852
00:56:19,217 --> 00:56:21,686
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

853
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,928
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

854
00:56:31,229 --> 00:56:32,731
Oh, God! Do something!

855
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,273
What the...

856
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,249
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

857
00:56:54,419 --> 00:56:55,420
No, no, no! No, no!

858
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,911
No! You're out of your mind!

859
00:57:01,861 --> 00:57:04,197
No!

860
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:26,019
- That is a dead-end!
<i>- Not for us.</i>

861
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:29,823
Whoa!

862
00:57:35,996 --> 00:57:36,997
Yeah!

863
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,129
Whoa!

864
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:16,402
I am going to die!

865
00:58:16,404 --> 00:58:17,840
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

866
00:58:29,918 --> 00:58:32,221
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

867
00:58:41,765 --> 00:58:43,030
I got him.

868
00:58:43,032 --> 00:58:44,097
<i>- Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

869
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:46,035
This is incredible.

870
00:58:52,341 --> 00:58:55,243
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

871
00:58:55,245 --> 00:58:58,281
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

872
00:59:10,093 --> 00:59:14,062
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

873
00:59:14,064 --> 00:59:16,533
So many snacks,
so little time.

874
00:59:27,178 --> 00:59:29,110
SFPD. Don't move!

875
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:30,280
Get off the car!

876
00:59:47,064 --> 00:59:48,100
My legs.

877
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:52,234
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

878
00:59:52,236 --> 00:59:54,639
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

879
01:00:09,988 --> 01:00:11,921
What the hell
are you?

880
01:00:11,923 --> 01:00:14,391
I am Venom.

881
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:17,160
And you are mine.

882
01:00:17,162 --> 01:00:19,529
You bit somebody's head off.

883
01:00:19,531 --> 01:00:21,599
Fuel in the tank.

884
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:23,636
Listen carefully, Eddie.

885
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:26,103
You did not find us.

886
01:00:26,105 --> 01:00:28,675
We found you.

887
01:00:28,908 --> 01:00:30,941
Think of yourself
as my ride.

888
01:00:30,943 --> 01:00:32,209
Where are you going?

889
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,312
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

890
01:00:35,314 --> 01:00:37,281
You remember him.

891
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:38,682
How do you even know
about that?

892
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:41,185
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

893
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:43,020
- Everything about you.
- How?

894
01:00:43,022 --> 01:00:45,456
I am inside your head.

895
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:48,026
You are a loser, Eddie.

896
01:00:52,598 --> 01:00:55,367
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

897
01:00:55,369 --> 01:00:56,668
Most likely.

898
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,135
Oh, God.

899
01:00:58,137 --> 01:01:01,139
That is why we are here.

900
01:01:01,141 --> 01:01:04,445
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

901
01:01:05,612 --> 01:01:07,715
That is the deal.

902
01:01:11,218 --> 01:01:12,551
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

903
01:01:12,553 --> 01:01:14,453
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

904
01:01:14,455 --> 01:01:16,496
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

905
01:01:37,411 --> 01:01:39,178
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

906
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,012
<i>- Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

907
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:43,084
I got Eddie's labs back,

908
01:01:44,486 --> 01:01:46,419
and it's worse than I thought.

909
01:01:46,421 --> 01:01:49,589
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

910
01:01:49,591 --> 01:01:51,324
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

911
01:01:51,326 --> 01:01:53,125
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

912
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:54,763
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

913
01:01:58,735 --> 01:02:00,568
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

914
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:10,444
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

915
01:02:10,446 --> 01:02:12,614
- Where was he?
- I was...

916
01:02:12,616 --> 01:02:16,620
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

917
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:18,688
The arrogance.

918
01:02:24,426 --> 01:02:28,664
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

919
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:30,800
not until we find
another suitable host.

920
01:02:31,034 --> 01:02:35,435
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

921
01:02:40,143 --> 01:02:42,443
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

922
01:02:42,445 --> 01:02:44,546
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

923
01:02:44,548 --> 01:02:45,614
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

924
01:02:45,616 --> 01:02:47,549
Found another one, Bill.

925
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,450
Get off the streets.
Go home.

926
01:02:49,452 --> 01:02:51,152
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

927
01:02:51,154 --> 01:02:52,188
Bodies?

928
01:02:53,624 --> 01:02:55,592
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

929
01:02:58,595 --> 01:03:00,562
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

930
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:02,498
That is none of your
goddamn business.

931
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,836
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

932
01:03:05,068 --> 01:03:06,635
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

933
01:03:06,637 --> 01:03:08,270
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

934
01:03:08,272 --> 01:03:09,773
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

935
01:03:09,775 --> 01:03:13,309
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

936
01:03:13,311 --> 01:03:15,110
Shit. Yeah?

937
01:03:15,112 --> 01:03:17,056
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

938
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,815
No, no, you can't see me.

939
01:03:18,817 --> 01:03:21,116
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

940
01:03:21,118 --> 01:03:22,686
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

941
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:25,255
You cannot come
near me right now.

942
01:03:25,257 --> 01:03:26,858
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
<i>- No!</i>

943
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:28,557
- Eddie?
<i>- No, I gotta go up there.</i>

944
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:29,592
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

945
01:03:29,594 --> 01:03:30,862
I got to get up there, man.

946
01:03:31,096 --> 01:03:33,162
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

947
01:03:33,164 --> 01:03:34,531
There's no such thing
as can't.

948
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:35,702
I'm sorry, man.

949
01:03:36,635 --> 01:03:39,135
Okay, okay... Uh...

950
01:03:39,137 --> 01:03:41,438
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

951
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,374
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

952
01:03:44,376 --> 01:03:46,677
<i>- Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

953
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:48,679
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

954
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:50,748
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

955
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,248
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

956
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,784
<i>- "We"?</i>
- Yeah.

957
01:03:53,786 --> 01:03:55,866
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

958
01:03:57,556 --> 01:03:59,391
Yeah.

959
01:04:05,263 --> 01:04:07,700
- Shit.
<i>- You want up?</i>

960
01:04:11,471 --> 01:04:13,807
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

961
01:04:24,618 --> 01:04:26,920
Hmm.

962
01:04:27,153 --> 01:04:30,354
- It is peaceful up here.
<i>- I'm not very good with heights.</i>

963
01:04:30,356 --> 01:04:34,559
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

964
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:36,898
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

965
01:04:37,132 --> 01:04:38,296
<i>What does that mean?</i>

966
01:04:46,573 --> 01:04:48,272
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

967
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,585
<i>I got us.</i>

968
01:05:00,587 --> 01:05:01,690
Whoa.

969
01:05:07,163 --> 01:05:10,731
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

970
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:12,866
<i>You die, I die.</i>

971
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:15,268
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

972
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:17,771
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

973
01:05:17,773 --> 01:05:19,673
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

974
01:05:19,675 --> 01:05:22,676
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

975
01:05:22,678 --> 01:05:24,845
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

976
01:05:24,847 --> 01:05:26,314
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

977
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:27,983
Thank you.

978
01:05:31,854 --> 01:05:32,888
Okay.

979
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:36,357
Here's your evidence.

980
01:05:40,295 --> 01:05:41,496
<i>Jump.</i>

981
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,667
<i>Pussy.</i>

982
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:56,913
Hands!

983
01:05:58,849 --> 01:06:00,583
On the ground! Now!

984
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:07,822
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

985
01:06:07,824 --> 01:06:09,891
- Mask!
- Copy!

986
01:06:09,893 --> 01:06:12,392
All right,
have it your own way.

987
01:06:12,394 --> 01:06:14,031
- Mask!
<i>- Copy.</i>

988
01:06:14,264 --> 01:06:15,798
What the hell
is that thing?

989
01:06:21,404 --> 01:06:22,572
What the hell?

990
01:06:23,808 --> 01:06:25,406
Hold your fire!

991
01:06:25,408 --> 01:06:27,542
Flares!

992
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:28,644
He's there!
He's there!

993
01:06:28,646 --> 01:06:29,847
Reload!

994
01:06:30,948 --> 01:06:32,681
Anybody see him?

995
01:06:43,593 --> 01:06:45,528
Does anyone have eyes on him?

996
01:06:47,265 --> 01:06:49,367
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

997
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,714
I don't have
eyes on him.

998
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:07,485
Where is it?

999
01:07:14,493 --> 01:07:15,592
Flash grenade!

1000
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,995
Throw them!

1001
01:07:17,997 --> 01:07:19,528
Flash grenade!

1002
01:07:30,576 --> 01:07:31,843
He's in the rafters!

1003
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:32,910
Above!

1004
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:39,384
There he is!

1005
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:45,458
Move, move, move!

1006
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:17,122
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1007
01:08:23,497 --> 01:08:24,998
Annie! Annie, wait!

1008
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,832
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1009
01:08:26,834 --> 01:08:29,501
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1010
01:08:29,503 --> 01:08:31,971
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1011
01:08:31,973 --> 01:08:33,572
- "He"?
- Yes.

1012
01:08:33,574 --> 01:08:36,009
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1013
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,713
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1014
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:43,785
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1015
01:08:47,554 --> 01:08:48,555
Right now.

1016
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:54,559
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1017
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:55,630
Get in the car, Eddie.

1018
01:08:57,733 --> 01:09:00,803
- In the back.
<i>- I like her. Get in.</i>

1019
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,979
I'm out of control.

1020
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,148
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1021
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,984
<i>- No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1022
01:09:15,686 --> 01:09:17,186
What? Why?

1023
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,519
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1024
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:24,859
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1025
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:27,662
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1026
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,233
- Not all sounds.
<i>- And fire.</i>

1027
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:33,502
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1028
01:09:35,105 --> 01:09:36,539
Always.

1029
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:39,809
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1030
01:09:39,811 --> 01:09:42,509
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1031
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,813
I'm hungry all the time.

1032
01:09:44,815 --> 01:09:48,152
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1033
01:09:49,454 --> 01:09:51,152
Get out of my head, man.

1034
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:53,622
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1035
01:09:53,624 --> 01:09:56,227
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1036
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,932
Annie.

1037
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:07,602
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1038
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:13,608
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1039
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,213
I am truly, truly sorry.

1040
01:10:16,614 --> 01:10:18,683
And that I love you.

1041
01:10:19,251 --> 01:10:21,884
Oh, Eddie...

1042
01:10:21,886 --> 01:10:24,988
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1043
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:27,624
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1044
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:35,732
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1045
01:10:35,734 --> 01:10:38,935
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1046
01:10:38,937 --> 01:10:40,005
Thank you.

1047
01:10:58,625 --> 01:10:59,659
Hello?

1048
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:12,206
What are you doing here?

1049
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:16,911
Are you lost?

1050
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:21,081
I'm not lost.

1051
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:30,155
Thanks for coming in.

1052
01:11:30,157 --> 01:11:33,659
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1053
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:36,329
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1054
01:11:36,564 --> 01:11:39,064
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1055
01:11:39,066 --> 01:11:40,367
I don't want you to fix it.

1056
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,934
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1057
01:11:44,138 --> 01:11:45,839
Can you fix it?

1058
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:47,773
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1059
01:11:47,775 --> 01:11:49,975
- This parasite, whatever this is...
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>

1060
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:51,276
It's eating you
from the inside.

1061
01:11:51,278 --> 01:11:52,912
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1062
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:55,014
- You're using him up.
<i>- No. She is wrong.</i>

1063
01:11:55,016 --> 01:11:58,050
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1064
01:11:58,052 --> 01:12:00,652
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
<i>- No!</i>

1065
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:02,255
You're killing him.

1066
01:12:02,257 --> 01:12:03,723
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1067
01:12:03,725 --> 01:12:05,290
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1068
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:06,852
- Oh, God!
<i>- We have to get out of here.</i>

1069
01:12:08,163 --> 01:12:09,229
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1070
01:12:09,231 --> 01:12:10,391
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1071
01:12:12,934 --> 01:12:15,937
No! Don't do that!

1072
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,154
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1073
01:12:34,156 --> 01:12:35,424
What is that?

1074
01:12:42,398 --> 01:12:45,366
You were killing me?

1075
01:12:45,368 --> 01:12:48,437
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1076
01:12:50,273 --> 01:12:54,944
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1077
01:12:56,179 --> 01:12:57,313
We're done.

1078
01:12:59,682 --> 01:13:02,050
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1079
01:13:02,052 --> 01:13:03,818
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1080
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,900
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1081
01:13:08,758 --> 01:13:10,292
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1082
01:13:10,294 --> 01:13:14,196
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1083
01:13:14,198 --> 01:13:16,431
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1084
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:19,402
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1085
01:13:19,404 --> 01:13:23,138
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1086
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,873
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1087
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:27,008
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1088
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,278
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1089
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:33,083
Dan.

1090
01:13:39,923 --> 01:13:41,158
Where is it?

1091
01:14:07,086 --> 01:14:09,088
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1092
01:14:35,214 --> 01:14:38,915
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1093
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:43,520
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1094
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:47,560
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1095
01:14:47,794 --> 01:14:50,094
Whoo!

1096
01:14:51,766 --> 01:14:55,434
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1097
01:15:05,012 --> 01:15:07,079
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1098
01:15:07,081 --> 01:15:10,114
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1099
01:15:10,116 --> 01:15:14,019
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1100
01:15:14,021 --> 01:15:15,953
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1101
01:15:15,955 --> 01:15:17,423
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1102
01:15:17,425 --> 01:15:19,191
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1103
01:15:19,193 --> 01:15:22,361
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1104
01:15:22,363 --> 01:15:24,930
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1105
01:15:24,932 --> 01:15:26,365
It can't go on.

1106
01:15:26,367 --> 01:15:28,902
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1107
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:30,903
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1108
01:15:30,905 --> 01:15:32,574
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1109
01:15:32,808 --> 01:15:36,508
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1110
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:38,311
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1111
01:15:40,247 --> 01:15:42,514
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1112
01:15:42,516 --> 01:15:45,018
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1113
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:49,522
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1114
01:15:49,524 --> 01:15:51,958
Man and Symbiote combined.

1115
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,527
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1116
01:15:54,529 --> 01:15:57,597
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1117
01:15:57,599 --> 01:16:01,000
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1118
01:16:01,002 --> 01:16:02,302
It's not a lot of fun.

1119
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:04,905
And then I find out,
all along,

1120
01:16:04,907 --> 01:16:06,307
that they're killing you.

1121
01:16:06,309 --> 01:16:08,041
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1122
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:10,578
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1123
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:13,114
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1124
01:16:13,116 --> 01:16:14,618
Where's Venom?

1125
01:16:14,851 --> 01:16:18,418
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1126
01:16:24,494 --> 01:16:28,295
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1127
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:30,965
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1128
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:35,202
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1129
01:16:43,447 --> 01:16:48,653
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1130
01:16:48,887 --> 01:16:52,287
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1131
01:16:52,289 --> 01:16:54,491
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1132
01:16:56,527 --> 01:16:58,293
Where we lead.

1133
01:16:58,295 --> 01:17:00,028
Yes, "we."

1134
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:03,300
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1135
01:17:04,669 --> 01:17:06,237
I can take care of that.

1136
01:17:11,275 --> 01:17:14,277
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1137
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:15,280
Shut up.

1138
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:20,719
Not so tough
without your friend.

1139
01:17:25,624 --> 01:17:27,292
Did your mama not love you?

1140
01:17:30,196 --> 01:17:31,662
God damn it!

1141
01:17:33,531 --> 01:17:36,700
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1142
01:17:36,702 --> 01:17:38,703
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1143
01:17:38,705 --> 01:17:40,470
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1144
01:17:40,472 --> 01:17:41,672
in this world than you and me.

1145
01:17:42,474 --> 01:17:44,709
Much bigger than me.

1146
01:17:44,711 --> 01:17:49,215
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1147
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,417
Karma's a bitch.

1148
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:54,654
I don't believe in karma.

1149
01:17:56,388 --> 01:17:58,390
Oh! Ooh!

1150
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,161
Hi, Eddie.

1151
01:18:04,163 --> 01:18:06,197
Whoa. Whoa...

1152
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:09,032
Oh...

1153
01:18:09,034 --> 01:18:10,035
Mmm...

1154
01:18:11,071 --> 01:18:12,272
Mmm!

1155
01:18:28,522 --> 01:18:29,690
Oh, no.

1156
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,692
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1157
01:18:33,694 --> 01:18:36,195
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1158
01:18:36,197 --> 01:18:38,799
<i>- The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1159
01:18:39,032 --> 01:18:41,533
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1160
01:18:41,535 --> 01:18:43,601
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1161
01:18:43,603 --> 01:18:45,924
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
<i>- He is unstoppable.</i>

1162
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:47,605
- Oh, great.
<i>- We have got to go!</i>

1163
01:18:47,607 --> 01:18:49,308
Go where? Where we going?

1164
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:50,744
- Well, I'm coming with you.
<i>- No!</i>

1165
01:18:50,746 --> 01:18:52,646
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1166
01:18:52,648 --> 01:18:55,128
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1167
01:18:56,517 --> 01:18:58,085
Not today.

1168
01:18:59,554 --> 01:19:01,155
Oh, that's bullshit!

1169
01:19:03,324 --> 01:19:04,826
This is not a simulation.

1170
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,226
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1171
01:19:07,228 --> 01:19:09,664
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1172
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,397
- You?
- Yes, me.

1173
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:13,099
How long?

1174
01:19:13,101 --> 01:19:14,801
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1175
01:19:14,803 --> 01:19:18,173
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1176
01:19:20,409 --> 01:19:21,510
I'm not alone.

1177
01:19:25,147 --> 01:19:28,448
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1178
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:30,417
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1179
01:19:30,419 --> 01:19:31,821
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1180
01:19:32,055 --> 01:19:35,455
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1181
01:19:35,457 --> 01:19:39,828
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1182
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:42,070
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1183
01:19:42,098 --> 01:19:43,798
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1184
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,566
- on a whole planet?
<i>- Yes!</i>

1185
01:19:45,568 --> 01:19:47,769
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1186
01:19:47,771 --> 01:19:50,338
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1187
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,373
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1188
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,879
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1189
01:19:56,112 --> 01:19:57,846
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1190
01:19:57,848 --> 01:20:00,514
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1191
01:20:00,516 --> 01:20:03,150
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1192
01:20:03,152 --> 01:20:06,890
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1193
01:20:07,156 --> 01:20:09,256
- then it's back to "we."
<i>- It is "we."</i>

1194
01:20:09,258 --> 01:20:11,660
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1195
01:20:11,662 --> 01:20:13,362
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1196
01:20:13,364 --> 01:20:14,845
What really made you
change your mind?

1197
01:20:18,636 --> 01:20:21,605
You. You did, Eddie.

1198
01:20:23,607 --> 01:20:26,274
Scrub diagnostics.

1199
01:20:26,276 --> 01:20:28,647
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1200
01:20:35,352 --> 01:20:38,420
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1201
01:20:38,422 --> 01:20:40,759
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1202
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:54,840
Oh, shit.

1203
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:07,352
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1204
01:21:14,827 --> 01:21:18,594
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1205
01:21:18,596 --> 01:21:21,297
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1206
01:21:21,299 --> 01:21:23,399
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1207
01:21:23,401 --> 01:21:26,837
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1208
01:21:26,839 --> 01:21:29,743
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1209
01:21:32,746 --> 01:21:34,848
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1210
01:21:38,551 --> 01:21:41,353
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1211
01:21:44,625 --> 01:21:47,458
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1212
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:51,596
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1213
01:21:51,598 --> 01:21:52,932
Then die.

1214
01:22:03,678 --> 01:22:05,678
<i>- Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1215
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,314
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1216
01:22:19,761 --> 01:22:21,294
You have a strong host.

1217
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:24,899
But not strong enough.

1218
01:23:03,673 --> 01:23:06,405
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1219
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:09,746
Eddie.

1220
01:23:14,284 --> 01:23:15,652
Drake, stop!

1221
01:24:21,921 --> 01:24:24,389
Told you I could fight ugly.

1222
01:24:31,529 --> 01:24:33,833
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1223
01:24:51,818 --> 01:24:53,516
You're too late.

1224
01:24:53,518 --> 01:24:54,519
This is the next stage...

1225
01:24:56,589 --> 01:24:58,825
You talk too much.

1226
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:10,169
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1227
01:25:10,404 --> 01:25:12,039
You are nothing.

1228
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:42,003
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1229
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:43,905
<i>Nine...</i>

1230
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:45,807
<i>Eight...</i>

1231
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:47,742
<i>Seven...</i>

1232
01:25:48,508 --> 01:25:49,509
<i>Six...</i>

1233
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:51,079
<i>Five...</i>

1234
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,511
<i>Four...</i>

1235
01:25:53,513 --> 01:25:55,047
<i>Three...</i>

1236
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:56,916
<i>Two...</i>

1237
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,921
<i>One...</i>

1238
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:01,889
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1239
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:10,864
Traitor!

1240
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:12,633
Have a nice life.

1241
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:40,295
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1242
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:42,999
Venom, no!

1243
01:27:31,048 --> 01:27:35,018
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1244
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,618
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1245
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,356
I feel great. Awesome.

1246
01:27:38,589 --> 01:27:40,357
Wow.

1247
01:27:40,591 --> 01:27:42,258
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1248
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:45,762
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1249
01:27:45,764 --> 01:27:47,764
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1250
01:27:47,766 --> 01:27:49,731
You're a good person, Annie.

1251
01:27:49,733 --> 01:27:51,234
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1252
01:27:51,236 --> 01:27:53,069
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1253
01:27:53,071 --> 01:27:55,105
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1254
01:27:55,107 --> 01:27:57,207
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1255
01:27:57,209 --> 01:28:01,645
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1256
01:28:01,647 --> 01:28:03,747
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1257
01:28:03,749 --> 01:28:06,083
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1258
01:28:06,085 --> 01:28:08,719
Oh! Like everyone else.

1259
01:28:08,721 --> 01:28:09,722
Yeah.

1260
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:14,393
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1261
01:28:16,094 --> 01:28:17,295
Hey, um...

1262
01:28:19,966 --> 01:28:21,799
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1263
01:28:21,801 --> 01:28:25,004
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1264
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,375
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1265
01:28:30,377 --> 01:28:32,779
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1266
01:28:35,281 --> 01:28:37,651
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1267
01:28:38,284 --> 01:28:39,718
I mean, the...

1268
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:43,255
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1269
01:28:43,257 --> 01:28:44,823
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1270
01:28:44,825 --> 01:28:45,926
Okay.

1271
01:28:47,227 --> 01:28:48,827
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1272
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:51,062
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1273
01:28:51,064 --> 01:28:54,799
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1274
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:57,736
No, I don't think so.

1275
01:28:57,738 --> 01:29:00,205
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1276
01:29:00,207 --> 01:29:02,007
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1277
01:29:02,009 --> 01:29:04,411
- Nope.
<i>- You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1278
01:29:04,646 --> 01:29:06,179
Eddie, are you sure?

1279
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:08,180
Good Lord, look at that.

1280
01:29:08,182 --> 01:29:10,317
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1281
01:29:12,086 --> 01:29:14,253
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1282
01:29:14,255 --> 01:29:16,390
You take care, all right?

1283
01:29:16,659 --> 01:29:18,459
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1284
01:29:22,397 --> 01:29:25,831
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1285
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:27,001
Either of you.

1286
01:29:27,735 --> 01:29:29,101
We won't.

1287
01:29:29,103 --> 01:29:30,803
<i>- Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1288
01:29:30,805 --> 01:29:33,372
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1289
01:29:33,374 --> 01:29:36,042
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1290
01:29:36,044 --> 01:29:38,978
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1291
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:42,748
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1292
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,486
<i>- I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1293
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,419
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1294
01:29:46,421 --> 01:29:49,990
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1295
01:29:49,992 --> 01:29:52,292
And then there are bad people.

1296
01:29:52,294 --> 01:29:54,161
You have to tell
the difference.

1297
01:29:54,163 --> 01:29:58,031
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1298
01:29:58,033 --> 01:30:01,401
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1299
01:30:01,403 --> 01:30:03,837
eat very, very bad people,

1300
01:30:03,839 --> 01:30:06,508
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1301
01:30:06,742 --> 01:30:09,109
<i>- Fine.</i>
- Good.

1302
01:30:09,111 --> 01:30:10,878
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1303
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,980
Well, it's super simple.

1304
01:30:12,982 --> 01:30:15,883
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1305
01:30:15,885 --> 01:30:17,952
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1306
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,387
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1307
01:30:19,389 --> 01:30:21,456
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1308
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:26,893
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1309
01:30:26,895 --> 01:30:29,199
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1310
01:30:30,767 --> 01:30:33,069
Hey, Mrs. C.

1311
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,837
How you doing, Eddie?

1312
01:30:35,839 --> 01:30:37,406
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1313
01:30:37,408 --> 01:30:40,375
No.

1314
01:30:40,377 --> 01:30:43,514
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1315
01:30:43,748 --> 01:30:45,413
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1316
01:30:45,415 --> 01:30:47,082
Right. Okay, no problem.

1317
01:30:48,352 --> 01:30:49,919
The payment's due, Chen.

1318
01:30:51,422 --> 01:30:53,421
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1319
01:30:53,423 --> 01:30:54,990
Now.

1320
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:56,560
<i>- Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1321
01:31:04,101 --> 01:31:06,168
You come in here again...

1322
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:10,839
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1323
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:14,343
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1324
01:31:14,345 --> 01:31:16,345
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1325
01:31:16,347 --> 01:31:19,416
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1326
01:31:19,418 --> 01:31:21,318
- Please...
- Yes.

1327
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:25,221
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1328
01:31:25,223 --> 01:31:29,993
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1329
01:31:29,995 --> 01:31:32,364
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1330
01:31:34,266 --> 01:31:36,835
We are Venom.

1331
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:40,439
- On second thought...
- Please.

1332
01:31:47,512 --> 01:31:49,913
Eddie? What was that?

1333
01:31:49,915 --> 01:31:51,314
Oh...

1334
01:31:51,316 --> 01:31:55,121
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1335
01:31:56,456 --> 01:31:57,988
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1336
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:59,990
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1337
01:31:59,992 --> 01:32:01,992
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- No.

1338
01:32:01,994 --> 01:32:04,929
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1339
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:07,635
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1340
01:32:07,867 --> 01:32:12,002
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1341
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:41,223
I need you
to stay quiet.

1342
01:34:41,225 --> 01:34:44,193
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1343
01:34:44,195 --> 01:34:47,331
- You got that?
<i>- Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1344
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:53,236
Open on five.

1345
01:34:53,238 --> 01:34:56,373
Go. Opening up.

1346
01:34:58,442 --> 01:35:01,144
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1347
01:35:01,146 --> 01:35:03,681
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1348
01:35:03,683 --> 01:35:05,414
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1349
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:07,584
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1350
01:35:07,586 --> 01:35:10,220
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1351
01:35:10,222 --> 01:35:13,356
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1352
01:35:13,358 --> 01:35:16,796
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1353
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:20,499
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1354
01:35:23,569 --> 01:35:26,472
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1355
01:35:46,627 --> 01:35:49,260
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1356
01:35:49,262 --> 01:35:53,699
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1357
01:35:53,701 --> 01:35:54,868
Sure, it's good with me.

1358
01:35:55,101 --> 01:35:57,435
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1359
01:35:57,437 --> 01:36:04,308
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1360
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,378
I bet you can.

1361
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:08,850
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1362
01:36:09,684 --> 01:36:10,719
Come on over.

1363
01:36:11,686 --> 01:36:13,153
All right.

1364
01:36:18,192 --> 01:36:19,491
I'm here.

1365
01:36:19,493 --> 01:36:23,229
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1366
01:36:24,565 --> 01:36:26,534
there's gonna be carnage.
