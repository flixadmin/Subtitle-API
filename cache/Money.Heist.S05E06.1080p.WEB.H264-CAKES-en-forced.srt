BARENTS SEA, FIVE YEARS BEFORE D-DAY

2
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:46,416
We've sabotaged this priceless pump
to get it out of here.

3
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,083
Tell him we're going to steal it from him.

4
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:04,750
Tell him that we're also
taking this gentleman here with us.

5
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:09,250
He spends so much time alone underwater,
breathing a mix of oxygen and helium,

6
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,583
that he's realized his wallet is full

7
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:14,208
of photos of the seven families
he hasn't had.

8
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,750
His kids call him "<i>güey</i>" and "sir"
because nobody calls a stranger "Dad."

9
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,041
That's why he wants
to get involved in our heist,

10
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,791
to see if he can have a family
that isn't just on photo paper.

11
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,166
By the way,
tell the foreman we charge 50% up front.

12
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,750
He's going to have to pay us
to rob him. Translate, sir.

13
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,541
This guy is awesome.
Ask him if he has a sister.
