1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,530
There's a war coming.
A terrible war. There will be chaos.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,446
Rivers of blood in the streets, I know it.
I can see it coming.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,202
It's time. Somebody has to take over.
It might as well be me.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,484
- My name's James Gordon. A detective.
- My name is Bruce Wayne.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,210
I will find the man who did this.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,089
Stop or I'll shoot!

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,446
Mario Pepper was framed
by Fish Mooney and the cops.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,364
Why snitch on your own boss?

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,760
You want to push Fish out.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,601
I told you this is important.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,724
I ain't looking for no girl.
I'm looking for a weapon.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,405
The old man has to go.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,490
If he figures out we're working together,
we're cooked.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,604
You're under arrest for the murder
of Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,484
- Holy crap.
- I am Oswald Cobblepot.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,331
You son of a bitch.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,164
<i>He's alive? Alive!</i>

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,126
No.

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,841
Boss, what's wrong?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,367
Gordon didn't kill
Penguin like he was told.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,931
- What?
- Penguin...

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,003
...is alive and working for Maroni?

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,964
No.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,646
You go find Gordon
and you bring him to me.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,564
Still breathing.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,451
I wanna talk to that son of a bitch.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,931
<i>Hey. Leave a message.</i>

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,526
Barbara, if you're at home, listen to me.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,286
I need you to get out right now.

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,484
- I thought we were friends.
- Harvey.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,642
Shut up. Game's over.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,408
Now I gotta kill you, take your body back
to Falcone and beg-- Beg him for mercy!

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,085
Listen to me. I screwed up.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,847
But I have a plan to make things right.
Don't kill me. Help me.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,764
You think I'm an idiot?

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,641
Walk away.

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,406
Walk away.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,811
Help me.

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,126
- We don't have to go out like this.
- You better hope you never see me again.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,570
Wow.

41
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,366
What a place, huh?

42
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,767
A beautiful home...

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,644
...for a beautiful lady.

44
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,130
Please tell me what you want.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,800
I guess there's no harm in the truth.

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,205
See, your boyfriend was supposed to kill a
certain person for somebody, only he didn't.

47
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,843
And now that somebody is real mad. Heh.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,241
- Cobblepot.
- What?

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,010
He didn't kill Cobblepot.

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,567
There you go!

51
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,325
You're hip.

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,448
You are hip.

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,649
That Jim Gordon
is one lucky son of a gun.

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,563
What, are you like 100 pounds?

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,290
One-ten?

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,171
I bet that's your real hair color too.

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,086
What are you gonna do to Jim?

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,242
You ever been with a criminal?

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,129
Some ladies find it a turn-on.

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,766
- Jim.
- Hey.

61
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,160
Speak of the devil.

62
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,004
I was getting to know your lady.

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,208
You're trespassing. Get out.

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,847
Slow down. You're misreading
the situation. I'm the shot-caller here.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,767
You've been told to bring me in alive or I'd
be dead. I'm happy to kill you right here.

66
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,811
Don't be such a hard ass.
Come on, you know the rules.

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,090
You play nice. You take your lumps.
Nobody else gets hurt.

68
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,720
Tell your friend to drop his gun
or I'll blow his brains out.

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,524
- Oh, my God. Jim.
- It's under control.

70
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,209
Drop your gun.

71
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,240
Okay. Have it your way.

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,564
But now, after we kill you,
we're gonna kill blondie too.

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,609
Nice and slow.

74
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,051
We've gotta go. Right now.

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,606
Barbara.

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,367
<i>Westbound interstate
express departs in five minutes, Bay 12.</i>

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,760
Barbara.

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,850
- What?
- Listen.

79
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,168
No. No.

80
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,527
- Just a couple of days and I'll join you.
- No.

81
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,409
There are things I need to do.

82
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,122
Fine. Then if you stay, I stay. Okay?
Because I love you, Jim. I cannot leave you.

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,170
I love you too.
That's why you need to leave.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,004
If I know you're safe,
there is nothing they can do to me.

85
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,371
I'll make things right.
And then I'll come join you.

86
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,811
And what if you don't?

87
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,528
Don't come back.

88
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,007
Don't come back to Gotham.

89
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,885
No, Jim.

90
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,889
Gordon's here. He's nuts.

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,451
What's he doing?

92
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,640
You believe this guy?

93
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,810
Hey, Alvarez.

94
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,649
You got any of those blank warrants
that Judge Barn Barn signed?

95
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,006
Uh...

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,685
Yeah.

97
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,969
This cannot stand.

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,569
Gordon must die. Bullock must die.
Penguin must die. Today.

99
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,171
- And Maroni too, I suppose?
- If need be.

100
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,726
You're overreacting, my dear.
This Penguin's a nobody.

101
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,929
You want to start a war over the guy
that carried your umbrella?

102
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,527
He was on my hip everywhere with me.
He knows things.

103
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,250
Like what?

104
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,284
Too much. He knows too much.

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,929
Go to Maroni and ask him politely
to hand over your little man. Politely.

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,928
If he refuses,
we can talk about stronger measures.

107
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,122
Boss, this is weak response.

108
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,727
I hate to agree with Fish,
but we need to show strength now.

109
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,249
We need to hit back hard.
No talk. Penguin dead. Gordon dead. Done.

110
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,087
Relax, Niko. I know what I'm doing.

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,887
Where is Gordon?
You were bringing him with you.

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,850
No. He wouldn't come without a struggle.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,166
I don't know if he's playing tough or crazy,
but he's at work like nothing's wrong.

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,084
I'll send Victor to fetch him.

115
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,607
No need. My guys can handle him.

116
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,648
I'll send Victor.

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,682
That's a nice handsome bird, huh?

118
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,891
I don't know chickens.

119
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,728
- Ugh.
- Fall back. The old man is right there.

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,049
Screw him. He's done.
Now's the time to strike.

121
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,090
- Not yet.
- "Not yet." "Not yet." If not now, when?

122
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,562
Look at him. Maroni clan are laughing
at us and he plays with chickens.

123
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,805
That's what has me worried.
The chickens.

124
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,009
He's happy, relaxed,
as if he doesn't have a care in the world.

125
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,686
- That girl of yours is doing her job, then.
- No.

126
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,561
She says he hasn't even touched her.
She cooks and she cleans for him.

127
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,122
- He likes to watch her do chores.
- Weird.

128
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,402
- But if that's his thing...
- No.

129
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,804
He's acting as if he knows something
important that no one else knows.

130
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,208
What the hell are you doing here?

131
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,280
I work here. It's my shift.
Where else should I be?

132
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,204
How about Alaska?

133
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,601
Arrest warrants? For who?

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,963
Mayor Aubrey James, Carmine Falcone,
and their close associates.

135
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,567
On charges of conspiracy and perversion
of justice in the Wayne case.

136
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,291
- Are you insane?
- No.

137
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,211
Maybe a little. Feels good.

138
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,042
They're gonna try and kill me anyway.
Might as well make them pay for it.

139
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,010
You're gonna arrest
the mayor and Don Falcone. How?

140
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,888
My testimony is attached to the warrants.
That's enough to indict on a dozen counts.

141
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,526
True. If you could execute
the warrants, which you can't.

142
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,047
If the DA would prosecute, which he won't.

143
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,044
There's not a cop or lawyer
in the city who'll help you.

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,841
There are people willing to help
once they see it's possible to fight back.

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,164
You're dreaming.
Nobody will help you. I won't help you.

146
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,767
You don't think I want change,
just like you do?

147
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,410
I have a family.

148
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,724
I understand.

149
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,245
Gordon...

150
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,727
...get out of town.

151
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,323
This is my home.

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,608
It was my father's home.

153
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,489
I'm not leaving.

154
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,165
Hello, everyone.

155
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,045
My name is Victor Zsasz.

156
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,365
I'm sent here personally
by Don Carmine Falcone himself...

157
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,922
...on a matter of deep concern to him,
so please be respectful.

158
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,405
I'm here for Jim Gordon.

159
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,806
Only him. Everybody else,
mind your business and we're cool.

160
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,526
So where's Jim at?

161
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,204
Thank you.

162
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,530
Hey, Jim!

163
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,402
Jim.

164
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,523
Hi, Jim.

165
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,843
Relax. I'm supposed to take you in alive.

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,651
Don Falcone wants to talk.

167
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,209
Tell Falcone we'll talk, but not today.

168
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,921
Don't be that way.

169
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,727
Alive is a very broad category.

170
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,562
A man with no hands can still be alive.

171
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,567
There are 50 cops in here. Try something.

172
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,886
Everybody out.

173
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,526
Please!

174
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,122
Go, boss. Get out of here.

175
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,850
- Jim--
- Go.

176
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,568
I can handle this.

177
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,409
Well, how now, Jim?

178
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,211
Jim?

179
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,805
Jim?

180
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,085
Why are you hiding from me, Jim?

181
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,970
Hey! What the--?

182
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,285
There.

183
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,851
You need a ride?

184
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,765
Go. Go. Go.

185
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,765
No. Please.

186
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,645
Twenty-eight.

187
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,091
Ah. You're back.

188
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,804
How do you feel?

189
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,009
Terrible.

190
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,125
Where am I? Who are you?

191
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,049
I'm a friend of Montoya and Allen.

192
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,804
I took two bullets out of you, sewed you up.
Now I'm checking to see how you're doing.

193
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,000
So who are you? What city are we in?
And what day of the week is it?

194
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,324
I'm James Gordon. We're in Gotham.

195
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,006
It's Friday. Why are there rats?

196
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,050
It's the dissection lab at the university.

197
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,128
I gather you're a fugitive from the mob.
"Can't go to the hospital," said Crispus.

198
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,801
Very exciting, I must say.

199
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,051
- How long have I been out?
- Just a couple of hours or so.

200
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,807
You're very lucky no vital organs were--
Whoa. Lie back down.

201
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,884
Okay, you were hurt.
Just a week or so in bed--

202
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,884
- No, I have to go.
- James, you have lost a lot of blood.

203
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,522
You have to do as I say and lie back down.
If you don't, you could die.

204
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,330
I have to stand. Can you help me?

205
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,801
Okay. Okay. Crispus.

206
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,721
- He said he's leaving already.
- I have to go. Now.

207
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,405
Sure.

208
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,528
Some clothes would be good though.

209
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,847
This is about tradition. Values.

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,810
Snitches get stitches.
That's how it's always been.

211
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,724
You need to hand him over, Sal.

212
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,121
I know. I should.

213
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,930
But what can I say?

214
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,606
- The little guy amuses me.
- Heh.

215
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,322
Don Falcone is going to be very unhappy.
You wanna start a war over this punk?

216
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,369
War? Whoa.

217
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,889
- He's that important to you, is he?
- Oh, no.

218
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,682
He means nothing to us.
Respect is what matters here.

219
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,650
Respect, I understand.

220
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,610
Penguin, come on out here.

221
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,922
Don't be scared. She won't bite.
You won't bite him, will you?

222
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,531
Hello, Penguin.

223
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,165
Hello, Ms. Mooney.

224
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,486
Penguin, Ms. Mooney
and her boss, Mr. Falcone...

225
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,802
...feel disrespected by you.

226
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,646
Oh, dear.
That certainly has never been my intention.

227
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,401
Well, respect is very important to them.

228
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,963
Now, I want a sincere apology
from you for making them feel that way.

229
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,847
Oh. Gosh, of course.

230
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,850
If I've, in any way, caused anyone
to feel a lack of respect, I apologize.

231
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,002
Sincerely.

232
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,849
There you go. Can't say fairer than that.

233
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,321
Bloodshed then. I'm glad.

234
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,568
Jolly fat men are so tiresome.

235
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,050
And you.

236
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,642
You little scaly-faced bitch.

237
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,891
Oh.

238
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,486
What I'm gonna do to you.

239
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,122
Torture's far too nice of a word.

240
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,368
I'm sorry you feel that way, Fish.

241
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,287
Ungh!

242
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,364
Only my friends call me Fish.

243
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,130
Hey, Sisters.

244
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,644
How's it hanging?

245
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,361
Holy--!

246
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,882
Tell your boss Falcone won't let any
of Maroni's trucks over the bridge.

247
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,243
Not till he gives up Penguin.
Listen, you gotta get hurt a little.

248
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,251
- You want a beating or a bullet?
- Why we gotta get hurt?

249
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,121
Because we're sending a message
this is a serious issue.

250
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,964
We'll tell him it's serious.
No problem.

251
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,531
Eh, you know what?

252
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,651
How did they find out
about the gun truck, huh?

253
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,088
That's 3 mil per week, right there.

254
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,004
Son of a bitch!

255
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,003
Four and a half mil per, gross. Cash.

256
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,049
A very aggressive move, isn't it?

257
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,806
An overreaction. They want to scare you.

258
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,611
You think that they think
that Don Maroni can be scared?

259
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,440
Of course you're right, no.

260
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,682
But why then would they
react so ferociously?

261
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,411
- Why do they want me back so badly?
- I know why.

262
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,970
Because they know I got
a stone money-maker here.

263
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,648
A golden goose. They know it and they
don't want us to have him. Right, Penguin?

264
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,448
Honk, honk. Heh, heh.

265
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,887
- What?
- Honk, honk.

266
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,761
- It's what geese say.
- Right, right. Honk, honk.

267
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,767
So fine. He's a goose. Maybe we can
negotiate a price. Pay him off.

268
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,570
- Yeah.
- Yes.

269
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,529
Caution is wise.

270
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,527
The Falcone clan still is number one.
Paying them off is the safe thing to do.

271
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,205
Screw safe.

272
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,522
They wanna push me?
They think I'm gonna fold?

273
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,091
I'll push right back. Harder.

274
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,846
Hit them where it hurts. Today.

275
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,485
You know best.

276
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,650
If that's how you wanna play it...

277
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,722
...I think I know just
the spot to hit them.

278
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,725
I owe you an apology.

279
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,247
You were telling the truth
and I wouldn't believe you.

280
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,007
Maybe my personal feelings towards
Barbara got tangled up in there.

281
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,730
- That was wrong.
- Forget it.

282
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,920
Anyhow, I'm sorry for misjudging you and
I'm glad that we're on the same side now.

283
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,764
Yeah, me too.

284
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,331
So Barbara's safe though?
You sure she's safe?

285
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,290
I'm sure.

286
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,884
Unh! Agh.

287
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,929
Gordon, is that you?

288
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,280
It's all right, Alfred. He's a friend.

289
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,011
We couldn't risk a direct approach.
People are looking for me.

290
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,208
- All right.
- Agh!

291
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,283
Sorry about that, mate.

292
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,005
Can't be too careful.

293
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,404
In a spot of bother, are we, sir?

294
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,920
Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen.

295
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,247
- Pleased to meet you.
- Bruce.

296
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,251
I promised I would find
your parents' killer.

297
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,121
I'm not sure I'm gonna be able
to keep that promise.

298
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,171
It's a long story,
but I'm kind of in a tight spot.

299
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,164
I've upset some powerful people.

300
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,049
Stop treating me like a child.

301
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,050
- Explain.
- You are a child. You don't need to know--

302
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,725
You expect to die!

303
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,962
I'd like to know why.

304
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,088
Is it connected to my parents' murder?

305
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,850
Yes. It's all connected.

306
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,130
Somehow.

307
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,165
Bruce.

308
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,089
I will do my best to work
this thing out, but if I don't...

309
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,003
...Montoya and Allen here
will take over your parents' case.

310
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,363
I've told them everything I know.
You can trust them, 100 percent.

311
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,806
One hundred percent.

312
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,124
Bruce, these are good detectives.

313
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,202
If anyone can find the truth, it's them.

314
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,924
Thank you.

315
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,881
Sir, what can we do to help you now?

316
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,647
Nothing.
From here on in, I have to go it alone.

317
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,167
I don't want anyone else caught up in this.

318
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,807
- I have to go.
- You can hardly walk.

319
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,204
I'll be fine.

320
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,444
This way.

321
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,289
Not much further.

322
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,490
It's there.

323
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,971
Told you. Easy as pie.

324
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,242
There must be a million
dollars' worth here.

325
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,926
Yeah, you told us, all right.

326
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,728
You're clever.

327
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,481
You're very clever.

328
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,371
I sense a sarcastic
and hostile edge to your tone.

329
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,601
Hostile?

330
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,050
You got that right.

331
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,649
You ain't no golden goose. You're a yellow
rat snitch and you got Maroni all twisted.

332
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,929
I'm so glad
we're finally clearing the air, at last.

333
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,290
That's it. Act smart, okay?

334
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,042
Because all I gotta do right now
is put a bullet in your brain right here:

335
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,406
bang.

336
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,449
See, then I go back and I tell the boss...

337
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,650
...that one of Nike's men shot you.
Gee, that's too bad. End of story.

338
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,801
Yes, that's clever enough.

339
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,565
I never doubted your intelligence.
That's not your problem.

340
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,530
Oh, I got a problem, huh?
I got a problem.

341
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,763
No. You got a problem.
What's my problem, shmo?

342
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,729
What drives you?

343
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,131
What's your passion?

344
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,968
When you know what a man loves,
you know what can kill him.

345
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,849
Do you believe this guy?

346
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,321
For you, it's money.

347
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,645
You love money.

348
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,971
More than power and respect.

349
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,805
You're a skinflint, Mr. Carbone.

350
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,962
A cheapskate.

351
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,769
What are you guys 'May-mg an
Let me gm!

352
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,445
- Sorry, Frankie.
- What?

353
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,206
- As I say, a Cheapskate.
- Hey, come on!

354
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,288
And consequently,
you don't pay your people enough.

355
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,283
Oh, no. You don't want to do this.

356
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,445
- It is a sad fact...
- Stop, you don't want to do this.

357
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,289
- ...that there is no loyalty among thieves.
- No, no. No!

358
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,923
The simple offer of a substantial pay raise
is all it took to sway these fine men.

359
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,729
So you see, that's your problem.

360
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,683
Your greatest passion
becomes your greatest weakness.

361
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,569
Love...

362
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,168
...Mr. Carbone.

363
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,161
Love conquers all.

364
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,445
Shh.

365
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,606
My friend.

366
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,845
My good friend, today is a sad day.

367
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,087
Nikolai was like a son to me.
Just as Frankie was a son to you.

368
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,608
We've both lost precious family members.

369
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,526
- My condolences to you.
- And mine to you.

370
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,566
I want this violence to stop.
Business is good.

371
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,521
The Arkham Project is a gold mine.
Wayne Enterprises is back in play.

372
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,891
Life is good for all of us. Why risk
all of that to go to war over trifles?

373
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,491
Your little man there is
obviously very valuable to you.

374
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,248
We'll let you have him, unharmed.
Our gift to you.

375
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,968
And as a show of mutual respect,
you give us something in return.

376
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,683
Like such as what?

377
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,205
How about real estate?

378
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,081
One of your warehouses
on the river, maybe.

379
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,965
That's not gonna work.

380
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,160
I mean, I like this fella, but we're
talking about a warehouse on the river.

381
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,164
Yeah.

382
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,370
Indian Hill. I'll give you Indian Hill.

383
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,602
I'm not familiar with the name.

384
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:11,291
It's in Arkham. It's a toxic waste dump
on an Indian burial ground. It's worthless.

385
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,126
Oh. Nothing is worthless.

386
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,011
Even nothing is worth something.
We'll take it.

387
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,011
As a token of our mutual respect, yes?

388
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,083
You got it, my friend.

389
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,447
It's all love. Heh, heh.

390
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,488
It's a pleasure seeing you all.

391
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,127
Um, I heard Vic Zsasz tore up
the G.C.P.D. tracking down Gordon.

392
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,884
Did you catch him yet?

393
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,080
We're working on it.

394
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,484
Well, good luck with that. There's nothing
more dangerous than an honest man, huh?

395
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,450
Jimbo, it's me. Open up.

396
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,047
- Hey.
- Don't worry. I'm not gonna kill you.

397
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,885
I should, but I ain't.

398
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,166
Glad to hear it.

399
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,846
You figured you'd go
to the last place they'd look...

400
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,006
...because it'd be the first place they'd reject
as being too obvious. Sorry, I'm being rude.

401
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,290
This is the Duchess of Devonshire.
Duchess, Jim Gordon, putz.

402
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,408
- Marsha. Hi.
- Hi.

403
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,882
Baby, why don't you explore a little bit?
Find the bedroom.

404
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,529
Put on your birthday suit
and I'll find you in a jiffy, okay?

405
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,326
So I've been thinking,
you're still a douche bag.

406
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,804
But you have the moral high ground. So
I'm gonna back your play, whatever it is.

407
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,884
I figure I'm doomed anyhow.
I might as well join the good guys.

408
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,644
Thank you.

409
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,610
So, what is your play?
You got one, right? You said you did.

410
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,721
Tomorrow morning, I'm arresting Falcone
and the mayor for framing Mario Pepper.

411
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,360
For conspiracy, P.O.J., RICO, the works.

412
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,761
Wow, that's a hell of a plan.

413
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,606
You sit down with chimpanzees and
a bucket of crack and come up with that?

414
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,287
Whatever else happens, we'll stir things
up. We might even make the papers.

415
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,446
We'll make the papers, all right. We'll
be dead in time for the evening edition.

416
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,128
The people will know the truth. We'll
go out doing our jobs. Enforcing the law.

417
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,568
That's the best inspirational speech
you got? Doing our jobs?

418
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,047
- You don't have to join me.
- No, I'm game.

419
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,770
Like I said, I'm doomed anyhow.

420
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,409
Now, if you'll excuse me for one minute.
Just gonna take care of some business.

421
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,489
Duchess!

422
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,244
Marco.

423
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,249
Polo.

424
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,931
Jumping catfish.

425
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,128
Good morning, Mayor James.

426
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,567
Gordon, you scared
the bajeebers out of me.

427
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,165
Almost spilled my coffee.

428
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,846
Sorry. Sir, you're under arrest.

429
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,161
That's not funny.

430
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,525
Depends where you're sitting.

431
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,085
Might wanna take a look at this.

432
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,803
How you doing, guys?
I'm here to have a chat with Mr. Falcone.

433
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,806
Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.

434
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,571
Carmine Falcone, you're under arrest.

435
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,210
Move.

436
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,722
Lie down right over there. Stay quiet.

437
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,049
What on earth are you thinking?

438
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,649
We'll take you both to jail and charge you
with conspiracy to pervert justice.

439
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,610
Try and take me in,
you won't make it to the end of the street.

440
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,001
- Exactly what I said.
- This is a lawful arrest.

441
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,931
- If you resist, you will be shot.
- I see.

442
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,010
We all die together in a blaze of glory.

443
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,891
If that's how it works out, that's fine.
How about you, Harvey?

444
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,849
- Fine by me.
- Oh, God.

445
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,130
I envy you boys.
Having nothing to lose must be liberating.

446
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,521
- Must feel pretty good.
- Yes, it does.

447
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,964
Suppose you did have something to lose.
What would you do then? Suppose...

448
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,488
...I had a knife
to Barbara Kean's throat right now.

449
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,290
Would you still be so brave?

450
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,721
- You don't.
- I'm telling you I do.

451
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,120
You're a liar.

452
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,449
I have many faults, but I'm not a liar.

453
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,650
Victor Zsasz has Barbara. You know Victor.

454
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,968
- You're lying. She's far away.
- She came back.

455
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,128
Came right to me to plead for your life.

456
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,322
You have a good woman there.
She loves you very much.

457
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,164
Too much.

458
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,890
Prove it.

459
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,686
Prove you have her.

460
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,251
I could.

461
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,209
But I won't.

462
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,728
I want you to believe me.

463
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,364
It's obvious, Jim. He's lying.

464
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,046
Am I?

465
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,885
If you think so,
go ahead and try to bring me in.

466
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,131
You'll be dead, so you won't know
what happens to Barbara.

467
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,004
But it won't be pretty.

468
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,964
Lying.

469
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,650
On my mother's grave.

470
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,129
Drop your gun and Barbara
won't be harmed in any way.

471
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,170
Those muffins smell good.

472
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,846
None for you, creep.

473
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,810
She can have one if she wants.

474
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,488
No, thank you.

475
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,211
Got it.

476
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,966
What a shame.

477
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,042
Oh, this is embarrassing.
He straight-up bluffed you into folding.

478
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,363
We could have gone out like heroes.
Now we're fish food.

479
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,801
Okay, so it wasn't a bluff.

480
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,768
Sorry if she was mistreated a little.

481
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,685
We needed to be sure
she had nothing useful to tell us.

482
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,966
Untie her, Victor.

483
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,685
I'm sorry.

484
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,729
It's okay. It's okay.

485
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,484
What am I gonna do with you?

486
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,363
By rights, you have to die.

487
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,602
Whoa, hello. Um, late for work.

488
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,806
Quite an adventure. I'll be on my way.

489
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,161
Such a waste though.
Gotham needs men like you. Both of you.

490
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,601
Strong men with principles.
I wish I could show you I'm not the enemy.

491
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,560
The system is not the enemy.
The enemy is anarchy.

492
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,682
But I told you that before, didn't I, Jim?

493
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,367
- Yes, you did.
- You didn't listen though.

494
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,410
Do we get a last meal or a smoke
or anything? Or just talk?

495
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,804
But today, you believed me.

496
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,567
You trusted my word.
That's a good first step.

497
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,409
Perhaps there's still hope for you.

498
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,964
Yes.

499
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,561
Go. Get out of here
before I change my mind.

500
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,449
- Wait a minute.
- Quiet.

501
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,170
It's been a pleasure, Barbara.

502
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,610
I do admire a brave woman.

503
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,689
- What's the catch?
- He said we could go. Let's not haggle here.

504
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,491
What's the catch, Mr. Falcone?

505
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,321
I want you to think about what I said.

506
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,444
I want you to understand the truth.
That's all I ask.

507
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,682
The catch is...

508
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,525
...someday soon, you'll see I'm right.

509
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,440
Barbara.

510
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,446
I'm sorry.

511
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,443
I was just trying to help. And...

512
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,484
...I don't know, I--

513
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,806
I love you so much.

514
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,485
Mm.

515
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,608
Excellent. Delicious.

516
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,402
Yes. I followed the recipe.
You're right, Mr. F. Cooking is easy.

517
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,806
I'm sorry you had to see all that earlier.

518
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,761
Not pleasant.

519
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,720
I understand. Business is business.

520
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,609
Yes, it is.

521
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,167
I'll go see to the chickens.

522
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,764
Bawk-bawk-bawk.

523
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,366
Any eggs, my dears?

524
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,286
Don Falcone.

525
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,606
My friend. Good to see you.

526
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,122
I was just thinking about the night we met.

527
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,169
Cut them down.

528
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,442
Where's the snitch? I wanna speak to him.

529
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,561
Cobblepot, is it?

530
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,766
Condemned men are honest men, I find.
What can you tell me before you go?

531
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,328
Don Falcone. It is a great honor, sir.

532
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,007
Indeed, I can tell a secret
of great value to you...

533
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,241
...if you grant me one last request.

534
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,085
Which is what?

535
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,961
Give the job of killing me to James Gordon.

536
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,481
Why him?

537
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,965
He's the only man under your sway
who has a conscience.

538
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,010
The only one who might be
persuaded to spare my life.

539
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,363
Why would I agree to that?
I want you dead. You're a snitch.

540
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,406
If you agree and Gordon spares me...

541
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,929
...then I will become your snitch for life.

542
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,651
I will come back to Gotham
under a different name.

543
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,640
I will work my way into the Maroni family,
and I will snitch for you.

544
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,402
I'm excellent at this sort of work.

545
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,328
I have a gift for it. I really do, sir.

546
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,365
Deal.

547
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,524
Gordon will get the job of killing you.

548
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,328
Thank you, sir.

549
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,250
What is the valuable secret?

550
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,164
Oh, yes.

551
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,451
Fish Mooney and Nikolai the Russian
only pretend to hate each other.

552
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,804
They're lovers.

553
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,726
And Fish is pushing Nikolai
to take your place.

554
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,081
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

555
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,325
But only so Fish can take over from him.

556
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,487
That is a good secret.

557
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,202
It's almost uncanny.

558
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,250
Everything played out
exactly as you said it would.

559
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,169
We got rid of Nikolai painlessly
and Maroni thinks you're a wizard.

560
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,807
You really do have a gift.

561
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,482
But I think we're making
a mistake letting Gordon live.

562
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,404
He's trouble.

563
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,245
Thank you so much for sparing him.

564
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,129
I appreciate the favor.

565
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,242
Don't worry. He'll see the light.

566
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,971
One way or another, I guarantee it.
