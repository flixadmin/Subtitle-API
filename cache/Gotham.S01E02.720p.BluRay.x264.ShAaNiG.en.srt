1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,971
There's a war coming.

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,549
A terrible war. There will be chaos.

3
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:10,582
Rivers of the blood in the streets,
I know it. I can see it coming.

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:14,415
It's time. Somebody has to take over,
it might as well be me.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,326
- My name's James Gordon. I'm a detective.
- My name is Bruce Wayne.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,261
I promise I will find the man who did this.

7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,762
Stop or I'll shoot!

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,599
He was framed.
To cover up for the real killer.

9
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,398
I know that you own the police department,
probably the mayor.

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,236
You can't have organized crime
without law and order.

11
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,743
You snitched, my little Penguin.

12
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,007
- Please.
- Falcone wants a bullet in his head.

13
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,686
Then we know you're with the program.

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,717
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

15
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,878
Ah. There you are.

16
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,308
Been all over the bloody house
looking for you.

17
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,816
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

18
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,753
You, my old son, are a terrible liar.

19
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,652
What you got there?

20
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,230
Come on, show me.

21
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,164
Oh, my God, you stupid little boy!

22
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,730
Aw.

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,609
It's all right. I'm sorry.

24
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,807
It's gonna be all right.

25
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,671
Hi, I'm Patti. This is Doug.

26
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,142
We're with the mayor's
homeless outreach project.

27
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,043
- We have some sandwiches and soup.
- We got cookies, candy.

28
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,682
Who here likes chocolate?

29
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,047
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Ain't you hungry, Cat?

30
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:30,058
Yeah, dig in. Take a sandwich.
Sure, go ahead. Plenty for everyone.

31
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,058
Haven't had a sandwich in forever.

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,226
Yeah, sure. Take two.

33
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,996
- Hey!
- Hey, lady!

34
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,042
- Oh, fudge!
- Don't worry, I'll go.

35
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,815
Slow down, there, buckaroo.
Stop struggling.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
<b><font color=#004F8C> v.1.0</b></font>

37
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,232
I got you one, but I dropped it.

38
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,804
Yeah, thanks.

39
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,771
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

40
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,741
- What do you think?
- I think it's been a long shift.

41
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,381
We give this bum three hours,
then we knock off.

42
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,780
- He was a vet.
- I salute his service. Now he's a dead bum.

43
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,946
People shoot bums all the time.
We might as well look for the tooth fairy.

44
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,318
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bo.

45
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,325
How come you weren't here?

46
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,723
- Whoa, whoa. Good morning to you too.
- Where were you?

47
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,921
At a restaurant down the street. Chez Vous.

48
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:18,660
They had some homeless junkie kid
fell through their front window last night.

49
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,304
- Been taking care of that.
- This is a potential murder.

50
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,408
You're first responder.
Supposed to preserve the crime scene.

51
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,100
He's got a point.

52
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,075
The restaurant that pays me 50 a month
to look out for them.

53
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,443
So I'm gonna babysit a dead wino?
I got a family.

54
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,913
He's got a point.

55
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,013
- Why'd the kid jump through the window?
- He was high.

56
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,247
- Did you ask him?
- Why am I the bad guy?

57
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,587
I'm asking about the kid because
maybe he's related to the victim.

58
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,958
- You're not a bad guy. Just a bad cop.
- Oh! Who are you talking to'!

59
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,361
- Hold on.
- Come on! Come on!

60
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,966
You want it? Any day.

61
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,865
Hey! Oh!

62
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,170
And then Zeb and Smoke went right down.

63
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,778
And that's when that wacky dude
just shot Soldier.

64
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,606
I realized I needed to get out of there.

65
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,809
I ran and I ran, and that's how I ended up
on the floor of that restaurant.

66
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,454
- She used a pen?
- I swear.

67
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,679
A big pen.

68
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,687
But listen, this is not the first time.

69
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,656
Street kids have been disappearing
for weeks now.

70
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,557
By the dozen. No one knows why.

71
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,956
- First we heard about it.
- Why would you?

72
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,498
Nobody gives a crap about us.

73
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,193
- Look, that is proof.
- That's not proof, that's a scab.

74
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,067
Listen, Macky, we're grown-ups.
We're smarter than you.

75
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,207
- Man, whatever.
- You're gonna tell the truth!

76
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,470
It was you, wasn't it?
It was you that killed that poor old man.

77
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,309
You're gonna tell me the truth,
or I swear to God, I'll beat it out of you!

78
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,850
- That man was a war veteran!
- Cat was there. Cat saw the whole thing.

79
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,522
- Ask Cat.
- Relax. No one'll beat you. Who's Cat?

80
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,249
What do you mean? Isn't that what I
just said I was gonna do right now?

81
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,017
Come here. Come here.

82
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,661
- He is 16.
- Yeah, and G-foot, 220.

83
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,065
He can take a punch. Look,
I wasn't gonna beat him. Just scare him.

84
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,932
But if I did want to, I could.

85
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,072
- It would be my prerogative.
- It's illegal.

86
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,571
Ille--?

87
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,941
How now so righteous? Hm?

88
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,580
Not long since you put a man in the river.

89
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,011
You wanna say that a little louder?

90
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,212
- Not everybody heard.
- Since then you've been a pain in the ass.

91
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,791
You think I or anybody here gives a crap
about a dead snitch or your conscience?

92
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,576
- We got our own problems.
- Conscience.

93
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,198
Call it what you want,
I'm gonna do what's right.

94
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,924
- You're beginning to irritate me.
- Get your hands off me.

95
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,396
Hey!

96
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,128
Watch the shoes, clown.

97
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,038
Shift's over.

98
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,970
Come on. Come on.

99
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,298
Come on, seriously.

100
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,603
<i>My pretty baby</i>

101
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,009
<i>When I first came home...</i>

102
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,348
Thank you so much, guys. Truly.

103
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,854
- I'm grateful. I've been waiting for hours.
- No kidding.

104
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,785
- Look like you crawled out of a cemetery.
- Smells like it too.

105
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,755
Open a window back there.

106
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,159
- There you go.
- Yeah. That's-- Thank you.

107
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,300
Forgive me, I am somewhat disheveled.

108
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,332
A temporary setback, I assure you.

109
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,769
- Thank you so much.
- What the hell happened to you, anyhow?

110
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,604
It was my own fault.

111
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,637
Foolish arrogance led me astray.

112
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,607
But I learned my lessons.

113
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,849
I'll be back.

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,815
Stronger and smarter than ever.

115
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,684
- Good luck with that, bro.
- Here I am riding around in a lovely truck.

116
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,018
Sharing an ice-cold beer
with my new friends.

117
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,024
My luck's already turned, right?

118
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,360
Dude, anyone ever tell you?
When you walk, you look like a penguin.

119
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,032
No.

120
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,503
Nobody's ever told me that.

121
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,844
He's saying he has a right
to stop me from beating on a mope.

122
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,182
- Damn right.
- How am I supposed to work with this?

123
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,691
Look, Jim, it's not like I can order you
to break the law, but this is Gotham.

124
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,863
You don't bend, you'll get broke.

125
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,191
- I understand.
- I thought you were with the program?

126
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,561
- He is.
- Let's get back to work. Where you at?

127
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,260
If the boy we have is telling the truth...

128
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:50,407
...there's a couple kidnappers out there
abducting homeless children. In numbers.

129
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:54,101
They lured them with a food truck from
the mayor's homeless outreach project.

130
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,575
Then they drugged them with a jab
from a big pen.

131
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,445
Why would anyone want to abduct
scraggly-ass orphans in bulk?

132
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,052
Where's the market? They're on the street
because no one wants them anyway.

133
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,119
If they said they were snatching
cute girls, I'd believe them.

134
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,588
Why would anyone want
a lard-ass like Macky?

135
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,955
What is it, Ed?

136
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,424
Guess what I found.

137
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,768
I did a blood test on him
and he had high levels of ATP.

138
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,268
What's ATP?

139
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,400
It's a fast-acting knockout drug.

140
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,740
Used to use it at the old Arkham Asylum.
Bring down troublesome patients.

141
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,938
It's hard to get, no recreational use.

142
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,381
- Okay. That's interesting.
- Anything else?

143
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,385
Thank you, Ed.

144
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,384
Ahem.

145
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,752
Thank you, Ed.

146
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,824
Get to work.

147
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,558
And keep this quiet. No press. Not a word.

148
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,898
Shouldn't we tell the public
what's going on? Warn them?

149
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,666
Department policy.
We don't advertise this kind of stuff.

150
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,435
Causes panic. The headlines will read,
"Gotham's Kids Snatched."

151
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,669
Which would be true.

152
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,404
No press. That's an order.

153
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,345
Follow up on the drug. The ATP.

154
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:07,950
And the Arkham connection.

155
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,917
- Arkham's been closed for, like, 10 years.
- Yeah, 15.

156
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,648
The drug suppliers
might still be in business.

157
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,623
Uh, this happened on Fish Mooney's turf.

158
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:21,094
Do you wanna see if it's safe for us to go
back there, or is, uh, she still mad at us?

159
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,100
It's a good question.

160
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,113
Bravo!

161
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,441
Bravo!

162
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:50,385
Don Falcone, what a wonderful surprise.
Welcome.

163
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,891
Thank you, my dear.

164
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,564
- Can we talk?
- Of course.

165
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,824
- Give me a moment to clear the place.
- No, no.

166
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,367
No need to spoil the fun.

167
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,643
Men who are about to die are very honest.

168
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,344
It pays to listen to them.

169
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,556
That's some toast.

170
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,926
I spoke with your man Cobblepot
before he died.

171
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,492
Odd little fellow.

172
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,724
Perceptive.

173
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,235
He told me the death of the Waynes
would bring troubled times...

174
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,997
...for our family and Gotham.

175
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,506
Ugh. What did he know?

176
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,200
Business is good as ever.

177
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,879
No, he was right.

178
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:47,416
The Waynes and the Falcones
were the pillars of the same house.

179
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,215
We understood each other.

180
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,089
Now that they're gone,
everything is out of balance.

181
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,191
And the Wayne empire is in flux.

182
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,788
Who knows who'll end up in control.

183
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,555
The Maroni family senses weakness.

184
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:06,134
They'll start making moves and every
criminal in the city will start making moves.

185
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,805
Please, don't lose any sleep over Maroni.

186
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,269
He's number two for a reason.

187
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,705
I never lose sleep over my enemies.

188
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,471
It's my friends that keep me awake.

189
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,443
- Oh.
- Cobblepot told me you say...

190
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,282
...I'm old and soft and ready to be
taken out, and you're the one to take me.

191
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:32,788
Don Falcone, I would never, ever say that.

192
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,229
I only have deep love and respect for you.

193
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,596
You have been like a father to me.

194
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:44,007
I'm so happy to hear that.

195
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,335
Let's forget all about it, then.

196
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,313
The babbling of a condemned man.

197
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,280
Ahem. Enough business.

198
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,155
How have you been, my dear?
Thriving, I hope.

199
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,519
Yes. Good. I'm good.

200
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,990
Which of these is your lover?

201
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,130
Please, my heart has been broken
far too many times for that nonsense.

202
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,770
Hm.

203
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,133
I heard you had a lover.

204
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,970
Well, if you're referring to the boy
that I keep around for exercise...

205
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,806
...my lover, he is not.

206
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,184
- What's your name?
- Lazlo, sir.

207
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,354
Lazlo, be good to this woman,
she's very precious to me.

208
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,192
If you break her heart, you break my heart.

209
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,890
Yes, sir.

210
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,740
Give me your hand.

211
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,010
Thank you for being honest.
It means a lot to me.

212
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,210
It shows wisdom...

213
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,251
...and humility.

214
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,665
Out!

215
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,240
Everyone out!

216
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,551
Never, never in his life
my son is away this long.

217
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,454
Nightclubs is his business.

218
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,457
Such hours.

219
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:49,189
But, always, he comes home to his mother.

220
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,198
His clothes are here.

221
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,066
My son would never leave his clothes.

222
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,901
Oh. So elegant he is.

223
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,043
Yes, I show you.

224
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,373
Damn, Mooney and the cops
must've had him killed.

225
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,709
Looks like. But snitches get bumped.
That's life.

226
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,910
But they won't get away with it.
Not as easy as they think.

227
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,715
- You take things too personally, know that?
- Yeah, I do.

228
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,050
That was a good snitch.

229
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,750
- What are we--?
- Nothing. Mrs. Cobblepot--

230
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,223
Kapelput.

231
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,822
Mrs. Kapelput...

232
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,932
...do you know anyone
who might wanna do your son harm?

233
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,727
Harm?

234
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,132
No, I would feel it.

235
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,432
A mother feels these things.

236
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,401
It's a woman.

237
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,774
Some painted slut has him in her clutch.

238
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,915
A woman? You think?

239
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,016
I'm sure.

240
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,119
So handsome he is.

241
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,517
And so naïve.

242
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,151
Uh, who are you, again?

243
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,330
Uh, detectives
with Major Crimes Unit, ma'am.

244
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,696
Oh, G.C.P.D.

245
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,597
- Like that.
- But honest.

246
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,461
Mm.

247
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,506
Boss, don't get mad at me...

248
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,344
...but I know that look.

249
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,275
Now is too early
to make a move on Falcone.

250
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,778
I know.

251
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,783
Not yet.

252
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:21,524
I need more money, more men,
more territory. I know.

253
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,521
I'll play this thing
loyal and bide my time.

254
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,827
But I swear, Butch...

255
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,835
...on my sainted mother's grave,
someday soon...

256
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:43,037
...I am gonna kill that old man
with my bare hands and my teeth.

257
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,084
I'll be holding your shoes.

258
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:58,356
I just wish that Penguin was still alive.

259
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:05,534
I didn't make that little punk suffer
near badly enough.

260
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:16,839
Excuse me, sir?

261
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,614
I couldn't help but notice
the sign on your trailer.

262
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,050
Is it still for rent?

263
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,953
- 100 bucks a week. It ain't much but--
- I'll take it.

264
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,953
- You don't wanna look at it first?
- No. I'm not fussy.

265
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,292
- It's all yours.
- The key?

266
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,902
Hey, sweet truck.
You got that big Hemi in there?

267
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,563
Yes. Yup.

268
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:47,233
That big Hemi's in there. Somewhere.

269
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,102
Uh, sir, the key?

270
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,214
It's in the door.

271
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,275
Okay.

272
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,460
What's up, players?

273
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,900
- You got any smokes?
- No.

274
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,436
Where are we?

275
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,607
Damned if I know.

276
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,809
I think we're dead.

277
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,697
Harvey. Jim. How marvelous.

278
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,095
Are you still mad at us?

279
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,002
No. Please.

280
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:51,608
I'm quite fond of you. And you intrigue me.

281
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,301
I knew I'd regret killing you
as soon as I gave the word.

282
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,105
But you know me.

283
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,441
I'm feisty.

284
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,279
What do you know about a man and
woman abducting street kids on your turf?

285
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,477
No foreplay with you. Hm?

286
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:05,951
Figures.

287
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,216
But you got with the program.

288
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,121
Killed Penguin your own bad self.

289
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,321
I was surprised. Straight arrow like you.

290
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,160
- I guess you misjudged me.
- I guess I did.

291
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,996
You're just a little sinner
like the rest of us.

292
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,165
I'm almost kind of sad about that.

293
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,137
We're looking for a man and a woman.

294
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,739
Middle-aged. White.

295
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,506
Targeting children under 16.

296
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,413
They use a poisoned pen,
if you can believe it.

297
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,521
Oh. Used to be, there was only a market
for nice-looking girls.

298
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:40,747
That's what I said.

299
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,520
But now there's a new buyer overseas
that'll take anyone young and healthy.

300
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,391
Overseas where? Who's "they"?

301
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,894
Nobody knows.

302
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,568
- What do they want them for?
- Nobody knows.

303
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,430
And no one cares to know.

304
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,572
Ta-da, moo sh...

305
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,009
Sorry. Go on.

306
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,742
They drugged them with a big pen?
That is so creepy.

307
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,217
Ah, you don't wanna hear this stuff,
it's depressing.

308
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,118
What do they use them for? The children.

309
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,689
Nobody seems to know.

310
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,555
And we can't say a damn thing to the press.
Bad PR.

311
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,755
- I can't believe the system is so corrupt.
- You have no idea.

312
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,957
What do you mean?

313
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,704
Oh. Figure of speech, I guess.

314
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,297
Did something happen
you're not telling me about?

315
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,034
These last couple of weeks
you've been different.

316
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,770
Troubled.

317
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,612
Mm.

318
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,374
No.

319
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,752
Been having trouble sleeping, I guess.

320
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,251
The newspapers must get anonymous tips
all the time.

321
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,721
Sure. Yeah.

322
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,893
You mean call it in myself? Heh.

323
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,628
No, I can't do that.

324
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,235
- Gotham Gazette? The news room?
- Wait. No.

325
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,073
I can't talk long. Somebody is abducting
homeless children off the streets.

326
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,149
And the cops are trying to keep it quiet.
Go talk to Captain Sarah Essen of G.C.P.D.

327
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,514
She has got a kid in custody
who can tell you the whole story.

328
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,279
- End the call.
- I gotta go.

329
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,356
Listen, Barbara, when I tell you stuff, it's
between us. You can't do what you just did.

330
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,758
- It was the right thing to do.
- Not the point.

331
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,490
What is the point?

332
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,369
You're right, it was the right thing to do.

333
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,468
Don't do it again. Okay?

334
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,498
Yes, boss.

335
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,008
"Gotham spirals ever downward.
Mayor James under attack.

336
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,648
Vows swift action.

337
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:49,012
Points finger
at police department's sluggish response."

338
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,278
Etcetera.

339
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,717
- It's just ink.
- Did you give them this?

340
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,359
- Me?
- You've done it before.

341
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,186
On my own case? Never.

342
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,226
It'd be a very stupid thing to do.

343
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,555
Jim?

344
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,060
I didn't call it in.

345
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,496
- I swear.
- Another mystery.

346
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,867
We have a thin lead on the case,
if you'd like to hear it, ma'am.

347
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,873
There's only three companies in Gotham
that stock this ATP.

348
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,206
You need a special license to buy it.
Chances are, one is crooked.

349
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,475
We're looking to lean hard on all three
like they are crooked.

350
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,710
See which one pops.

351
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,762
That was sneaky good.

352
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,899
- Almost couldn't tell you were lying.
- I wasn't lying.

353
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:39,759
Good morning, Judge Baker.

354
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,263
Thank you, sir. Yes, all three.

355
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,441
Wellzine, Dracotech,
and Quillan Pharma.

356
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,943
You guys have screwed me.

357
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:56,613
Against my better judgment
I sell you the juice.

358
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:02,014
I let you guys use my storage space
because, "No problem," you said.

359
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,591
And now look.

360
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,092
Heat. White hot heat.

361
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,196
No problems, my friend.

362
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,596
We're here to take the merch away.
You'll be clean as a whistle.

363
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,694
March?

364
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,133
They're children, damn it.

365
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,131
They're human beings.

366
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:20,071
Didn't I tell you to check on them
10 minutes ago?

367
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,470
I want another five large.

368
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,980
- But we had a deal already.
- I gotta stand up for what is right, here.

369
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,949
Be fair, sir.
We don't have that kind of cash on hand.

370
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,282
That's your problem. I can wait.

371
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:37,325
- I thought you was worried about the heat.
- If heat arrives in the meantime...

372
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,052
...I can get rid of the
evidence very quickly.

373
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,927
We have an obligation to deliver.
The Dollmaker doesn't tolerate failure.

374
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,933
- We need those children.
- Well, that's also your problem.

375
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,170
Ha-ha. Ah!

376
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,411
No. Hey, hey-- This
is totally inappropriate.

377
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,810
I mean, we were having
a business discussion here.

378
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,575
You weren't being fair.

379
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,321
Oh, gosh. Cops.

380
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,695
You didn't call the Gazette,
but did your girl call?

381
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,523
- Yeah.
- I knew it.

382
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,702
- I didn't know she was gonna call them.
- Seriously, you gotta control your woman.

383
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,495
I kind of like her the way she is.

384
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,937
These high-class temperamental broads
need firm handling, trust me.

385
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,269
- Trust you? On women?
- Damn right.

386
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,039
All varieties. From house fraus
to movie stars. I love them all.

387
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,217
Now, you, let me guess,
high school sweetheart...

388
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,182
...then a bunch of hos overseas
only made you sad.

389
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,821
And then there's Barbara.

390
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,824
- Pretty much.
- You, my friend, are a monkey...

391
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,460
...riding a race horse.

392
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,036
Good evening. May I help you?

393
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,174
Detectives Gordon and Bullock.
We need to speak to whoever's in charge.

394
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:01,538
Of course. Mr. Quillan,
detectives are here to see you.

395
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,745
Oh?

396
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,385
Wow. Detectives, hey. What's up?
Nothing serious, I hope.

397
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:13,489
Cut the crap. We have a warrant to search
the premises. We know what you're doing.

398
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,149
Then you know some boring stuff, then.
I mean, what are you talking about?

399
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:21,729
- You're peddling ATP to kid-snatchers.
- Oh, my gosh. No.

400
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,165
I mean, we used to stock ATP,
but not since the Arkham Asylum closed.

401
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:33,844
Uh, I heard that the Wayne Foundation is
planning on reopening the old place again.

402
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,378
But now that the Waynes are dead,
I guess everything's up in the air.

403
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,043
What a world, eh? Nobody's safe.

404
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,723
- Jim!
- Go, go!

405
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,610
Where the hell were you?

406
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:15,549
Get rid of them now.
Then hose down the room.

407
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,599
Ah! Zack.

408
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,457
Freeze.

409
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,998
Ash! No!

410
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,681
On behalf of all the citizens of Gotham,
I wanna thank you gentlemen.

411
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,250
From the bottom of my heart.

412
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,319
And I wanna promise you, kids...

413
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:56,254
...we will take care of you
as if you were our own children.

414
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,984
But here's the thing.

415
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,858
The people who victimized these kids
are still out there.

416
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:06,467
And hundreds of vulnerable youngsters
are still living rough on our streets.

417
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,194
<i>Alone.</i>

418
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,134
<i>Unprotected.</i>

419
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,969
<i>And let's face it, that's
the real crime here.</i>

420
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,611
So, what are we going to do
to help these kids?

421
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:21,144
<i>Yesterday, I made a phone call
to juvenile services and the G.C.P.D...</i>

422
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,847
<i>...to initiate a humane but tough love
program to get these kids off the streets...</i>

423
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,288
...and into the loving arms
of juvenile services.

424
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,732
- I think that went very well.
- I think so.

425
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,368
- A small toast, Your Honor?
- You read my mind.

426
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:45,732
Mr. Mayor, where are you sending
all the children that get rounded up?

427
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,570
Foster homes for the cute,
undamaged ones.

428
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,006
Upstate for the rest.

429
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,306
Upstate?

430
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,483
The Alpenia Youth Corrections Facility.

431
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,844
A fine institute.

432
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,548
Prison, in other words.

433
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,551
Forgive me, Your Honor.

434
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:02,317
- Detective Gordon's our house firebrand.
- No, no, no, that's okay.

435
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,324
Jim. May I call you Jim?

436
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,696
Half the petty crime in this city
is homeless kids.

437
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,526
They need structure.

438
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:15,865
People who care for them, for the greater
good of Gotham and for the children, see?

439
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:22,103
I see you're using the child-snatchers as a
pretext to lock up children without a trial.

440
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,212
Thank you, my friend.

441
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,015
Valuable input.

442
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,914
Most refreshing.

443
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,089
Yo, Gordon,
a man's been waiting for you upstairs.

444
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,061
Mr. Pennyworth?

445
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,064
Alfred, please.

446
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,302
It's bedlam, isn't it?

447
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,240
Rough job you got.

448
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,478
Best job in the world.

449
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:02,218
I wonder if it might be convenient for you
to visit us tomorrow.

450
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,442
Of course.

451
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:06,213
- Why? ls something wrong?
- I don't know.

452
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,956
Never had a child before.

453
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,285
Nor me.

454
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,257
The boy respects you.

455
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,154
Tea time, shall we say?

456
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,097
Tea time.

457
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,190
- Name?
- Ma'am, there's been a mistake.

458
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,966
I'm not meant to go upstate.
I need James Gordon. He's a cop.

459
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,365
You're allowed a phone call
when you get upstate. Name.

460
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,369
I need to talk to him now.

461
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:00,099
- He'll thank you for it.
- Not happening. Name.

462
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,642
Bite me, Pig-erina.

463
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,836
Jane Doe.

464
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,897
Hey.

465
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,230
Relax, kid. Juvie's not so bad.

466
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:35,244
First week, whatever you do, don't
make friends with anyone that's friendly.

467
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:38,004
When you get into a
fight, go for their eyes.

468
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,415
Hiya, kids. How you doing?

469
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,887
Are you ready to go on a big adventure?

470
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,819
Sit down, young lady.

471
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,721
I said sit down.

472
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,820
Like, now.

473
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:00,995
Okay.

474
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,072
Next naughty child to stand up...

475
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,042
...gets a black mark.

476
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,266
Right here.

477
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:19,620
One or two or three...

478
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,085
...I can explain that.

479
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,383
But a busload?

480
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,527
A whole busload of the little bastards.

481
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,923
What am I supposed to say? Oops?

482
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,692
Just tell me it wasn't them, I'm begging
you. Just tell me it wasn't the snatchers.

483
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,962
Bus driver was a man. Guard was a woman.
It could be them.

484
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,806
You're killing me. You're killing me.

485
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,872
We're working it, Your Honor.

486
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,472
I told you everything I know. I told you.

487
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,773
You see that man there?

488
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:50,113
He doesn't like it when I beat people.
But for you, no objection. Why is that?

489
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,448
Math. The lives of 30 children
versus one scumbag.

490
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,819
So I can beat you like a bongo drum,
and St. Jim here won't intervene.

491
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,118
Give us something.

492
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,386
Okay, okay! No!

493
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,759
The truck. When they came to pick up
the last bunch of kids.

494
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,993
On the side of it,
there was a picture, like a logo.

495
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,728
I didn't wanna say before
because it'll give a bad impression.

496
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,137
- It doesn't reflect really--
- What was it?

497
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,937
There's a blue plate and a silver fork.

498
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,604
- A plate and a fork?
- Yeah. You know, like...

499
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,285
- Like a catering company, like food'?
- Like that, I mean--

500
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:24,818
You know, but--
I mean, that doesn't mean...

501
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,353
It doesn't mean what?

502
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,785
Look, I don't know
what they do to them. Ah!

503
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,823
Hey. Hey.

504
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,086
All right.

505
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,594
Draw the logo. Uncuff him.

506
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,670
There you go, kids.

507
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,933
Don't worry, everything's
gonna be all right.

508
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,371
That's right. Come on.

509
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,340
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Come on.

510
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,672
Go.

511
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:59,617
Funny thing. By my count, according
to the sheet they gave us, we're one short.

512
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,846
Me too.

513
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,048
Maybe there's one on the bus. Hm.

514
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,122
Shh.

515
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,277
Nope. Weird.

516
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,609
Must be a miscount someplace.
Never mind. We got more than enough.

517
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,184
- We did good.
- Indeed we did.

518
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,255
The Dollmaker will be so pleased with us.

519
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,721
All right, thanks. Nothing. You?

520
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:14,563
Apparently no companies in Gotham
have a plate and a fork as their logo.

521
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,929
Selling children for food.

522
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:18,624
Is such a thing even possible?

523
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,561
We've got officers searching all the trucks
on every bridge and tunnel.

524
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,935
But they had a three-hour window.

525
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:30,971
We can only pray they stayed in the city.
If not, they can be any place by night fall.

526
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,910
Scum-sucking toads. Where are they?

527
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:40,422
It's not a blue plate. It's
not a fork either. It's a trident.

528
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,421
When you stow this on the ship, make sure
there's room for the doors to open.

529
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,791
- The ship's crew has--
- Let me out!

530
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,989
- Let me out!
- Ls anybody there?

531
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,997
Quiet in there!

532
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,008
Hush. Hush.

533
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,446
My eyes! She scratched me. Oh!

534
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,513
Come on, follow me.

535
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,509
Hm. Let me look.

536
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,319
Mm. Uh...

537
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,082
It's nothing. It's a scratch.
We'll get you the doctor.

538
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,285
- You'll be right as rain in no time.
- You sure?

539
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,527
- What was that?
- Hang on.

540
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,246
Well...

541
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,845
You are a very naughty little girl.

542
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,884
Hi.

543
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,586
- What's your name?
- Why is that your business?

544
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,197
Jim.

545
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,163
Where are the kids?

546
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,166
Where are they?

547
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,581
He's not been sleeping.

548
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,910
And when he does,
he has these nightmares.

549
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,553
Now he's hurting himself.

550
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:52,949
Burning himself.

551
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,748
He's cutting.

552
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,534
- Is he getting professional help?
- Oh, you mean psychiatrists?

553
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,854
Oh, no, none, he won't have them.

554
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,299
No psychiatrists, that's a rule.

555
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,230
You make the rules, don't you?
You're his guardian.

556
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,631
Now, Bruce's father...

557
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,309
...gave me very firm orders
was him and his missus to die.

558
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:17,076
Now I will raise the boy
the way his father told me to raise him.

559
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,980
Which is how?

560
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:24,318
Trust him to choose his own course.

561
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,987
He is, after all, a Wayne.

562
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,116
Sounds like a recipe for disaster.

563
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,922
- What do you want me to do?
- He wants you to talk some sense into me.

564
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:41,098
Haven't I told you to stop creeping up
on people like that. It's bloody rude.

565
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,464
All right then, Bruce.

566
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,768
Talk to me.

567
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,843
I'm perfectly fine.

568
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,274
Alfred's a worrywart.

569
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,178
What'd you do to your hand?

570
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,845
I burned it.

571
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,582
Listen to me, Bruce.

572
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,155
You've been through a terrible experience.

573
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,619
Talking to someone can be very helpful.

574
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,626
You must have seen terrible things
in the war, does it--?

575
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,995
Does it help you to talk about
what you saw?

576
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,294
Yes, a little.

577
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,768
You're not a very good liar.

578
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,775
- Bruce, you're hurting yourself.
- I'm testing myself.

579
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,777
Different. But I appreciate your concern.

580
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,823
I've been following your adventures
in the newspapers.

581
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,352
I feel very sorry for
all those poor children.

582
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,217
Me too.

583
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:44,056
- I'll give you some money to give to them.
- I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, Bruce.

584
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,533
What way does it work?

585
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,500
Those children need someone
who cares for them.

586
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,970
Like you have right here.

587
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,503
Money won't buy that.

588
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,046
There must be something I can do.

589
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:01,217
What about clothes?

590
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:02,976
They all looked awfully ragged.

591
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,647
They did, didn't they?

592
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,655
After all this? You're sending us upstate?

593
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,197
- Selina--
- Cat.

594
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,837
Cat, even if you didn't have
outstanding warrants...

595
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,666
...you're 13. No parents or guardians.

596
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,605
- That's not true. I have a mom.
- Says here she's deceased.

597
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:31,507
That's not true. She's alive. Someplace.

598
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,241
Be that as it may, we're not allowed
to put you back on the street.

599
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,080
- It's for your own well-being.
- Heh.

600
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,512
Have you been there? Upstate?

601
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,248
- Yes.
- Then you know.

602
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,088
You know.

603
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,587
Go get Detective James Gordon.

604
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,128
He works here.

605
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:51,930
Cat.

606
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,637
- Police are very busy people--
- Go get him.

607
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,805
Or...

608
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,036
...I'll say you touched me.

609
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,238
Excuse me?

610
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,140
James Gordon.

611
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,576
I'm gonna scream in about three seconds.

612
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,005
Hello? Ah.

613
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:39,113
Yes, this is he.

614
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:43,585
Well, I'm looking at your son
right now, and...

615
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,618
...he doesn't look good.

616
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,991
Madam, I assure you,
your son is not trying to trick you.

617
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,019
No, he will die a
horrible death unless he--

618
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:55,763
No, no. No.

619
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,525
Really, truly, he isn’t joking.

620
00:40:58,756 --> 00:40:59,962
I'm not joking.

621
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:03,105
I will poke his eyeballs out. And--

622
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,874
How can you say that? You saw
the video I sent. I'm not lying. Heh.

623
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,639
Madam-- Madam. Calm yourself.

624
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,146
If 10,000 is too much, I'm sure we can--

625
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,876
Hello? Hello?

626
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:24,726
Well, that's disappointing.

627
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,554
She didn't believe me.

628
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:34,294
You must be quite the scamp.

629
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,499
I got it.

630
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,735
Hello again, young lady.

631
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,577
- How can I help you?
- We need to talk.

632
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,039
So now you wanna talk, huh?

633
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,651
Okay. It's all right.

634
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,352
- Selina, is it?
- Cat.

635
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:59,821
Cat. You're Macky's friend?

636
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,259
Yeah, I know Macky.

637
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:06,268
Those bastards nearly got you twice, huh?

638
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,936
You're quite a survivor.

639
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,235
You have no idea.

640
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:19,946
Suppose I had something
you really, really wanted.

641
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,049
If I gave it to you,
could you get me out of here?

642
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:27,086
- What do you got?
- I've been watching you.

643
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:31,591
You're a friend of the boy.
You're not like the rest of these crooks.

644
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,729
The boy?

645
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:41,769
Bruce?

646
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,468
What do you mean
you've been watching me?

647
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,242
The Mario Pepper guy was a patsy, huh?

648
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,876
- What makes you say that?
- Could you? Could you get me out?

649
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,879
It's possible.

650
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,922
I saw who really killed the Waynes.

651
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,455
Saw him clear as day.
