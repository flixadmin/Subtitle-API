With his last words,
he told me his killer was a time traveler.

17
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,289
Damien Darhk murdered my sister.

- You save her.

Every sweet-smelling speck of it.

22
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,438
As for my compensation?

23
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,067
A strange form of payment.

This "thing" is called a faeces.

No?

31
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,007
A form of rule, which in my opinion,
is getting a bit of a bad rap lately.

You should have learned
that lesson by now.

What's it been,

40
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,374
45 years since you hired me
to nuke New York?

41
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,036
Forty-five years for you, maybe.
But for me...

42
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,581
- Huh.
- Good seeing you again, old friend.

43
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,249
"Old"? That's fair.

44
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,671

48
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,883
A partner.

49
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,144
Pass. I prefer to work alone.

50
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,057
Ah, yeah. Gathering your hive
of followers? Building your empire?

51
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,725
Designing your ark?

52
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:26,022
Yeah, I know what you're planning,
and how it works out.

53
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,861
You want to reshape the world?

54
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,368
Try reshaping history,
try rewriting destiny...

Try putting our partnership
into concrete terms, as in...

What's in it for me?

57
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,579
Well, perhaps you're content
collecting symbols of power,

58
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,544
but I can give you actual power.

59
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,138
We have the tools to make a difference.
We can make history better.

60
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,770
Even if we act
with the best of intentions,

61
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,352
these changes can ripple throughout time.

62
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,735
A temporal domino effect
with disastrous consequences.

63
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,362
So, we start small,
make changes we can control.

64
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,148
What you're talking about can't be done.

65

It's like playing God,

66
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,401
and it goes against everything
we're trying to do.

67
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,784
I thought we were trying to help people.

not creating them.

A little side project I've been working on
with Ray and the Professor.

110
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,610
Hmm.

111
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,748
They said that Temporal Aberrations
cause these things called timequakes.

112
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,079
So I started thinking,

113
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,745
if there was a way
of locating their epicenters,

114
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,336
maybe we'll be able to fix the Aberrations
before they happen.

115
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,841
Like a time seismograph.

Your grandfather was a great man.

That's it? He's a great man?

126
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,454
Is it because
your missions were classified?

127
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,456
Or is it because you really
didn't know him well as a person?

128
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,414
It's because the JSA didn't encourage
its members to fraternize.

It's something
you and your team should consider.

So what?

138

December 7th was the day before

139
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,488
Reagan and Gorbachev
signed the INF Treaty,

140
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,489
reducing both countries' nuclear arsenals

141
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,116
and paving the way
for the end of the Cold War.

How do you know all that?

143

Because I was in the capital
for that very summit.

144
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,282
The Reagan Administration would call upon
the top nuclear physicists

145
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,825
to act as technical advisors.

146

You think someone might have
traveled back in time

to stop the treaty from being signed?

148

The JSA has a training academy in D.C.

152

00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,987
And how exactly do we do that?

162
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,947
Welcome to the White House.

163
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,703
This is Cross Hall,

164
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,991
a magnificent space that connects
the State Dining Room with the East Room.

165
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,330
All right. Fan out, but stay on the comms

166
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,370
<i>and report if anything seems out of place.</i>

167
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,175
Women actually wore these things
in the '80s?

168
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,551
Shoulder pads? Yeah.

169
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,714
They were supposed to make women
more imposing, more... I don't know.

170
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,052
- Manly?
- Yeah.

171
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,059
I'd hoped that by this decade,
women wouldn't need to use clothing

172
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,640
to compensate for their status.

173
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,685
Surely by now,
men and women are considered equals?

174
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,565
Never lose that optimism.

175
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,226
This is it.

176
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,983
This is the JSA Academy?

177
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,819
Inside a crummy warehouse?

178
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,236
The JSA Academy is hidden
inside a crummy warehouse.

179
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,829
Prepare to see the most elite
training facility in all of history.

180
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,335
Maybe "elite" means something different
in 1987?

181
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,895
When I was recruited,
this is where I was brought to train.

182
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,734
What happened to the JSA?

183
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,688
No clue.

184
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,611
But a lot can change in 45 years.

185
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,073
I thought you said you were a historian.
How can you not know?

186
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:52,742
Hey, every memo, every executive action
relating to the JSA is top secret.

187
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,452
I only pieced together
their World War II activities

188
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,340
from my father's bedtime stories,
witness testimonies and government leaks.

189
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,772
I never should have left 1942.

190

Look, Amaya, whatever happened to them,
that's not your fault.

191

You don't know that.

192

what happened to them.

Whitney Houston

you forgot about.

197
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,594
Mr. Stein, pleasure to meet you.

198
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,850
Uh-oh.

stuck in meetings on the Hill all clay.

203
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,202
I was. I never stepped foot
inside the White House.

204
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,951
The Aberration must have caused
infinitesimal ripples

205
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,082
that affected
the movements of my younger self.

206
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,576
The temporal domino effect.

207
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,788
This is why
we should never interfere with history.

208
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,755
We'll agree to disagree.

209
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,754
But one thing's for sure,
we cannot let him see you.

210
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:29,049
Indeed. The last time he and I interacted,
nearly erased our marriage from existence.

descended over Central and Eastern Europe.

This is about time travel, isn't it?

473
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,659
That's why Special Advisor Darhk
stabbed me.

474
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,165
He wouldn't have stabbed you

475
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,997
<i>if you had been having dinner
with Clarissa</i>

476
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,002
- at L'Auberge as previously planned.
<i>- Good God!</i>

477
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,206
Clarissa. She's waiting
for me at the hotel.

478
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,249
How could you've left her alone
on her birthday?

479
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,838
She ordered room service.

480
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,175
- You are a careless, self-centered idiot.
- JAX: Grey. Grey.

481
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,341
Look, I'll go to the hotel,

482
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,259
and I'll tell Clarissa
that her husband's working late.

483
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,554
Okay? Just relax.

(PANTING)

485
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,935
Martin, what on Earth were you thinking?

486
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,026
Hubba hubba. Who's that?

487
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,443
Professor Stein's wife.
Jax is at her hotel explaining

488
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,611
why she has to spend her birthday alone.

489
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,666
Wait a minute. If you use everyone's
favorite talking computer to find her...

490
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,125
Gideon, do you have the location
on Damien Darhk?

491
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,291
GIDEON: <i>Unfortunately, I have no intel
on his current whereabouts.</i>

492
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,800
But we know where he's gonna be.

493
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,336
His little side deal with the Soviets

494
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,095
is going down at the State Dinner
tomorrow night.

495
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,052
GIDEON: <i>Which is probably the most
heavily guarded dinner in history.</i>

496
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,593
I think we know someone
who may be able to help.

497
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,978
- GIDEON: <i>Is that so?</i>
- One of Amaya's old JSA buddies.

498
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,763
And by "old" I mean old.

499
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,475
He may still have some government contacts
we can exploit.

500
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,733
TODD: <i>Absolutely not.</i>

501
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,817
Whatever Darhk is planning to exchange
with the Soviets, it can't be good.

502
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,984
All right, I'll contact the FBI.
You don't have to worry about it.

503
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,321
Except we do.

504
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,784
Darhk's working with a time traveler.
That's way out of the Bureau's league.

505
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,914
I believe this time traveler killed Rex.

506
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,371
All the more reason
to stay clear of that State Dinner.

507
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,161
You can't remain professional.

508
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,170
Are you kidding me?
She's nothing but professional.

509
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,581
She's all about being professional.

510
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,750
The only reason
I could ever see her not being...

511
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,918
Oh, my God!
You and Rex Tyler were together!

512
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,587
- No.
- They were together, weren't they?

513
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,632
- This makes total sense.
- We weren't together.

514
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,597
Like I said before, fraternization
among teammates is unprofessional.

515
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:17,692
Rex and I were going to leave the JSA
after the war.

516
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,861
Try and start a new life with each other.

517
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,113
And then he was cut down.

518
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,194
That's why I left the team.

519
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,193
And that's why I wouldn't talk to you
about them.

520
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,736
It's too hard.

521
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,656
And this is why I'm reluctant to help you.

522
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,830
Because your emotions
are clouding your judgment.

523

I know you feel like I abandoned you,
but please don't abandon me.

Hey, how're you doing?

527
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,100
I'm all right.

528
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,732
The truth is this young man
is like a stranger to me.

529
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:03,188
Every time I encounter him,
I can't imagine I was ever that person.

530
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,653
I think anyone would feel that way
about meeting their younger self.

531
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,867
I don't recognize my current self.

532
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,448
Mick told me I need to be more like me.

533
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,996
And he's right, which is rare.

534
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,281
Mmm. Indeed.

535
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,994
Problem is I don't know
what being me means right now.

536
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,583
- I don't know if that makes any sense.
- Of course it does.

at least on occasion,

with who they are and
what their place is in the world.

539
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,176
So, what's the answer?

540
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,266
(CHUCKLES) I have no idea.

541
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,391
But I suppose it's just to live.

542
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,939
It's all any of us can really do.

543
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:45,780
And then hopefully, through the act of
living, we discover who we truly are

544
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,942
and learn to grow from that.

545
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,620
Amaya got us invites to the State Dinner.

546
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,163
- Are you feeling up to it?
- Yes. I'm feeling much better.

547
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,502
Are you feeling up to it?

548
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,880
I think what he means is,
are you gonna create a diplomatic crisis

549
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,837
and risk unknown damage to history
by killing Damien Darhk?

550
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,626
I know what he means, Ray.

551
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:13,762
Earlier, you accused me
of not ever caring for anyone,

552
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,018
but you know that's not true.

553
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,726
I care very much about you.

than I am about your conscience.
