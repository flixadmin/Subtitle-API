Oh my God. Grandma!

1068
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:46,333
No, no, no. Stop, stop.
Can't do that or we'll all die.

1069

-What? Why?
-I don't know. I… I'm telling you.

-You… You'll die. Just shut up. Calm down.
-Oh, okay.

1071
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:56,125
Fix your phone later.
I'm a talking turtle. I picked you 'cause…

1072
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:58,041
"I like your style."

1073
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:01,833
-Take it down a notch.
-I got this. Now, tell me your problems.

1074
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:04,666
-What?
-I… I can fix your problems. I… I… I…

1075
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,750
I seen a lot of things
in that 5th grade room,

1076
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,458
and I can help. So come on.

00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:11,291
I don't have any problems.
Other than I broke my phone.

1078
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:13,583
Ah-ha. Bully. I get it.

1079
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:16,333
Come on. You're insecure, right?
Every class bully is.

1080
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:19,083
No. I don't know.

1081
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:22,750
You're sad, you got something
tearing you up inside.

1082
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:26,416
Just say it. I'm a talking turtle.
I can't tell anyone else.

1083
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:30,708
Of course I'm a bully.
I don't know what else to do.

1084
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:36,041
-I'm just different. I'm not smart.
-Nah. Everyone's smart in some way.

1085
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:39,625
You're just afraid of trying
and looking not smart. That's textbook.

1086
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:42,083
-What's a textbook?
-You know what? Never mind.

1087
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:46,750
-I'm different in other ways too.
-There you go. Come on. Out with it.

1088
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,750
-You won't say anything?
-No. What is it? What's the sadness?

1090

I don't know how babies are made.

1091
00:54:57,416 --> 00:54:59,416
Perfect. That's very class bully.

1092
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,750

-Oh. About babies? Sure. Here we go.

1095
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:12,375
[clears throat] First, the daddy climbs
on the mommy's back while she's swimming.

1096
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,541
He reaches under the mommy
to find her cloaca.

1097
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,250
This goes on for about 24 hours.

1098
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:21,708
Then the mommy comes ashore, makes a nest,
and deposits eggs in the sand.

1099
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:25,625
My mom made eggs in the sand?

1100
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:28,041
Yes. So the fish don't eat 'em.

[ball tapping]

1102
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:35,041
I crushed it.
Totally fixed the kid's problem.

maybe it's 'cause he wants to keep me.

So from here on, you'll be taking home…
[sighs] What's the turtle's name again?

1117
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,541
Squirtle. My name is Squirtle.

1118
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,458
I think it's Squirtle.

1119
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:32,750
Squirtle sucks.

1120

I beg your pardon? Why?

1121
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,708
I don't know. He just sucks.

What is so special about this reptile?

1125
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:54,708
I like his skin.

1126
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:57,916
His skin is like my grandma's elbows.

1127

Uh, same.

to take home that lizard again,
