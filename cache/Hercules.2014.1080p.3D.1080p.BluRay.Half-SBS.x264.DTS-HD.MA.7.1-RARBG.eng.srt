1
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,891
<i>You think you know the truth
about him?</i>

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,385
<i>You know nothing.</i>

3
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,060
<i>His father was Zeus. The Zeus.</i>

4
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,145
<i>King of the gods.</i>

5
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,490
<i>His mother, Alcmene, a mortal woman.</i>

6
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,198
<i>Together, they had a boy.</i>

7
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,161
<i>Half human,</i>

8
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,664
<i>half god.</i>

9
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:24,589
<i>But Zeus' queen, Hera,
saw this bastard child as an insult,</i>

10
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,888
<i>a living reminder of
her husband's infidelity.</i>

11
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,383
<i>Alcmene named the boy Hercules,</i>

12
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,639
<i>which means "glory of Hera,"</i>

13
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,729
<i>but this failed to appease the goddess.</i>

14
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,733
<i>She wanted him dead.</i>

15
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,672
<i>Luckily, he took after his father.</i>

16
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,463
<i>Once he reached manhood,</i>

17
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,546
<i>the gods commanded him
to perform Twelve Labors,</i>

18
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,261
<i>twelve dangerous missions.</i>

19
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,926
<i>If he completed them all and survived,</i>

20
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,891
<i>Hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace.</i>

21
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,159
<i>He fought the Lernean Hydra!</i>

22
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,266
<i>He battled the Erymanthean Boar!</i>

23
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,032
<i>But his greatest Labor
was the Nemean Lion.</i>

24
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,536
<i>This was no ordinary beast.</i>

25
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:25,005
<i>It had a hide so tough,
no weapon could penetrate it.</i>

26
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,684
<i>But even this monster was no match
for the son of Zeus.</i>

27
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,977
What a load of crap!

28
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,646
Every word is true.

29
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,609
You know what I think?

30
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,528
This friend of yours doesn't even exist.

31
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,035
Laugh all you want.

32
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,997
He's coming. And be warned, Gryza,
he despises pirates.

33
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,833
Macedonia has been good to us.

34
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,795
Plenty of villages ripe for pillaging.

35
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,209
We are here to stay.

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,547
Finish him.

37
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,349
The more you struggle,
the faster you drop.

38
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,387
Indeed, your fleet is strong. I...

39
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,945
Yet, as I was about to explain
before I was so rudely interrupted,

40
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,071
the Nemean Lion was strong, too.

41
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,816
Yet, he still destroyed it.

42
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,746
And not with a sword
or a spear or arrows. No!

43
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,831
I did it with my bare hands!

44
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,460
Or so they say.

45
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,214
Hercules.

46
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,924
Is this all the men you have?

47
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,966
There's 40 of us. One of you.

48
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,936
The king of this land
has offered me gold to dispose of you.

49
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,938
So leave, or die.

50
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,770
I get paid either way.

51
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,061
Make him bleed.

52
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,866
Five men with a single blow.

53
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,824
Still think you can destroy
the son of Zeus?

54
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,908
Bring me his head!

55
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,001
Seems they need
more convincing, Autolycus.

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,423
That's why we're here.

57
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,010
Atalanta.

58
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,506
Amphiaraus.

59
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,768
May Zeus forgive you.

60
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,474
Tydeus?

61
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,794
Die, Hercules!

62
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,793
Good man.

63
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,431
Hurry!

64
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,354
Hurry! Uncle!

65
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,561
Uncle, hurry!

66
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,321
Hurry! Hurry!

67
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,818
Any longer, Uncle...

68
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,864
And the girls would finally be safe
from your attentions.

69
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,497
The rest of you may go.

70
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,997
But not you.

71
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,764
Thirteen,

72
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,393
14,15,16,

73
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,310
- 17, 18, 19, 20.
- That was fun.

74
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,439
Twenty pirates
at two gold pieces a head,

75
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,569
minus the headless ones. Let's see.

76
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,733
Not a bad night.

77
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,530
You see how the pirates ran?
My story softened their resolve.

78
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,910
Their resolve must be broken, Iolaus.

79
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,746
When you spread
the legend of Hercules,

80
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,997
make it bigger, scarier.

81
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,081
The more they believe
Hercules is truly the son of Zeus,

82
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,756
the less likely they are to fight.

83
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,389
Amphiaraus?

84
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,383
Care to join us here on Earth?

85
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:56,561
A lion and a crow in strange alliance,
fighting across a sea of corpses.

86
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,403
If you're going to use those herbs,
Amphiaraus, at least share.

87
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,460
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

88
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,875
Fight it!

89
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,760
Keep practicing, boys!

90
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,422
So who's next? You? You?

91
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,435
That's a pretty sight.

92
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,891
One more payday, Autolycus,
that's all we need.

93
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,933
Then we get to live like
the kings we've sewed.

94
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,318
Or live simply.

95
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,447
You still dreaming of barbarian lands?

96
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,030
Beyond the Aegean.
At the shores of the Black Sea.

97
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,113
That is where I will live out
the rest of my days in solitude.

98
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,372
Boring, if you ask me.

99
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,166
Maybe so, Autolycus.

100
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,578
But I'll never find peace unless
I move as far away as possible.

101
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,214
What of Tydeus?

102
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,168
Without you to temper his rage,
I fear what he may become.

103
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,301
Tydeus will go with me.

104
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,130
Civilization has become
too civilized for us.

105
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,469
Uncle!

106
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,553
Join us.
The girls are eager to welcome you.

107
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,609
See? I told you I knew Hercules.

108
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,695
Are you his servant?

109
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,360
I'm his nephew.

110
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,490
Are you, really?

111
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,279
I tell of Hercules' Twelve Labors,

112
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,036
like the Nemean Lion,
the Apples of the Hesperides,

113
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,241
the Belt of Hippolyta

114
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,329
with its buxom naked Amazons
and exciting bondage.

115
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,006
- I immortalize him...
- He talks, while the rest of us fight.

116
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,507
It is a wonder
you share the same blood as Hercules.

117
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,508
Have fun.

118
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,551
Ladies.

119
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,494
What do you want with Hercules?

120
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,326
My words are for him, not you.

121
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,577
Atalanta, it's all right.

122
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,291
You certainly are a hard man to find.

123
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,380
Maybe I don't want anyone to find me.

124
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,261
I'm not just anyone.

125
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,047
My name is Ergenia,
daughter to Lord Cotys.

126
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,388
Your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir.

127
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,813
My father is most unfortunate.

128
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,061
He battles a warlord, Rhesus.

129
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,481
Our land is torn by civil war.

130
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,443
Every day, villages are destroyed,
crops ruined, innocents slaughtered.

131
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,406
We all have problems.

132
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:54,371
Well, perhaps I can convince you
to make our problems your own.

133
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,039
Unfortunately, My Lady,

134
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,288
Hercules is fully committed
till the Feast of Dionysus.

135
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,910
We could, however,

136
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,251
advance you to the front of the line,
for the right price.

137
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,258
I thought heroes fight for glory.

138
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,294
But mercenaries fight for gold.

139
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,133
Lord Cotys is a rich man.

140
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,513
I like him already.

141
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,267
If you agree to aid him,
he will pay your weight in gold.

142
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,727
Eat up.

143
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,651
"A lion and crow in strange alliance."

144
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,817
Told you.

145
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,248
Where are we going?

146
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,450
It is good to see you safe, My Lady.

147
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,528
This war claims more victims every day.
We were concerned, My Lady.

148
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,736
Thank you, General Sitacles.
I was well protected.

149
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,362
The mighty Hercules. An honor.

150
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,540
Though not quite as big an honor
as I expected.

151
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,373
General, go tell my father
Hercules is here.

152
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,630
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

153
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,420
It's meant to be.

154
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,965
It took five years and a thousand men
to build her temple.

155
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,385
Hera is the patron goddess of Thrace.

156
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,852
Everyone knows the legend,
how Hera seeks to destroy Hercules.

157
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,393
Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

158
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,856
Mother!

159
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,691
Arius.

160
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,280
- You're Hercules.
- That's right.

161
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,741
My name is Arius.
I know all your Labors by heart.

162
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,865
You killed the giant Geryon
with a single blow,

163
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,746
cleaned the Augean stables
in one night.

164
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,875
Hercules is probably tired.

165
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,703
And the Labor of the Hide,
and the Labor of the Mares.

166
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,413
That's enough, Arius. Come along.

167
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,297
Stay away from him.

168
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,092
Men who deal in violence
attract violence.

169
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,512
But he's Hercules. He's no mere mortal.
He's the greatest!

170
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,434
Lord Cotys will see you now.

171
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,652
Have you ever met royalty, Hercules?

172
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,655
Once or twice.

173
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,665
Father!

174
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,254
Megara.

175
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,926
Welcome home, my love.

176
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,934
Hercules!

177
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:00,776
Whenever I'm here, I imagine
this is what Elysium must look like.

178
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:05,830
Well, men like us have the means
to create our own paradise on Earth.

179
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,327
Look.

180
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,912
Magnificent, aren't they?

181
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,498
Well, do not keep us in suspense.
Are we safe from the monster Hydra?

182
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,339
The Hydra's heads, Your Majesty.

183
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,516
The masks of serpents.

184
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,603
No wonder men thought
they were monsters.

185
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,027
You've done your sovereign
a great service. Come.

186
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,026
Let the people have their hero.

187
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,738
All hail King Eurystheus.

188
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,158
And the mighty protector of Athens,

189
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,706
Hercules!

190
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,119
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

191
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,548
A man faced with such adoration
might be tempted to think himself a god.

192
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,045
I only want to be
a husband and a father.

193
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,266
Lord Cotys awaits.

194
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,708
Hercules.

195
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,586
Welcome.

196
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,590
An honor to host such a legend.

197
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,755
Lord Cotys.

198
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,429
But in legend, you fight alone.

199
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,763
My reputation would not exist
without my comrades.

200
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,303
Autolycus of Sparta.

201
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,437
Tydeus of Thebes.

202
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,190
Atalanta of Scythia.

203
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,277
Iolaus of Athens.

204
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,488
And Amphiaraus of Argos.

205
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,903
Amphiaraus?

206
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,114
The famed seer of Argos.

207
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,539
It is said you have glimpsed
your own death,

208
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,293
so you fight each battle knowing that
it is not yet your time to die.

209
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,962
What else can you tell of the future?

210
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,927
Only what the gods see fit to reveal.

211
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,003
A shame.

212
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,341
It would have been a great gift
to know the outcome of this war.

213
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,137
The gods can be frustrating sometimes,
Lord Cotys.

214
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,364
With respect, I fear that the task ahead
might not be suitable for a woman,

215
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,567
even if she is an Amazon warrior.

216
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,743
I stand corrected.

217
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,089
When the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel,

218
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,343
it was intended as
the high seat of all Thrace.

219
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,805
But now Thrace is divided.

220
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,761
This war has depleted our forces.

221
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,561
We're left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army.

222
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,767
It takes every one of us
to resist Rhesus.

223
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,274
People think that he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal.

224
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,398
Only by a god.

225
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,438
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

226
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,067
<i>His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.</i>

227
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,825
<i>He leads an army of monsters,
half horse, half human.</i>

228
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,040
Centaurs?

229
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,997
- You've actually seen them?
- They have been seen.

230
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,506
Come, Hercules.

231
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,214
Let me show you what misery
Rhesus has brought us.

232
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,972
Every week, more refugees arrive
seeking my protection,

233
00:18:55,134 --> 00:19:00,231
most of them covered in blood,
crippled or burnt by Rhesus' men.

234
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,485
I feared nothing could ever
be good again, till you arrived.

235
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,317
I'm just a mercenary fighting for gold.

236
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,368
How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

237
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,912
How others perceive us is important.

238
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,912
And your name, like it or not,

239
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,293
is a rallying cry.

240
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,128
I have seen too much reality
to trust in legends, and I am not alone.

241
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,548
Nobody has any faith anymore.

242
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,762
The people need a hero.
They need someone to look up to.

243
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,145
My son believes in you.

244
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,609
Bring us peace,

245
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,780
and I will believe in you, too.

246
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,036
I'm convinced these are good people.

247
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,170
I see. And who's more convincing,
Cotys or his daughter?

248
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,215
All the gold on Earth is not
as convincing as a pair of breasts.

249
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,542
Maybe, but gold never ages.

250
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,923
Which is why
I got them to double our price.

251
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,256
Double your weight in gold? Well done.

252
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,386
Amphiaraus?

253
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,887
If it be the will of Zeus.

254
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,345
Which title sounds more terrifying
to our enemies?

255
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,023
"Hercules: Savior of Thrace"
or "Hercules: A Legend is Born"?

256
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,647
Both sound terrifyingly boring.

257
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,820
What are we supposed to do
with an army of farmers?

258
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,029
Train them.

259
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,738
Oh, shit.

260
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,500
In war, there is one thing
more important than killing.

261
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,380
Surviving.

262
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,128
My companions and I will show you
how to stay alive,

263
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,178
so that you may return home
to your farms someday.

264
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,968
Autolycus.

265
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,684
Shield wall! Form!

266
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,242
Corpses! Every last one of you!

267
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,086
Because your shield wall was weak.

268
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,583
Dead.

269
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,377
Dead.

270
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,212
Very dead.

271
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,302
Soldier,

272
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,588
many lives depend on you.

273
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,758
When attacked,
lock your feet in the ground.

274
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,808
You understand?

275
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,229
Yes, sir.

276
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,766
When a shield wall is strong,

277
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,895
nothing can ever defeat it!

278
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,615
You must learn to work together,
react together.

279
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,945
When you do, each individual
will become a link in a chain

280
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,371
that will be stronger than iron.

281
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,002
I hope the enemy has a sense of humor.

282
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,376
Right. Today's lesson,
how not to stab yourselves!

283
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,465
It is imperative that we strike now,
My Lord, given this opportunity.

284
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,717
There you are!

285
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:27,263
Hercules, my scouts have brought news.
Rhesus is on the move.

286
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,223
Archers who shoot lightning
from their bows.

287
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,020
And infantry 4,000-strong,
their minds bewitched.

288
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,649
Demons march with them.

289
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,439
So now we're fighting demons.

290
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,484
No stranger than the monsters
I hear you faced, Hercules.

291
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,366
My Lord, Rhesus is preparing
to attack Bessi lands.

292
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,623
He will be on them within six days.

293
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,331
If the Bessi fall, we're next.
Unless we intercept him.

294
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,667
Your men need weeks, if not months,
of training before they're ready.

295
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,460
The Bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

296
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,636
If we do not protect them,
then there will be a bloodbath.

297
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,722
Face Rhesus with an untrained army

298
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,757
and you risk losing
far more than a single battle.

299
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,975
My Lord, Rhesus is coming.
I vouch my life on it.

300
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,141
The longer Rhesus lives,

301
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,979
the more villages will be burnt
and the more innocents will be killed.

302
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,699
Assemble your men.
We march tomorrow.

303
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,867
Hercules,
the gods have offered us a gift.

304
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,074
We must not squander it.

305
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,793
Are your gods going to
be fighting with us?

306
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,411
No.

307
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,247
The son of Zeus will.

308
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,670
Your mother told you to stay away.
You should listen.

309
00:24:22,301 --> 00:24:23,678
What's wrong with him?

310
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:29,601
Tydeus is my most loyal warrior.

311
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:32,565
He was born in war.

312
00:24:33,062 --> 00:24:36,908
When I found him,
he was more animal than human.

313
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:42,825
He never speaks of what he saw.

314
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:45,415
He never speaks at all.

315
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:49,086
But he relives it every night.

316
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:52,005
Come.

317
00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:53,586
Let's find your mother.

318
00:25:00,255 --> 00:25:03,509
When I grow up,
I want to be a great hero like you.

319
00:25:03,592 --> 00:25:06,471
- Like me?
- No hero is greater than Hercules.

320
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:07,725
I know all your Labors.

321
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:11,651
Like the Cretan Bull, you wrestled it
for seven days and seven nights.

322
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:12,851
That's a bit exaggerated.

323
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:16,735
- And struck it 49 times with your club.
- Maybe not quite that many.

324
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:20,489
Until it fell dead and Crete was saved.
It's my favorite Labor.

325
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:22,653
Also Queen Hippolyta's Belt,

326
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:26,036
with its buxom Amazons
and exciting bondage.

327
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:29,915
- Do you even know what that means?
- No.

328
00:25:39,545 --> 00:25:41,798
- Mother.
- Arius.

329
00:25:41,964 --> 00:25:44,137
You're supposed to be in bed.

330
00:25:46,468 --> 00:25:48,141
Why are you in the hospice?

331
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:50,180
My mother saves people's lives.

332
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:53,226
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

333
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:56,482
So, out of necessity,
I taught myself the art of healing.

334
00:25:58,188 --> 00:25:59,405
If I could be like you,

335
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:03,160
I would protect all of Thrace
and no one would ever get hurt.

336
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:13,662
Here.

337
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,833
I was going to give this
to someone else,

338
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:21,299
but I never got the chance.

339
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:25,011
Only a hero may wear this.

340
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:28,060
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

341
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:33,395
Is this the Nemean Lion's tooth?

342
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:35,776
- It is.
- Thank you.

343
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:37,895
Thank you.

344
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,021
Good night.

345
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,528
Good night, Hercules.

346
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:47,700
Have no fear.

347
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,502
If you fall in the service of a just cause,
your souls will go to Elysium,

348
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,790
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes,

349
00:26:57,873 --> 00:26:59,216
like Theseus.

350
00:26:59,374 --> 00:27:00,466
Odysseus!

351
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:02,628
And the great Achilles.

352
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:06,636
Or if you're lucky, you'll go to Hades,
where all the fun people are.

353
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:16,228
Iolaus.

354
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:18,564
Your place is beside Lord Cotys,
where it's safe.

355
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:21,731
I've been giving it a lot of thought,
and I really feel I'm ready to fight.

356
00:27:21,897 --> 00:27:23,337
You're a storyteller, not a warrior.

357
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:24,483
We share the same blood.

358
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,073
And I will not see it shed. Chariot.

359
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:28,487
Now.

360
00:27:36,662 --> 00:27:38,005
Thracians,

361
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:41,797
the shield wall is your home.
Your shelter.

362
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:45,171
When you sleep,
the wall is your blanket.

363
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:49,095
When you fight, the wall is your armor.

364
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:51,928
The shield wall will
never break formation

365
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,854
as long as there is breath in your body.

366
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:57,558
Remember these words,

367
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:00,568
and you will taste victory.

368
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:03,988
- Move the army out!
- Move out!

369
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,091
Halt!

370
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:14,843
Halt!

371
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:17,221
- Halt!
- Halt!

372
00:29:48,543 --> 00:29:50,545
We are too late.

373
00:29:50,712 --> 00:29:53,386
Rhesus has already been here.

374
00:29:57,135 --> 00:30:00,139
Leave the chariots.
We'll go down on foot.

375
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:28,816
The lion and crow
cross a field of corpses.

376
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:32,858
I hate being right all the time.

377
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:39,489
Halt.

378
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:41,119
- Halt!
- Halt!

379
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:51,765
This head is rotting.

380
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:55,440
A week old, at least.

381
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:01,195
Yet some of these bodies are fresh.

382
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:17,419
Uncle!

383
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:29,633
And we've walked into a trap.

384
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:40,431
Shield wall! Form a single square!
Protect Lord Cotys! Iolaus, go!

385
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,183
Shield wall!

386
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:54,365
We're here to help them.
Why are they attacking?

387
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,987
This is Rhesus' doing.

388
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:58,570
They say his spells have
the power to cloud minds.

389
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:01,364
Turn comrades against each other.

390
00:32:09,414 --> 00:32:11,416
King's guards, around Lord Cotys!

391
00:32:20,716 --> 00:32:22,889
Amphiaraus, do we die in this battle?

392
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:27,141
My time's not come yet.
Not sure about yours.

393
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,734
That's comforting.

394
00:32:38,568 --> 00:32:40,366
I think he wants a challenge.

395
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:04,060
Hercules' fists have been dipped
in the blood of the Hydra!

396
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:06,471
Lethal to anyone but him!

397
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:10,354
Watch!

398
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:23,779
Did you see that?

399
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:25,289
The gods fight on our side!

400
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:33,878
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

401
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,667
Hercules! Hercules!

402
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:38,586
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

403
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,314
Battle position!

404
00:34:03,444 --> 00:34:06,744
Lady Artemis, if I am to fall,
let me be judged...

405
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:42,067
Stand fast!

406
00:34:57,456 --> 00:34:59,299
Hold your position!

407
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:13,918
Do not yield!

408
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:09,931
No retreat! Stay in the wall!

409
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:12,767
Hold the lines!

410
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:14,519
Do not yield!

411
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:17,192
Defend Lord Cotys!

412
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:42,946
The wall has been breached!

413
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:50,329
Seal up the shield wall!
Defend Lord Cotys!

414
00:36:56,626 --> 00:36:57,798
Whip!

415
00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:08,230
Hercules!

416
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:10,190
Bring the chariots!

417
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:19,825
Defend your Lord!

418
00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:30,834
No!

419
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,911
Advance!

420
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:47,988
Advance!

421
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,428
Make way!

422
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,196
Where is Rhesus?

423
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,598
Lord Cotys.

424
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,602
We came here to save this village,

425
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,521
but, no, they killed half my army.

426
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,853
Rhesus.

427
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,147
This is all his doing.

428
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,482
And yours.

429
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,153
I warned you.

430
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,987
Your men are brave,
but untrained, unprepared for battle.

431
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,527
Give me time to make warriors.

432
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,743
Very well.

433
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:16,256
Cover up, before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal.

434
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:48,958
I'm applying a salve of mint,
chamomile and clay to seal the wound.

435
00:40:49,036 --> 00:40:52,916
This is extract of lithops for the pain,
a powerful sedative.

436
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:56,594
It should rest you after consuming it.
It may have certain side effects.

437
00:40:56,669 --> 00:40:57,716
I don't need it.

438
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:02,054
Forgive me, I forgot.
No mortal can harm Hercules.

439
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:06,354
And your lion's hide is indestructible?

440
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:10,107
Drink, son of Zeus.

441
00:41:13,602 --> 00:41:16,697
Arius' father was the same,
he distrusted medicines.

442
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:18,024
Where is he now?

443
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:22,325
Taken by the gods
before my son was born.

444
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:23,450
I'm sorry.

445
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:25,699
I never knew my father.

446
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:30,245
Well, he must have been
very, very strong.

447
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,883
Tell me about Arius.

448
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:38,548
He's a good boy.

449
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:41,555
And someday, he will make a fine king.

450
00:41:42,214 --> 00:41:43,215
Do you have any children?

451
00:41:47,553 --> 00:41:48,645
Do they live in Athens?

452
00:41:49,263 --> 00:41:51,231
Thank you for your care.

453
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:03,014
The sedative will help you rest.

454
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:34,380
It happened again, didn't it?

455
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:39,670
Another vision of Cerberus,
the three-headed beast of Hades?

456
00:44:39,836 --> 00:44:42,965
The gods show you things
they don't share with others.

457
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:46,510
There's a word for that. Madness.

458
00:44:47,177 --> 00:44:49,020
When we were driven from Athens,

459
00:44:49,095 --> 00:44:51,598
I consulted the Oracle of Delphi
on your behalf.

460
00:44:51,681 --> 00:44:53,479
Do you remember her prophecy?

461
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,650
"Hercules must finish the Labor
that remains unfinished."

462
00:44:57,812 --> 00:45:00,361
And what is that, Hercules?

463
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:04,027
Confront the beast that haunts you.
Only then will you find peace.

464
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:06,196
I speak from experience.

465
00:45:06,362 --> 00:45:09,957
No matter how far you run, no matter
how fast you go, the beast will follow.

466
00:45:10,116 --> 00:45:12,915
Man cannot escape his fate.

467
00:45:28,802 --> 00:45:31,305
Room for one more in your company?

468
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,942
It'd be a pleasure having
female companionship for a change.

469
00:45:36,017 --> 00:45:38,691
Atalanta doesn't quite count.
No offense.

470
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,273
If only your manhood
was as long as your tongue.

471
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,858
Both can satisfy in different ways.

472
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:51,120
You're a famed storyteller, Iolaus.
Grace me with a story.

473
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,203
Any particular subject, My Lady?

474
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,248
Murder, of a woman
and her three children.

475
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:04,088
Is it true?
Did Hercules slaughter his own family?

476
00:46:04,254 --> 00:46:06,723
- Who said so?
- Soldiers talk.

477
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:09,976
They say if Hercules
ever returns to Athens,

478
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:12,019
King Eurystheus will have him executed.

479
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:20,354
Hercules had completed his Labors
and returned home. But Hera...

480
00:46:20,436 --> 00:46:23,155
No myths. I want the truth.

481
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,987
No one knows the truth.

482
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,447
Not for sure.

483
00:46:28,027 --> 00:46:32,874
We found Hercules alone.
His wife, Megara and the children, dead.

484
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:34,292
He remembers nothing.

485
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:36,745
Do you believe he is innocent?

486
00:46:37,745 --> 00:46:43,002
We grew up together, both orphans,
trying to survive in the streets of Athens.

487
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:46,588
We found a home in the army.
Looked out for each other.

488
00:46:47,422 --> 00:46:51,643
Hercules' strength set him apart.

489
00:46:52,135 --> 00:46:55,435
Kings of Athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions.

490
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,514
The Twelve Labors.

491
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:58,308
And he took me with him.

492
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,901
To fight by his side.

493
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,859
And with each mission,
our numbers grew.

494
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:08,451
Scythia, the Amazon kingdom where
the royal family had been assassinated.

495
00:47:08,776 --> 00:47:11,199
My family was gone.
Everyone was gone.

496
00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:14,032
Hercules helped me
avenge their murder.

497
00:47:14,115 --> 00:47:15,992
He became my brother-in-arms.

498
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:19,625
Thebes, the city of corpses,

499
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:22,127
where we found a single child,

500
00:47:22,498 --> 00:47:24,125
still alive.

501
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:26,920
Hercules took Tydeus in when

502
00:47:27,003 --> 00:47:29,677
everyone else saw
nothing but a wild animal.

503
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:34,303
You know how a rumor spreads.
How a legend grows.

504
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:36,638
Hercules' deeds were so incredible,

505
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:39,895
they could not possibly
have been performed by a mere mortal.

506
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:42,523
So we played along.

507
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:46,986
We encourage people to think
Hercules was the son of Zeus. It's good.

508
00:47:47,315 --> 00:47:48,612
Scares the enemy.

509
00:47:48,775 --> 00:47:50,402
Iolaus helps.

510
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,236
He talks nice.

511
00:47:53,553 --> 00:47:56,557
And that, My Lady, is the truth.

512
00:47:57,623 --> 00:47:59,000
The truth,

513
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:03,466
whatever the truth,

514
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:06,473
the death of his loved ones
haunts Hercules.

515
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:09,101
Only the gods can help him,

516
00:48:10,302 --> 00:48:12,100
if he listens.

517
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:22,152
Come! Gather around,
soldiers of Thrace, and behold,

518
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:25,234
when Hercules gives an order,
even the gods listen.

519
00:48:25,317 --> 00:48:27,661
Zeus' master ironsmith,

520
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,039
using the forges of your own citadel,

521
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:34,665
has crafted these divine weapons
that will make you invincible.

522
00:48:34,827 --> 00:48:36,921
As steel is hewn into shields,

523
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:40,465
so, too, will you be hewn into warriors.

524
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:46,756
You shall carry the shield of Hercules!

525
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,436
It's lighter.

526
00:48:56,515 --> 00:48:59,439
Infused with the souls
of Stymphalian birds

527
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:01,361
from Hercules' sixth Labor!

528
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,740
Spirits of birds?
How does that work, exactly?

529
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:08,577
Well, much as birds take flight,

530
00:49:08,652 --> 00:49:12,282
so, too, are these shields
lighter than air. It's in the fibers. Here.

531
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,368
Try on the helmet of Hercules.

532
00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:24,126
It covers my whole face.

533
00:49:24,293 --> 00:49:28,844
Forged after Hercules' very own helmet,
when he defeated the demon Geryon.

534
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:32,426
You sure it wasn't your horseshit
that frightened Geryon to death?

535
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:36,229
General Sitacles,

536
00:49:36,388 --> 00:49:39,562
perhaps you would care to inspect
the armor of Hercules?

537
00:49:54,364 --> 00:49:56,207
Leather armor?

538
00:49:58,744 --> 00:50:00,838
We will be skewered like pigs.

539
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:05,967
Linothorax.

540
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:10,385
Hewn from the skin of
the Erymanthean Boar.

541
00:50:10,547 --> 00:50:12,345
It's indestructible.

542
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:18,021
Wait. If it's indestructible,
how did Hercules cut it off the boar?

543
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,234
He used an indestructible blade.

544
00:50:53,048 --> 00:50:54,140
Get up.

545
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:56,468
Next!

546
00:51:04,476 --> 00:51:05,819
Again!

547
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,613
Both eyes open.

548
00:51:09,773 --> 00:51:10,945
Keep practicing.

549
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:14,953
Firmer grip.

550
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:17,121
Elbow up.

551
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,491
Good.

552
00:51:19,658 --> 00:51:21,251
Shield wall! Form!

553
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:28,258
Stand tall.

554
00:51:31,169 --> 00:51:32,341
Excellent.

555
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:00,665
Careful you don't cut yourself, boy.

556
00:52:03,035 --> 00:52:04,036
Again!

557
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:13,803
Rhesus is here.

558
00:52:13,879 --> 00:52:16,223
Close enough to stick
a blade between his ribs.

559
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:17,553
What did you see?

560
00:52:17,716 --> 00:52:20,845
Centaurs. Half man, half horse.
Hundreds of them.

561
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:23,556
He saw shadows in the night.

562
00:52:23,722 --> 00:52:26,066
My Lord,
I will go ahead into the Rhesus camp.

563
00:52:26,516 --> 00:52:28,894
I will bring word of his plans.

564
00:52:33,398 --> 00:52:36,242
If we let them get past Mount Asticus,
Thrace will fall.

565
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:38,532
You want to stop Rhesus?

566
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:40,618
We'll go through the forest
and they'll never see us coming.

567
00:52:40,697 --> 00:52:43,746
It'll slow down our chariots. A gamble.

568
00:52:44,743 --> 00:52:45,744
I have a plan.

569
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,792
The scouts have returned.

570
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:55,553
Rhesus has made his camp
in Mount Asticus, 72 leagues away.

571
00:52:55,879 --> 00:52:58,177
Once these men are ready, we march.

572
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:02,428
So, have you seen if we win or lose?

573
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,224
The gods have been annoyingly silent
on that matter.

574
00:53:06,807 --> 00:53:08,184
What they have told me is that

575
00:53:08,266 --> 00:53:11,190
I'm soon to discover
there truly is a heaven or a hell.

576
00:53:12,896 --> 00:53:14,193
When will you die?

577
00:53:14,356 --> 00:53:17,656
Within a week in a place
that looks an awful lot like hell.

578
00:53:18,402 --> 00:53:21,952
As always,
the gods are generous with hints,

579
00:53:22,114 --> 00:53:24,208
but cheap on specifics.

580
00:53:26,702 --> 00:53:28,170
Cheer up, Hercules.

581
00:53:28,328 --> 00:53:32,299
I've lived, not always well,
but long enough.

582
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:36,671
I'm ready for what's next.

583
00:53:42,509 --> 00:53:45,353
Thracians, halt!

584
00:53:46,638 --> 00:53:48,811
Shield wall! Form!

585
00:53:52,978 --> 00:53:54,230
Battle positions!

586
00:53:57,774 --> 00:53:59,117
Tydeus?

587
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,623
There is no enemy camp.

588
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:49,539
This is the right place.

589
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:08,562
Centaurs!

590
00:55:09,304 --> 00:55:10,647
They're real.

591
00:55:34,579 --> 00:55:36,172
It seems that we're expected.

592
00:55:51,596 --> 00:55:52,768
Centaurs?

593
00:56:13,827 --> 00:56:15,124
Rhesus!

594
00:56:15,287 --> 00:56:19,667
You have come looking for a fight,
and we are happy to oblige.

595
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:23,386
Hercules. The son of Zeus.

596
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:26,047
Your legend ends here.

597
00:56:26,131 --> 00:56:27,132
Look at me.

598
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:29,638
Do I look afraid?

599
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:36,745
It is over, Cotys.

600
00:56:37,112 --> 00:56:40,537
Mount Asticus on your front.
The woods at your back.

601
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:43,168
And my troops outman you three to one.

602
00:56:43,785 --> 00:56:48,586
Surrender now
and we shall consider being merciful.

603
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:51,252
Men die who speak to my lord
in such a manner.

604
00:56:57,883 --> 00:56:59,351
You've made your choice.

605
00:57:15,192 --> 00:57:16,193
Go!

606
00:57:27,746 --> 00:57:31,171
In this moment, on this day,

607
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:34,715
become the man you were born to be!

608
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:39,721
You have it within yourselves
to write your own legends!

609
00:57:40,342 --> 00:57:44,142
Let it be to death or victory!

610
00:57:48,809 --> 00:57:49,935
Charge!

611
00:57:58,735 --> 00:57:59,736
Shield wall!

612
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:02,697
Flanks out!

613
00:58:11,832 --> 00:58:13,425
Maybe today.

614
00:58:35,105 --> 00:58:36,152
Now!

615
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:57,719
Watch as the Amazon
uses the arrows of Artemis...

616
00:58:57,794 --> 00:58:59,262
Silence, boy!

617
00:59:04,468 --> 00:59:05,970
Spears forward!

618
00:59:24,905 --> 00:59:26,327
Archers, ready!

619
00:59:27,532 --> 00:59:28,954
Loose!

620
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:20,828
Advance!

621
01:00:30,087 --> 01:00:31,589
Set them aflame!

622
01:00:36,552 --> 01:00:37,644
Take cover!

623
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:40,397
Defend Lord Cotys!

624
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,251
Maybe not.

625
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,333
Shield wall! Attack!

626
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,418
Push forward!

627
01:01:22,223 --> 01:01:25,067
To kill a snake, cut off its head.

628
01:01:41,534 --> 01:01:44,037
Victory is yours, Lord Cotys!

629
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:46,665
It is not over yet!

630
01:02:20,865 --> 01:02:22,367
Fucking centaurs.

631
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:32,882
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

632
01:02:33,294 --> 01:02:36,844
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

633
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:39,383
Hail, Lord Cotys!

634
01:03:06,494 --> 01:03:07,962
Halt!

635
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:16,262
Get up.

636
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:18,715
Get up.

637
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:27,273
- Up.
- Enough!

638
01:03:38,108 --> 01:03:40,782
You helped a tyrant enslave a nation.

639
01:03:41,529 --> 01:03:44,032
All I did was stop you from
burning more villages.

640
01:03:44,114 --> 01:03:45,536
I burned no villages.

641
01:03:46,075 --> 01:03:47,543
Then who did?

642
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:49,874
Ask yourself, if Cotys is beloved,

643
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:52,195
why did he need to hire mercenaries
to do his dirty work?

644
01:03:52,331 --> 01:03:53,753
Keep moving, dog.

645
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:56,882
You've been fighting on the wrong side.

646
01:04:30,327 --> 01:04:32,125
Where are you going?

647
01:04:32,204 --> 01:04:34,206
I'm taking some water to the prisoner.

648
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:37,676
Sit down.

649
01:04:43,257 --> 01:04:44,759
It's time.

650
01:04:54,935 --> 01:04:57,859
Thrace is finally united.

651
01:05:00,441 --> 01:05:01,693
One land,

652
01:05:02,276 --> 01:05:03,619
one King,

653
01:05:05,112 --> 01:05:06,785
one Thrace.

654
01:05:07,781 --> 01:05:09,283
One land!

655
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:11,669
One King! One Thrace!

656
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:14,626
Thrace is not a man, a king, or a god!

657
01:05:15,122 --> 01:05:16,624
Thrace is her people!

658
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:26,555
Who cares what Rhesus claims?
Our work is done.

659
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:28,261
Let's collect our fee and be gone.

660
01:05:40,356 --> 01:05:41,653
Don't do anything foolish.

661
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:46,365
Where are you going?

662
01:05:53,452 --> 01:05:54,874
I saw pity in your eyes for Rhesus.

663
01:05:55,287 --> 01:05:56,584
Why?

664
01:05:57,289 --> 01:05:58,381
Look at me.

665
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:00,842
Cotys is responsible for this war,
isn't he?

666
01:06:05,047 --> 01:06:08,677
You lie very well.
Clearly, your father's daughter.

667
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:13,226
I didn't do it for my father.
I did it for my son.

668
01:06:14,139 --> 01:06:18,485
If I disobeyed Cotys or resisted
in any way, Arius would be executed.

669
01:06:18,686 --> 01:06:22,031
I did what any mother would.
I protected my child.

670
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:25,576
My husband was king.

671
01:06:25,818 --> 01:06:28,116
And Cotys poisoned him
to take his place.

672
01:06:28,696 --> 01:06:31,324
Rhesus fought back. Civil war broke out.

673
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:34,209
Arius is the legitimate king.

674
01:06:36,203 --> 01:06:38,046
My father is old.

675
01:06:38,205 --> 01:06:41,584
He will not live forever,
and once he is gone,

676
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,720
my son will be a good king.

677
01:06:45,713 --> 01:06:47,932
And he will heal this land.

678
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:49,258
That's a dream.

679
01:06:51,051 --> 01:06:52,644
And you can help.

680
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,724
Please, when you leave Thrace,
take Arius with you.

681
01:06:55,889 --> 01:06:57,607
Please keep him safe.

682
01:06:58,517 --> 01:07:00,019
Find another savior.

683
01:07:00,602 --> 01:07:01,603
Hercules?

684
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:05,737
The King commands your presence.

685
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:12,539
My Lady.

686
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:25,919
Champion of Thrace!

687
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,140
Something tells me
we're not gonna get paid.

688
01:07:29,047 --> 01:07:31,891
- You could be right.
- Oh, shit.

689
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,223
You wanted conquerors, not heroes.

690
01:07:37,723 --> 01:07:39,396
You betrayed me, Cotys.

691
01:07:39,725 --> 01:07:41,227
Betrayed?

692
01:07:42,394 --> 01:07:46,274
A mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold

693
01:07:46,356 --> 01:07:48,779
can hardly presume to
judge his employers.

694
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:51,195
Let's not quibble about details.

695
01:07:56,074 --> 01:08:00,204
We all know your legend, Hercules.
But here is mine.

696
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:03,044
When I was a general
in the army of Thrace,

697
01:08:03,123 --> 01:08:05,797
I had dreams of ruling this kingdom.

698
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:09,175
But thanks to you,
my dreams have grown.

699
01:08:09,254 --> 01:08:12,098
I now crave an empire.

700
01:08:12,758 --> 01:08:17,389
My thousands will train more thousands,
and they even more.

701
01:08:17,471 --> 01:08:19,565
The lessons of Hercules will spread.

702
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:22,397
What you began here
can never be stopped.

703
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:26,530
And if you fear
what such an army may do,

704
01:08:27,773 --> 01:08:29,150
then lead it.

705
01:08:33,111 --> 01:08:36,331
You want me to serve you?

706
01:08:37,157 --> 01:08:39,876
Spare me the moral outrage.

707
01:08:40,953 --> 01:08:42,205
Child killer.

708
01:08:44,706 --> 01:08:47,835
Getting us all killed, bad idea.

709
01:08:51,755 --> 01:08:55,225
Well, I must take this as a "no."

710
01:08:56,301 --> 01:08:57,553
In that case,

711
01:08:59,221 --> 01:09:01,599
your services are no longer required.

712
01:09:05,936 --> 01:09:08,655
You will be paid in full.
Bring them the gold.

713
01:09:50,272 --> 01:09:54,072
If we hurry, we can be spending
our fortunes in Macedonia.

714
01:09:57,571 --> 01:09:58,823
Take mine, too.

715
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:04,377
What do you think you're doing?
Let's go.

716
01:10:05,245 --> 01:10:07,168
There will be no more innocent blood
on my hands.

717
01:10:07,247 --> 01:10:09,750
I can't leave without setting this right.

718
01:10:11,501 --> 01:10:12,844
I see.

719
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,220
And who's gonna be paying us
for this suicidal endeavor?

720
01:10:16,548 --> 01:10:17,674
Thrace needs our help.

721
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:19,764
To hell with Thrace. We have gold.

722
01:10:20,928 --> 01:10:22,009
You remember the Black Sea.

723
01:10:22,095 --> 01:10:26,020
That beach you spoke of is within reach.
Leave now, be free.

724
01:10:28,477 --> 01:10:30,354
I would never be free.

725
01:10:33,398 --> 01:10:35,446
In this fight, you're alone.

726
01:10:38,195 --> 01:10:40,163
Never saw that one coming.

727
01:10:40,322 --> 01:10:42,402
- How can you just walk away?
- You can't just leave.

728
01:10:42,491 --> 01:10:44,459
- Why not?
- It's all right.

729
01:10:44,952 --> 01:10:48,422
You've sacrificed your lives for me.
Now you can finally be free.

730
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,628
Whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid.

731
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:52,384
Debt?

732
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:56,634
You think we follow you
because we owe you?

733
01:10:57,798 --> 01:10:59,141
Look around, Hercules.

734
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,552
We're family.

735
01:11:02,219 --> 01:11:03,971
All we have is each other.

736
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:09,310
We will fight for you.
And if it's our time, we will die for you.

737
01:11:09,559 --> 01:11:11,357
Because you would die for us.

738
01:11:14,064 --> 01:11:16,158
Take that, too. I have no need of it.

739
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,322
This is madness.

740
01:11:18,402 --> 01:11:19,904
You want madness?

741
01:11:19,987 --> 01:11:23,287
Tonight, a spear of flame
will pierce my heart.

742
01:11:25,325 --> 01:11:27,999
Is that not the most insane death
you've ever heard of?

743
01:11:38,505 --> 01:11:41,258
Crazy. The lot of you.

744
01:11:41,675 --> 01:11:43,018
Autolycus.

745
01:11:43,635 --> 01:11:46,639
Iolaus. Go with Autolycus.

746
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:48,682
I think I'll stay.

747
01:11:48,849 --> 01:11:49,850
Nephew.

748
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:55,072
Uncle, all I've ever done is tell stories
of great deeds performed by others.

749
01:11:56,565 --> 01:12:00,991
It's time I stopped telling their stories.
Started living my own.

750
01:12:01,445 --> 01:12:05,040
Well, you may have all
completely lost your minds, but not me.

751
01:12:06,533 --> 01:12:07,876
Not me.

752
01:12:11,246 --> 01:12:12,247
Autolycus?

753
01:12:15,959 --> 01:12:17,882
Live like a king, my friend.

754
01:12:27,888 --> 01:12:29,185
What about Cotys?

755
01:12:32,309 --> 01:12:34,311
He paid us to save Thrace.

756
01:12:34,644 --> 01:12:35,861
Let's not disappoint him.

757
01:13:05,258 --> 01:13:06,976
Lay down your arms.

758
01:13:08,845 --> 01:13:10,438
Lay down your arms!

759
01:13:11,264 --> 01:13:14,108
Or your nephew dies first.

760
01:13:30,242 --> 01:13:33,963
I invite you to join me. You refuse.

761
01:13:34,121 --> 01:13:37,295
I order you to leave. You return.

762
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,048
Get your hands off me.

763
01:13:41,962 --> 01:13:45,091
I overheard her
conspiring with Hercules.

764
01:13:45,423 --> 01:13:48,302
They were planning to remove
the young Prince from your protection.

765
01:13:53,974 --> 01:13:54,975
No.

766
01:13:55,809 --> 01:13:57,982
Let go of him! Don't touch him!

767
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:03,441
Arius! No!

768
01:14:07,863 --> 01:14:09,661
No! You're hurting him! No!

769
01:14:09,739 --> 01:14:12,162
Hercules, no! Help me! Stop!

770
01:14:12,325 --> 01:14:15,169
- Help! No!
- Arius. No.

771
01:14:15,328 --> 01:14:17,171
Arius! No!

772
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:06,589
Magnificent, aren't they?

773
01:15:07,964 --> 01:15:11,810
An extraordinary species.
Incredibly loyal.

774
01:15:12,552 --> 01:15:14,600
As long as they're fed.

775
01:15:15,222 --> 01:15:17,350
- Remember them?
- Eurystheus.

776
01:15:19,059 --> 01:15:20,902
They remember you.

777
01:15:21,645 --> 01:15:24,148
Confused, Hercules?

778
01:15:25,398 --> 01:15:30,074
Kingdoms are won with armies,
but empires are made by alliances.

779
01:15:31,071 --> 01:15:35,998
King Eurystheus and I
will now rule all of Greece.

780
01:15:42,499 --> 01:15:45,673
Cerberus only exists in my mind.

781
01:15:47,254 --> 01:15:49,256
Speak a little louder, Hercules.

782
01:15:50,757 --> 01:15:52,759
I didn't quite catch that.

783
01:15:54,928 --> 01:15:56,271
The wolves.

784
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:00,859
They were there that night.

785
01:16:01,726 --> 01:16:03,478
<i>The wolves were there.</i>

786
01:16:03,561 --> 01:16:05,279
<i>You drugged me.</i>

787
01:16:21,955 --> 01:16:24,629
<i>The wolves were there
the night my family was murdered.</i>

788
01:16:28,545 --> 01:16:31,139
My men told me
how your children screamed

789
01:16:32,382 --> 01:16:34,851
as my wolves gnawed on their bones.

790
01:16:37,137 --> 01:16:40,311
As their fangs despoiled your daughter's

791
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:42,188
pure flesh.

792
01:16:43,727 --> 01:16:47,197
When the people called out your name
louder than mine,

793
01:16:47,272 --> 01:16:50,651
you see, when they saw you as a god,

794
01:16:50,734 --> 01:16:52,953
how long before
they saw you as their king?

795
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:54,533
I wanted nothing!

796
01:16:54,696 --> 01:16:58,246
Precisely! Your sin, Hercules,
was that you had no ambition!

797
01:16:58,325 --> 01:17:00,874
I can deal with an ambitious man!
He can be bought!

798
01:17:00,952 --> 01:17:03,796
But a man who wants nothing
has no price!

799
01:17:06,082 --> 01:17:08,585
Killing you would have
turned Athens against me.

800
01:17:09,419 --> 01:17:10,762
I had to ruin your name.

801
01:17:14,924 --> 01:17:16,267
My wife!

802
01:17:17,594 --> 01:17:19,016
My children!

803
01:17:19,179 --> 01:17:22,023
Well, you have our permission
to join them in death.

804
01:17:22,182 --> 01:17:26,358
All of you!
Starting with my faithless daughter!

805
01:17:27,103 --> 01:17:29,105
No! Get off me!

806
01:17:29,856 --> 01:17:32,029
No! No! No!

807
01:17:32,192 --> 01:17:34,661
Unhand me! No!

808
01:17:35,195 --> 01:17:36,663
She's your own flesh and blood!

809
01:17:36,821 --> 01:17:39,199
I will raise Arius to be
my worthy successor!

810
01:17:39,366 --> 01:17:43,837
You stay away from my boy!
You monster, you bastard!

811
01:17:44,037 --> 01:17:47,507
- You are a monster! You are a monster!
- No!

812
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:51,511
You are not a man! You're a demon!

813
01:17:51,836 --> 01:17:53,338
Who are you?

814
01:17:54,255 --> 01:17:55,347
Are you a murderer?

815
01:17:55,507 --> 01:17:58,010
Damn you! I curse you!

816
01:17:58,176 --> 01:18:00,554
Are you a mercenary
who turns his back on the innocent?

817
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,347
Stay away from my son!

818
01:18:02,514 --> 01:18:03,891
Are you only the legend?

819
01:18:04,057 --> 01:18:07,732
Or are you the truth behind the legend?

820
01:18:07,894 --> 01:18:09,521
No! Father, please, please, please.

821
01:18:09,604 --> 01:18:10,605
We believe in you.

822
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:13,487
We have faith in you.

823
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:15,573
Have faith in yourself.

824
01:18:15,735 --> 01:18:16,952
Save me!

825
01:18:17,028 --> 01:18:18,746
Remember the man that you are.

826
01:18:18,905 --> 01:18:22,284
Father, the gods will punish you!
You cannot escape this time!

827
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:24,703
Remember the deeds
you have performed,

828
01:18:24,869 --> 01:18:26,190
the Labors you have accomplished!

829
01:18:26,913 --> 01:18:28,130
No! No!

830
01:18:29,082 --> 01:18:30,504
- Stop it!
- Leave her alone!

831
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:32,669
Now, tell me!

832
01:18:32,752 --> 01:18:33,753
Please!

833
01:18:33,878 --> 01:18:36,597
Who are you?

834
01:18:36,756 --> 01:18:40,761
I am Hercules!

835
01:18:50,812 --> 01:18:53,281
Unleash the wolves!

836
01:18:57,819 --> 01:18:58,820
Get away!

837
01:19:07,704 --> 01:19:10,628
Three wolves should be
more than enough for one lion.

838
01:19:14,002 --> 01:19:15,345
Hurry!

839
01:19:21,718 --> 01:19:22,844
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

840
01:19:25,638 --> 01:19:27,481
No!

841
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:56,256
The gods have revealed your innocence.

842
01:19:56,419 --> 01:19:58,763
The final Labor is complete.

843
01:19:58,922 --> 01:20:01,016
But I'm just getting started.

844
01:20:08,848 --> 01:20:11,248
Doesn't take a vision to know
what's waiting for us up there.

845
01:20:40,755 --> 01:20:42,098
My time.

846
01:20:53,393 --> 01:20:55,737
Excuse me.
That was my moment, my fate.

847
01:20:55,895 --> 01:20:57,317
You're welcome.

848
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:12,503
I'm going after Eurystheus!

849
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:36,895
Hercules, listen to me.
None of this is my fault.

850
01:21:36,978 --> 01:21:40,983
You see, Cotys poisoned my mind.
Turned me against you.

851
01:21:41,816 --> 01:21:42,817
I like you.

852
01:21:43,234 --> 01:21:44,281
No, stop.

853
01:21:44,902 --> 01:21:47,951
I command you to stop! I'm your King!
You took an oath to obey me!

854
01:21:48,114 --> 01:21:50,367
You swore to Zeus!

855
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:51,451
Wait, wait, wait.

856
01:21:52,702 --> 01:21:56,081
You fight for gold. I have plenty of gold.
Name your price.

857
01:21:56,789 --> 01:21:59,008
Find it in your heart to forgive.

858
01:22:04,464 --> 01:22:06,341
You want forgiveness?

859
01:22:22,565 --> 01:22:24,818
Ask my family for forgiveness.

860
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:45,555
I've never killed a god before.

861
01:22:55,556 --> 01:22:57,684
I really think I'm ready to fight now.

862
01:23:02,188 --> 01:23:03,565
Well done, warrior.

863
01:23:15,618 --> 01:23:17,336
- Eurystheus?
- Dead.

864
01:23:17,495 --> 01:23:19,543
- We need to find Arius.
- Follow me.

865
01:23:34,512 --> 01:23:36,059
Soldiers of Thrace!

866
01:23:36,222 --> 01:23:39,852
You followed me in battle.
Follow me now.

867
01:23:40,268 --> 01:23:42,111
Don't be fools!

868
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:45,319
Hercules is mortal! Not a god!

869
01:23:46,065 --> 01:23:49,695
Anyone who sides with him will die!

870
01:23:50,903 --> 01:23:52,871
And I will show you.

871
01:23:53,322 --> 01:23:54,574
Bring him.

872
01:23:58,578 --> 01:24:00,330
- Arius!
- Mama!

873
01:24:00,496 --> 01:24:02,874
No! He's your grandson!

874
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:06,169
You failed to save
your children, Hercules.

875
01:24:06,252 --> 01:24:08,346
But you may yet save him.

876
01:24:08,504 --> 01:24:09,551
Please, Father! No!

877
01:24:10,047 --> 01:24:11,594
Admit defeat!

878
01:24:12,216 --> 01:24:13,593
Bow to me!

879
01:24:14,761 --> 01:24:17,765
You have until the count of three!

880
01:24:20,266 --> 01:24:21,939
One!

881
01:24:22,977 --> 01:24:23,978
Two!

882
01:24:27,023 --> 01:24:28,821
Don't just stand there! Kill someone!

883
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:32,112
Protect Lord Cotys!

884
01:24:35,281 --> 01:24:36,453
Arius, run!

885
01:24:36,574 --> 01:24:37,621
Mother!

886
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:39,952
Get the boy!

887
01:25:33,673 --> 01:25:35,175
Tydeus!

888
01:25:38,511 --> 01:25:39,854
Attack!

889
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,432
Hold them back!

890
01:25:58,155 --> 01:25:59,577
Spears!

891
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:06,422
Go through the fire!

892
01:26:12,295 --> 01:26:15,139
Here! Here! Help! Come on!

893
01:26:18,926 --> 01:26:20,348
Easy, Tydeus.

894
01:26:51,292 --> 01:26:52,339
Hercules.

895
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:14,824
Lock shields!

896
01:27:15,983 --> 01:27:17,530
March!

897
01:27:19,779 --> 01:27:21,531
Find peace, my brother.

898
01:27:37,463 --> 01:27:42,560
As you said, Hercules,
there is no way to defeat a shield wall!

899
01:27:43,302 --> 01:27:45,350
There is no way out!

900
01:27:46,472 --> 01:27:48,395
Come out and face me!

901
01:27:55,856 --> 01:27:59,201
You're no hero! You're no god!

902
01:27:59,527 --> 01:28:02,326
You're nothing but a mercenary!

903
01:28:02,488 --> 01:28:05,207
Your wife and children deserved to die!

904
01:28:27,763 --> 01:28:28,855
What're you doing?

905
01:28:29,015 --> 01:28:30,733
Get back up there!

906
01:28:30,891 --> 01:28:33,519
Hercules must die!

907
01:28:36,313 --> 01:28:37,781
Come on!

908
01:28:40,026 --> 01:28:43,246
Kill that filthy bastard!

909
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:45,849
Hercules! Hercules!

910
01:29:46,467 --> 01:29:49,937
Hercules! Hercules!

911
01:29:50,096 --> 01:29:55,398
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

912
01:29:55,476 --> 01:29:59,151
Hercules! Hercules!

913
01:29:59,313 --> 01:30:04,313
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

914
01:30:09,448 --> 01:30:12,292
<i>You want to know
the truth about Hercules?</i>

915
01:30:12,618 --> 01:30:14,291
<i>There it is.</i>

916
01:30:15,121 --> 01:30:18,625
<i>To be honest, I prefer it to the legend.</i>

917
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:22,507
<i>The world needs a hero
they can believe in.</i>

918
01:30:23,295 --> 01:30:26,344
<i>Is he actually the son of Zeus?</i>

919
01:30:27,007 --> 01:30:29,351
<i>I don't think it really matters.</i>

920
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:33,230
<i>You don't need to be
a demigod to be a hero.</i>

921
01:30:33,681 --> 01:30:36,685
<i>You just need to believe you're a hero.</i>

922
01:30:37,017 --> 01:30:39,520
<i>It's what worked for him.</i>

923
01:30:41,147 --> 01:30:45,323
<i>But then again, what the hell do I know?</i>

924
01:30:46,193 --> 01:30:48,696
<i>I'm supposed to be dead by now.</i>
