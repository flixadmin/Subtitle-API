Why are we stopping here?

639
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,649
No, please. Please, I beg of you.

640
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,205
Shut up!

641
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,171
This is the fool that snitched
to Montoya and Allen.

642
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,491
Falcone wants you to walk him to the end
of that pier and put a bullet in his head.

643
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,762
Then everybody knows
you're with the program.

644
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,170
And if I don't?

645
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,603
Then I'm supposed to take you out
and him too.

646
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,809
Here's the thing, Jim, I like you.

647
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,447
I might not have the stomach to do it,
but I'll try.

648
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,167
Because if I don't,
someone will get to you quick enough.

649
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,006
Then they're gonna get to me,
probably Barbara as well.

650
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,810
Who knows what you told her.

651
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,049
- I told her nothing.
- You think Falcone cares?

652
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,484
- Come on, you've killed people before.
- That was war!

653
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,524
This is war!
We're at war with scumbags like him.

654
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,530
Sometimes in a war, you gotta do
a bad thing to do good, right?

655
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,251
So, do you do this bad thing, or do you die
and maybe your girl dies?

656
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,002
I might be lackadaisical, hmm?
But that's not a tough call.

GORDON:
Walk.

659
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,169
Please, Mr. Gordon, just let me live.

660
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,091
I'll do whatever you say,
I'll be your slave for life.

661
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,047
Listen to me, there's a war coming,
a terrible war.

662
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,005
Falcone is losing his grip,
and his rivals are hungry.

663
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,921
There will be chaos,
rivers of blood in the streets, I know it.

664
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,964
I can see it coming.

665
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,764
I'm clever that way.

666
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,086
And I can help you.

667
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,802
- I can be a spy--
- Shut up!

668
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,483
Turn around.

669
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,370
For God's sake, have mercy.

670
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,371
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

Attaboy.

672
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,524
Oh, my God, James.

673
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,048
I've been so worried.

674
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,762
What happened to you?

675
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,963
Hey! Master Bruce!
Get your bloody ass down off there!

676
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,730
How many times have I told you?

677
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,049
Why were you up on the roof?

678
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,763
I'm learning to conquer fear.

679
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,290
Fear doesn't need conquering.

680
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,608
Fear tells you where the edge is.
Fear is a good thing.

681
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,167
And you think I haven't told him that,
do you?

682
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,567
- You came here for a reason, I imagine.
GORDON: Yes.

683
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,446
Mario Pepper didn't kill your parents.

684
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,207
He was framed by the police department
and the mob working together.

685
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,123
We killed an innocent man.

686
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,480
ALFRED:
Right.

687
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,331
So who did it, then?

688
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,602
- I don't know.
ALFRED: I see.

689
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,808
Well, sterling work there, then, mate.

690
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,049
Yes, I'm sorry.

691
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,205
Don't be.

692
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,331
I'm glad he's still alive.

693
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,405
I wanna see him again.

694
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,245
Bruce, I'm asking you
to give me a second chance.

695
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,531
I'm going to find out
who killed your parents and why.

696
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,042
And I'm gonna clean up
the damn police department if I can.

697
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,728
But I can only do that from the inside.

698
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,882
So I'm asking you to stay silent
about what I've told you.

699
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,684
Your call.

700
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,247
Right, well,
that's sort of convenient, isn't it?

701
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,646
Alfred!

702
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,010
Thank you.
