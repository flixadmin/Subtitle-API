2
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:34,073
Despite appearances, I think you'll
find the city's on the rise.

3
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:39,179
Perhaps we should take shelter.

4
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:41,909
The city's on the rise?

5
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,451
Meereen is strong.

6
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,418
Commerce has returned to the markets.

7
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,955
The people are behind you.

8
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:52,859
Well, not all the people, of course.

9
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:56,029
No ruler that ever lived had
the support of all the people.

10
00:02:56,031 --> 00:03:00,366
<i>But the rebirth of Meereen is
the cause of this violence.</i>

11
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:04,803
The Masters cannot
let Meereen succeed.

12
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:08,106
Because if Meereen succeeds,
a city without slavery,

13
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:11,377
a city without Masters...

14
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:14,079
...it proves that
no one needs a Master.

15
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,984
Good.

16
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:20,886
Shall we begin?

17
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,255
Do we have a plan?

18
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:26,324
I will crucify the Masters.

19
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:28,193
I will set their fleets afire,

20
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,128
kill every last one
of their soldiers,

21
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,297
and return their cities to the dirt.

22
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,700
That is my plan.

23
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:38,603
You don't approve?

24
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,038
You once told me you knew
what your father was.

25
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,808
Did you know his plans
for King's Landing

26
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,244
when the Lannister armies
were at his gates?

27
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:51,583
Probably not.

28
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:54,018
Well, he told my brother
and Jaime told me.

29
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,722
<i>He had caches of wildfire
hidden under the Red Keep,</i>

30
00:03:57,724 --> 00:04:00,357
the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,

31
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:02,359
all the major thoroughfares.

32
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:06,630
He would have burned
every one of his citizens.

33
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:09,065
The loyal ones and the traitors.

34
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:11,501
Every man, woman, and child.

35
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:13,002
That's why Jaime killed him.

36
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,404
This is entirely different.

37
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:16,540
You're talking about
destroying cities.

38
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:18,642
It's not entirely different.

39
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:25,982
I'd like to suggest
an alternate approach.

40
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,997
Once before, I offered you peace.

41
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,467
If you had not been so arrogant,

42
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:48,404
you could have returned to your
homeland with a fleet of ships.

43
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:54,510
Instead, you will flee
Slaver's Bay on foot

44
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,879
like the beggar queen you are.

45
00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:00,015
<i>We are here to
discuss terms of surrender,</i>

46
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:02,484
not to trade insults.

47
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,519
The terms are simple.

48
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:08,123
You and your foreign friends
will abandon the Great Pyramid

49
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,624
<i>and the city of Meereen.</i>

50
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,227
<i>The Unsullied you stole
from Kraznys mo Nakloz</i>

51
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,229
<i>will remain to be sold again
to the highest bidder.</i>

52
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,366
<i>The translator you stole from
Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain</i>

53
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,835
to be sold again
to the highest bidder.

54
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:24,706
The dragons beneath the Great
Pyramid will be slaughtered.

55
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,777
We obviously didn't
communicate clearly.

56
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:31,645
We're here to discuss
your surrender, not mine.

57
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,551
I imagine it's difficult

58
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:40,154
adjusting to the new reality.

59
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:45,793
Your reign is over.

60
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:51,264
My reign has just begun.

61
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:30,386
Dracarys.

62
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,952
_

63
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:24,105
_

64
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:26,989
_

65
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:36,216
Thank you for the armada.

66
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:38,085
<i>Our queen does love ships.</i>

67
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:43,256
Now, last time we spoke,
we made a pact.

68
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,458
You violated that pact.

69
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,226
You declared war upon us.

70
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:49,596
<i>Though our queen does have
a forgiving nature,</i>

71
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:52,899
this cannot be forgiven.

72
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:55,868
Our queen insists
that one of you must die

73
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,271
<i>as punishment for your crimes.</i>

74
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,942
It always seems a bit
abstract, doesn't it,

75
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,743
other people dying?

76
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,714
Him.
He should die.

77
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:11,084
<i>- Yes, him.</i>
<i>- He's not one of us.</i>

78
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:12,718
<i>He's an outsider, a lowborn.</i>

79
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,753
<i>He does not speak for us.</i>

80
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,892
Please.

81
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:23,095
Please.

82
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,116
Tell your people what happened here.

83
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:49,053
Tell them you live
by the grace of Her Majesty.

84
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:51,255
When they come forward
with notions of retribution

85
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:55,760
or ideas about returning the slave
cities to their former glory,

86
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:57,962
remind them what happened

87
00:10:57,964 --> 00:11:01,632
when Daenerys Stormborn and
her dragons came to Meereen.

88
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:39,502
You don't have to be here.

89
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:41,571
Yes, I do.

90
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,263
My beloved wife.

91
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:12,701
I've missed you terribly.

92
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:19,374
Thank you for returning
Lady Bolton safely.

93
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:22,177
Now, dismount and kneel before me,

94
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,513
surrender your army and proclaim
me the true Lord of Winterfell

95
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:27,281
and Warden of the North.

96
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,350
I will pardon you for
deserting the Night's Watch.

97
00:12:29,352 --> 00:12:33,354
I will pardon these treasonous
lords for betraying my house.

98
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:39,060
Come, bastard,

99
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:41,962
you don't have the men,
you don't have the horses,

100
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,265
<i>and you don't have Winterfell.</i>

101
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:48,001
<i>Why lead those poor souls
into slaughter?</i>

102
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:50,771
There's no need for a battle.

103
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:53,741
Get off your horse and kneel.

104
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:57,444
I'm a man of mercy.

105
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,251
You're right.

106
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:06,386
There's no need for a battle.

107
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:10,557
Thousands of men don't need to die.

108
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:14,261
Only one of us.

109
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:18,698
Let's end this the old way.

110
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,800
You against me.

111
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:36,149
I keep hearing stories
about you, bastard.

112
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:38,417
The way people in the
North talk about you,

113
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,686
you're the greatest
swordsman who ever walked.

114
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:44,257
Maybe you are that good.

115
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,492
Maybe not.

116
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:49,127
<i>I don't know if I'd beat you.</i>

117
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,398
But I know that my army
will beat yours.

118
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,566
<i>I have 6,000 men.</i>

119
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:58,069
You have, what, half that?

120
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,571
Not even?

121
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,607
Aye, you have the numbers.

122
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,642
Will your men want to fight for you

123
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,545
when they hear you
wouldn't fight for them?

124
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,223
He's good.
Very good.

125
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,360
Tell me, will you let
your little brother die

126
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,662
because you're too proud
to surrender?

127
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,631
How do we know you have him?

128
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,824
<i>Now, if you want
to save--</i>

129
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,393
You're going to die
tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

130
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,398
Sleep well.

131
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,575
She's a fine woman, your sister.

132
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:15,678
<i>I look forward to having
her back in my bed.</i>

133
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:21,684
And you're all
fine-looking men.

134
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,953
My dogs are desperate to meet you.

135
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:25,688
I haven't fed them for seven days.

136
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,089
They're ravenous.

137
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:30,225
I wonder which parts
they'll try first.

138
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,728
<i>Your eyes?</i>

139
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,196
Your balls?

140
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,901
We'll find out soon enough.

141
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:43,238
In the morning, then, bastard.

142
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:02,490
<i>If he was smart,
he'd stay inside</i>

143
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,358
<i>the walls of Winterfell
and wait us out.</i>

144
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,429
That's not his way. He knows
the North is watching.

145
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,364
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

146
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:12,166
they'll stop fearing him.

147
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:14,936
He can't have that.
Fear is his power.

148
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:17,638
It's his weakness, too. His men
don't want to fight for him.

149
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,341
They're forced to fight for him.
If they feel the tide turning...

150
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:22,743
It's not his men that worry me.

151
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:24,178
It's his horses.

152
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,447
I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

153
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:29,683
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

154
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,018
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

155
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,321
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

156
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:35,656
in a double envelopment.

157
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:41,528
A pincer move.

158
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:49,035
They won't be able
to hit us from the sides.

159
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,937
Good.

160
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:56,176
It's crucial that
we let them charge at us.

161
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:00,180
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

162
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:06,118
If we let him buckle
our center, he'll pursue.

163
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,689
Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

164
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:13,493
Did you really think that cunt
would fight you man-to-man?

165
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,228
No.

166
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,130
But I wanted to make him angry.

167
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,168
I want him coming at us full tilt.

168
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:27,006
We should all get some sleep.

169
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:30,842
<i>Rest, Jon Snow. We
need you sharp tomorrow.</i>

170
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:43,755
So you've met the enemy,

171
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:47,258
drawn up your battle plans.

172
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,261
Aye, for what they're worth.

173
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:54,232
You've known him for the space
of a single conversation,

174
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:56,166
you and your trusted advisors,

175
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:57,835
<i>and you sit around making your plans</i>

176
00:17:57,837 --> 00:18:00,804
<i>on how to defeat
a man you don't know.</i>

177
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:02,406
<i>I lived with him.</i>

178
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:04,141
I know the way his mind works.

179
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:07,310
I know how he likes to hurt people.

180
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:11,581
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

181
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,785
You're right.

182
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:18,522
You think he's going
to fall into your trap.

183
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,890
He won't. He's the
one who lays traps.

184
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,793
- <i>He's overconfident.</i>
- He plays with people.

185
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:26,530
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

186
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:29,465
Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broomsticks?

187
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:33,369
I fought beyond the Wall against
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

188
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:36,205
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

189
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:38,775
You don't know him.

190
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:42,078
All right, tell me.

191
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,947
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

192
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:48,650
We'll never get him back.

193
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:53,155
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

194
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:54,990
which makes him
a greater threat to Ramsay

195
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:58,160
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

196
00:18:58,162 --> 00:19:01,196
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

197
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:04,800
which means he won't live long.

198
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:07,268
We can't give up on our brother.

199
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,438
Listen to me, please. He
wants you to make a mistake.

200
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,609
Of course he does. What
should I do differently?

201
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,777
I don't know. I don't know
anything about battles.

202
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,280
Just don't do
what he wants you to do.

203
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:20,582
Aye, that's good advice.

204
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:22,083
You think that's obvious?

205
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:23,518
Well, it is a bit obvious.

206
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,885
If you had asked
for my advice earlier,

207
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:26,654
I would have told you
not to attack Winterfell

208
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:29,090
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

209
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:31,459
When will we have a larger force?

210
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,628
We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

211
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,962
The Blackfish can't help us.

212
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:37,031
We're lucky to have this many men.

213
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:40,534
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

214
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:48,876
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

215
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:57,184
If Ramsay wins,

216
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:59,219
I'm not going back there alive.

217
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:00,887
Do you understand me?

218
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,393
I won't let ever
let him touch you again.

219
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:12,398
I'll protect you, I promise.

220
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:16,235
No one can protect me.

221
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:18,138
No one can protect anyone.

222
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:38,957
<i>You think there's hope?</i>

223
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,393
I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

224
00:20:41,395 --> 00:20:43,862
And they've never seen
the free folk fight,

225
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:45,864
so, yes, there's hope.

226
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:51,670
You want to avenge
your king, don't you?

227
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:54,573
It wasn't the Boltons
defeated Stannis.

228
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:57,175
It was Stannis himself.

229
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,910
I loved the man.

230
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:01,446
He lifted me up
and made me something.

231
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:04,683
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

232
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:07,285
- You saw these demons?
- What?

233
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:10,755
No, it's a manner of speaking.

234
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:15,626
Not actual demons.

235
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:17,061
Oh.

236
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:20,131
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis

237
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,366
and I loved the man he burned.

238
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,468
Mance didn't have
demons in his skull.

239
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,072
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

240
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:30,541
I believed in him.

241
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:34,612
I thought he was the man to
lead us through the Long Night.

242
00:21:34,614 --> 00:21:36,880
But I was wrong just like you.

243
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:41,952
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

244
00:21:43,656 --> 00:21:46,089
Jon Snow's not a king.

245
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:49,626
No, he's not.

246
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:56,833
<i>I need a good drink to help me
sleep the night before a fight.</i>

247
00:21:56,835 --> 00:21:58,401
You want some?

248
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:00,904
I have a jug of sour goat's milk

249
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:02,972
stronger than any of that grape water

250
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:05,241
you southern twats like sucking on.

251
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:07,176
No, thanks.
It does sound delicious,

252
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:09,879
but I better keep a clear head.

253
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:12,282
I can never sleep
the night before a battle.

254
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:14,083
So what do you do all night?

255
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:16,352
I walk.

256
00:22:16,354 --> 00:22:18,220
Think and walk.

257
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:20,422
Think and walk until I'm
far enough away from camp

258
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,624
that no one can hear me
shitting my guts out.

259
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:26,628
Happy shitting.

260
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,975
My lady.

261
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:47,882
You weren't at the war council.

262
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:51,320
I'm not a soldier.

263
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:54,823
Any advice?

264
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:57,158
Don't lose.

265
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,033
If I do, if I fall...

266
00:23:07,537 --> 00:23:10,170
don't bring me back.

267
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,206
I'll have to try.

268
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,408
I'm ordering you
not to bring me back.

269
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,143
I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

270
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,546
You're in my camp.
I'm the commander.

271
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:21,315
I serve the Lord of Light.

272
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,651
I do what he commands.

273
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,085
How do you know what he commands?

274
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:29,923
I interpret his signs

275
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:32,092
as well as I can.

276
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:37,097
If the Lord didn't
want me to bring you back,

277
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,766
how did I bring you back?

278
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:42,402
I have no power.

279
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:45,772
Only what he gives me
and he gave me you.

280
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:49,509
Why?

281
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,678
I don't know.

282
00:23:56,251 --> 00:24:00,887
Maybe you're only needed for this small
part of his plan and nothing else.

283
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,890
Maybe he brought you here
to die again.

284
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:11,130
What kind of god would do
something like that?

285
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,200
The one we've got.

286
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:08,210
Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

287
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:14,549
You were making jokes about
my height, I seem to recall.

288
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:18,953
Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

289
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:22,891
thinks he's the only person ever to
make a joke about a dwarf's height.

290
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:26,328
"The height of nobility,"
"a man of your stature,"

291
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,162
"someone to look up to."

292
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:31,666
You're all making the same
five or six jokes.

293
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:35,036
- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

294
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,406
And how have things been
going for you since then?

295
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:41,308
Not so well, I gather.

296
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,911
Can't imagine you would
have murdered the Stark boys

297
00:26:43,913 --> 00:26:45,246
if things had been going well.

298
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:46,947
I didn't murder the Stark boys.

299
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:49,883
But I did things that were
just as bad or worse.

300
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:51,218
And he paid for them.

301
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,287
Doesn't seem like it.

302
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:55,222
He's still alive.

303
00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:57,291
It was complicated for you, I'm sure,

304
00:26:57,293 --> 00:26:59,560
growing up at Winterfell.

305
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:02,829
Never quite knowing who you were.

306
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:06,466
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

307
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:08,535
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet

308
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:10,270
<i>with men to sail them.</i>

309
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:12,573
In return, I expect
you want me to support

310
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:15,108
your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

311
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,110
Not my claim.
Hers.

312
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:19,212
And what's wrong with you?

313
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:20,780
I'm not fit to rule.

314
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:22,482
We can agree upon that at least.

315
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:25,151
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

316
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:26,752
No more than Westeros.

317
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:31,958
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

318
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,594
He murdered our father and took
the Salt Throne from Yara.

319
00:27:35,596 --> 00:27:38,163
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

320
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:42,800
Lord Tyrion tells me your
father was a terrible king.

321
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:44,936
You and I have that in common.

322
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,805
We do.

323
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:50,142
And both murdered
by a usurper as well.

324
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:53,144
Will their ships be enough?

325
00:27:53,146 --> 00:27:56,280
With the former Masters'
fleet, possibly.

326
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:58,415
Barely.

327
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:01,218
There are more than 100
ships in the Iron Fleet.

328
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,721
There are and Euron is building more.

329
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,456
He's going to offer them to you.

330
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:06,958
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

331
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,627
The Iron Fleet
isn't all he's bringing.

332
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:11,828
He also wants
to give you--

333
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,566
His big cock, I think he said.

334
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,902
<i>Euron's offer is also an
offer of marriage, you see.</i>

335
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:20,771
<i>You won't get one without the other.</i>

336
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:23,407
And I imagine your offer is
free of any marriage demands?

337
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:26,710
I never demand, but I'm
up for anything, really.

338
00:28:28,547 --> 00:28:31,314
<i>He murdered our father
and would have murdered us.</i>

339
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:33,984
<i>He'll murder you as soon
as you have what he wants.</i>

340
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:35,719
The Seven Kingdoms.

341
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:37,020
All of them.

342
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:38,789
And you don't want
the Seven Kingdoms?

343
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:42,158
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

344
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,760
We ask you to give them back.

345
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:46,128
And that's all?

346
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,764
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

347
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:50,733
who don't think
a woman's fit to rule.

348
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:52,402
Reasonable.

349
00:28:54,706 --> 00:28:57,372
What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

350
00:28:57,374 --> 00:28:59,508
She's not demanding, she's asking.

351
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,277
The others are free to ask as well.

352
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:09,585
Our fathers were evil men,
all of us here.

353
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:12,154
They left the world
worse than they found it.

354
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:13,822
<i>We're not going to do that.</i>

355
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:16,858
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

356
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:22,464
You will support my claim as
queen of the Seven Kingdoms

357
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:25,867
and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

358
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:30,438
No more reaving, roving,
raiding, or raping.

359
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:33,341
That's our way of life.

360
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:34,876
No more.

361
00:29:42,418 --> 00:29:44,152
No more.

362
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:31,405
Do you like games, little man?

363
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,474
Let's play a game.

364
00:33:37,113 --> 00:33:38,879
Run to your brother.

365
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:40,814
The sooner you make it to him,

366
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:43,216
the sooner you get to see him again.

367
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:47,454
That's it.

368
00:33:47,456 --> 00:33:49,690
That's the game.

369
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:51,692
Easy.

370
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,694
Ready?

371
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:54,961
Go.

372
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:02,002
No, you have to run, remember?

373
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:04,170
Those are the rules.

374
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:19,051
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

375
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:46,511
Hyah! Hyah!

376
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:04,186
Don't.

377
00:36:14,932 --> 00:36:16,298
Prepare to charge.

378
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:19,768
Prepare to charge.

379
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:24,172
<i>- Draw!</i>
<i>- Draw!</i>

380
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:26,374
<i>Draw!</i>

381
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:27,843
<i>Loose!</i>

382
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:31,680
Hyah! Hyah!

383
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:37,819
Go! Go!
Follow your commander!

384
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:44,759
Run and fight!

385
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:12,786
Hyah!

386
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:15,556
<i>Nock!</i>

387
00:37:15,558 --> 00:37:18,058
<i>- Draw!</i>
<i>- Draw!</i>

388

<i>- Loose!</i>

389
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:30,503
Now.

390
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:34,840
<i>Cavalry, charge!</i>

391
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:30,628
- Nock!
<i>- Nock!</i>

392
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,130
- Nock!
<i>- Nock!</i>

394
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:39,670
- Draw!
<i>- Draw!</i>

395
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:44,975
We'll just kill our own men.
Stand down.

396
00:38:44,977 --> 00:38:47,744
- Loose!
- Loose!

397
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:29,852
Get word--

398
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:50,972
<i>No!</i>

399
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,220
Loose!

400
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:23,871
- Loose!
<i>- Loose!</i>

401
00:40:31,146 --> 00:40:33,513
- Loose!
<i>- Loose!</i>

402
00:41:02,277 --> 00:41:05,878
We may as well be
taking shits back here.

403
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,081
Follow!

404
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:17,723
It's time, go.

405
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:22,294
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

406
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:25,130
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

407
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:26,764
Show me!

408
00:41:56,195 --> 00:41:57,662
Hey!

409
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,954
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

410
00:43:30,887 --> 00:43:33,755
With me, lads!
Break their line!

411
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:08,755
Help me!

412
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:39,118
- Tormund!
- Get him back!

413
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,854
<i>Infantry, advance.</i>

414
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:49,628
<i>Both sides!</i>

415
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,563
<i>Fall back!</i>

416
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,666
<i>Fall back!</i>

417
00:45:15,022 --> 00:45:17,055
Fuck this, come on!

418
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:29,066
We're going home!

419
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,549
<i>Open the gate!</i>

420
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,756
<i>Archers to the wall.</i>

421
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,993
- Their army's gone.
- Our army's gone.

422
00:50:00,363 --> 00:50:02,263
We have Winterfell.

423
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,832
They don't have the men for a siege.
All we have to do is wait.

424
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:06,734
<i> Archers!</i>

425
00:50:06,736 --> 00:50:08,436
To the wall!

426
00:51:42,596 --> 00:51:45,497
You suggested one-on-one
combat, didn't you?

427
00:51:53,206 --> 00:51:55,806
I've reconsidered.

428
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:59,277
I think that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

429
00:53:59,162 --> 00:54:01,895
We're going to bury
my brother in the crypt

430
00:54:01,897 --> 00:54:03,997
next to my father.

431
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:11,405
Jon.

432
00:54:17,012 --> 00:54:19,179
Where is he?

433
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,141
Ah.

434
00:54:49,143 --> 00:54:50,710
Sansa.

435
00:54:54,182 --> 00:54:56,381
Hello, Sansa.

436
00:55:03,724 --> 00:55:06,391
Is this where I'll be staying now?

437
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:16,801
No.

438
00:55:20,573 --> 00:55:24,375
Our time together is
about to come to an end.

439
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,814
<i>That's all right.</i>

440
00:55:29,816 --> 00:55:31,649
You can't kill me.

441
00:55:33,253 --> 00:55:35,419
I'm part of you now.

442
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,491
Your words will disappear.

443
00:55:43,162 --> 00:55:46,029
Your house will disappear.

444
00:55:46,031 --> 00:55:49,233
<i>Your name will disappear.</i>

445
00:55:51,203 --> 00:55:53,804
<i>All memory of you will disappear.</i>

446
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:23,633
My hounds will never harm me.

447
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:26,135
You haven't fed them in seven days.

448
00:56:26,137 --> 00:56:27,636
You said it yourself.

449
00:56:31,843 --> 00:56:33,575
They're loyal beasts.

450
00:56:33,577 --> 00:56:35,477
<i>They were.</i>

451
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:37,379
Now they're starving.

452
00:57:01,404 --> 00:57:03,371
Sit.

453
00:57:03,373 --> 00:57:04,906
Down.

454
00:57:04,908 --> 00:57:07,508
Down!

455
00:57:08,578 --> 00:57:10,879
Down! Down!

456
00:57:10,881 --> 00:57:12,814
Down!

457
00:57:56,497 --> 00:58:06,675
