1
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,920
You've seen better days, my lord.

2
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,210
Another visit?

3
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,960
It seems you're my last friend.

4
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,930
No, no, many still love you.

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,310
Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.

6
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,230
On her knees begging for me. Hm!

7
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,480
Did you laugh with the others?

8
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,150
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing I want.

9
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,150
I don't know what you want.

10
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,900
I've given up trying to guess.

11
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,530
When I was still a boy -

12
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,450
before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -

13
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,000
I traveled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

14
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,630
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

15
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,510
The same is true at court.

16
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,880
I am the master of whisperers.

17
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,390
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

18
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,470
I'm a good actor, my lord.

19
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,850
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

20
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,980
I could.

21
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,440
But will I?

22
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,900
No.

23
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,990
As I said, I'm no hero.

24
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,860
What do you want? Tell me.

25
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,820
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?

26
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,540
Peace.

27
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,710
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

28
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,170
Fighting for his father's freedom.

29
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,460
Robb?

30
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,380
He's just a boy.

31
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,720
Boys have been conquerors before.

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,390
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

33
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,270
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,560
He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

35
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,070
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

36
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,910
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

37
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,540
Cersei is no fool.

38
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,960
She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,630
You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,

40
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,340
who crippled my son?

41
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,380
I want you to serve the realm!

42
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,220
Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,

43
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,350
tell your son to lay down his sword

44
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,680
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,730
Cersei knows you as a man of honor.

46
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,610
If you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

47
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,320
I believe she will allow you
to take the black

48
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,950
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

49
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,990
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

50
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,830
That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...

51
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,580
Of what?

52
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,550
You grew up with actors.

53
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,010
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

54
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,470
But I grew up with soldiers.

55
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,940
I learned how to die a long time ago.

56
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,770
Pity.

57
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,740
Such a pity.

58
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,950
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

59
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,500
Is that a precious thing to you?

60
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,880
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,710
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- Keep shooting them down.

62
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,880
We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

63
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,970
He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

64
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,890
Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

65
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,140
Look.

66
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,100
Father rots in a dungeon.

67
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,310
How long before they take his head?

68
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

69
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,030
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

70
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,070
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

71
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,580
Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

72
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,370
The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

73
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,620
and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.

74
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,000
Have my horse saddled and ready.

75
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,210
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.

76
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,130
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

77
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,890
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

78
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,260
Whatever it took.

79
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,940
If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

80
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,230
I agree.

81
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,440
- I'll go.
- You can't!

82
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,860
I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.
He would never harm me.

83
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,410
Unless there was a profit in it.

84
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you want?

85
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,670
It is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

86
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh, spare me.

87
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,710
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

88
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
What am I supposed to do with you?

89
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,970
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

90
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,180
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until I die. Do I look dead to you?

91
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,060
- Father, please...
- I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

92
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,570
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

93
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,160
All right, you come forward.

94
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,300
There.
Now that I've observed the courtesies,

95
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,800
perhaps my sons will do me the honor
of shutting their mouths.

96
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,180
Is there somewhere we can talk?

97
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,310
We're talking right now.

98
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,860
Fine.

99
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,530
Out! All of you!

100
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,290
- Oh!
- You too.

101
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,800
You see that?

102
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,970
Fifteen, she is.

103
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,890
A little flower.

104
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,430
And her honey's all mine.

105
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,190
I'm sure she will give you many sons.

106
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,940
Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

107
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,980
He is quite ill, my lord.

108
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,240
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

109
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,530
Or the one before that.

110
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,160
Your family has always pissed on me.

111
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,160
- My lord, I...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

112
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,710
The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

113
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,750
- I'm sure there were reasons...
- I didn't need reasons.

114
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,550
I needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

115
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,100
Why are you here?

116
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,770
To ask you...

117
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,150
to open your gates, my lord...

118
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,780
so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

119
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,950
- Why should I let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

120
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,570
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

121
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,080
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

122
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,540
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

123
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,040
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

124
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,000
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

125
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,460
You swore an oath to my father.

126
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,630
Oh, yes, I said some words.

127
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,930
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

128
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,310
Joffrey's king now,

129
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,060
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

130
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,980
If I had the sense the gods gave a fish,
I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

131
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,990
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

132
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,200
Give me one good reason why I should
waste a single thought on any of you?

133
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
And... engage!

134
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

135
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,300
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

136
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,170
You'll be ready for this, then.

137
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,970
I thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

138
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,560
so I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

139
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,310
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.

140
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,990
This is Valyrian steel.

141
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,710
It was my father's sword,
his father before him.

142
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,210
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

143
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,340
It was meant for my son Jorah.

144
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,180
He brought dishonor to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

145
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,550
before he fled from Westeros.

146
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,720
- My lord, you honor me, but I can't...
- Oh, you can.

147
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,560
And you will.

148
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,560
I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

149
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,360
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

150
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,070
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

151
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,910
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

152
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,620
Right.

153
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,620
Now, don't think this means I approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

154
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,210
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

155
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,590
I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.

156
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,090
No, you won't.
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

157
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,220
The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist...

158
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,640
I've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...

159
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,600
boy king.

160
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,560
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

161
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,780
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

162
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,450
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...

163
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,950
and bring me my supper.

164
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,620
Yes, my lord.

165
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,510
- Well done.
- Well done.

166
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,260
You earned that, Snow.

167
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,270
Well done.

168
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,190
Go on, let's have a look.

169
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,610
- At what?
- The sword! Show us the sword.

170
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,650
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

171
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,030
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

172
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,950
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

173
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,960
Come on,
I want to have a look at it in the light.

174
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,840
Give it here!

175
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,840
What is it?

176
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,970
- I...
- Look at its eyes.

177
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,600
- Give it.
- I can't.

178
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,180
You can't what?

179
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,480
I...

180
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,770
I'm really not supposed to say.

181
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,520
And yet you really want to say.

182
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,610
You want to say that...?

183
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,700
There was a raven.

184
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,700
I read the message to Maester Aemon.

185
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
It's your brother Robb.

186
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,870
What?

187
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,500
What about him?

188
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,460
He's heading south.

189
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,380
To war.

190
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,430
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

191
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,890
I should be there.

192
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,520
I should be with him.

193
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,660
If we do that, they'll never get back across.

194
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,250
Well?

195
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,040
What did he say?

196
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,670
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

197
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,720
- His men are yours, as well.
- Huh.

198
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,600
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

199
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,100
What does he want in return?

200
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,430
You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

201
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,400
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

202
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,070
And?

203
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,240
And Arya...

204
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,160
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

205
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,910
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

206
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,160
And?

207
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,330
And...

208
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,590
when the fighting is done...

209
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,090
you will marry one of his daughters.

210
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,180
Whichever you prefer.

211
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,640
He has a number
he thinks will be... suitable.

212
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,640
I see.

213
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,810
Did you get a look at his daughters?

214
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,360
I did.

215
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,770
And?

216
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,690
One was...

217
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,410
Do you consent?

218
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,120
- Can I refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

219
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,290
Then I consent.

220
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,300
Sam said you wanted to see me?

221
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,760
I did indeed.

222
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,850
Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

223
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,560
Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

224
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,730
take no wives and father no children?

225
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,530
No.

226
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,360
So they will not love.

227
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,870
Love is the death of duty.

228
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,790
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

229
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,250
between honor on the one hand...

230
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,790
and those he loves on the other,

231
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,250
what would he do?

232
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,420
He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

233
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,680
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.

234
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,390
Most of us are not so strong.

235
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,100
What is honor...

236
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,900
compared to a woman's love?

237
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,440
And what is duty...

238
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,070
against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

239
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,570
Or a brother's smile?

240
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,450
Sam told you.

241
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
We're all human.

242
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,870
Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

243
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,790
Honor comes easy then.

244
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,380
Yet...

245
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,420
sooner or later...

246
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,470
in every man's life...

247
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,590
there comes a day when it is not easy.

248
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,760
A day when he must choose.

249
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,640
And this is my day?

250
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,810
Is that what you're saying?

251
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,020
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

252
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,980
- I know.
- You do not know.

253
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,900
No one knows.

254
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,660
I may be a bastard,

255
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,240
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

256
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,840
The gods were cruel
when they saw fit to test my vows.

257
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
They waited till I was old.

258
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,510
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

259
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,010
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

260
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,010
I was helpless...

261
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,390
blind, frail.

262
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,150
But...

263
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,780
when I heard they had
killed my brother's son...

264
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,990
and his poor son...

265
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,490
and the children!

266
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,910
Even the little children.

267
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,660
Who are you?

268
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,580
My father was Maekar,

269
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,790
the first of his name.

270
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,130
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

271
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,130
when I had refused the throne.

272
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,680
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

273
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,720
whom they called the Mad King.

274
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,480
You're Aemon Targaryen.

275
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,230
I'm a maester of the Citadel,

276
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,530
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

277
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,660
I will not tell you... to stay or go.

278
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,250
You must make that choice yourself...

279
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,620
and live with it for the rest of your days.

280
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,670
As I have.

281
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,110
My lord...

282
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,740
My sun and stars...

283
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,910
Drogo.

284
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,960
My horse...

285
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,920
Blood of my blood...

286
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,930
No, I must ride.

287
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,430
He fell from his horse.

288
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,140
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

289
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,350
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

290
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,690
We've ridden far enough today.
We'll camp here.

291
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,030
This is no place to camp.

292
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,320
A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a Khaleesi.

293
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,410
We'll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

294
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,080
You do not command me, Khaleesi.

295
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,330
Find Mirri Maz Duur.
Bring her to me.

296
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,040
The witch?
I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

297
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,920
Bring her to me unharmed
or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.

298
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,970
Hyah! Hyah!

299
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,410
Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

300
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,880
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

301
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,500
They're a day's march north.

302
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,010
The boy may lack experience and sense,

303
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,550
but he does have a certain mindless...

304
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,260
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

305
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,890
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

306
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,390
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

307
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,560
otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

308
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,070
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battleaxes.

309
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,610
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

310
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,570
Shagga likes axes.

311
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,410
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

312
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,080
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

313
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,790
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

314
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,290
They do seem rather ferocious.

315
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,590
Ferocious?

316
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,430
Last night... a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

317
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,260
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

318
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,020
Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock,

319
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,270
which was fortunate, but even still,
Ulf is demanding blood money,

320
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,980
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

321
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,230
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

322
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,820
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.

323
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,320
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

324
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,910
It appears I'm not hungry after all.

325
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,620
Excuse me, my lords.

326
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,810
Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?

327
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,100
- I took her.
- Took her?

328
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,270
- From whom?
- From, uh...

329
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,190
Ser... What's his name?

330
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,150
- I don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

331
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,530
He said something.

332
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,370
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

333
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,750
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

334
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,550
Oh, well.

335
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,930
I, uh...
think I'll go and find myself one.

336
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,930
Who are you?

337
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,440
Who would you like me to be?

338
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,230
What did your mother call you?

339
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,440
Shae. What did your mother call you?

340
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,900
My mother died giving birth to me.

341
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,660
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

342
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,030
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

343
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,830
For...

344
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,120
What do you want from me?

345
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,000
What do I want from you?

346
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,090
I want you to share my tent.

347
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,220
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

348
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,880
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

349
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,010
I want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.

350
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,730
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

351
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,850
Which it may well be.

352
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,520
And what do I get?

353
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,230
One - safety.

354
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,400
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

355
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,160
Two - the pleasure of my company,

356
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,910
which I have heard is spectacular.

357
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,160
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

358
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,870
And three...

359
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,040
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

360
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,000
Do you accept my proposal?

361
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,900
Let's start with your last night in this world.

362
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,230
Khaleesi.

363
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,400
Come.

364
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,940
He's very strong.

365
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,780
No one understands how strong he is.

366
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,800
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

367
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,550
He can't. I won't let him.

368
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,760
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

369
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,900
We must go quickly.
I've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

370
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,070
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

371
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,150
Doth...

372
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,990
Even if...

373
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,490
Even if he dies...

374
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,030
why would I run?

375
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,750
I am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

376
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,000
This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood.

377
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,710
Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

378
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,550
Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.

379
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
He won't want any rivals.

380
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,470
Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.

381
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,350
I won't... leave him.

382
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,070
The wound has festered.

383
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,160
You did this, witch.

384
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,080
Stop it!

385
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,750
I don't want her hurt.

386
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:19,040
No? No?
You don't want her hurt?

387
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:27,010
Pray we don't hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

388
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,760
Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.

389
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,680
Only while the blood of my blood lives.

390
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,610
When he dies, she is nothing.

391
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,740
I have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.

392
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:00,250
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

393
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,300
I think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.

394
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,100
I think you're right.

395
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,320
- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

396
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,650
He's beyond the healer's skills.

397
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,150
All I can do is ease his path.

398
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,450
Save him and I will free you. I swear it.

399
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,660
You must know a way.

400
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,490
Some...

401
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,210
Some magic.

402
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,000
There is a spell.

403
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,380
Some would say death is cleaner.

404
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,970
Do it.

405
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,560
Save him.

406
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,480
- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

407
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,860
It's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

408
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,980
Only death pays for life.

409
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,030
My death?

410
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,910
No, not your death, Khaleesi.

411
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,290
Bring me his horse.

412
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,560
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

413
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,980
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

414
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,030
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

415
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,740
I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

416
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,460
Go. Now.

417
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,460
- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

418
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,750
Take her!

419
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,560
You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

420
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,220
The dead will dance here tonight.

421
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,320
No one will enter.

422
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,920
Bring him back to me.

423
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,100
What have you done?

424
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,480
I have to save him.

425
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,860
We could have been 10 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

426
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,940
You would have been safe.

427
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,700
This must not be.

428
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,330
This must be.

429
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,660
Witch.

430
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,630
No, you can't.

431
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,630
Khaleesi!

432
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,470
No further, horselord.

433
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,470
Are you hurt?

434
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,550
- The baby...
- Hmm?

435
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,300
...is coming.

436
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:23,260
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

437
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,810
They'll come or I'll have their heads.

438
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,730
The witch - she can bring baby.
I hear her say so.

439
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,840
Are you in agony, my lion?

440
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,380
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

441
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,890
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

442
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,140
Ah!

443
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,440
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

444
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,610
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

445
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,740
Let's play a new game.

446
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,820
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you.

447
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,040
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

448
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,660
- Not if you win.
- No!

449
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,330
No fire games, no knife games.

450
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,300
- Let's do something I'm good at.
- What are you good at?

451
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,300
I happen to be a great judge of character.

452
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,630
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

453
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,850
Here's how it works -
I make a statement about your past.

454
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,100
If I'm right, you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

455
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,100
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

456
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,060
I don't want to play this game.

457
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,110
Fine. Bronn first.

458
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,570
Your father beat you.

459
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,250
But my mother hit harder.

460
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,170
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

461
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,090
It was a woman.

462
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,720
She swung an axe at me.

463
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,050
You've been north of the Wall.

464
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,140
What brought you up there?

465
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,560
- Work.
- And...

466
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,020
you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly

467
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,940
so you've never let yourself love again.

468
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,150
Oh, wait, that's me.

469
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,160
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

470
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,830
I don't want to play.

471
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,710
It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

472
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,340
Your mother was a whore.

473
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,510
Drink.

474
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,180
All right.

475
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,730
Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.

476
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,980
Drink.

477
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,030
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

478
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,950
Mm.

479
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,990
You wanted a different life.

480
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,830
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

481
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,620
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

482
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,830
So, specifics...

483
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,420
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

484
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,300
I don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

485
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,090
So... what's a lowborn girl to do?

486
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,020
Drink.

487
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,560
- Are you sure...
- Drink!

488
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,950
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

489
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,570
or I will carve your eyes from your head.

490
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,000
My dear lady,
if I have offended you, I apologize.

491
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,130
My turn.

492
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,290
Fine, fine.

493
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,920
Ask away.

494
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,680
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

495
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,720
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

496
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,180
I don't care the way the game works.

497
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,270
Our lord here used to be married.

498
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,350
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

499
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,770
You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

500
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,940
Another night, perhaps.

501
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,070
Not another night. This night.

502
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,240
It's not a pleasant story.

503
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,830
Oh, maybe I will cry.

504
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:00,420
I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more
unpleasant stories than your lordship.

505
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,630
So...

506
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:13,760
I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding,
when we heard a scream.

507
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,350
She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.

508
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,980
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while I wrapped her in my cloak.

509
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,900
She was too scared to send off on her own,

510
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:30,030
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

511
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,530
Her name was Tysha.

512
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,830
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

513
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,120
And she was hungry.

514
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,500
Together we finished off three chickens
and a flagon of wine.

515
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,790
Impossible as it seems, there was a time
when I was unaccustomed to wine.

516
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,050
I forgot how afraid I was around girls...

517
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,510
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

518
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,930
look away embarrassed,

519
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,720
or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

520
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,180
I forgot about everything but Tysha.

521
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,230
And somehow I found myself in her bed.

522
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,230
For three chickens, I should hope so.

523
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,400
It didn't last long.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

524
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,860
But she was good to me.

525
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,950
She kissed me afterwards and...

526
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,450
sang me a song.

527
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,580
And by morning
I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

528
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,960
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

529
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,250
and there you have it - man and wife.

530
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:32,260
For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

531
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,890
Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.

532
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,470
Not quite.

533
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,600
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

534
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,730
The girl was a whore, you see.

535
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,440
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers... all of it.

536
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,030
He thought it was time I had a woman.

537
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,240
After my brother confessed...

538
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,370
my father brought in my wife

539
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,410
and gave her to his guards.

540
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,670
He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

541
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,670
How many whores command
that kind of price?

542
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,970
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

543
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,430
By the end, she had so much silver

544
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,270
that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.

545
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,110
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

546
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,240
You should have known she was a whore.

547
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,200
Really?

548
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,490
I was 16, drunk and in love.

549
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,960
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

550
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,590
As I said, I was young and stupid.

551
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,510
You are still young and stupid.

552
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,120
Hyah!

553
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,220
- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

554
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,060
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

555
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,680
They're a mile north.

556
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,890
- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

557
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,310
If I die, weep for me.

558
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,610
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

559
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,830
I'll know.

560
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,620
Watch out! Move!

561
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,380
Out of the way!

562
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,380
Move aside!

563
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,260
Stay low.

564
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,800
Stay low?

565
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,270
If you're lucky, no one will notice you.

566
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,230
I was born lucky.

567
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,730
Tribesmen of the Vale,

568
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,150
gather round!

569
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,280
Stone Crows!

570
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,610
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

571
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,320
- Moon Brothers!
- And Painted Dogs!

572
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:47,240
- And Painted Dogs!
- Painted Dogs!

573
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,250
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

574
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,210
Onward, to claim what is yours!

575
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,420
Half man! Half man!

576
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,840
Half man! Half man!

577
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,590
Half man! Half man!

578
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,550
To battle!

579
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,600
You're a shit warrior.

580
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,480
I'm alive?

581
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,980
You're alive.

582
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,030
Did we win?

583
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,820
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

584
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,210
How did our tribesmen do?

585
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,840
Yeah, good.

586
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:29,180
It's nice to see them getting along.
You're wounded.

587
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,310
Good of you to notice.

588
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,430
I hear we won.

589
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,100
Huh! The scouts were wrong.

590
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,900
There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20.

591
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,070
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

592
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,650
He wasn't here.

593
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,200
Where was he?

594
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,700
With his other 18,000 men.

595
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,500
And where are they?

596
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,550
- We should go, my lady.
- No!

597
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,310
My lady!

598
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,770
Hyah! Hyah!

599
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,060
By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

600
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,480
Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword,
but I seem to have lost it.

601
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,520
It is not your sword I want.

602
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,650
Give me my daughters back.

603
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,610
Give me my husband.

604
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,240
I've lost them too, I'm afraid.

605
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,830
Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

606
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:19,710
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

607
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,920
Take him away and put him in irons.

608
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,500
We could end this war right now, boy,

609
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,630
save thousands of lives.

610
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,630
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

611
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,720
Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

612
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,560
choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

613
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,230
If we do it your way, Kingslayer...

614
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,020
you'd win.

615
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,650
We're not doing it your way.

616
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,410
Come on, pretty man.

617
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:06,210
- I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

618
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,340
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

619
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,060
One victory does not make us conquerors.

620
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,940
Did we free my father?

621
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,480
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

622
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,530
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

623
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,200
This war is far from over.

624
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,110
Could I have one?

625
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,990
A lemon one... or any of them.

626
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,740
Three coppers.

627
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:20,240
- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

628
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:24,160
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

629
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,750
Piss off!

630
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,180
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

631
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,470
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

632
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,510
The Hand of the King.

633
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,120
- Traitor!
- Coward!

634
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,290
Baelor.

635
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,630
Baelor!

636
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,010
Traitor! Traitor!

637
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,370
I am Eddard Stark...

638
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,490
Lord of Winterfell...

639
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,950
and Hand of the King.

640
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,630
I come before you to confess my treason...

641
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,720
in the sight of gods and men.

642
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,390
I betrayed the faith of my king...

643
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,520
and the trust of my friend Robert.

644
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,400
I swore to protect and defend his children.

645
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,400
But before his blood was cold...

646
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,150
I plotted to murder his son...

647
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,780
and seize the throne for myself.

648
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:19,090
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what I say...

649
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,180
Joffrey Baratheon...

650
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,430
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...

651
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,980
by the grace of all the gods,

652
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,310
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...

653
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,610
and Protector of the Realm.

654
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,990
As... As we sin...

655
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,490
so do we suffer.

656
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,660
This man has confessed his crimes...

657
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:53,210
in sight of gods and men.

658
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,500
The gods are just...

659
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,090
but beloved Baelor taught us...

660
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,670
they can also be merciful.

661
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,220
What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace?

662
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,190
My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

663
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,650
Stripped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

664
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,820
And my Lady Sansa...
has begged mercy for her father.

665
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,910
But they have the soft hearts of women.

666
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,170
So long as I am your king...

667
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:41,090
treason shall never go unpunished.

668
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,340
Ser Ilyn...

669
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,840
bring me his head!

670
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:48,050
No!

671
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,010
Someone stop him!

672
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,280
My son, this is madness.

673
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,490
Put him down!

674
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,200
- Don't look!
- Let me go! Let me go!

675
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,870
Shut your mouth!
Look at me! Look at me!

676
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,420
Stop! Daddy! Stop!

677
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,420
- No! No!
- Traitor!

678
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,880
Stop!

679
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,090
Stop him! Stop!
