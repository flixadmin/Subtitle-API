1
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,204
When you were here before

2
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,834
Couldn't look you in the eye

3
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:11,800
You're just like an angel

4
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,638
Your skin makes me cry

5
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:23,144
You float like a feather

6
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,273
In a beautiful world

7
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:34,614
And wish I was special

8
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,160
Come on, Drax. Dance.

9
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:40,703
Only idiots dance.

10
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:45,583
And I'm a creep

11
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:52,006
I'm a weirdo

12
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,803
What the hell am I doin' here?

13
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,977
I don't belong here

14
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:14,612
I want to have control

15
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:22,287
I want a perfect body

16
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:25,153
I want a perfect soul

17
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,797
I want you to notice

18
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,386
When I'm not around

19
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,392
You're so very special

20
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,062
I wish I was special

21
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,944
But I'm a creep

22
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,738
Hey! Uh-uh.

23
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,200
I told you a million times,

24
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:05,163
you keep your grimy
raccoon hands off my Zune.

25
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:10,209
I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

26
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,961
But I'm a creep

27
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:22,597
When I don't belong here

28
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:31,898
Again?

29
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:42,325
Ah, she's runnin' out

30
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:49,415
She run, run, run, run

31
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,676
Whatever makes you happy

32
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,931
Whatever you want

33
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,141
I love you, Gamora.

34
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,646
You're so very special

35
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:17,026
I wish I was special

36
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,740
But I'm a creep

37
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:30,248
I'm a weirdo

38
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,919
What the hell am I doing here?

39
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:40,717
I don't belong here

40
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,848
I don't belong here

41
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,038
So, what are you gonna do about Quill?

42
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,939
Me? Why not you?

43
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:58,109
I got emotionalistical issues.
What am I gonna do?

44
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,545
Why are you on the ceiling?

45
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,338
I wanted to see if
these new gravity boots

46
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,460
worked on a slope.

47
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,579
Here we go.

48
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:25,762
Sorry.

49
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,771
Bozhe moi, Kraglin.

50
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:36,707
You must know you will never learn.

51
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,561
You think you could do better?

52
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,109
Da.

53
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,236
Davaj.

54
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:01,881
Telekinesis is cheating!

55
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,961
That's a stupid little pebble!

56
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,204
I could do that with my dang finger!

57
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,013
You're a bad dog.

58
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:10,765
Do not say that to me.

59
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,409
You are. You're a bad dog.

60
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,559
Take that back.

61
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,311
Come on, that's not cool.

62
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,563
Nebula, did you hear?

63
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,357
He called me a bad dog,

64
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,876
and he refused to take it back.

65
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,443
I don't care, Cosmo.

66
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,671
- Is Peter okay?
- I don't know.

67
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,949
- What are you going to do?
- Me? He's your brother.

68
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,302
It doesn't matter,
he still doesn't listen to me.

69
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:33,180
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

70
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,497
She's not dead.

71
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,225
She just doesn't remember anything

72
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,309
from the past few years.

73
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,685
Nobody tells me nothing.

74
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,687
Mantis, why don't you just touch him and,

75
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,856
- you know, make him happy?
- I am Groot?

76
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,965
- Dude!
- Gross!

77
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,968
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

78
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,613
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

79
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,907
'Bout that time you made me
fall in love with my sock?

80
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:53,307
Well, that was funny.

81
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,953
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

82
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:57,246
Maybe we should draw straws.

83
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,188
No one ever meant that, Drax.

84
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:24,005
If we still have time
We might still get by

85
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:28,634
Every time I think about it I wanna cry

86
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:32,388
With bombs and the Devil
And the kids keep comin'

87
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:36,184
No way to breathe easy
No time to be young

88
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:47,195
But I tell myself
That I was doin' all right

89
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,539
There's nothin' left To do at night

90
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,224
- What was that?
- What was that?

91
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,017
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God!

92
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,168
Is he okay?

93
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,303
Hey!

94
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,451
Where did you go, squirrel?

95
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,148
On the ground!

96
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,545
No, stop! Don't!

97
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,091
Stop, please! No!
Stop, please!

98
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,300
Please!

99
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,043
Who is that maniac?

100
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,647
Some super douche with ray gun hands,

101
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,013
I don't frickin' know.

102
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:08,854
Who threw this thing at me?

103
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,880
Shut up.

104
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,215
Baby.

105
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,145
Pick on someone your own size.

106
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,386
Peter!

107
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,138
Peter!

108
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,473
We need Med-Paks!

109
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,863
Nebula!

110
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:18,948
Piss off.

111
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,974
Rocket.

112
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,412
That hurts.

113
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,497
What a pity.

114
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,599
No!

115
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,080
All I did was activate the Med-Paks!

116
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,647
Get them off! Now!

117
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,192
Oh, hell.

118
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:20,420
We need to get him to the Med-Bay!

119
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,944
It was destroyed.
There's one on the ship.

120
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,287
Lill ol od for today.

121
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:35,262
Stitch him up and transfer him
in with the rest of Batch 89.

122
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,576
It's okay.

123
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,623
You're here with us now.

124
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,956
Hey! It's a new guy.

125
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,937
What kind of thing are you?

126
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,627
You've got, like, a mask on your face.

127
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,508
Mask, eyes, face, mouth,

128
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,302
does it words?

129
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:31,015
It's okay, friend.
Don't let them scare you.

130
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,105
Hurts.

131
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,714
It's okay.

132
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,260
You're gonna be okay.

133
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,681
A kill switch?

134
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,892
A device set to destruct

135
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,828
if anyone goes poking around inside him,

136
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,204
or even if we use the Med-Paks.

137
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,081
And why would Rocket have a kill switch?

138
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,334
Apparently, someone considers
him proprietary technology

139
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,860
and sent that golden lunatic to get him.

140
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,588
So, he'll die if we operate on him?

141
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:27,672
And he'll die if we don't.

142
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,007
There has to be some way to bypass it.

143
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,300
It looks like there's a passkey

144
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,926
that could override the kill switch.

145
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,012
What do we know about
where Rocket came from?

146
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,388
He won't talk about it.

147
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,141
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called OrgoCorp.

148
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,117
And there's a code on all of it,

149
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,670
89P13.

150
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,755
He's got maybe 48 hours.

151
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,485
Where are you going?

152
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,236
OrgoCorp have to have records, right?

153
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,321
Maybe they'll have a way for us

154
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,323
to override the kill switch
and save Rocket.

155
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,866
They won't just give us that information.

156
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,368
Well, that's why we're gonna break in.

157
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:58,453
We kill anyone who gets in our way!

158
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,288
- Not kill anyone.
- Kill a few people.

159
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,355
Kill no people.

160
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,875
Kill one guy, one stupid guy
who no one loves.

161
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,729
Now you're just making it sad.

162
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,176
Kraglin, Cosmo, I need you to keep watch

163
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,095
over Knowhere till we're back.
Couple of days, tops.

164
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,827
- Aye, Cap'n.
- Aye, comrade.

165
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,432
Take back what you said,

166
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,934
- that I'm a bad dog.
- Nope.

167
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,520
I know you don't really
think I am a bad dog.

168
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,813
Can you please take it back?

169
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:25,838
I will not.

170
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,943
I located the coordinates for OrgoCorp.

171
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,444
I think I have a contact near there.

172
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,779
Maybe they can help us get in.

173
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,012
Contact him.

174
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,455
Let's go save our friend.

175
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:57,327
I get the same old dreams
Same time every night

176
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,497
Fall to the ground And I wake up

177
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:05,210
So I get out of bed
Put on my shoes and in my head

178
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,839
Thoughts fly back To the break-up

179
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,508
These four walls Are closing in

180
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,170
Look at the fix You've put me in

181
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,699
Since you been gone

182
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:18,891
No, no, no.

183
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,768
Since you been gone

184
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:24,104
I'm out of my head Can't take it

185
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,609
Could I be wrong But since you been gone

186
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,862
You cast the spell So break it

187
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,498
It's good to have friends.

188
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,833
Since you been gone

189
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,423
Oh, my poor baby.

190
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,926
It hurts.

191
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,072
- Do you have it?
- He does not, sire.

192
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,891
I tried to warn you, High Evolutionary.

193
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,495
These Guardians are
more powerful than you think.

194
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,605
Or perhaps you simply
overestimate your own value,

195
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,190
High Priestess.

196
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,003
No doubt a flaw of some type
in my own design.

197
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,006
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

198
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,907
Beautiful numbskulls.

199
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,118
But your egos have run wild.
Say, "Ah."

200
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,538
- Ah.
- And this one

201
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,307
was meant to be the Warlock,

202
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,975
the apogee of their people.

203
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,378
You removed Adam from his cocoon early,

204
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,545
my liege.

205
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,213
He's still a child.

206
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,857
No, there's something wrong with him

207
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,223
even outside all that.

208
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,693
Yes, there's something wrong with me!

209
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,217
I was stabbed, you extraordinary phallus!

210
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,282
He doesn't know any better.

211
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,784
We shall do whatever
you require, my liege.

212
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:46,329
You knew of 89P13's existence
for years without alerting me.

213
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,272
That's not what I require!

214
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,402
I'm sorry, my liege.

215
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,572
Find 89P13 and return it to me,

216
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:59,241
or I will destroy
your entire civilization,

217
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,743
as is my right as your maker.

218
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,579
Do you understand?

219
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,794
Do you understand?

220
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,255
Yes, sire.

221
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,841
Toodle-do.

222
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,597
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

223
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,241
It was always clever, sire.

224
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,159
Yes, that's exactly why I want it now.

225
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,852
- Of course.
- Its brain.

226
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,229
That is the only reason, sire.

227
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,042
But are you really trusting
the Sovereign to retrieve it?

228
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,377
They're merely a backup.

229
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,658
I believe I know where they're going.

230
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,980
It's bio-formed.

231
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:15,296
Instead of being built,
it's grown from living matter.

232
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,753
The structure is surrounded

233
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,297
by three impenetrable
plasmic security shields.

234
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,381
It's not going to be easy

235
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,799
to break into this place, Star-Lord.

236
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,884
Doesn't have to be easy.

237
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,802
I was a professional thief, remember?

238
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,961
I'll jam the signals one at a time.

239
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,350
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

240
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,541
She's always mad

241
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,461
at everyone.

242
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,653
It's because I was drunk.

243
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,633
She's right.

244
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,302
If I hadn't been drinking,

245
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,887
maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

246
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,390
It's okay.
He's your best friend.

247
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,808
Second best friend.

248
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:52,771
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu, Gamora.

249
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:53,952
Gamora isn't dead.

250
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,035
She is to us.
You want a Zarg-Nut?

251
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,235
Thank you.

252
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:03,949
First shield set.

253
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,285
Three, two,

254
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,122
one.

255
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:16,837
- Peter.
- What?

256
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,089
You had family on Earth,

257
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,794
and you never wanted
to go back to see them?

258
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,152
No, you're my sister.

259
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,988
That's all the family I want or need.

260
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,073
Besides, it was really
just my grandpa, okay?

261
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,622
He was a pretty hard guy.

262
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,517
Still. Don't you think he...

263
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,352
What?

264
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,997
You were abducted by Ravagers

265
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,095
the same day he lost his daughter.

266
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,566
Oh, yeah, he was upset.

267
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,043
My mom died, he screamed in my face,

268
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,211
he pushed me out of the room!

269
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,630
He was probably
just trying to protect you.

270
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,424
- What are you talking about?
- What?

271
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:45,675
I'm talking about the people
in my life who died,

272
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:46,759
and you're talking about this?

273
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,844
Second shield set.

274
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,620
Three, two, one.

275
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,752
I'm only saying,

276
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,272
you've never even
gone to see if he's okay.

277
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:00,760
He could still be alive.

278
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:04,593
My grandpa? He'd be, like,
90-something years old.

279
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,237
So he could still be alive.

280
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,322
People on Earth die
when they're, like, 50.

281
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,871
They die when they're 50?

282
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,701
I don't know.
Something like that.

283
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,494
What's even the point of being born?

284
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,271
- Exactly!
- Are you about to die?

285
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,232
I'm not 50!

286
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,402
The point is,

287
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,780
I wasn't talking about any of this.

288
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:27,741
Third shield set.

289
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,744
Three, two, one.

290
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,589
Well, not everything

291
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,682
is about what you are talking about.

292
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,750
And I'm only saying you are upset

293
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,895
because so many of the people
you cared about

294
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,087
have left you...

295
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,939
but you also left someone.

296
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,317
And maybe I wanted a Zarg-Nut!

297
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,232
It's too late.
They're all gone.

298
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,756
Why didn't we go through?

299
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,488
We did. It's not the shield.

300
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,035
Oh, hell.

301
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,540
Ravagers.

302
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,477
Hey, guys, you're about to be boarded

303
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,044
by the United Ravagers.

304
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:22,355
You can surrender and turn over

305
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,940
any stuff worth anything and live...

306
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,882
or you can die.

307
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,008
Totes up to you.

308
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,693
Drax, no, no, no, Drax!

309
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,920
- Mwah.
- Guys, it's me,

310
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,171
Peter Quill, I'm one of you, remember?

311
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,114
Hold on!
We have an appointment!

312
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,008
- We have an appointment.
- With who?

313
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,160
- With Gamora.
- With Gamora.

314
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,704
- What?
- You're early.

315
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,180
What are these?

316
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,682
OrgoCorp uniforms.

317
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,120
You're gonna have to wear
these to move through the Orgo

318
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,354
without attracting attention.

319
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,689
This isn't my color.

320
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,444
What did you say?

321
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,196
It clashes with my eyes.

322
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,160
Put it on!

323
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,424
Nebula, why would you not tell me

324
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:40,433
that you've been in contact with Gamora?

325
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,018
Because I didn't want you
to get freaked out.

326
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,126
Freaked out how?

327
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,336
Like that.

328
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,921
Let me in there.

329
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,191
I don't wanna be trapped
out here, I can't...

330
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,109
Gamora, we are grateful for your help.

331
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:53,321
Oh, I'm not doing this out
of the kindness of my heart.

332
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,323
I'm doing this
for the hundred thousand units

333
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:56,556
my sister promised.

334
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,226
So, you're a Ravager now?

335
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,870
Put on the uniform.

336
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,273
Never pictured you as the Ravager type.

337
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,106
Who are you again?

338
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,691
Oh, man.

339
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:10,007
OrgoCorp is in possession
of some of the most advanced

340
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,989
cybergenetic IP in the galaxy,

341
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,119
so they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.

342
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,748
Now, I know you don't have
documentation to dock,

343
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:24,393
so you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

344
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,964
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records,

345
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:31,341
where maybe you can find the passkey

346
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,718
to override the kill switch

347
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,887
and help you save the hedgehog.

348
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,306
But if you get into trouble,

349
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,768
we will not be able to bail you out.

350
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,245
Yes.

351
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,164
Yes, of course. Brilliant.

352
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,794
His functioning has skyrocketed.

353
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,133
That's correct, P13.

354
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,551
Very good.

355
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,267
That's the new world.

356
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,727
Counter-Earth.

357
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,872
Where the experiments will go
once they're ready.

358
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,189
It blue.

359
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,357
That's the sky.

360
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:30,859
Sky.

361
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,071
Rocket.

362
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,740
Yes, it is.

363
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,868
What sounds?

364
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,495
That's music.

365
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,580
We like it?

366
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,123
We do.

367
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:49,252
This recording is over 5,000 years old.

368
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,064
"Mo Ergastee Förn, Mo Ergalone Förn Nort."

369
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,217
Which, translated, is,

370
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,846
"Be not as you are,
but as you should be."

371
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:02,098
It's our sacred mission,

372
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:05,018
to take the cacophony of sounds around us

373
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,271
and turn it into a song.

374
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,650
To take an imperfect clump

375
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,528
of biological matter such as you

376
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,615
and transform it into something

377
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,283
perfect.

378
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,747
And we're halfway there, aren't we?

379
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,586
Come with me, P13.

380
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,811
I'd like to show you something.

381
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,011
We have but a single quest,

382
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,931
to create the perfect species

383
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,100
and the perfect society.

384
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,685
You, P13,

385
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,188
are part of Batch 89.

386
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,649
But here with Batch 90,

387
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,194
I've developed a process
by which I can guide

388
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,863
any organism through millions of years

389
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,533
of programmed evolutionary changes

390
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:03,535
in a moment.

391
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:38,278
See, now, there's the rub.

392
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,822
For some reason,

393
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:44,075
these specimens are also over-producing

394
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,954
loligo beta-microseminoprotein
in their systems,

395
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:49,747
causing them to be, well...

396
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,000
Violent. We don't like it.

397
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,252
A utopia can't have its denizens

398
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,165
murdering one another, can it?

399
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,255
It can'ts.

400
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,174
Can't.

401
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,467
Can't.

402
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:01,843
Theel.

403
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,892
They're programmed
to be peaceful. Like you.

404
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,437
But for some reason, it's not catching.

405
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,231
Hyptonic filters.

406
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,316
What?

407
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:20,403
They's suppressaliting
the glycosylated saltses.

408
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,572
And then boop-boop-boop,

409
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,033
halfcystine residual be formin',

410
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:27,619
and then, they make, um...

411
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,204
What do you say?

412
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,331
Loligo beta-microseminoproteins.

413
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:32,957
Yeah, thems.

414
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,793
And then, angry turtleses.

415
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:27,428
There. That's
the decompression chamber.

416
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:29,055
Lock in.

417
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:34,018
And in the end We shall achieve in time

418
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,312
The thing they call divine

419
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,315
When all the stars Will smile for me

420
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,441
Go.

421
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:45,572
When all is well And well is all for all

422
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,615
And forever after

423
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:53,079
Well, maybe in the meantime Wait and see

424
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:57,292
We love the all The all of you

425
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:03,590
Where lands are green And skies are blue

426
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:08,803
When all in all We're just like you

427
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,473
Activate gravity boots and gloves.

428
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,856
And when I cry for me I cry for you

429
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,233
Nebula, go.

430
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,819
For all the days You've still to come

431
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:30,617
And did I ever say I'd never play

432
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,578
Or fly toward the sun

433
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:39,292
Maybe in the meantime Something's wrong

434
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:43,087
We love the all The all of you

435
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:48,801
Where lands are green And skies are blue

436
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:59,872
So, you really don't remember anything?

437
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:00,897
Like what?

438
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,278
'Bout your time with us.

439
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,942
No.

440
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,279
- Huh. We were...
- We weren't anything.

441
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,656
You and me...

442
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:13,326
That person was some alternate
future version of me.

443
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,912
It wasn't me.

444
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,498
We loved each other.

445
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,959
I don't think so.

446
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,199
I know you don't remember any of it.

447
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,094
You were everything to me.

448
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,305
And I miss you...

449
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:37,141
so much.

450
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:39,560
And, maybe...

451
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,149
maybe, if you open yourself up to it...

452
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,043
there's a possibility...

453
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,652
I don't think so, Quinn.

454
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:49,862
Quill.

455
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,030
Quill.

456
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,158
I don't think so.

457
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:55,427
Well, what I'm trying to say...

458
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,846
Peter, you know this is
an open line, right?

459
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,996
What?

460
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,683
We're listening to everything
you're saying.

461
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,709
And it is painful.

462
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,061
And you're just telling me now?

463
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,396
We were hoping it would stop on its own.

464
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,772
But I switched it over to private!

465
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,232
What color button did you push?

466
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,391
- Blue, for the blue suit!
- Oh, no!

467
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,319
Blue is the open line for everyone.

468
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,095
- Orange is for blue.
- What?

469
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,681
Black is for orange, yellow is for green,

470
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:19,267
green is for red, and red is for yellow.

471
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,869
No. Yellow is for yellow,

472
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,621
green is for red, red is for green.

473
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,658
- I don't think so.
- Try it then.

474
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:26,983
Hello!

475
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,236
You were right.

476
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:32,256
How the hell am I supposed
to know all of that?

477
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,573
Seems intuitive.

478
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,288
Can we get back to saving our friend?

479
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,595
Get that jammer
ready to change the shield.

480
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:14,947
Guys?

481
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,925
I mean, you wanna talk
about a sweet ride?

482
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,094
The acceleration will crush your spine.

483
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,763
It's got that brand-new fusalix core.

484
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:21,847
You know what I'm talking about?

485
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:22,872
Oh, yeah.

486
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,029
Really? 'Cause I just
made that up.

487
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,603
Oh, I thought you said somethin' else.

488
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:28,795
Master Karja.

489
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,465
- No, you didn't.
- I... I did.

490
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,319
Master Karja, there appears
to be a physical breach

491
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:36,570
in the white wing somewhere.

492
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:38,485
- Could it be a glitch?
- Maybe.

493
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,079
I'm accessing the eye.

494
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:47,811
I'll see if I can locate it.

495
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:20,906
There's some sort of anomaly

496
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,116
in the decompression chamber.
Best you check it out, Master.

497
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,141
On it.

498
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:26,727
Hurry.

499
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,040
Where do we put these?

500
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:44,278
Here! Hide them in this locker
until we leave.

501
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,503
Hurry!

502
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,314
What the hell was that, guys?

503
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,818
- What, are you kidding me?
- What?

504
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,322
A neutro-quark just hit the satellite.

505
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,799
It's burning a hole through the wall.

506
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,010
You geniuses,
you just throw the door open

507
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:25,387
without any proper
precautionary procedure?

508
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,787
What procedure, bro?

509
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:30,333
Oh! You want us to read
the manual for you too, bro?

510
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,686
You could have killed
everyone in the wing!

511
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,921
Exactly! You idiots!

512
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:36,422
I'm angry too!

513
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,673
Oh, no.

514
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:38,984
I mean, can't you see

515
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,777
these authentic mechanic uniforms

516
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,362
that we're wearing on our bodies?

517
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,948
That blend in with some of our
skin-tones better than others?

518
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,432
Excuse my friend.

519
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:49,312
He is the boss' nephew.
He's a little...

520
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,193
Yeah. I...
I got one of those too.

521
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:00,071
I mean, this one?
This one I love.

522
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,238
I'm so proud.

523
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,175
You're doing great.
So proud of you.

524
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,784
But this one, I just...

525
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,644
Everything he does drives me crazy.

526
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:14,669
Yeah.

527
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:15,812
I thought you said something else.

528
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:16,837
Shut up.

529
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:18,690
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

530
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:19,942
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.

531
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,175
I am.

532
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,694
How'd you guys get here so fast?

533
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,529
I'll be honest with you,
we just happened in

534
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,573
before it burned all the way
through, thankfully.

535
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:28,366
Ah. Good thing you were here.

536
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,935
All right, guys, wrap it up.

537
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,970
Looks like we're all clear here.

538
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,693
Our spacesuits!

539
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,365
You threw them in the contamination bin.

540
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:47,260
It expels stuff into space
the moment you shut the door.

541
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:50,055
That would have been helpful
information three minutes ago.

542
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,432
Damn it, Mantis,
why don't you ever think?

543
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,393
Are we pretending to be angry again?

544
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:55,668
Mantis, you asshole!

545
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,212
Guys, just focus for two seconds.

546
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,690
We'll find another way out of here.

547
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:02,758
Right now, we need to save Rocket's life.

548
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,396
Nebula, Quinn, and I

549
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,447
will get to the records
and get the passkey.

550
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:08,472
Bug and Doofus,

551
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:10,242
access the spaceport through the elevator

552
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,706
so Tree can land and get us out of here.

553
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:14,186
Apologies.

554
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,271
No problem.

555
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:17,481
Go.

556
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,213
Not my fault I don't know something

557
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:34,711
if no one ever tells me.

558
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,435
I didn't even wanna come here.

559
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,061
I'm gonna need to see your...

560
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,087
You're hopelessly in love

561
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:41,839
with him.

562
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,174
Oh, no.

563
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:45,176
Hey.

564
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:46,260
Hey.

565
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:48,898
How you doin' today?

566
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,015
I'm all right.

567
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:55,713
What was... What was
your name again?

568
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:58,105
- Drax the Destroyer.
- Oh.

569
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:00,628
That is such a lovely name.

570
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:03,487
I'll get the door for you.

571
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,090
I'll be here when you
come back out, okay?

572
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,115
Sure.

573
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,534
Every single time.

574
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:14,330
My name is Bletelsnort.

575
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:17,833
Welcome to OrgoCorp headquarters.

576
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,877
For over 300 years,

577
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,689
OrgoCorp has been producing
cybernetic implants

578
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:25,257
and genetic upgrades across the universe

579
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:28,761
under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.

580
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:31,406
That warning we got today,

581
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,748
don't those two match the description?

582
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,682
Attention, all Orgosentries,

583
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:40,783
That manager should
have access to the records.

584
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:43,859
If the passkey is here,
she can get it for us.

585
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,278
All right.
I'll handle this one.

586
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:47,488
How?

587
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,865
Pure Star-Lord charm.

588
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,010
I'm excited for you
that you get to see this again

589
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:53,202
for the first time.

590
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,378
Hi, Yura.

591
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,462
Ura.

592
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:05,089
- Oh. Ura.
- Hi.

593
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,216
Hi, my name's Patrick Swayze.

594
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:10,970
I've been noticing you for quite a while,

595
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,906
and the way that you smile to yourself

596
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,943
when you think nobody is looking,

597
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,119
it makes my every day a bit brighter.

598
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:19,162
We need your hand.
And it's your choice

599
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,664
whether it's on your body or not.

600
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:21,981
What are you doing?

601
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,708
She was never gonna fall for that.

602
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,960
Dude, she was totally into me, man!

603
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:26,545
I kind of thought you were a douchebag.

604
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:28,088
- Oh, come on.
- We need a file.

605
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:30,322
- What file?
- 89P13.

606
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:31,758
- Could that be something?
- No.

607
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:33,325
Then your use to us

608
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,262
- is over.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

609
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:37,055
It sounds like a species tag.

610
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:38,789
Show us!

611
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:43,687
All of our research supports

612
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:46,672
the High Evolutionary's
altruistic objective

613
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:49,466
of creating a utopian society.

614
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,218
That must be the spaceport.

615
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:00,227
What is all this?

616
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:03,772
Species patented over
the years using OrgoCorp tech.

617
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,233
Every species OrgoCorp has created

618
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,068
has its own individual file.

619
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:09,838
I'm so sorry about this.

620
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:11,965
Listen to me, this is not
the kind of thing we do.

621
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:14,217
Oh, please, stop it with the subtle jabs!

622
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,802
Old you would have never done this.

623
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,179
You had a purpose higher than yourself.

624
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,430
- A calling to help people.
- Give me a break.

625
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,182
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

626
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:21,766
Except, I didn't form the Guardians.

627
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,001
- Sheesh.
- And I barely left Thanos.

628
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:26,670
Whoever it was
that you were in love with,

629
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:28,923
it wasn't me.

630
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,026
It sounds more like her.

631
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,051
- Her?
- What?

632
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:33,945
- That's ridiculous!
- Do not bring me into this.

633
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,596
Don't even...

634
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:41,568
- Knock it off!
- What?

635
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,121
Don't look at me like a lost puppy

636
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:44,331
needing a soft place

637
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:46,673
- to lie down.
- I didn't say anything!

638
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:52,646
I just never noticed
how black your eyes were.

639
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,867
They were replaced by my father

640
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:59,078
as a method of torture.

641
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:01,664
He... He picked a pretty set.

642
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,459
There.

643
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:09,088
That's the file for 89P13.

644
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,091
Heads up, heads up!

645
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:15,636
- Ugh.
- Okay.

646
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:20,724
What?

647
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:36,949
Oh, no.

648
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:39,410
Walk!

649
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:42,955
Move it, move it!

650
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,671
Stand down!

651
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,275
Drax, we should make a run for it.

652
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:54,397
Or we could fight.

653
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,467
- Run.
- Fight.

654
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:57,094
- Run!
- Fight!

655
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:59,054
Take 'em!

656
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:04,715
What are we gonna do?

657
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:07,580
- I got a plan.
- What is it?

658
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:09,251
All of you, come with me...

659
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:11,984
Everybody, lower your weapons,

660
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,712
or I blow this woman's brains out!

661
00:44:13,736 --> 00:44:14,862
That's the plan?

662
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:17,948
- You're a kitty cat.
- Meow.

663
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:22,077
You feel like dancing.

664
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,581
Violent rage.

665
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:32,838
Lower your weapons!

666
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:38,611
Let's kill that one
that looks like a carrot

667
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:40,160
to show we mean business.

668
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,639
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

669
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:45,744
She was always like that,
and yet, I was the bad guy.

670
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:47,436
We are not killing anyone!

671
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,520
Back off!

672
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:53,901
Groot, bring the Bowie
to us. Now.

673
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:06,681
I'm so sorry about this, Ura.

674
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:07,790
Oh, please.

675
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:11,377
We're here to save the life
of our friend, that is all.

676
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:15,089
We paid her to help us get in
and get out.

677
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:16,691
You'd think that'd mean,
"Oh, I'm gonna help you

678
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,318
"do it in a way that
no one knows it's happening."

679
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:20,820
But no, what she means is,
"I'm gonna shoot people.

680
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:23,162
- "Threaten people's lives."
- Shut up!

681
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,616
And I know you're probably asking,

682
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,141
why would I trust her?

683
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:28,060
Well, that's a good question.

684
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:31,522
The answer is, we used to be in love.

685
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,690
Yeah. She was my girlfriend,

686
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,877
only she doesn't remember it,
because it wasn't her.

687
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,796
Because her dad threw her off
a magic cliff and she died,

688
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,963
and then I lost my temper

689
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,882
and nearly destroyed half the universe.

690
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,801
Then she came back, out of the past.

691
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:44,159
And there she is.

692
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:46,179
Everyone else who died in
the past stayed dead, not her.

693
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:48,515
Why? Was it the magic cliff?
I don't know.

694
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:51,344
I'm not some fricking
Infinity Stone scientist.

695
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:55,462
Just some dumbass Earth dude
who met a girl, fell in love,

696
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:57,464
that girl died,

697
00:45:57,923 --> 00:46:00,134
and then came back a total dick.

698
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,222
He left out some important information,

699
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:07,850
but that is the gist of it.

700
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:15,708
Get to the security hub!

701
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:16,733
Okay!

702
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:28,430
Everybody, down on the floor,
or we blow your brains out!

703
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:30,473
Hey, hey, hey, we don't want any...

704
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:31,790
No! Oh, my God

705
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:32,958
Oh, my God! No!

706
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,669
Come on! Would you please
stop doing that?

707
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:52,728
Now, I'm craving your body Is this real

708
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:56,231
Temperature's rising I don't want to feel

709
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:59,193
I'm in the wrong place To be real

710
00:47:01,195 --> 00:47:02,404
Yeah!

711
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:03,572
Hey!

712
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:07,784
And I'm longing to love you
Just for a night

713
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:19,796
Run.

714
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:52,579
Drax!

715
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:58,085
Get on the ground
and show me your hands now.

716
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:08,595
Ura?

717
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:10,556
Please listen to me.

718
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,849
We need to get out of here with this

719
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:14,763
to save my best friend's life.

720
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,120
If you could get us into the system

721
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:17,247
of those sentries out there,

722
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:20,250
they are good people,
like you. I'm certain of it.

723
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:21,584
And if I just had an opportunity

724
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,669
to speak to them...

725
00:48:22,693 --> 00:48:24,337
They're corporate shills, you idiot.

726
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:25,421
They're not gonna listen to you.

727
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:28,383
They will listen if I speak
to them from my heart.

728
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:29,408
Ura.

729
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,451
Please.

730
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,212
Hey!

731
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:47,759
Come out now!

732
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,761
Damn it!

733
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,519
You are in.

734
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,081
Tell them your truth.

735
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:01,624
Yeah, I'm not that big of an idiot.

736
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,905
I just needed to get into the system.

737
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:05,986
Move it.

738
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:18,874
Told you she was into me.

739
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,229
I am Groot?

740
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:44,358
Yeah, that looked cool.

741
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:55,911
Is sky?

742
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:57,329
No.

743
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:01,083
That's not sky, that's a ceiling.

744
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:05,045
But sire's making a new world
for all of us,

745
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:07,214
and when we get there,

746
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:09,174
there will be sky,

747
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:13,053
and it will be beautiful and forever.

748
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:19,935
I have been thinking.

749
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:21,687
'Bout what?

750
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:24,189
Oh, nothing in particular.

751
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:28,276
But I thought, since you guys
are my closest friends,

752
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,153
and my only friends,

753
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:32,006
you might be interested in knowing

754
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,741
that I have been thinking.

755
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:36,368
That's cool.

756
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,870
I've been thinking, too,

757
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:41,581
about something more singular.

758
00:50:42,374 --> 00:50:44,835
When sire moves us to the new world,

759
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:46,837
we're gonna need names.

760
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:48,797
I mean,

761
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,841
89Q12,

762
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:52,342
it's not really a name,

763
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:57,848
so I would like my name to be...

764
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,183
Lylla.

765
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:02,102
Lylla.

766
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:03,979
Lylla.

767
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:05,397
Lylla.

768
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,649
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

769
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:10,110
Thank you.

770
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:14,573
I think my name shall be Teefs,

771
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:17,868
because, although we all do have them,

772
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:21,121
mine are definitely the most prominent.

773
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:24,124
- Teefs.
- Teefs.

774
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:25,417
- Lylla.
- Teefs.

775
00:51:26,877 --> 00:51:31,339
Me be called Floor,
because me is lying on floor.

776
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:34,509
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

777
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:37,345
Yes!

778
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:40,724
- Floor.
- Floor.

779
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:42,642
What about you, friend?

780
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:49,149
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly,

781
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:53,069
and me and my friends
are gonna go flyin' together

782
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:56,656
into the forever and beautiful sky.

783
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:59,534
Lylla, and Teefs,

784
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:02,788
and Floor, and me...

785
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,415
Rocket.

786
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:09,252
Rocket.

787
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,756
It really is good to have friends.

788
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:14,758
Yeah.

789
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:21,640
Start the incision here.

790
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,769
Keep calm.

791
00:52:28,939 --> 00:52:30,732
- Hold it still.
- I can't!

792
00:52:30,816 --> 00:52:33,443
It won't stop moving.

793
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,822
Why did he never tell us
about any of this?

794
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,780
This is worse than what Thanos did to me.

795
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:43,951
Well, what about
the passkey? Is it there?

796
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,418
No. But a file
was removed today.

797
00:52:50,502 --> 00:52:51,562
Downloaded and deleted,

798
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,064
a million characters in length.

799
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:57,634
The biometrics say it was
this man. Recorder B2H6.

800
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:00,157
I saw this guy outside of records today.

801
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:04,534
Looks like one of the
High Evolutionary's recorders.

802
00:53:04,558 --> 00:53:05,934
The High Evolutionary?

803
00:53:06,977 --> 00:53:08,329
The founder of OrgoCorp?

804
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:10,331
OrgoCorp is just a way
to fund his experiments

805
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,333
that lie outside intergalactic laws.

806
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,401
He's created whole societies.

807
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:16,987
Xeronians, the Ani-Men,

808
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,548
- the Sovereign.
- The Sovereign?

809
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:21,072
Corners of the universe consider him God.

810
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:23,618
I am Groot.

811
00:53:23,702 --> 00:53:24,703
Yes.

812
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,097
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

813
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:28,099
He said maybe this man
downloaded the passkey

814
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:29,953
into the computer on his head.

815
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,211
That could store the passkey.

816
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:35,046
We find him, we save Rocket.

817
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:37,951
The High Evolutionary's coordinates.

818
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:40,695
Put the coordinates in the nav.

819
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:41,720
Wait a minute.

820
00:53:42,596 --> 00:53:43,930
Are you kidding me?

821
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:47,410
What he wants is that gutted
badger in the Med-Bay,

822
00:53:47,434 --> 00:53:49,871
and you're gonna bring it
straight to him?

823
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:51,664
It's almost certainly a trap.

824
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:53,165
Trap isn't a trap if you know the trap

825
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:54,750
is trying to trap you.
It's a face-off.

826
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:57,211
A face-off is a trap if you're facing off

827
00:53:57,235 --> 00:54:00,467
against a guy a thousand times
more powerful than you.

828
00:54:01,114 --> 00:54:03,217
Do you know who the High Evolutionary is?

829
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:06,536
Yeah, he's some dickhead
who dissected my best friend.

830
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,556
- Second best.
- The High Evolutionary

831
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,683
isn't someone you wanna
think about messing with.

832
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:12,685
We won't think about it when we do it.

833
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:14,628
You know what? I don't care!

834
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:15,980
Just drop me off with the Ravagers,

835
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:18,024
and you go do whatever it is
that you wanna do.

836
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:19,317
We don't have time for this.

837
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:22,028
I'm not asking you. Drop me
off with my people now!

838
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,930
"Your people"? The Ravagers
aren't your people.

839
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:26,932
I'm a damn Ravager.
You aren't.

840
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:31,120
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family. Okay?

841
00:54:31,144 --> 00:54:32,788
But my Gamora, the one I loved,

842
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,290
she didn't find it
with a group of criminals,

843
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,583
she found it with us.

844
00:54:35,607 --> 00:54:37,776
People who care about you.

845
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:40,236
I know that's who you still are.

846
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:42,532
Somewhere inside of you...

847
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:48,119
What are you so afraid of in your self

848
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:50,413
that I need to be something for you?

849
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:53,625
I don't give a shit about your Gamora.

850
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,126
Life made me me!

851
00:54:57,754 --> 00:54:58,856
I have a few upgrades

852
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,816
courtesy of that gutted badger
in the Med-Bay,

853
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,234
and we are not risking his life

854
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:03,736
to make yours more convenient.

855
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,970
I'm family.

856
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:06,554
So is he.

857
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:12,268
Screw you.

858
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:16,564
Screw all of you.

859
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,763
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield,

860
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:32,129
pirating supply ships.

861
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:35,393
I do appreciate this, good sir.

862
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:37,311
And I appreciate
your generous contribution

863
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:39,397
to the Orgosentry retirement fund.

864
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:40,672
Your associate,

865
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,968
a Zehoberei named Gamora,
where is she now?

866
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:46,320
You ain't getting nothing from me.

867
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,847
Oh, we'll see about that, won't we?

868
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:51,099
Adam.

869
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:53,601
Adam.

870
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:54,769
Yes, Mother?

871
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:56,439
Show him we mean business.

872
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:20,045
I said show him we mean business,

873
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:21,313
not disintegrate him!

874
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:22,940
What more business
could we have shown him?

875
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:24,567
But now he's of no use to us!

876
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:25,776
Well, let's just question
the man's friend.

877
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,570
Friend?
You think that's a friend?

878
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:28,720
It's an animal!

879
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,515
He looks sad.

880
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,161
I really don't enjoy

881
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:37,381
how that's making me feel, actually.

882
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:40,523
Your friend's a moron.

883
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:42,559
I got one of those too.
I get it.

884
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:45,528
Outpost?
This is Gamora, you there?

885
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:49,407
Fitz-Gibbonok.

886
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:50,492
Come in.

887
00:56:55,705 --> 00:56:57,332
Outpost, come in.

888
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,959
Yes, Gamora.

889
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,003
Salutations.

890
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:03,421
May I help?

891
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:06,025
Well, I need you guys to come pick me up.

892
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:07,526
I'm gonna upload the location-link

893
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,843
to the craft I'm on.

894
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:11,429
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

895
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:34,577
Do you realize

896
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:42,627
That you have the most

897
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:46,965
Beautiful face?

898
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:51,344
Do you realize

899
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:01,688
We're floating in space?

900
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:06,276
Do you realize

901
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:11,281
You need to say to him exactly
what I told you to say.

902
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:13,217
Why don't you just say it?

903
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:15,493
No one ever listens to me.

904
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:21,040
Do you realize

905
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,046
That everyone...

906
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,551
Quill,

907
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:33,887
life is a pond,

908
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:36,490
and you've spent your entire life

909
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,161
leaping from woman to woman

910
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,907
as if they're lily pads
upon this great pond.

911
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:43,521
Perhaps, what you need to do, Quill,

912
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,524
is learn to swim.

913
00:58:50,278 --> 00:58:52,631
- That actually made sense.
- Yes, it made sense.

914
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:54,973
No, I mean, that's sort of an analogy.

915
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:56,886
And I didn't know that you were capable

916
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,828
of that type of thought.

917
00:58:58,912 --> 00:59:00,864
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

918
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,208
Analogies, metaphors, et cetera.

919
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:05,460
For instance,

920
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:10,256
Gamora's head is like a
lily pad because it is green.

921
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:12,926
Analogy.

922
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:15,094
And also stupid-looking

923
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:16,520
- and flappy.
- Flappy?

924
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:19,057
Because her skin is made of a leaf.

925
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:20,642
Metaphor.

926
00:59:21,017 --> 00:59:22,060
Is it?

927
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:25,313
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

928
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:29,275
Even my butt is capable
of making an analogy.

929
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,447
What's happening?

930
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:42,830
The fluid is in his lungs.

931
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,792
P13?

932
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:48,211
P13.

933
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:51,089
Sire.

934
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,466
P13!

935
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:55,684
My lord, might I suggest that we...

936
00:59:56,678 --> 00:59:57,679
Must...

937
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,200
Sire was in the middle of his treatments

938
01:00:01,224 --> 01:00:03,577
when we had a breakthrough with Batch 92.

939
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,454
Perhaps then we should
resume tomorrow, yes?

940
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,480
"We shall resume tomorrow," no!

941
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:08,898
P13!

942
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:13,194
There you are.

943
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:24,247
Hello.

944
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:36,342
How did you know

945
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:40,430
about the microseminoproteins, P13?

946
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:06,205
What happened in there?

947
01:01:07,123 --> 01:01:08,124
Why?

948
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:11,461
How did you know, P13?

949
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:13,605
Uh, it was too little filtration...

950
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:16,317
In the hypotonic, yes,
we know, we fixed that.

951
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:17,967
But how did you know?

952
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,012
I made you!

953
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,348
How did you know?

954
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:28,644
Because it worked.

955
01:01:35,735 --> 01:01:37,070
It... It worked.

956
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,908
Their rage is gone.

957
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:45,596
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought,

958
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,289
ready to inhabit the new world.

959
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:52,978
We're going to the new world?

960
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:56,464
We?

961
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:00,259
Look at you.

962
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:01,803
As if you were

963
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:04,597
cobbled together
by fat-fingered children.

964
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,600
How could you be part
of a perfect species?

965
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:11,813
You're simply a medley of
mistakes we could learn from

966
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:14,701
and apply to the creatures
that truly mattered.

967
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:21,155
Batch 89 was never meant
for the new world, P13.

968
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:24,117
You could figure out the complex workings

969
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,702
of cytoplasmic filtration systems,

970
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,799
but you couldn't figure out that?

971
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:34,293
But that brain.

972
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,672
That, I'd like to study further.

973
01:02:42,218 --> 01:02:45,513
Prep it for surgery
and removal in the morning.

974
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:48,874
What about the rest of Batch 89, sire?

975
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,646
Incinerate them.

976
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:04,073
He's dying.
We need that passkey.

977
01:03:04,157 --> 01:03:06,284
We don't have long.

978
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:09,078
We've arrived.

979
01:03:17,712 --> 01:03:19,046
We care a lot

980
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:25,746
That looks just like...

981
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:27,972
home.

982
01:03:34,812 --> 01:03:36,314
We care a lot

983
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:39,859
About disasters, fires
Floods and killer bees

984
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:42,403
It's like a replica of Earth.

985
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:43,863
It makes no sense.

986
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:47,056
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity's Xandar minus one.

987
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:49,285
We care a lot

988
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:53,539
About disease, baby, rock
Hudson, rock, yeah!

989
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:04,342
Oh, it's a dirty job
But someone's gotta do it

990
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:12,600
Oh, it's a dirty job
But someone's gotta do it

991
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,143
We care a lot

992
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:22,485
We care a lot

993
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,202
We care a lot

994
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:34,497
About the gamblers
And the pushers and the geeks

995
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,623
We care a lot

996
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:39,121
About the smack and crack
And whack that hits the streets

997
01:04:39,669 --> 01:04:40,711
Hello.

998
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:43,172
We mean you no harm.

999
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:55,702
Listen to me, he was just trying

1000
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,373
to throw her back her ball.

1001
01:04:59,981 --> 01:05:01,691
- Hey!
- Ow, ow.

1002
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:03,859
Come on! There's no reason...

1003
01:05:04,569 --> 01:05:06,404
Hey, hey.

1004
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:08,322
Groot, full Kaiju!

1005
01:05:08,406 --> 01:05:10,825
- Not full Kaiju!
- I am

1006
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:12,285
- Groot!
- Back up.

1007
01:05:12,368 --> 01:05:13,744
No, not Kaiju!

1008
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:15,162
Groot, down!

1009
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:17,137
There's no reason to be afraid.

1010
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:20,835
Get down, Groot!

1011
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:23,021
Everybody, it's okay.
It's okay.

1012
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,171
Hey. Hey, hi.

1013
01:05:24,255 --> 01:05:25,902
We're not here to harm you.

1014
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:27,842
Okay.

1015
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:29,802
See? Here.

1016
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:32,179
For your knee.

1017
01:05:34,557 --> 01:05:36,509
We just need to save our friend.

1018
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:43,190
Filthy.
It doesn't belong here.

1019
01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:47,542
I will train it in the ways
of the Sovereign.

1020
01:05:50,156 --> 01:05:51,508
I will train him not to do that.

1021
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:54,215
It's an act of blasphemy
even having it here.

1022
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,287
Kill it. Now.

1023
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:58,338
I am the Warlock, Mum,

1024
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:00,833
and I am done with being ordered around.

1025
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:03,377
Gamora is here.

1026
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,256
Which means the squirrel is also.

1027
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,400
To save ourselves,

1028
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:09,735
we must bring it to the High Evolutionary

1029
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:11,719
before his own people do.

1030
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:37,119
Yeah, yeah, sit.

1031
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:38,871
Let's sit. Okay.

1032
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:49,799
I am Groot.

1033
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:51,818
It's not rude.
It's what it's here for.

1034
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:53,260
Drax, sit up!

1035
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:54,345
Idiot.

1036
01:06:55,971 --> 01:06:57,473
Thank you.

1037
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:03,020
Thank you.

1038
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,565
Our friend...

1039
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:09,235
He's dying.

1040
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:18,327
We love our friend.

1041
01:07:19,954 --> 01:07:21,247
But he is dying.

1042
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,561
That's not dying, that's already dead.

1043
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:28,105
They'll think he's already dead.

1044
01:07:28,129 --> 01:07:30,190
They'll think we're here
on a quest for revenge.

1045
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:31,966
Drax, sit up.

1046
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:33,193
That's what it's here for!

1047
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:34,385
Drax, it isn't.

1048
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:36,154
It's made for people
to sit shoulder to shoulder

1049
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,239
right next to each other.

1050
01:07:37,263 --> 01:07:38,323
Get your boots off her pillows.

1051
01:07:38,347 --> 01:07:39,533
I find it hard to believe

1052
01:07:39,557 --> 01:07:40,951
it doesn't have multiple purposes!

1053
01:07:40,975 --> 01:07:43,561
I'm sorry.
My friend is a dumbass.

1054
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:46,373
That's the same as your dying.

1055
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:48,166
Why do you criticize everything?

1056
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,584
Well, why is it oblong then?

1057
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:51,044
It was a totally different sound.

1058
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:53,404
No, it wasn't. Dying.
Dumbass.

1059
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,632
- See? It's the same.
- All right, guys!

1060
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:58,051
Can I proceed, please,
to try to save our friend?

1061
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,535
Drax, I see you!

1062
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:02,616
I understand that none of this

1063
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:05,249
makes any sense to you right now.

1064
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,918
We need your help

1065
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:10,671
in finding a man.

1066
01:08:10,755 --> 01:08:12,965
Uh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna draw.

1067
01:08:13,048 --> 01:08:15,792
I'm gonna draw the man
that we're looking for.

1068
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,679
Like this.

1069
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:21,093
You see the thing on her head?

1070
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:24,561
- He has a thing like this.
- That is delightful. Mm.

1071
01:08:24,602 --> 01:08:26,061
There you go.

1072
01:08:26,896 --> 01:08:29,315
Have you seen this man?

1073
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:32,568
That's very good.

1074
01:08:32,651 --> 01:08:34,838
Can I have that later to hang
in my apartment, please?

1075
01:08:34,862 --> 01:08:36,614
Yeah. Thank you.

1076
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:38,157
Mowtio.

1077
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,051
His name...
His name is "Mowtio"?

1078
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:41,535
Eo, eo. Uh...

1079
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:55,508
Mowtios-ek lolo.

1080
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:00,638
- Many mowtios.
- Oh.

1081
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:01,889
- There?
- Oh.

1082
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:03,432
- At the pyramid.
- Oh.

1083
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:08,813
Is that your car in the driveway?

1084
01:09:09,688 --> 01:09:11,690
- Oh.
- Eo.

1085
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,779
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

1086
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:18,215
Watch him.
That's who they're coming for.

1087
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:19,490
- I wanna come.
- No.

1088
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:21,617
Mantis, watch Drax.

1089
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,018
Groot, you know what to do with these.

1090
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:33,379
- Push down on it.
- What?

1091
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:35,649
- Push it down.
- I am pushing down on it.

1092
01:09:35,673 --> 01:09:37,049
Push the button.

1093
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,152
It looks like you're pushing the keyhole.

1094
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,487
- The what?
- There's a button

1095
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:42,972
under the handle, press that in.

1096
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,016
Okay. Now what?

1097
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,560
Open the fucking door.

1098
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:51,730
That is a stupid design,

1099
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:54,650
and your instructions were very unclear.

1100
01:09:55,276 --> 01:09:57,837
Let's get that passkey
and save our friend.

1101
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:05,637
I was eight years old
when I left Earth, okay?

1102
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:06,721
Why would I know any more

1103
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:08,098
about driving one of
these things than you do?

1104
01:10:08,122 --> 01:10:09,933
- Don't see you volunteering.
- You want me to drive?

1105
01:10:09,957 --> 01:10:11,017
- No.
- I'll drive.

1106
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:13,298
I don't want you to drive.
I got this.

1107
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,534
Just a wild goose chase

1108
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:49,830
And my dreams Have all been denied

1109
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:54,585
Why have I always Been a failure

1110
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,755
What can the reason be

1111
01:10:57,838 --> 01:11:00,174
You must be a really loyal pet

1112
01:11:00,883 --> 01:11:03,761
if they're willing to do
all this for you.

1113
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:21,403
Chasing rainbows

1114
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:27,159
Watching clouds drifting by

1115
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:37,086
My schemes are just like All my dreams

1116
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:45,511
Ending in the sky

1117
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:50,891
Some fellows look And find the sunshine

1118
01:11:50,975 --> 01:11:54,853
I always look And find the rain

1119
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:59,024
And some fellows Make a winning sometime

1120
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:10,327
I'm always chasing rainbows

1121
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:14,873
This is the perfect society?

1122
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:36,603
Sire.

1123
01:12:36,687 --> 01:12:38,957
This one has been running for two hours

1124
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:40,506
without breaking a sweat.

1125
01:12:40,566 --> 01:12:42,335
- It's incredible...
- They can survive

1126
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,652
on 30 calories a day,

1127
01:12:43,736 --> 01:12:46,655
an hour's sleep a week,
they're always happy,

1128
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:48,883
and they can rewire a carbenetrix core

1129
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:50,826
in under two minutes.

1130
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:53,912
But will she be ready for the new colony?

1131
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:56,498
Sire, they're here.

1132
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,256
Here we go.

1133
01:13:12,306 --> 01:13:13,450
We're here to see...

1134
01:13:13,474 --> 01:13:16,060
The High Evolutionary is expecting you.

1135
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:17,370
Which means it is a trap.

1136
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:18,520
It's a face-off.

1137
01:13:18,604 --> 01:13:20,105
She stays here.

1138
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:22,191
- Why?
- Policy against weaponry,

1139
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:23,692
and your arm is a gun.

1140
01:13:28,781 --> 01:13:30,491
- He's clean.
- Let's go.

1141
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:32,117
Hey.

1142
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:34,703
It'll be okay.

1143
01:13:55,891 --> 01:13:56,934
Move it!

1144
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:17,538
Are you okay, Rocket?

1145
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:37,182
Me Rocket play now?

1146
01:14:37,266 --> 01:14:38,791
I can't right now, Floor.

1147
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:47,168
What are you doing?

1148
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:48,961
They ain't gonna set us free.

1149
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:50,953
Yes, they are, Rocket.

1150
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:53,488
We're going to the new world any day now.

1151
01:14:56,535 --> 01:14:57,938
No, that can't be true.

1152
01:14:57,995 --> 01:14:58,996
It is.

1153
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:01,641
They wanna kill us all in the morning.

1154
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:03,208
- What?
- What?

1155
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:05,377
But I'm gonna fix it.

1156
01:15:11,216 --> 01:15:12,426
What is that?

1157
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:13,927
It's a key.

1158
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:17,239
I'm gonna use it
to get us all out of here.

1159
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:19,951
I don't know if that's wise, Rocket.

1160
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:22,227
- Mm.
- Me Rocket leave!

1161
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:24,688
Hooray time forever!

1162
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:28,358
Just down that hall, there are ships.

1163
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:31,653
I know.
And if we can get to one,

1164
01:15:31,737 --> 01:15:33,113
I can pilot it.

1165
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:37,035
And then we'll all fly away
together, the four of us,

1166
01:15:37,618 --> 01:15:39,509
just like we always said, okay?

1167
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,081
Okay?

1168
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:51,131
Whoo-hoo! Yippee!
Rocket! Sky, sky, sky!

1169
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:15,864
- You did it!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1170
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:16,990
You did it!

1171
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:19,209
You did it, you did it, you did it!

1172
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:41,098
You did it!

1173
01:16:41,682 --> 01:16:43,392
You did it.

1174
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:46,893
It really is good to have...

1175
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:06,790
Yes, I imagined
you'd do something like this.

1176
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,459
Back in the cage, P13.

1177
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:17,009
Sky.

1178
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:32,816
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1179
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:34,607
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1180
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:36,528
Q12 and P13

1181
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:38,631
- escaped from their pens.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1182
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:40,550
- Q12 is neutralized...
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1183
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:42,677
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
- ...but P13 is still out,

1184
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:45,013
- so I'll need assistance.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1185
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:47,890
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1186
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:49,958
Remember not to bruise its brain.

1187
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:52,210
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1188
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:54,002
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1189
01:17:57,299 --> 01:17:59,301
All right, P13!

1190
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:02,372
You win the crying contest.
Now, back in the cage.

1191
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:08,119
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
- Rocket, let's go!

1192
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:10,145
Let's go! Rocket, please!

1193
01:18:10,562 --> 01:18:12,731
Rocket! Rocket!

1194
01:18:15,108 --> 01:18:16,735
Down here. Hurry.

1195
01:19:14,835 --> 01:19:16,062
- Hey, there it is!
- Get him!

1196
01:19:16,086 --> 01:19:17,754
- Get back here!
- Get it!

1197
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:19,005
He's getting away!

1198
01:20:03,592 --> 01:20:04,652
What are you doing?

1199
01:20:04,676 --> 01:20:06,237
I got a bad feeling about this.

1200
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:08,197
Peter just told you to stay here.

1201
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:09,407
Yeah, well, that's his fault.

1202
01:20:09,431 --> 01:20:10,950
He should know by now that I never do

1203
01:20:10,974 --> 01:20:12,743
anything that anyone ever tells me.

1204
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,519
We need to protect Rocket.

1205
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:16,146
Yeah, that's right.

1206
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:19,524
So, hop on and we'll ride
back to the ship.

1207
01:20:19,608 --> 01:20:21,276
Just right over there?

1208
01:20:21,902 --> 01:20:22,903
Yeah.

1209
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:36,416
Drax! Hey! Stop being a jerk!

1210
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:46,551
You!

1211
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,345
Hey, yeah, you!

1212
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:51,115
I take it the passkey,

1213
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:53,091
it's in that thing on your head.

1214
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:55,340
I would advise against aggression.

1215
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:57,562
Oh. Got time for me now?

1216
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:01,233
Your friend once took advantage.

1217
01:21:01,816 --> 01:21:03,151
I learn my lessons.

1218
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:07,322
I aim some small part
of my mental capacity

1219
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,199
back in my own direction,

1220
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:12,369
and now, gravity itself serves my whims.

1221
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:14,955
War Pig.

1222
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:16,164
Now.

1223
01:21:19,626 --> 01:21:21,883
You must find Counter-Earth familiar.

1224
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,004
Counter-Earth?

1225
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:25,274
I visited your planet many years ago.

1226
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,109
Earth hasn't been my planet
in a long time.

1227
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:28,260
Your people had

1228
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:30,971
- wonderful spirit.
- Mm.

1229
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:32,907
The art and music and literature

1230
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:35,371
were some of the finest in the universe.

1231
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:38,270
Earth would be a fabulous place,

1232
01:21:38,353 --> 01:21:40,748
were it not for
the ignorance and bigotry.

1233
01:21:40,772 --> 01:21:42,857
- Okay.
- It inspired me to create

1234
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,585
- Counter-Earth.
- I don't care.

1235
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:46,254
All of the good and none of the bad.

1236
01:21:46,278 --> 01:21:49,382
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob

1237
01:21:49,406 --> 01:21:50,800
whose mother didn't love him

1238
01:21:50,824 --> 01:21:53,386
rationalizing why he needs
to conquer the universe.

1239
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:56,246
I'm not trying to conquer the universe.

1240
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:58,011
I'm perfecting it.

1241
01:22:03,086 --> 01:22:05,505
What the...

1242
01:22:24,858 --> 01:22:25,859
Hey!

1243
01:22:26,276 --> 01:22:27,819
Drop the badger.

1244
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:35,994
- I just want the passkey.
- Then bring me 89P13.

1245
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:37,454
I am Groot.

1246
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:39,956
He says, "Suck my..."

1247
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,321
Why are you so angry?

1248
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,853
Because I know
what you did to our friend.

1249
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:45,021
Anything I've done,

1250
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:47,189
I've done for the betterment
of the universe.

1251
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,632
Newsflash, Einstein.

1252
01:22:48,715 --> 01:22:50,192
Better universes generally don't include

1253
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:51,861
a bunch of octopuses selling meth

1254
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:53,654
to guys with cockroach heads.

1255
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:56,014
They do not.

1256
01:22:58,475 --> 01:22:59,476
Which is why,

1257
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:01,853
as I have done many times before,

1258
01:23:02,312 --> 01:23:04,264
I'm going to have to raze it all

1259
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:05,940
and start again.

1260
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:07,150
What?

1261
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:17,577
I got 89P13,

1262
01:23:17,661 --> 01:23:19,245
and I'm on my way.

1263
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:21,464
We're in possession of the subject.

1264
01:23:47,357 --> 01:23:48,650
Oh, my God.

1265
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:00,453
I am Groot?

1266
01:24:00,537 --> 01:24:01,621
Kill 'em all.

1267
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:06,543
Stay.

1268
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,129
Uh-uh. I said "stay."

1269
01:24:10,422 --> 01:24:11,941
What, did you want me to leave you back,

1270
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:13,401
so that Mother could fillet you?

1271
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:15,510
Stay.

1272
01:24:15,593 --> 01:24:16,594
What the hell?

1273
01:24:16,678 --> 01:24:18,930
We're working for the same boss.

1274
01:24:19,013 --> 01:24:21,099
Yes, but I need the credit, chum,

1275
01:24:21,182 --> 01:24:23,184
to save my entire civilization.

1276
01:24:24,144 --> 01:24:27,313
So be a good creepy... thing

1277
01:24:27,397 --> 01:24:28,982
and back off.

1278
01:24:37,866 --> 01:24:38,908
No.

1279
01:25:19,491 --> 01:25:20,617
Mother.

1280
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:46,518
Mother!

1281
01:25:51,523 --> 01:25:53,048
Mantis and Drax, come in.

1282
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:55,109
Mantis? Drax?

1283
01:25:55,193 --> 01:25:56,861
Uh, hey.

1284
01:25:56,945 --> 01:25:59,256
I need you to bring the ship here now!

1285
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,866
Well, we can't do that exactly because...

1286
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:03,719
we're not at the ship.

1287
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:05,329
Then where the hell are...

1288
01:26:33,648 --> 01:26:34,649
Nebula, come in.

1289
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:36,693
Gamora! Take off now!

1290
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:39,155
Get yourself and Rocket off the planet.

1291
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:45,748
What kinda ship is this?

1292
01:26:47,954 --> 01:26:50,582
It's amusing, really.

1293
01:26:50,665 --> 01:26:52,129
How stupid are you, hmm?

1294
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:53,918
It was so obviously a trap.

1295
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:56,963
It's not a trap.
It's a face-off.

1296
01:26:57,547 --> 01:26:59,215
Now kill them all.

1297
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:02,463
What do you have in your hand?

1298
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:07,015
Grenade!

1299
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:48,431
I am Groot!

1300
01:28:20,505 --> 01:28:21,547
No! Don't!

1301
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:25,009
Don't! No, no, no! No, please!
Please, spare me!

1302
01:28:25,093 --> 01:28:26,928
Please, spare me, please.

1303
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:33,393
Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

1304
01:28:33,643 --> 01:28:35,520
- That'd be premature.
- Huh?

1305
01:28:35,937 --> 01:28:37,438
No, no, no...

1306
01:28:48,408 --> 01:28:50,201
Quite a novel escape plan,

1307
01:28:50,284 --> 01:28:52,845
jumping headfirst
into an exploding planet.

1308
01:28:57,834 --> 01:28:59,502
You'll kill us both!

1309
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:01,045
Not both.

1310
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:18,330
Why are we doing this?

1311
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:19,581
Quill and Groot are inside.

1312
01:29:19,605 --> 01:29:21,315
We have to get them out.

1313
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,220
Groot.

1314
01:30:07,528 --> 01:30:09,548
Whoever's in the cockpit,
activate the brake.

1315
01:30:09,572 --> 01:30:11,467
The steering mechanism is stuck.

1316
01:30:11,491 --> 01:30:13,117
Well, pull harder!

1317
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:20,041
Let's go. Come on.

1318
01:30:39,811 --> 01:30:42,063
It's hard to breathe.

1319
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:51,906
We are entering space.

1320
01:31:16,889 --> 01:31:17,974
Joob joob?

1321
01:31:18,266 --> 01:31:19,642
Oh, piss off.

1322
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:31,487
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1323
01:31:31,988 --> 01:31:34,610
- Where are Mantis and Drax?
- I don't know!

1324
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:39,620
- Gimme.
- Here.

1325
01:31:41,372 --> 01:31:43,040
Ha! You're lucky I was able

1326
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:44,643
- to knock down that door...
- Rocket and Gamora

1327
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,680
are probably dead because of you!

1328
01:31:46,794 --> 01:31:48,522
- I didn't know.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1329
01:31:48,546 --> 01:31:50,482
When are you gonna stop using the excuse

1330
01:31:50,506 --> 01:31:53,318
of being some big dumb clown
for contributing nothing,

1331
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:55,529
and the rest of us having
to carry your slack!

1332
01:31:55,553 --> 01:31:56,888
Don't push him!

1333
01:31:56,971 --> 01:31:58,323
You don't have the right to push him.

1334
01:31:58,347 --> 01:32:00,141
And you! You're no better.

1335
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:02,077
The only thing we can count on you for

1336
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:03,495
is when someone shows weakness,

1337
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:05,038
you'll be right there to support it.

1338
01:32:05,062 --> 01:32:06,480
Fine, I don't care.

1339
01:32:06,564 --> 01:32:08,834
I know you need to find fault
in everyone else

1340
01:32:08,858 --> 01:32:10,502
to make yourself feel okay,

1341
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:13,087
- so find it in me.
- Oh, go to hell, Mant!

1342
01:32:13,154 --> 01:32:15,424
But you don't have the right to push him!

1343
01:32:15,448 --> 01:32:17,617
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1344
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,845
- He's a liability.
- He makes us laugh

1345
01:32:19,869 --> 01:32:22,747
and he loves us.
How is that a liability?

1346
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:25,684
All you care about is intelligence and...

1347
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:27,001
and competence.

1348
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:29,188
Not sure I appreciate this defense.

1349
01:32:29,212 --> 01:32:30,546
He has sadness,

1350
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:33,862
but he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1351
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:35,857
So I don't care if he's stupid.

1352
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:38,095
You think I'm stupid?

1353
01:32:39,305 --> 01:32:40,473
Yes.

1354
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,061
Forget.

1355
01:32:47,313 --> 01:32:49,917
Ha! You're lucky I was able
to knock down that door

1356
01:32:49,941 --> 01:32:51,649
with my incredible strength.

1357
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:53,694
Quill?

1358
01:32:53,778 --> 01:32:55,696
Quill? Quill, are you there?

1359
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:58,574
Joob joob...

1360
01:32:59,867 --> 01:33:02,245
That language isn't in my translator.

1361
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,049
Okay. Here we go.

1362
01:33:36,487 --> 01:33:37,951
Okay. All right, Rocket.

1363
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:39,740
Go.

1364
01:33:57,174 --> 01:33:59,593
Lylla?

1365
01:34:01,095 --> 01:34:02,388
Friend.

1366
01:34:05,433 --> 01:34:07,059
Okay, okay.

1367
01:34:07,143 --> 01:34:08,180
Okay, here we go.

1368
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:13,018
This isn't right.

1369
01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:16,378
No, no, no, it's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1370
01:34:16,402 --> 01:34:17,744
It needs to be faster.

1371
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:23,159
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1372
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:26,162
Rocket.

1373
01:34:26,245 --> 01:34:27,580
I let you down.

1374
01:34:28,456 --> 01:34:29,915
I got you killed.

1375
01:34:29,999 --> 01:34:32,084
I got everybody killed.

1376
01:34:32,585 --> 01:34:33,961
We were right.

1377
01:34:34,587 --> 01:34:38,257
The sky is beautiful, and it is forever.

1378
01:34:38,841 --> 01:34:41,677
And I've been flying with our friends.

1379
01:34:55,191 --> 01:34:56,359
Can I come?

1380
01:34:56,901 --> 01:34:58,110
Yes.

1381
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:08,704
No, no, no!

1382
01:35:09,163 --> 01:35:10,164
No!

1383
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:11,374
Come on.

1384
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:13,626
- Come on!
- Quill.

1385
01:35:16,545 --> 01:35:18,047
No!

1386
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:20,424
No!

1387
01:35:22,635 --> 01:35:23,677
- Quill.
- No!

1388
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,114
- Quill.
- I'm not gonna lose him.

1389
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:27,264
He's gone.

1390
01:35:27,348 --> 01:35:30,017
I'm not letting him go!

1391
01:35:32,436 --> 01:35:33,437
Come on.

1392
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:47,535
But not yet.

1393
01:35:48,661 --> 01:35:50,491
You still have a purpose here.

1394
01:35:50,538 --> 01:35:52,998
A purpose for what?

1395
01:35:53,499 --> 01:35:55,042
They made us for nothing.

1396
01:35:55,126 --> 01:35:57,711
Stupid experiments to be thrown away.

1397
01:35:58,879 --> 01:36:00,923
There are the hands that made us,

1398
01:36:01,006 --> 01:36:03,994
and then there are the hands
that guide the hands.

1399
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:13,352
My beloved raccoon.

1400
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:16,540
This story has been yours all along,

1401
01:36:16,564 --> 01:36:18,028
you just didn't know it.

1402
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:24,071
I'm not a raccoon.

1403
01:36:30,828 --> 01:36:32,536
The passkey's going through!

1404
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:50,806
Quill?

1405
01:37:10,201 --> 01:37:11,577
Where's Nebula?

1406
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:19,043
Sh... She's, uh...

1407
01:37:20,044 --> 01:37:22,605
Because her code
is on the comm behind you.

1408
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:29,053
What? Nebula?

1409
01:37:29,136 --> 01:37:31,088
- Where are you?
- Oh, thank God!

1410
01:37:31,138 --> 01:37:32,532
We're here to get you out of here.

1411
01:37:32,556 --> 01:37:34,201
- Out of where?
- The High Evolutionary's ship.

1412
01:37:34,225 --> 01:37:35,768
No, I got off the ship.

1413
01:37:35,851 --> 01:37:37,287
- You what?
- Wait, where are you?

1414
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:38,395
On the ship!

1415
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:39,956
- On the ship?
- I didn't lie.

1416
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,374
Why are you on the ship?

1417
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:42,709
To save you, obviously.

1418
01:37:42,733 --> 01:37:43,919
No, I told you to go back.

1419
01:37:43,943 --> 01:37:45,587
You gotta know by now I always figure out

1420
01:37:45,611 --> 01:37:47,506
an incredibly clever way
to get out of a fix.

1421
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:49,360
- Tell him I said hi.
- Really?

1422
01:37:49,406 --> 01:37:51,134
Tell him we're coming to save him.

1423
01:37:51,158 --> 01:37:53,094
Pay attention or play with the kids.

1424
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,203
One or the other.

1425
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:55,567
"Play with the kids"?

1426
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:57,974
- How did you get out?
- That's not really important.

1427
01:37:57,998 --> 01:37:59,333
I am Groot.

1428
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:01,937
Jumping a thousand feet to
your death without a parachute

1429
01:38:01,961 --> 01:38:03,003
is a clever way

1430
01:38:03,087 --> 01:38:04,922
of getting out of a fix?

1431
01:38:05,005 --> 01:38:07,359
You're all just makin' up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1432
01:38:07,383 --> 01:38:08,568
The important thing is

1433
01:38:08,592 --> 01:38:10,135
we're all okay.

1434
01:38:13,389 --> 01:38:14,390
Rocket?

1435
01:38:15,474 --> 01:38:16,976
Yeah, he's here.

1436
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:18,143
And he's okay.

1437
01:38:24,441 --> 01:38:28,529
Rocket, we love you very much,
and we're happy you're alive.

1438
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:30,674
Well, that makes you the idiots then.

1439
01:38:30,698 --> 01:38:32,040
He's right about that.

1440
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,494
Back in your cages!

1441
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:40,874
Nebula?

1442
01:38:42,126 --> 01:38:43,502
Nebula, come in!

1443
01:38:48,966 --> 01:38:51,927
So, you'd like to joust, would you?

1444
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:56,515
Go to hell, you sick son of a bitch.

1445
01:38:56,599 --> 01:38:58,201
You killed all of those people.

1446
01:38:58,225 --> 01:39:00,060
As I will your friends.

1447
01:39:00,644 --> 01:39:02,771
I'm sending you the coordinates.

1448
01:39:02,855 --> 01:39:05,441
They will die unless you bring me

1449
01:39:05,524 --> 01:39:06,609
what is mine!

1450
01:39:06,692 --> 01:39:10,696
Screw you, you stretch-faced,
RoboCop-looking,

1451
01:39:10,779 --> 01:39:12,239
Skeletor wannabe,

1452
01:39:12,323 --> 01:39:14,325
purple-nurple piece of...

1453
01:39:17,494 --> 01:39:18,579
He hung up.

1454
01:39:21,415 --> 01:39:22,499
You think?

1455
01:39:25,794 --> 01:39:27,421
1966.

1456
01:39:27,504 --> 01:39:30,090
The Soviet put me on a rocket,

1457
01:39:30,174 --> 01:39:33,284
knowing full well I'm never
to return and I will die

1458
01:39:33,344 --> 01:39:35,179
in a fiery ball of death.

1459
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:38,432
But one thing even mudak Soviets never do

1460
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:40,768
is call me bad dog.

1461
01:39:40,851 --> 01:39:43,270
Oh, my God!
Could you just let it go?

1462
01:39:43,354 --> 01:39:45,981
Kraglin, please, just take it back.

1463
01:39:46,065 --> 01:39:47,399
This is killing us.

1464
01:39:47,483 --> 01:39:50,319
I can't take it back if she is, in fact,

1465
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:52,446
a bad dog.

1466
01:39:52,529 --> 01:39:53,530
Kraglin!

1467
01:39:53,614 --> 01:39:55,699
Oh, it never stops hurting.

1468
01:39:55,783 --> 01:39:56,992
Kraglin.

1469
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:58,827
Oh, hey, Pete.

1470
01:39:58,911 --> 01:40:00,972
We need to save Nebula, Mantis, and Drax,

1471
01:40:00,996 --> 01:40:02,623
and we need your help.

1472
01:40:02,706 --> 01:40:03,832
Me?

1473
01:40:07,294 --> 01:40:09,230
You're the one who lost it, you twit.

1474
01:40:09,254 --> 01:40:11,382
The Hellspawn had it, sire, but...

1475
01:40:11,465 --> 01:40:13,842
But, but, but! But!

1476
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:17,513
That rancid word.

1477
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:22,911
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser

1478
01:40:22,935 --> 01:40:24,454
to go directly to the new colony

1479
01:40:24,478 --> 01:40:26,498
and not engage in unnecessary conflict.

1480
01:40:26,522 --> 01:40:30,317
They can rewire a carbenetrix
core in under two minutes,

1481
01:40:30,401 --> 01:40:31,743
but what is that, Vim?

1482
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:33,672
Rote memorization.

1483
01:40:33,696 --> 01:40:35,447
Rote memorization!

1484
01:40:36,407 --> 01:40:38,385
In hundreds of years of our creations,

1485
01:40:38,409 --> 01:40:41,578
only one has known true invention.

1486
01:40:41,662 --> 01:40:42,663
One.

1487
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:49,378
Putrid in every other way,
but 89P13 had that.

1488
01:40:52,256 --> 01:40:53,298
Yes, sire.

1489
01:40:54,299 --> 01:40:58,554
A populace unable to think
what hasn't yet been thought

1490
01:40:58,637 --> 01:41:00,264
will die on the vine.

1491
01:41:00,347 --> 01:41:03,726
We need 89P13's brain,

1492
01:41:03,809 --> 01:41:07,312
so we can transfer that trait
into these creatures

1493
01:41:07,396 --> 01:41:09,398
before we go to the new colony.

1494
01:41:09,481 --> 01:41:11,525
Nothing else matters.

1495
01:41:31,587 --> 01:41:33,106
How did they get down here?

1496
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:34,339
Joob joob.

1497
01:41:36,008 --> 01:41:38,691
Peter will be trying
to get to the spaceport.

1498
01:41:38,886 --> 01:41:40,864
He doesn't know about the children.

1499
01:41:40,888 --> 01:41:42,181
You!

1500
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:45,785
We need you to let all the
other children on board know

1501
01:41:45,809 --> 01:41:48,127
to stay away from the starboard walls.

1502
01:41:49,062 --> 01:41:50,272
Joob joob?

1503
01:41:50,355 --> 01:41:51,499
They know three frickin' words

1504
01:41:51,523 --> 01:41:53,170
and two of them are "joob."

1505
01:41:53,442 --> 01:41:56,153
- Joob joob.
- No! Listen to me!

1506
01:41:56,862 --> 01:41:59,241
You need to talk to the other children,

1507
01:41:59,323 --> 01:42:01,992
all of them here, and tell them

1508
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:04,088
to stay away from the freaking...

1509
01:42:04,161 --> 01:42:05,847
What the hell are you doing, Mantis?

1510
01:42:05,871 --> 01:42:08,457
Explaining it, dickhead!

1511
01:42:13,212 --> 01:42:14,546
Joob joob eo!

1512
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:18,175
Joob joob eo!

1513
01:42:19,468 --> 01:42:20,886
You're scaring them.

1514
01:42:26,934 --> 01:42:28,310
Hello, dumb idiots.

1515
01:42:32,856 --> 01:42:34,625
I had a little girl like you.

1516
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,791
You know what she used to like?

1517
01:42:37,027 --> 01:42:39,223
She liked when I made monkey noises.

1518
01:42:42,241 --> 01:42:43,700
Beep.

1519
01:42:43,784 --> 01:42:45,327
Beep, beep. Beep.

1520
01:42:49,706 --> 01:42:51,041
How is that a monkey?

1521
01:42:52,084 --> 01:42:53,210
Beats me.

1522
01:43:03,136 --> 01:43:04,680
Boop.

1523
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:08,851
Boop.

1524
01:43:08,934 --> 01:43:11,144
Boop.

1525
01:43:26,785 --> 01:43:28,161
Eo, eo. Joob joob.

1526
01:43:28,245 --> 01:43:29,538
- Joob joob.
- Yeah.

1527
01:43:29,621 --> 01:43:31,039
Joob joob.

1528
01:43:31,123 --> 01:43:32,165
Yeah. Joob joob.

1529
01:43:32,249 --> 01:43:34,668
Joob joob.

1530
01:43:34,751 --> 01:43:35,895
They're gonna tell the other kids

1531
01:43:35,919 --> 01:43:37,188
to stay away from the starboard wall.

1532
01:43:37,212 --> 01:43:38,273
Why didn't you tell us

1533
01:43:38,297 --> 01:43:40,441
you knew their language this whole time?

1534
01:43:40,465 --> 01:43:41,925
Why didn't you ask?

1535
01:43:43,969 --> 01:43:47,931
This could be futile,
Quill. He's too powerful.

1536
01:43:48,015 --> 01:43:49,909
Well, then I guess we'll die trying.

1537
01:43:49,933 --> 01:43:52,519
What is "dying trying" gonna accomplish?

1538
01:43:52,603 --> 01:43:54,247
Or we can just give him the badger?

1539
01:43:54,271 --> 01:43:56,773
Our thing is dying trying.

1540
01:43:56,857 --> 01:43:57,941
I am Groot.

1541
01:43:58,191 --> 01:43:59,838
I know who you are already!

1542
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:02,589
Feel free to stay behind
in the cargo area.

1543
01:44:02,613 --> 01:44:05,574
I'm not leaving my sister
with that jackass.

1544
01:44:05,657 --> 01:44:06,950
This you?

1545
01:44:07,034 --> 01:44:08,660
Fell out of your bag.

1546
01:44:10,829 --> 01:44:11,997
Let's do this.

1547
01:44:38,899 --> 01:44:40,835
Well, you didn't wake up This morning

1548
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:42,506
'Cause you didn't go to bed

1549
01:44:42,569 --> 01:44:45,781
You were watching the whites
Of your eyes turn red

1550
01:44:46,406 --> 01:44:48,867
The calendar on your wall

1551
01:44:48,951 --> 01:44:50,285
Wait.

1552
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:53,080
Wait.

1553
01:44:53,163 --> 01:44:55,916
Reading some old letters

1554
01:44:55,999 --> 01:44:57,000
You smile...

1555
01:44:57,876 --> 01:45:01,421
You almost have to admire their pluck.

1556
01:45:01,505 --> 01:45:03,548
Sire.

1557
01:45:09,846 --> 01:45:12,599
Across the clear blue sky

1558
01:45:14,518 --> 01:45:16,520
Howdy there, you freakin' creep.

1559
01:45:16,603 --> 01:45:19,564
Your life will surely change

1560
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:22,901
- Back up!
- Yes, sire.

1561
01:45:22,985 --> 01:45:25,070
When things fall into place

1562
01:45:25,362 --> 01:45:26,697
You're on, Steemie.

1563
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:28,490
First barrel.

1564
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:30,593
This is the day
Your life will surely change

1565
01:45:30,617 --> 01:45:31,827
Second barrel.

1566
01:45:32,953 --> 01:45:34,246
Third barrel.

1567
01:45:34,329 --> 01:45:35,455
Fourth barrel.

1568
01:45:36,581 --> 01:45:38,500
When things fall into place

1569
01:45:41,294 --> 01:45:44,006
This is the day

1570
01:45:44,089 --> 01:45:45,716
Hard starboard.

1571
01:45:45,799 --> 01:45:46,842
Hard starboard.

1572
01:45:47,843 --> 01:45:50,053
This is the day

1573
01:45:50,137 --> 01:45:52,931
Your life will surely change

1574
01:45:53,015 --> 01:45:54,599
And fire!

1575
01:45:54,683 --> 01:45:56,059
This is the day

1576
01:46:03,066 --> 01:46:04,419
They've breached the spaceport.

1577
01:46:04,443 --> 01:46:06,945
One of them holds subject 89P13.

1578
01:46:07,029 --> 01:46:08,756
Release the Hellspawn.
All of them.

1579
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:10,508
Sire, the Hellspawn were created

1580
01:46:10,532 --> 01:46:11,718
solely to defend the new colony

1581
01:46:11,742 --> 01:46:13,160
Do it now!

1582
01:46:13,243 --> 01:46:14,911
Get me 89P13,

1583
01:46:14,995 --> 01:46:18,248
and kill everyone
in the head of that dead god.

1584
01:46:56,495 --> 01:46:58,205
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n,

1585
01:46:58,288 --> 01:46:59,974
but that old missile's all we had.

1586
01:46:59,998 --> 01:47:03,460
Rocket, Groot, go, go!
Get inside that spaceport.

1587
01:47:17,265 --> 01:47:18,475
What the hell?

1588
01:47:33,073 --> 01:47:34,950
Aw, come on!

1589
01:48:04,563 --> 01:48:06,940
Kraglin, we have been infiltrated.

1590
01:48:09,234 --> 01:48:10,569
Open the pit.

1591
01:48:10,652 --> 01:48:13,280
Sire, our bargaining power will be gone.

1592
01:48:38,471 --> 01:48:39,472
Abilisks!

1593
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:48,440
Good God!

1594
01:48:54,988 --> 01:48:56,072
This way!

1595
01:50:02,013 --> 01:50:04,116
One more step
and this weird thing gets it!

1596
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,767
Don't be rash.

1597
01:50:23,952 --> 01:50:25,513
What were you programming?

1598
01:50:25,537 --> 01:50:27,001
A self-destruction code.

1599
01:50:44,848 --> 01:50:46,057
What are you doing?

1600
01:50:49,352 --> 01:50:50,437
It's okay.

1601
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,688
Mantis, stop!

1602
01:50:54,065 --> 01:50:55,224
They eat batteries,

1603
01:50:55,442 --> 01:50:56,609
not people.

1604
01:50:58,111 --> 01:51:01,587
Maybe they're just scared of
what we are gonna do to them.

1605
01:51:08,455 --> 01:51:10,123
We're not gonna hurt you.

1606
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:15,211
Everything is going to be okay.

1607
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:12,185
Use your heart, boy.

1608
01:53:03,319 --> 01:53:04,696
A dog!

1609
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:05,947
Yeah.

1610
01:53:14,372 --> 01:53:16,332
She's a good dog.

1611
01:53:20,753 --> 01:53:22,964
I knew you believe I am good dog.

1612
01:53:23,047 --> 01:53:25,669
All right, all right,
get off me, you idiot!

1613
01:53:28,803 --> 01:53:31,532
Sire, we must retreat.
The ship is going down.

1614
01:53:31,556 --> 01:53:33,266
The spaceport has intruders.

1615
01:53:33,558 --> 01:53:36,311
Go! See if one of them
is 89P13.

1616
01:53:36,394 --> 01:53:38,581
Sire, you have an irrational
obsession with this animal.

1617
01:53:38,605 --> 01:53:40,082
You must stop, for God's sake!

1618
01:53:40,106 --> 01:53:41,816
There is no God!

1619
01:53:42,066 --> 01:53:44,152
That's why I stepped in!

1620
01:54:12,722 --> 01:54:17,143
Controller, I am taking
command of the Arête.

1621
01:54:17,227 --> 01:54:21,648
Disengage all damaged sectors
of the ship,

1622
01:54:22,023 --> 01:54:24,192
and retreat.

1623
01:54:49,133 --> 01:54:50,218
Attention,

1624
01:54:50,301 --> 01:54:51,636
all personnel.

1625
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:55,974
Intruders have boarded the ship.

1626
01:54:56,599 --> 01:54:59,060
Head to the starboard spaceport.

1627
01:55:01,563 --> 01:55:03,982
Get me 89P13,

1628
01:55:05,191 --> 01:55:06,651
and kill the rest.

1629
01:55:11,656 --> 01:55:12,657
No sleep till

1630
01:55:16,119 --> 01:55:17,763
We go in there, we get Mantis,

1631
01:55:17,787 --> 01:55:19,289
Nebula, and Drax.

1632
01:55:19,372 --> 01:55:21,916
We move in, we get 'em, and we get out.

1633
01:55:41,728 --> 01:55:43,104
Did that look cool?

1634
01:55:43,813 --> 01:55:45,565
Okay, new game plan.

1635
01:55:45,648 --> 01:55:47,600
We get the hell out of here now.

1636
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:49,461
There are thousands
of creatures on the ship.

1637
01:55:49,485 --> 01:55:50,754
Many of them are children.

1638
01:55:50,778 --> 01:55:52,464
And we need to be good joob joob.

1639
01:55:52,488 --> 01:55:54,991
- Huh?
- It means friends.

1640
01:55:55,908 --> 01:55:58,328
If we wanna live, we have to leave now.

1641
01:55:58,870 --> 01:56:01,265
This whole rig is gonna
go down any second.

1642
01:56:01,289 --> 01:56:03,729
They will all die if we don't help them.

1643
01:56:11,007 --> 01:56:12,800
I'm done runnin'.

1644
01:56:21,726 --> 01:56:24,270
Foot on the pedal Never ever false metal

1645
01:56:24,354 --> 01:56:26,749
Engine running hotter
Than a boiling kettle

1646
01:56:26,773 --> 01:56:29,359
My job ain't a job It's a damn good time

1647
01:56:29,442 --> 01:56:31,903
City to city I'm running my rhymes

1648
01:56:31,986 --> 01:56:34,243
On location Touring around the nation

1649
01:56:34,322 --> 01:56:36,658
Beastie Boys Always on vacation

1650
01:56:36,741 --> 01:56:39,160
Ain't no faking Your money I'm taking

1651
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:41,513
Going coast to coast
Watch all the girlies shaking

1652
01:56:41,537 --> 01:56:43,849
While you're at the job
Working nine-to-five

1653
01:56:43,873 --> 01:56:46,922
The Beastie Boys at the Garden
Cold kicking it live

1654
01:56:50,463 --> 01:56:51,673
No sleep till

1655
01:56:55,968 --> 01:56:58,697
Another plane, another train
Another bottle in the brain

1656
01:56:58,721 --> 01:57:01,575
Another girl, another fight
Another drive all night

1657
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:05,269
No sleep till Brooklyn

1658
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:10,191
No sleep till Brooklyn

1659
01:57:11,275 --> 01:57:13,736
Born and bred in Brooklyn, USA

1660
01:57:14,904 --> 01:57:16,215
They call me Adam Yauch But I'm MCA

1661
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:18,825
Like a lemon to a lime A lime to a lemon

1662
01:57:18,908 --> 01:57:21,411
I sip the def ale With all the fly women

1663
01:57:21,494 --> 01:57:23,663
Limos, arenas, and TV shows

1664
01:57:23,746 --> 01:57:26,249
Autographed pictures And classy hoes

1665
01:57:26,332 --> 01:57:28,668
Step off, Holmes Get out of my way!

1666
01:57:28,751 --> 01:57:31,008
Taxing little girlies From here to LA

1667
01:57:31,045 --> 01:57:33,339
Waking up Before I get to sleep

1668
01:57:33,423 --> 01:57:36,472
'Cause I'll be rocking
This party eight days a week

1669
01:57:40,138 --> 01:57:41,305
No sleep till

1670
01:57:46,102 --> 01:57:49,647
No sleep till Brooklyn

1671
01:57:50,857 --> 01:57:54,736
No sleep till Brooklyn

1672
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:59,615
No sleep till Brooklyn

1673
01:57:59,699 --> 01:58:00,908
Brooklyn

1674
01:58:00,992 --> 01:58:04,704
No sleep till Brooklyn

1675
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:29,437
No sleep till Brooklyn

1676
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,646
Brooklyn

1677
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:32,072
No sleep till Brooklyn

1678
01:58:34,442 --> 01:58:35,568
Brooklyn

1679
01:58:35,651 --> 01:58:39,155
No sleep till Brooklyn

1680
01:58:40,615 --> 01:58:43,951
No sleep till Brooklyn

1681
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:48,706
No sleep till Brooklyn

1682
01:59:16,108 --> 01:59:17,544
There's a big hole up in the deck.

1683
01:59:17,568 --> 01:59:18,879
If we can connect that to Knowhere,

1684
01:59:18,903 --> 01:59:20,756
we can lead the survivors to safety.

1685
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:22,549
Nebs and me will pilot the ship.

1686
01:59:22,573 --> 01:59:25,013
You guys save all the higher life forms.

1687
01:59:35,169 --> 01:59:36,170
Hello, moron.

1688
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:40,675
Come on!

1689
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:43,737
Follow me, come on! Come on!

1690
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:45,137
Domo!

1691
01:59:45,221 --> 01:59:46,472
Come on!

1692
01:59:47,181 --> 01:59:48,683
Go, go, go!

1693
01:59:48,766 --> 01:59:50,393
Domo! Domo!

1694
01:59:50,476 --> 01:59:51,602
I am Groot!

1695
02:00:08,578 --> 02:00:11,038
Um, this way to, uh...

1696
02:00:11,831 --> 02:00:12,915
Thank you.

1697
02:00:12,999 --> 02:00:15,585
Yes, you're welcome.
I was screaming

1698
02:00:15,668 --> 02:00:17,271
at something scary behind you, not you.

1699
02:00:17,295 --> 02:00:19,630
You look really cool.

1700
02:00:24,343 --> 02:00:25,404
Kill me if you want,

1701
02:00:25,428 --> 02:00:27,807
but then good luck gettin' out of here.

1702
02:00:31,017 --> 02:00:32,202
- Wait!
- Let him go, Flecktick...

1703
02:00:32,226 --> 02:00:33,287
it's our only chance.

1704
02:00:33,311 --> 02:00:34,621
I got a space big enough to get through.

1705
02:00:34,645 --> 02:00:35,998
I gotta find out if I can change it

1706
02:00:36,022 --> 02:00:37,481
to a permeable shield.

1707
02:00:43,863 --> 02:00:45,382
I can't fly this frickin' thing,

1708
02:00:45,406 --> 02:00:47,301
the flight controls are all screwed.

1709
02:00:47,325 --> 02:00:48,534
I'll do it.

1710
02:00:48,618 --> 02:00:51,240
Go help the others.
Wait, give me your comm.

1711
02:00:59,045 --> 02:01:01,714
Kraglin, I'll pilot from this side.

1712
02:01:02,715 --> 02:01:03,716
Kragula,

1713
02:01:03,799 --> 02:01:05,760
back in action!

1714
02:01:31,911 --> 02:01:33,472
Come on, come on, come on!

1715
02:01:33,496 --> 02:01:34,580
Go, go!

1716
02:01:34,664 --> 02:01:36,040
Go, go, go!

1717
02:01:37,458 --> 02:01:38,769
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!!

1718
02:01:38,793 --> 02:01:39,835
Stop, stop!

1719
02:01:39,919 --> 02:01:41,545
Are those kids?

1720
02:01:58,312 --> 02:01:59,898
Okay, Cosmo, stitch it up!

1721
02:01:59,939 --> 02:02:02,376
It needs to be airtight for
the kids to make it across.

1722
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,110
Locking up, Kapitan.

1723
02:02:13,077 --> 02:02:14,704
Go, now, go!

1724
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:21,210
One by one, one by one!

1725
02:02:21,293 --> 02:02:22,586
Okay.

1726
02:02:28,718 --> 02:02:30,970
Locking in and headed down.

1727
02:02:37,476 --> 02:02:39,311
This way. This way.

1728
02:02:42,732 --> 02:02:43,733
Why?

1729
02:02:45,818 --> 02:02:48,440
Why are you doing this?
I tried to kill you.

1730
02:02:48,988 --> 02:02:51,157
I am Groot.

1731
02:02:52,074 --> 02:02:53,159
He says,

1732
02:02:53,242 --> 02:02:55,377
"everyone deserves
a second chance."

1733
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:08,632
You are so strong.

1734
02:03:13,345 --> 02:03:15,598
Why are you so slow? Hurry!

1735
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:18,100
Where's Rocket?

1736
02:03:22,188 --> 02:03:24,315
Domo. Domo.

1737
02:03:25,066 --> 02:03:27,318
Domo. Domo.

1738
02:05:47,666 --> 02:05:49,335
You!

1739
02:05:50,044 --> 02:05:52,004
You thought you could escape me!

1740
02:05:52,546 --> 02:05:53,839
No!

1741
02:05:56,133 --> 02:05:58,302
You think you have some worth

1742
02:05:58,385 --> 02:06:00,030
in and of yourself, without me?

1743
02:06:00,054 --> 02:06:01,055
No!

1744
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:04,475
You are an abomination!

1745
02:06:04,558 --> 02:06:07,728
Nothing more than a step on my path,

1746
02:06:07,811 --> 02:06:10,314
you freakish little monster!

1747
02:06:10,397 --> 02:06:12,483
How dare you think you are more,

1748
02:06:13,525 --> 02:06:17,071
89P13?

1749
02:06:20,574 --> 02:06:21,784
The name's Rocket.

1750
02:06:22,701 --> 02:06:25,079
Rocket Raccoon.

1751
02:07:05,244 --> 02:07:06,370
His face came off!

1752
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:07,871
It's a mask.

1753
02:07:08,664 --> 02:07:12,126
Look what you did to me.

1754
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,461
For what?

1755
02:07:14,545 --> 02:07:16,630
All I wanted to do

1756
02:07:17,089 --> 02:07:18,757
was to make things

1757
02:07:19,425 --> 02:07:20,509
perfect.

1758
02:07:21,385 --> 02:07:23,642
You didn't wanna make things perfect.

1759
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:26,058
You just hated things the way they are.

1760
02:07:26,473 --> 02:07:27,558
Kill him.

1761
02:07:34,231 --> 02:07:35,232
Why?

1762
02:07:36,025 --> 02:07:38,986
Because I'm a freaking
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1763
02:07:40,195 --> 02:07:42,614
We have to get outta here now.

1764
02:07:42,698 --> 02:07:43,800
We have to save them.

1765
02:07:43,824 --> 02:07:44,968
We've got all the kids on board.

1766
02:07:44,992 --> 02:07:45,993
No, Pete.

1767
02:07:46,785 --> 02:07:48,412
The rest of them.

1768
02:07:54,209 --> 02:07:56,337
Come on!
Come on. Whoa!

1769
02:07:56,837 --> 02:07:57,921
Move!

1770
02:07:58,005 --> 02:07:59,465
Move it, bird!

1771
02:07:59,882 --> 02:08:01,258
- Whoa!
- Come on!

1772
02:08:04,803 --> 02:08:05,804
Come on!

1773
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:07,474
Come on, come on, come on!

1774
02:08:10,934 --> 02:08:12,203
Thought we were limiting ourselves

1775
02:08:12,227 --> 02:08:13,288
to the higher life forms?

1776
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:15,189
Yeah, well, me too.

1777
02:08:15,272 --> 02:08:17,524
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1778
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:24,656
Go, babies.

1779
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:25,991
Go, babies.

1780
02:08:26,075 --> 02:08:27,618
Go!

1781
02:08:27,701 --> 02:08:30,371
I cannot hold much...

1782
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:37,711
Run!

1783
02:08:37,795 --> 02:08:38,921
Go! Go!

1784
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:52,601
Quill! Hurry!

1785
02:09:35,686 --> 02:09:38,730
Peter!

1786
02:10:45,255 --> 02:10:46,423
Peter!

1787
02:10:52,429 --> 02:10:53,931
Did that

1788
02:10:54,014 --> 02:10:55,474
look

1789
02:10:56,183 --> 02:10:57,476
cool?

1790
02:11:00,646 --> 02:11:01,647
Come on.

1791
02:11:13,742 --> 02:11:16,828
Cosmo! I'm okay.

1792
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:56,159
I am Groot.

1793
02:11:56,827 --> 02:11:59,449
Thanks. Just tell them
I'm gonna be right...

1794
02:12:04,835 --> 02:12:06,211
I am Groot.

1795
02:12:08,088 --> 02:12:10,799
Yeah. It was good
working with you, too.

1796
02:12:18,599 --> 02:12:21,101
Hey, Gamora.
Are you ready?

1797
02:12:21,768 --> 02:12:22,894
Yeah.

1798
02:12:29,109 --> 02:12:31,853
You know, I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1799
02:12:32,738 --> 02:12:33,739
I know.

1800
02:12:35,115 --> 02:12:37,242
But who you are ain't so bad.

1801
02:12:57,179 --> 02:12:58,889
I bet we were fun.

1802
02:13:04,144 --> 02:13:05,896
Like you wouldn't believe.

1803
02:13:12,444 --> 02:13:13,487
Okay.

1804
02:13:27,417 --> 02:13:28,835
You okay?

1805
02:13:30,754 --> 02:13:32,950
I think I need to talk to everybody.

1806
02:13:35,008 --> 02:13:37,219
So, you're gonna leave?

1807
02:13:38,887 --> 02:13:40,948
My mother died in front of me
when I was eight years old,

1808
02:13:40,972 --> 02:13:43,141
and I have been running ever since.

1809
02:13:44,351 --> 02:13:46,486
I'm gonna need to take some time...

1810
02:13:48,438 --> 02:13:50,148
and learn how to swim.

1811
02:13:52,776 --> 02:13:53,777
I as well.

1812
02:13:58,365 --> 02:14:01,243
I love you all. I do.

1813
02:14:05,414 --> 02:14:08,542
But my whole life
I did whatever Ego wanted,

1814
02:14:09,084 --> 02:14:11,878
and then, I did
whatever the Guardians wanted.

1815
02:14:12,629 --> 02:14:15,966
I need to go out
and discover what I want.

1816
02:14:16,049 --> 02:14:18,176
- I'll come with you.
- No, Drax.

1817
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:19,570
That's the whole point.

1818
02:14:19,594 --> 02:14:21,197
But you need someone to protect you.

1819
02:14:21,221 --> 02:14:23,306
- I don't.
- Not in a bad way.

1820
02:14:23,390 --> 02:14:24,909
Just because of your incredible weakness.

1821
02:14:24,933 --> 02:14:26,494
Oh, my gosh, you're so frustrating!

1822
02:14:26,518 --> 02:14:27,644
Drax.

1823
02:14:28,311 --> 02:14:29,479
I need you here.

1824
02:14:30,313 --> 02:14:32,082
We're building a new society.

1825
02:14:32,441 --> 02:14:33,960
I need all the support I can get

1826
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:35,753
for those children out there.

1827
02:14:36,278 --> 02:14:38,864
Today, I saw who you are.

1828
02:14:40,073 --> 02:14:42,208
You weren't born to be a destroyer.

1829
02:14:43,827 --> 02:14:45,413
You were born to be a dad.

1830
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:51,885
So, you'll lead the Guardians then?

1831
02:14:52,335 --> 02:14:53,336
No.

1832
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:55,422
I'm gonna lead the city,

1833
02:14:56,173 --> 02:14:58,430
make it the type of home I never had.

1834
02:15:00,677 --> 02:15:01,970
So, that's it?

1835
02:15:03,472 --> 02:15:04,931
The group's over?

1836
02:15:05,474 --> 02:15:06,641
No.

1837
02:15:06,933 --> 02:15:09,494
Well, the Galaxy
still needs its Guardians.

1838
02:15:10,312 --> 02:15:13,300
And you will make a better
leader than I ever was,

1839
02:15:13,899 --> 02:15:14,900
Cap'n.

1840
02:15:35,337 --> 02:15:37,088
I love you, guys.

1841
02:15:45,138 --> 02:15:46,223
For you.

1842
02:16:22,092 --> 02:16:28,431
Like a train on a track

1843
02:16:31,476 --> 02:16:33,937
Coming towards her

1844
02:16:35,063 --> 02:16:41,528
Stuck still, no turning back

1845
02:16:43,405 --> 02:16:49,369
She hid around corners
And she hid under beds

1846
02:16:49,452 --> 02:16:54,749
She killed it with kisses
And from it she fled

1847
02:16:56,084 --> 02:17:01,506
With every bubble She sank with a drink

1848
02:17:02,674 --> 02:17:08,388
And washed it away down The kitchen sink

1849
02:17:09,014 --> 02:17:12,183
The dog days are over

1850
02:17:15,228 --> 02:17:18,064
The horses are coming

1851
02:17:18,148 --> 02:17:21,443
So you better run

1852
02:17:21,526 --> 02:17:24,905
Run fast for your mother
Run fast for your father

1853
02:17:24,988 --> 02:17:28,283
Run for your children
For your sisters and brothers

1854
02:17:29,784 --> 02:17:31,095
And your longing behind

1855
02:17:31,119 --> 02:17:34,372
You can't carry it with you
If you want to survive

1856
02:17:34,456 --> 02:17:37,584
The dog days are over

1857
02:17:40,712 --> 02:17:42,339
Can you hear the horses

1858
02:17:42,422 --> 02:17:43,423
Yeah!

1859
02:17:43,506 --> 02:17:44,507
Oh, yeah!

1860
02:17:47,510 --> 02:17:50,180
The dog days are over

1861
02:17:50,263 --> 02:17:51,640
Welcome home.

1862
02:17:51,723 --> 02:17:53,600
The dog days are done

1863
02:17:53,683 --> 02:17:56,686
The horses are coming

1864
02:17:56,770 --> 02:17:59,731
So you better run

1865
02:17:59,814 --> 02:18:03,109
The dog days are over

1866
02:18:06,446 --> 02:18:09,532
The horses are coming

1867
02:18:22,128 --> 02:18:29,135
And I never wanted

1868
02:18:29,219 --> 02:18:33,056
Anything from you

1869
02:18:34,349 --> 02:18:39,854
Except everything...

1870
02:18:39,938 --> 02:18:42,256
I think I might be at the wrong, uh...

1871
02:18:43,316 --> 02:18:45,002
I'm looking for Jason Quill.

1872
02:18:45,026 --> 02:18:46,152
Uh, yes.

1873
02:18:46,611 --> 02:18:47,862
Come in.

1874
02:18:49,072 --> 02:18:52,200
Happiness hit her

1875
02:18:52,283 --> 02:18:53,827
Like a bullet

1876
02:18:53,910 --> 02:19:00,208
In the back

1877
02:19:01,668 --> 02:19:04,713
Struck from a great height

1878
02:19:06,006 --> 02:19:07,007
Pete?

1879
02:19:07,090 --> 02:19:08,883
By someone who should know

1880
02:19:13,471 --> 02:19:14,472
Pete.

1881
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:20,812
Hi, Grandpa.

1882
02:19:20,895 --> 02:19:23,231
Can you hear the horses?

1883
02:19:23,314 --> 02:19:26,776
'Cause here they come

1884
02:19:41,041 --> 02:19:42,709
Run fast for your father

1885
02:19:44,127 --> 02:19:45,646
For your sisters and brothers

1886
02:19:45,670 --> 02:19:48,590
Leave all your love
And your longing behind

1887
02:19:48,673 --> 02:19:50,425
Yes! Yes!

1888
02:19:50,508 --> 02:19:52,218
Yeah! Yeah!

1889
02:19:52,302 --> 02:19:55,180
The dog days are over

1890
02:19:55,263 --> 02:19:57,557
Yeah!

1891
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:59,184
Yeah!

1892
02:20:31,716 --> 02:20:36,554
How young are you?
How old am I?

1893
02:20:37,472 --> 02:20:42,936
Let's count the rings Around my eye

1894
02:20:48,775 --> 02:20:53,655
How smart are you?
How dumb am I?

1895
02:20:54,948 --> 02:20:59,577
Don't count any of my advice

1896
02:21:00,703 --> 02:21:05,416
Oh, meet me anyplace
Or anywhere or anytime

1897
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:08,419
Now, I don't care Meet me tonight

1898
02:21:08,503 --> 02:21:12,465
If you will dare, I might dare

1899
02:21:17,595 --> 02:21:21,391
Call me on Thursday If you will...

1900
02:21:23,685 --> 02:21:26,122
Okay, how about
your favorite musical act?

1901
02:21:26,146 --> 02:21:27,230
Phyla, you first.

1902
02:21:27,689 --> 02:21:31,776
Um... Britney Spears and Korn.

1903
02:21:32,193 --> 02:21:33,278
Good choices.

1904
02:21:33,361 --> 02:21:36,072
I gotta go with the man.
Garth Brooks.

1905
02:21:36,156 --> 02:21:39,367
The Carpenters do not
have a single bad song.

1906
02:21:39,450 --> 02:21:40,660
Adrian Belew.

1907
02:21:40,952 --> 02:21:44,205
Both solo and his work with King Crimson.

1908
02:21:44,956 --> 02:21:46,183
What about you, Captain?

1909
02:21:46,207 --> 02:21:48,098
Uh, this one's kind of special.

1910
02:22:06,227 --> 02:22:07,770
Guess they're here.

1911
02:22:07,854 --> 02:22:11,608
Well, I can handle this by my lonesome

1912
02:22:11,691 --> 02:22:13,526
if y'all wanna chill.

1913
02:22:13,610 --> 02:22:14,611
Nah, nah.

1914
02:22:14,694 --> 02:22:17,089
It'll go faster if we all do it together.

1915
02:22:17,113 --> 02:22:18,114
Groot, wake up.

1916
02:22:19,824 --> 02:22:21,868
Nothin' the matter With your head

1917
02:22:23,036 --> 02:22:26,581
Baby, find it Come on and find it

1918
02:22:29,292 --> 02:22:31,353
Do you ever feel a little sad for them?

1919
02:22:31,377 --> 02:22:32,462
Yeah, sure.

1920
02:22:32,545 --> 02:22:35,228
But these townsfolk
can't protect themselves.

1921
02:22:35,256 --> 02:22:36,925
On your word, Kapitan.

1922
02:22:37,008 --> 02:22:39,219
Come and get your love

1923
02:22:41,179 --> 02:22:43,848

1924

02:22:46,809 --> 02:22:47,810

- Hail
- Hail

1935
02:23:26,307 --> 02:23:30,895

02:23:30,979 --> 02:23:33,231

02:25:04,447 --> 02:25:06,949
La, da boom La, ta, da boom, boom, boom

1974
02:25:07,033 --> 02:25:08,743
Come and get your love

1975
02:25:08,826 --> 02:25:11,347
La, da boom, boom, boom
Ta, daba, boom, la, da boom

1976
02:25:11,371 --> 02:25:13,498
Come and get your love

1977
02:25:33,935 --> 02:25:38,147
Lights out tonight
Trouble in the heartland

1978
02:25:38,231 --> 02:25:42,110
Got a head-on collision
Smashin' in my guts, man

1979
02:25:42,193 --> 02:25:47,365
I'm caught in a crossfire
That I don't understand

1980
02:25:47,448 --> 02:25:50,009
But there's one thing
I know for sure, girl

1981
02:25:50,076 --> 02:25:53,621
I don't give a damn for
The same old played-out scenes

1982
02:25:53,704 --> 02:25:57,708
Baby, I don't give a damn
For just the in-betweens

1983
02:25:57,792 --> 02:25:59,293
Honey, I want the heart

1984
02:25:59,377 --> 02:26:02,713
I want the soul I want control right now

1985
02:26:03,172 --> 02:26:05,508
You better listen to me, baby

1986
02:26:05,591 --> 02:26:09,220
Talk about a dream Try to make it real

1987
02:26:09,303 --> 02:26:13,266
You wake up in the night
With a fear so real

1988
02:26:13,349 --> 02:26:16,185
You spend your life waiting For a moment

1989
02:26:16,269 --> 02:26:18,521
That just don't come

1990
02:26:18,604 --> 02:26:21,441
Well, don't waste Your time waiting

1991
02:26:21,524 --> 02:26:24,735
Badlands, you gotta Live it every day

1992
02:26:24,819 --> 02:26:28,781
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay

1993
02:26:28,865 --> 02:26:30,717
We'll keep pushin' Till it's understood

1994
02:26:30,741 --> 02:26:34,787
And these badlands Start treating us good

1995
02:26:36,747 --> 02:26:40,793
Workin' in the fields
Till you get your back burned

1996
02:26:40,877 --> 02:26:44,797
Workin' 'neath the wheel till
You get your facts learned

1997
02:26:44,881 --> 02:26:49,510
Baby, I got my facts
Learned real good right now

1998
02:26:49,969 --> 02:26:52,430
You better get it straight Darling

1999
02:26:52,513 --> 02:26:56,267
Poor man wanna be rich
Rich man wanna be king

2000
02:26:56,350 --> 02:27:00,229
And a king ain't satisfied
Till he rules everything

2001
02:27:00,313 --> 02:27:05,485
I wanna go out tonight
I wanna find out what I got

2002
02:27:07,528 --> 02:27:11,741
Well I believe in the love
That you gave me

2003
02:27:11,824 --> 02:27:15,703
I believe in the faith That could save me

2004
02:27:15,786 --> 02:27:20,166
I believe in the hope
And I pray that some day

2005
02:27:20,249 --> 02:27:23,961
It may raise me above these

2006
02:27:24,045 --> 02:27:27,256
Badlands, you gotta Live it every day

2007
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:31,260
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay

2008
02:27:31,344 --> 02:27:33,280
We'll keep pushin' Till it's understood

2009
02:27:33,304 --> 02:27:37,433
And these badlands Start treating us good

2010
02:28:26,732 --> 02:28:30,611
For the ones who had a notion
A notion deep inside

2011
02:28:30,695 --> 02:28:34,323
That it ain't no sin
To be glad you're alive

2012
02:28:34,407 --> 02:28:38,202
I wanna find one face
That ain't looking through me

2013
02:28:38,286 --> 02:28:39,912
I wanna find one place

2014
02:28:39,996 --> 02:28:42,498
I wanna spit In the face of these

2015
02:28:42,582 --> 02:28:45,793
Badlands, you gotta Live it every day

2016
02:28:45,876 --> 02:28:49,839
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay

2017
02:28:49,922 --> 02:28:51,966
Keep movin' Till it's understood

2018
02:28:52,049 --> 02:28:55,970
And these badlands Start treating us good

2019
02:28:58,014 --> 02:29:01,851
Badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa

2020
02:29:01,934 --> 02:29:05,688
Badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa

2021
02:29:05,771 --> 02:29:09,483
Badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa

2022
02:29:09,567 --> 02:29:13,362
Badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa

2023
02:29:14,530 --> 02:29:16,592
I mean, if she needs help
mowing her lawn, I'll do it,

2024
02:29:16,616 --> 02:29:18,927
but I kinda feel like
her son should help.

2025
02:29:18,951 --> 02:29:21,346
He's gonna sit on the porch
and watch me do it.

2026
02:29:21,370 --> 02:29:23,289
Like, he's a 45-year-old man,

2027
02:29:23,372 --> 02:29:25,392
able-bodied, and I'm mowing his lawn.

2028
02:29:25,416 --> 02:29:26,685
- It just feels weird.
- Mm-hmm.

2029
02:29:26,709 --> 02:29:28,252
Don't get me started.

2030
02:29:29,837 --> 02:29:31,631
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

2031
02:29:32,632 --> 02:29:34,279
Now I kind of want to know.
