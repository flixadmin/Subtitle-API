00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:48,897
So we have to leave by the weekend.

166
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:52,526
No. No, you can'<i>t</i> do this to us.

167
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:55,988
They were waiting for your husband
to turn himself in, and he never did.

168
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:04,079
Ma'am? Ma'am.

169
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,873
May I give you some advice?

170
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:14,423
I think it's time for you to think
about you and your children's safety.

171
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:16,383
Forget about him.

172
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:31,398
(Broken radio chatter, static)

173
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:40,949
(Tata) 'The kids miss you.
Should I wake up Juan Pablo?'

174
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:46,288
(Pablo) Probably not a good idea
right now, my love.

175
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:50,542
(Tata) 'So... do you feel
a year older or what?'

176
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:54,796
More like four or five.

177
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:58,008
We've missed you very much, Pablo.

178
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,843
The days feel longer.

179
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:04,306
For me too.

180
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,852
I still don'<i>t</i> understand
why you're in Medellín.

181
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:11,104
That place is too dangerous, my love.

182
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,653
That's exactly why.
No one would think I'd be here.

183
00:14:21,156 --> 00:14:22,991
Pablo...

184
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:26,787
'I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.'

185
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:31,792
Turning yourself in
isn'<i>t</i> the end of the world, my love.

186
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,168
You can survive prison.

187
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:39,383
We both know that won'<i>t</i> happen.

188
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:41,843
(Hugo Jr.)
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Shh!

189
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:45,305
- (Tata) 'Listen to me, Pablo...'
- They're talking.

190
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,933
- 'You will always be Pablo Escobar.'
- Boss.

191
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:51,269
'You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.'

192
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:53,688
My man.

193
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,400
'My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.

194
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:58,318
'The people love you and follow you.'

195
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:01,446
(Pablo) 'Tata, Limón wants me off.'

196
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:04,616
It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

197
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,703
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

198
00:15:10,372 --> 00:15:13,417
'They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.

199
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,419
'They gave him the Nobel Prize.'

200
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:19,297
They say he may even
become president.

201
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:22,426
'President, Pablo.
Of the same country that imprisoned him.'

202
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:24,511
(Pablo) 'I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.'

203
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:26,263
(Hugo Jr.) Alvaro, stop.
Stop for a second.

204
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:29,141
(Tata) 'All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.

205
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,101
'It's very important.

206
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:34,187
'It's our only way out really.'

207
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:37,566
Alvaro, let's go slowly.

208
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:39,776
Colonel! Colonel,
this is Lieutenant Martinez.

209
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:42,779
'Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.'

210
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:45,073
I'll think about it.

211
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:47,451
All right?

212
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:51,079
'I love you very much.'

213
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:24,905
Where are you going?

214
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,364
To Medellín.

215
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,952
What? No, no, no, Hermilda.
You can't leave.

216
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:33,830
My son needs me.

217
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:36,416
How so?

218
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,627
What you want...

219
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,173
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

220
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,966
I don'<i>t want</i> them to kill him.

221
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,219
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know <i>that.</i>

222
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:48,887
They won'<i>t</i> if he turns himself in.

223
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:51,848
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

224
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:53,767
No! No, ma'am.

225
00:16:53,892 --> 00:17:00,273
I will not stay quiet when...
when I see you... betraying my son!

226
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:04,277
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

227
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:08,073
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

228
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:10,242
We can'<i>t</i> even leave the country.

229
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:16,248
And the only shot I have
at getting my children out of this alive...

230
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:19,251
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

231
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:27,634
My son...

232
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:31,221
needs his mother.

233
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:40,564
Hermilda.

234
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:52,200
Please be very careful. Please.

235
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,537
Tell the children...

236
00:17:58,123 --> 00:17:59,874
(Whispers) I'll tell them.

237
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:20,562
(In Spanish) We have intel
that Escobar is in this building.

238
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:25,150
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

239
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:28,570
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

240
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:32,657
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

241
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:36,911
Now, if he resists...

242
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:40,749
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

243
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,335
I want you to take his life. Understood?

244
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,211
- (All) Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

245
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:47,172
(Engines revving)

246
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:35,720
(Limón)
Everything all right, boss?

247
00:19:57,242 --> 00:19:59,202
Tata wants me to surrender.

248
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:06,292
(Sighs) She said
I can be like Nelson Mandela.

249
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,586
Nelson Mandela?

250
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:14,759
Who's that, boss?

251
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:07,270
Did you buy more rolling papers?

252
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:09,481
Sorry, no, boss.

253
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:19,282
(Knocking at door)

254
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,911
(Gasps)

255
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:25,580
(Fork clatters)

256
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:47,268
I can'<i>t</i> think with that
fucking smell of Chinese food in here.

257
00:22:08,623 --> 00:22:10,500
(Man over radio) 'He's not here.'

258
00:22:15,338 --> 00:22:18,758
Come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

259
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:23,930
This is my city, Limón.

260
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,727
These are my people.

261
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:36,359
Medellín will never betray me.

262
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,157
- (Low chatter)
- Colonel.

263
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,660
- We fucked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

264
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:48,580
- Looks like your little machine is broken.
- (Men chuckle)

265
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:50,707
Go and fiddle with the little knob. Go on.

266
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,127
Excuse me, Colonel.

267
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:58,965
(Man) Listen up!

268
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,926
Take down the staging area
and head back to Holguín.

269
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,149
(Hugo Jr.) Son of a bitch wasn'<i>t</i> talking
from this building, but he was close.

270
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,903
- (Kids chattering)
- (Water splashes)

271
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:24,115
- A ghost.
- What's that?

272
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:28,661
That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

273
00:23:28,786 --> 00:23:31,789
That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

274
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:40,673
I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

275
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:43,509
Give me the keys!

276
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:46,429
- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

277
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:55,980
(Dogs barking outside)

278
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,113
(Starts engine)

(Indistinct TV chatter)

286
00:26:16,412 --> 00:26:19,624
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

287
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:22,210
Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

288
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:24,504
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

289
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:43,898
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

290
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:49,821
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

- Hello, how are you? My pleasure.

293
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:03,042
Sir.

294

(Church bell ringing)

300
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:43,768
(Gustavo) You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

301
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:46,103
to sit here as if nothing's happening.

302
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:50,816
They're offering seven million dollars
for you head,

303
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:53,402
and you're sitting here
like a fucking tourist.

304
00:28:56,697 --> 00:28:58,950
You look just like Che Guevara.

305
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:00,952
What's beautiful is always beautiful.

306
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:03,829
You look like you ate Che Guevara.

307
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:15,007
What? You don'<i>t</i> miss me or what?

308
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,305
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

309
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:24,558
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

310
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:27,103
Thank you, Gustavo.

311
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:34,110
Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

312
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:38,281
He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

313
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:39,949
Never letting anything stop him.

314
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:44,537
Yeah, but that motherfucker
had a fucking army.

315
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:47,790
You remember when we used to
talk about going to the jungle

316
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:49,417
if shit got too heavy?

317
00:29:50,584 --> 00:29:52,795
- Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.
- Mmh.

318
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:57,633
(Sighs) Tata wants me to surrender.

319
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:04,015
Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

320
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,058
Maybe it's a good idea.

321
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:12,898
You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

322
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:17,278
to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

323
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:19,322
The legend grows.

324
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:22,116
- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

325
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,039
We both know that things aren'<i>t</i>
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

326
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,793
Let's cut the bullshit.

327
00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:37,590
We are bandits, Pablo.

328
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:39,967
Right?

329
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:47,641
What do you think?

330
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:52,355
(Sighs) I think...

331
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:58,944
that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

332
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:05,618
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

333
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:18,381
Every fucking day of my life, brother.

334
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,197
(Children laughing)

335
00:31:57,044 --> 00:32:00,214
(Broken chatter, static on radio)

336
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:29,493
(Dogs barking outside)

337
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:42,673
(Exhales) Boss? Don'<i>t</i> do that again, sir.

338
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:45,509
- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

339
00:32:49,138 --> 00:32:51,182
It worked perfectly.

340
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:59,565
You're a good man, Limón.

341
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:04,236
Thank you.

342
00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:07,364
Thanks a lot.

343
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,743
- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

344
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:14,455
- Put salt on it, pussy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

345
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,165
I'm hungry.

346
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:20,419
(Pablo) 'Tata?'

347
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:25,549
Pablo?

348
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:28,302
'There's the love of my life.'

349
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:33,015
- You sound different.
- 'I'm good, my love.'

350
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:35,809
I feel good.

351
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:40,481
And ready to talk to those reporters.

352
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:44,068
Good, my love.

353
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:46,237
Does that mean
you're turning yourself in?

354
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:51,242
No, Tata.

355
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:54,370
'I'll never surrender.'

356
00:33:57,998 --> 00:34:00,209
We won'<i>t</i> be under protection, Pablo.

357
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,295
You have to.

358
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:09,385
I'll never surrender, my love.

359
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:25,943
I know, Pablo.

360
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,863
But what's your plan?

361
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,994
All right.

362
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,037
I know what we're going to do.

363
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:43,168
We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

364
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:45,254
'That's what we are going to do.'

365
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,215
(Signal breaking up)

366
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:53,679
- (Pablo) '...foreign journalists...'
- Alvaro, slow down!

367
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:56,515
'...so the world will know
what these bastards are doing...'

368
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,351
- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

369
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:05,566
'We will make the international press
put pressure

370
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:07,484
'on the Colombian government.'

371
00:35:08,902 --> 00:35:12,948
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

372
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:16,744
We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

373
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:18,954
'You have to believe me.

374
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:22,750
- 'We will succeed.'
- (Softly) Stop, stop, stop, stop!

375
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:29,381
'As soon as we do that,
I'll go to the jungle, join the guerrillas...'

376
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:31,383
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

377
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:34,720
We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

378
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:37,014
And listen...

379
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:42,311
I will not rest until that happens.

380
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:45,814
Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.

381
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:51,612
(Tata) 'I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.'

382
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,285
The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

383
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,828
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

384
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:01,246
- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

385
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:04,041
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

386
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:08,295
All right, excuse me. Thank you.

387
00:36:09,588 --> 00:36:11,632
(Martinez) 'Go ahead, Lieutenant.'

388
00:36:11,757 --> 00:36:13,133
Colonel, I found him.

389
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:15,135
'Who? Escobar?'

390
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:17,638
Yes, Colonel.

391
00:36:17,763 --> 00:36:19,348
'He's in Los Olivos.'

392
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:25,896
Son, are you sure? We can'<i>t</i> afford
the luxury of making another mistake.

393
00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:29,191
I'm sure. I saw him.

394
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:32,695
What do you mean you saw him?

395
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:36,907
'Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.'

396
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:39,827
And did he see you?

397
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:42,871
'No, I don'<i>t</i> think so.'

398
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:46,417
Listen up, Lieutenant.

399
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:49,002
'There's still some men
in the staging area.

400
00:36:49,128 --> 00:36:52,715
'I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?'

401
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:54,925
Copy that, Colonel.

402
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,928
One more thing. Be safe.
Over and out.

403
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:02,558
- Fix the position.
- Right away.

404
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:05,894
Hello, Dad.

405
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:08,397
How's it going, son?

406
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:11,358
You wanted to ask me something
or what?

407
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,152
Yes, sir.

408
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:15,195
What wish did you make
for your birthday?

409
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,782
If I tell you, it won'<i>t</i> come true. Right?

410
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:22,035
'Tell me! Don'<i>t</i> be like that!'

411
00:37:22,161 --> 00:37:24,371
Well, the only thing that I can tell you

412
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:27,833
- 'is that it was a very good wish.'
- You know,

413
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,669
'you deserve the best birthday
in the world.'

414
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:44,349
Thank you, my love.

415
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:48,687
Captain.

416
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:51,398
- (Martinez) 'Captain, can you hear me?'
- Yes, Colonel?

417
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:53,859
'How many men are left
in the provisional base?'

418
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:56,779
- Counting me, about 12.
- 'Listen up.'

419
00:37:57,946 --> 00:38:01,742
- Lieutenant Martinez found Escobar.
- 'Shit! Let's go!'

420
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:04,328
- Everybody to Los Olivos!
- (Overlapping shouts)

421
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:06,038
(Manuela) 'Hello.'

422
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:10,417
Hello, my little princess.
How's my little girl?

423
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:11,543
Good.

424
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:15,422
I've got your little rabbit here.
He's getting very fat.

425
00:38:15,547 --> 00:38:16,965
(Giggles)

426
00:38:26,183 --> 00:38:27,518
Perez!

427
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:31,355
Attention! Two groups. Captain, Sergeant
in the back, and I'll take the front.

428
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,940
This is the house.

429
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:36,401
(Pablo) Get your mum
on the phone, OK?

430
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,154
Pablo.

431
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:41,615
- 'Do you have the questions?'
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

432
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:44,743
'The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.

433
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:49,373
'"How do you feel after
all these days on the run?"'

434
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,960
Write this down.

435
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,005
It's been very hard
being far from my family,

436
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,008
who I love more than anything
in the world.

437
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:03,512
- Sergeant, go around.
- But I feel good.

438
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:05,138
I feel strong.

439
00:39:05,264 --> 00:39:10,060
And I have the will to fight
all of these injustices.

440
00:39:11,144 --> 00:39:14,773
The government has made a mockery
of our rights.

441
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,822
It's allowed our justice system
to become corrupted by murderers.

442
00:39:22,906 --> 00:39:26,618
The people of Colombia deserve
much better than that.

443
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:34,501
The government
is holding my family hostage.

444
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:38,338
That's a crime against human rights
committed by a government

445
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:41,550
'that calls itself democratic.'

446
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:45,220
My little kids are innocent children

447
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:49,683
that have nothing to do
with their father's problems.

448
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:58,442
All we want from the government

449
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:01,445
is that they bring those killers,
Los Pepes, to justice.

450
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:07,659
But above else, that they allow my family
to leave the country immediately.

451
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:09,953
- Without <i>that...</i>
- (Dogs barking outside)

452
00:40:13,415 --> 00:40:14,458
(Softly) One moment.

453
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,335
What happened, Pablo?

454
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,378
(Barking continues)

455
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:23,258
Something strange is happening here.
I'll call you back.

456
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:25,886
Pablo. Pablo.

457
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:29,139
'Pablo. Pablo, don't hang up.

458
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:31,183
'Pablo, what's going on?'

459
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:34,478
(Juan Pablo) What's wrong, Mum?

460
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:40,609
(Whispers) Go on. All right.

461
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:50,243
Go! Go!

462
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:52,704
(Shouts) Let's go!

463
00:40:54,331 --> 00:40:56,041
- (Gunshot)
- (Grunts)

464
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:59,127
- (Pablo) Let's go! Come on! Come on!
- (Groans)

465
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:00,379
Come on!

466
00:41:00,963 --> 00:41:02,339
Come on! Move, move, move!

467
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,510
(Shouts)

468
00:41:10,847 --> 00:41:12,265
Go, go, go!

469
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:21,858
Move!

470
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:23,485
Go!

471
00:41:24,027 --> 00:41:25,320
Keep going!

472
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:26,697
- (Gunshot)
- (Groans)

473
00:41:42,713 --> 00:41:44,506
(Gunfire)

474
00:41:57,102 --> 00:41:59,229
(Gunfire)

475
00:42:00,689 --> 00:42:03,483
Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot!

476
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:07,654
(Groans)

477
00:42:11,033 --> 00:42:13,035
(Wheezing breaths)

478
00:42:28,717 --> 00:42:30,427
Sergeant Sarmiento!

479
00:42:31,094 --> 00:42:33,638
You just shot Pablo Escobar!

480
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:35,182
Is he alive?

481
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,225
(Steve) 'All that time hunting him...

482
00:42:38,018 --> 00:42:41,897
'and just like that, I'm looking down
at Pablo fucking Escobar.

483
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:46,443
'For years I'd been building
this son of a bitch up in my head.

484
00:42:46,568 --> 00:42:49,863
'What a monster he'd be. (Chuckles)

485
00:42:50,822 --> 00:42:52,240
'But here's the thing.

486
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:56,078
'When you lay eyes on him,
the devil's a real letdown.

487
00:42:56,745 --> 00:42:58,205
'Just a man.

488
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,956
'Beard grows if he doesn't shave.

489
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,793
'Fat and shoeless.

490
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:05,754
'You take a good long look at evil,
and it reminds you of one...'

491
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:07,714
(Gunshot echoes)

492
00:43:16,223 --> 00:43:17,849
Long live Colombia.

493
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,393
- (Shouts) Long live Colombia!
- Long live!

494
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:22,437
We killed Pablo Escobar!

495
00:43:22,562 --> 00:43:25,357
- (Men) Long live! Long live!
- Long live Colombia!

496
00:43:25,482 --> 00:43:28,819
- (Trujillo) Long live Colombia!
- (Men shout) Long live Colombia!

497
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:33,573
(♪ Slow Latin guitar song plays)

498
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:53,009
Go ahead.

499
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:55,303
(Indistinct chatter over radio)

500
00:43:59,224 --> 00:44:03,562
- (Man) They killed Pablo Escobar!
- (People cheering, chattering)

501
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,156
(♪ Guitar song continues)

502
00:44:27,002 --> 00:44:28,712
(Pager buzzes)

503
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,468
(♪ Music over dialogue)

504
00:44:49,816 --> 00:44:52,652
(♪ Guitar song continues)

505
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:26,686
(♪ Music over dialogue)

506
00:45:30,232 --> 00:45:32,984
My son! My son...

507
00:45:33,008 --> 00:45:39,008
http://hiqve.com/

508
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,515
(♪ Music over dialogue)

509
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:39,342
(Hermilda)
I pray to God that other mothers

510
00:46:39,467 --> 00:46:43,513
don'<i>t</i> have to experience
the pain that I'm feeling.

511
00:46:43,638 --> 00:46:46,474
And I know my son wasn'<i>t</i> as bad
as they made him out to be.

512
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:49,602
I know that they blamed him
for anything bad that happened.

513
00:46:49,728 --> 00:46:51,813
I want the good things he did
to be remembered,

514
00:46:51,938 --> 00:46:54,190
because he didn'<i>t</i> do the bad things
they say he did.

515
00:46:54,316 --> 00:46:57,444
He built playing fields.
He built a neighbourhood for the poor.

516
00:46:57,569 --> 00:46:59,487
No one has paid attention to that.

517
00:46:59,612 --> 00:47:03,700
As a son,
there will never be anyone better.

518
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:07,454
(Dialogue fades) He was the noblest
of men. Not just as a son...

519
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:24,804
(♪ Up-tempo Latin music playing)

520
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,266
(Celebratory shouting)

521
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,402
Sit down, ma'am. Sit.

522
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:40,904
Thank you.

523
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:49,329
Talk to me.

524
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:54,501
Before he died,
my husband told me to find you.

525
00:47:56,211 --> 00:47:57,837
He told you that?

526
00:48:00,673 --> 00:48:04,052
He told me that despite the fact
that you became enemies,

527
00:48:04,177 --> 00:48:06,179
you were once associates and friends.

528
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:08,807
(Laughter, loud chatter)

529
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,230
You were saying?

530
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:19,567
He told me that
you were a decent man.

531
00:48:19,692 --> 00:48:22,237
That you would
understand the situation.

532
00:48:23,488 --> 00:48:25,573
That you would forgive us.

533
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:29,077
And that you might help us
get out of the country.

534
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,707
How much do you have left,
Mrs Escobar?

535
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:37,419
In property? In cash?

536
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:43,425
I can find out.

537
00:48:47,303 --> 00:48:49,305
That's good.

538
00:48:49,431 --> 00:48:51,641
Because I want all of it.

539
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:31,848
(Javier in English)
Sir, do I need a lawyer?

540
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:36,227
You're the review board, right?

541
00:49:37,604 --> 00:49:41,065
Professional conduct or some bullshit?

542
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:45,445
We're not the review board.

543
00:49:48,781 --> 00:49:49,991
So who are you?

544
00:49:52,744 --> 00:49:54,621
We're from Operations.

545
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:01,711
- What do you want from me?
- (Laughter, chatter)

546
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:03,922
(In Spanish) All right, gentlemen!

547
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:05,590
Gentlemen!

548
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:11,221
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

549
00:50:11,346 --> 00:50:13,681
In 1992, do you know how much cocaine

550
00:50:13,806 --> 00:50:16,142
we estimated came into the US
from Colombia?

551
00:50:17,477 --> 00:50:19,646
311 metric tons.

552
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:24,943
(In Spanish) The first sale.
The first million. The first billion.

553
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:28,947
And when your rival no longer exists.

554
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:30,490
(Laughter)

555
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:36,996
And in 1993, during the hunt for Escobar,
372 metric tons.

556
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:39,541
Now that piece of shit is on his last leg.

557
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:41,626
Every one of his labs
has been shut down.

558
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:44,045
And cocaine production goes up.

559
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,215
(In Spanish) The important thing
in these moments isn'<i>t</i> how one reacts,

560
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,634
but how well one has prepared for them.

561
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:54,055
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

562
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,475
Can you imagine
what happens next year?

563
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,938
(Gilberto) And we won'<i>t</i> be needing
kidnappings and bombs to succeed.

564
00:51:02,063 --> 00:51:05,316
We will do it covertly.

565
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:08,194
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

566
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,612
we'll no longer be there.

567
00:51:09,737 --> 00:51:11,447
- No, sir!
- (Laughter)

568
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:13,866
- Cheers!
- (All) Cheers!

569
00:51:15,034 --> 00:51:17,620
Now the king is dead.
Long live the kings.

570
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:26,713
Agent Peña, how much do you know
about the Cali cartel?

571
00:51:31,342 --> 00:51:33,720
(♪ Pop song plays)

572
