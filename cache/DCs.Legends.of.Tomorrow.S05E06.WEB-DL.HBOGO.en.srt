1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,680
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,160
Astra's dead mother
was a powerful witch.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,600
Why did you bring me back?

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,560
Natalie, is that really you?

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,040
Natalie brought you here
to help me save Astra.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,920
What do you know
about the Loom of Fate?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,160
Do you wanna know
what I'm hiding from?

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,840
- Yes, I do.
- That bloody Loom.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
He still has ten years.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,240
Can you make it zero?

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,680
Bye-bye, Johnny.

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,400
<i>John.</i>

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,560
<i>John, can you hear me?</i>

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
<i>What happened?</i>

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,760
He just collapsed.

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Out of nowhere.

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,000
After coughing up a bucket of blood.

18
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,560
Come on, Johnny. Stay with us.

19
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,840
Gideon, we'll need to run a scan.

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,120
<i>Right away, Dr. Palmer.</i>

21
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,760
Oxygen mask, please.

22
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,560
The Loom. Where is it, Charlie?

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,240
Not now, John, all right?
You've got to rest.

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,040
- What loom?
- Astra's ghost mom.

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,440
She told... Oh, my God.
Hold me, hold me.

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,560
- Hold me.
- What the hell's going on?

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
<i>As you can see
from his chest X-ray,</i>

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,200
<i>Mr. Constantine has a very
aggressive form of lung cancer.</i>

29
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,800
<i>I'm afraid it's terminal.</i>

30
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,360
Well, there's no point
in quitting now.

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,040
There's nothing funny
about lung cancer, John.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Who's laughing?

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,720
{\an5}If you lose your hair,
I'm shaving my head in solidarity.

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute.

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,160
No saucy AI is butchering me
and pumping me full of drugs...

36
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,560
<i>I took the liberty
of administering a sedative.</i>

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,400
<i>Mr. Constantine needs to rest.</i>

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,440
Gideon, prepare the Jumpship.

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
<i>Clotho...</i>

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,280
<i>Where are you going?</i>

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
<i>You can't escape us.</i>

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,840
<i>Clotho...</i>

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,720
<i>You can't get away.</i>

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,360
<i>We see you.</i>

45
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,680
No, no.

46
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,360
{\an5}- Oh, mate!
- Charlie.

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,120
You're back.

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,920
How are you doing, B-easy?

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Where you been?

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,920
{\an5}I was just... I was just hanging
out at Constantine's.

51
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,120
How is he?

52
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,440
- Dying.
- What?

53
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,960
No, don't worry. You know John-o.

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,360
{\an5}He's always got a trick up
his sleeve.

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
{\an5}Bro, that donut you made me eat
had me hallucinating.

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,760
Starting today,
I'm on a juice cleanse.

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,920
Zari, this is my...

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,240
friend, Charlie.

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,560
Charlie, meet my sister.

60
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Good fashion.

61
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
<i>Team meeting on the bridge.</i>

62
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,920
Does that mean me?

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,160
<i>That means you, too, Zari.</i>

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cool.

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
So, you coming?

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
I wouldn't miss it.

67
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,960
Oh, Charlie.

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,440
{\an5}We could really use your
help right now.

69
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,720
{\an5}With Sara in Star City and Rory
in a mood, we are short-staffed.

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,440
{\an5}- What's Mick in a mood about?
- Ali. His girlfriend.

71
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Ray, they only...
they only had sex once.

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,640
Well, when you know, you know.
You know?

73
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Okay.

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,680
{\an5}Listen, I know
we're all worried about John. Okay?

75
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,920
{\an5}And we could just sit back
and wait for a miracle.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,040
But, does Marie Kondo rest
just because she built an empire?

77
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,160
- No.
- No.

78
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,400
No, she tidies up.

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,520
{\an5}And that is exactly
what we're gonna continue to do.

80
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
{\an5}We are gonna tidy up the timeline,
yeah?

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
{\an5}Gideon, show them
what we've been working on.

82
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,760
Each point represents
a potential Encore.

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,280
Which means, we can catch them
before they change history.

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
I call her...

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,760
The Prognosticator.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

87
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,240
Oh, anyway, there's a Category 5
in 1997, Hong Kong.

88
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,320
A mysterious gangster is moving in
on the Triad's territory.

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,720
Ray, I want you and Zari to QB.

90
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,480
Oh, you don't have to tell me
to Queen Bee.

91
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,640
It'll occur naturally.

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
You know what? Hong Kong traffic
is notoriously bad.

93
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,840
{\an5}- So why
- Whoa!

94
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,280
{\an5}don't we take my new scooter?

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I call her...

96
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,520
Scoots McGoots.

97
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,560
- Dude!
- That's so awesome.

98
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,000
The scooter, you're all impressed by?

99
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,640
Oh, my God. I need one.

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,240
Wanna go for a ride?

101
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,400
- Yeah.
- Yes.

102
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,120
Away we go.

103
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,520
Okay, I'm next.

104
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,640
- Careful!
- Slow down.

105
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
All right, speed her up.

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Nate. Nate?

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,120
Never been to Hong Kong before.

108
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,160
So, what's the plan?

109
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,960
I had Gideon cook up the same
sedative she dosed John with.

110
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
{\an5}All we have to do is inject
the Encore

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,040
{\an5}and bring him back to the ship
for nap time.

112
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
One problem.

113
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,480
We're just supposed
to hope the Encore shows up

114
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
looking for a cuppa?

115
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,760
This is no ordinary tea shop.

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
It's owned by the Triad.

117
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,080
<i>Nate, how's the perimeter sweep?</i>

118
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,760
No sign of a gangster from Hell yet.

119
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,640
So it looks like we've arrived

120
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,920
{\an5}right as Great Britain
was getting ready to hand control

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
of Hong Kong back to China.

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,760
Oh, that's probably not pertinent
but keep up the research.

123
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,360
Gary! What are you doing here?

124
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,520
John's trying to leave the ship!

125
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
You have to stop him!

126
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,040
<i>You should return
to the MedBay, Mr. Constantine.</i>

127
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,800
John, what are you doing out
and about?

128
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,520
Oh, listen, big man.

129
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,400
Look, I know you're only
trying to help, all right?

130
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,040
But nobody gets Stage IV
lung cancer this fast.

131
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,400
Some sneaky git with a grudge against
me is bending the rules of magic.

132
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,200
Oh, who could hate you that much?

133
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,120
The list is long.

134
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,560
I'm taking the Jumpship
home to narrow it.

135
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,400
John, no. I cannot
let you leave this ship.

136
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,280
You are in need of medical
supervision.

137
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
You can't let me?

138
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,960
You forget who I am, old son.

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Fine.

140
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,600
But I'm going with you.

141
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Hallelujah!

142
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,560
That was intense.

143
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,960
The Encore's a no-show.

144
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
<i>I say we split.</i>

145
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,760
Thirteenth-century armor...

146
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,200
Fu Manchu mustache.

147
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Guys.

148
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,040
<i>I think I know who the Encore is.</i>

149
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,240
<i>It's Genghis freaking Khan.</i>

150
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,480
How the hell did Genghis Khan
get to 1997

151
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
and learn how to ride a motorbike?

152
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,240
Genghis used horses
to revolutionize warfare.

153
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,440
A motorbike's the modern-day horse!

154
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
Looks like he's meeting
with the Triad.

155
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,840
What sort of man steals my drugs

156
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,800
and my nephew's ear

157
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,040
only to return them to me?

158
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,480
I have only one interest.

159
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,960
Conquest.

160
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,240
Surrender the Triad to me

161
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
and I will remake the globe.

162
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
And if I refuse?

163
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,360
We're not getting in that room.

164
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,640
We should abort.

165
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,880
<i>Regroup on the ship.</i>

166
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,280
What, and stay in Hong Kong longer?

167
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,120
Give me the syringe.
Let's finish this.

168
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,920
B, I'm gonna need a distraction.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
It's too dangerous.

170
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,640
Any moment.

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,800
Charlie, stop. Don't do this!

172
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,040
Behrad!

173
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,680
We're the cops.

174
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,120
Freeze, jackass.

175
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,120
Great distraction, B.

176
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
No!

177
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,720
Genghis is leaving.
I'm going after him!

178
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Charlie, wait!

179
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Charlie?

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
- I'm out.
- Me, too.

181
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,080
Drop your guns!

182
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Shoot him!

183
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
- Huh?
- Nice timing.

184
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,440
Scoots.

185
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Shoot him!

186
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,040
- He's immortal.
- And I'm not!

187
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
You're lucky.

188
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,520
Maybe next time, not so lucky.

189
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,440
Gary, bring me the foxglove,
a serpent's tongue

190
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,720
and the hair of an albino.

191
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,560
John, need some water?

192
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Bollocks.

193
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
No, mate.

194
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,880
Just do me a favor and pull up
the rug.

195
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
What are you planning?

196
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,640
A summoning spell.

197
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm gonna throttle the bastard
that did this to me.

198
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,720
Are you really up for that?

199
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,920
No two-bit demon
is getting the better of me.

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm John Constantine,
and I am devious to the core.

201
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,520
I added honey, just how you like it.

202
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Good. Now, give it here.

203
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,440
Johnny.

204
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,160
Show your face.

205
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,240
The great John Constantine,
brought to his knees.

206
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,680
There are denizens of Heaven and Hell
who would kill to see this.

207
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,880
Surprise.

208
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,440
Astra, why?

209
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,720
You're bad for business, John.

210
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
The cancer was already in your lungs.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,200
I just... sped it up.

212
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,040
Astra, this magic
is way beyond you, love.

213
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,160
Look, whoever helped you,

214
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,440
whatever you promised them
in exchange, trust me,

215
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
it's a trap.

216
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,200
I'll keep that in mind.

217
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,240
You know, I would have expected
your purgatory to be a little more...

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,320
gruesome.

219
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,080
You don't remember this place, then.

220
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,200
Your mother brought you here.

221
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,440
So that's your angle.

222
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,200
I knew you'd try something, John.

223
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,800
Astra, I can change
your mother's fate.

224
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,520
All right? She never dies.
You never go to Hell. Your dad, he...

225
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,640
He never drowns his sorrow in booze.
Your family can be whole again.

226
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Tempting.

227
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,600
But everyone you try to help...

228
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,200
you hurt.

229
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,480
But this is different, all right?

230
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,120
I know someone who has a lead
on a very powerful artifact.

231
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,160
"I know someone."

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,840
John, listen to yourself.
It's pathetic.

233
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,520
No, what is pathetic is that someone

234
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,920
who is so content to rule Hell

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,080
because they're too scared
to make a go at a real life.

236
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,960
Look, this is what Natalie wanted,
love.

237
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
I just...

238
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I need a little more time.

239
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,240
Time is something you're running
low on.

240
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,720
Oh, thank God.

241
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,360
No.

242
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,000
The man upstairs
had nothing to do with this.

243
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,360
It was Astra.

244
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,640
She owns the chip to my soul.

245
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
She's figured out a way
how to spin down the dial

246
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,280
on the time I have left.

247
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Thanks, man.

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
John, I'm sorry.

249
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,360
Cheer up, lads.

250
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,920
This dog is still in the fight.

251
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,200
That went well.

252
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
My Queen Bee-ing, I mean.

253
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,440
You four almost got
yourselves killed.

254
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,680
- I had fun.
- "Fun"?

255
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,560
You got us stuck
in the middle of a shoot-out.

256
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,960
It's why I love Bruce Lee.
He never uses guns.

257
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,400
Keep your knickers on.
You have wind powers.

258
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,880
You could have
just stopped the bullets midair.

259
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,080
Stop bullets?

260
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
You're crazy.

261
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Look, this is all my fault.
We should have been gathering Intel,

262
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,920
not doping the Encore. Gideon.

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,280
<i>I'm currently tracking
Genghis Khan's whereabouts</i>

264
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,680
<i>via his license plate.</i>

265
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,040
Great. 'Cause we need to figure out
how and why

266
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,520
Genghis just showed up
in 1997 Hong Kong.

267
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Charlie, you up for
some undercover work?

268
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,960
Oh, I get it. Just
because I'm the shapeshifter,

269
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,920
I have to be the one
to infiltrate the criminal gang.

270
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,680
Sorry, pause.
Oh, you're a shapeshifter?

271
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,280
Yeah. I am, actually.

272
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,560
I can shift into anyone you like.

273
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,760
Anyone?

274
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,720
- Yeah, anyone.
- All right, come on.

275
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,200
Where's Mick? I'm gonna get a drink.

276
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,280
- I need a smoke.
- I...

277
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,560
I don't get it.
They used to be best buds.

278
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,440
Oh, there's only one explanation.

279
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,400
B and Charlie went to pound town.

280
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,960
Oh. Gross.

281
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Wait, what?

282
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Moan zone?

283
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,280
Smash city?

284
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Ava.

285
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,960
They had sex?

286
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,200
All right, guys.
I'll see you in a bit.

287
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,400
- Charlie.
- Oh, here we go. Another lecture.

288
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,680
No, I just...

289
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Be careful.

290
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
She won't talk.

291
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,880
Oh, the hero cop from the tea house.

292
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,440
Ava, are you there?

293
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,960
Yeah, Charlie. You find something?

294
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,640
<i>Genghis kidnapped your cop friend.</i>

295
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,680
What do we have here?

296
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,040
Only one child?

297
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,640
How unambitious.

298
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,560
Nevertheless...

299
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,000
give me what I desire
and I will spare his life.

300
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,720
John, Nora's here.

301
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
All right, I'm coming.

302
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,480
Okay, Pippa...

303
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,600
can you wish our friend John healthy,
like we discussed?

304
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,680
Yes, but I want something first.

305
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,200
Pippa's made a lot of progress

306
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,520
but we're still working
on a few challenges.

307
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,560
Hey!

308
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,680
The Master of the Dark Arts
needs your help!

309
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,720
Shut up, four eyes.

310
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,040
Now you listen to me,
you little squirt.

311
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,840
Now you're gonna make that damn wish
because if you don't and I die,

312
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,400
then I'm gonna come back and haunt
you every waking hour of your life.

313
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,000
Fairy Godmother, I wish your scary
British friend wasn't sick!

314
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,080
There you go. Easy.

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay.

316
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,840
Oh, no matter.

317
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,720
I'll try something else.

318
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,480
I wish I was home!

319
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Sorry.

320
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Bye, Ray.

321
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Bye, Nora.

322
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,920
So, when did
you and Charlie, you know...

323
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
It's that obvious?

324
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,920
After Heyworld.

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,080
Wow. That's nice.

326
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,040
- How was it? She shapeshift?
- That's what you want to talk about?

327
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,400
Hundred percent but we don't have to.

328
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,800
Look, Charlie's clearly
affecting you.

329
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,120
So come on, talk to me.

330
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,000
- It's stupid.
- What?

331
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,680
She left without saying goodbye.

332
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Yeah, that sucks.

333
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,600
But if you were thousands of years
old, wouldn't you be over goodbyes?

334
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,680
The least she could've done
is texted.

335
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,200
How hard is it to send a ghost emoji?

336
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,680
Maybe it wasn't about you.

337
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,960
Dum-dum's got a good point.

338
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,560
B, chin up. You are a catch.

339
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,200
If there was a female version of you,

340
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,480
I would be all over her. Fact.

341
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,800
Like my sister?

342
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,920
Absolutely.

343
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,040
But the point is,

344
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,320
we don't know why Charlie
didn't say goodbye.

345
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
So just check your ego...

346
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
and ask her.

347
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
You're right.

348
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,840
- Thanks, Nate.
- My man.

349
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,360
Where's our prisoner?

350
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,160
Even with Prince Charles' motorcade
route, he'll be heavily guarded.

351
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,560
<i>Wait. Prince Charles is the target?</i>

352
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,240
He's here to hand Hong Kong
back to China.

353
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,040
What if the Khan wants Prince Charles
to give it to him instead?

354
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,560
An authoritarian power
wants to control Hong Kong.

355
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
It sounds familiar.

356
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,280
The worst part of my resurrection

357
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,680
was finding myself buried
in an impenetrable tomb.

358
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,160
It took me 700 years
to dig myself out.

359
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,280
The best part of my resurrection
was the sword I was buried with.

360
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,920
Genghis just killed a cop
with a Hell weapon.

361
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,080
Son of a bitch.

362
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,360
Okay, you got
what we needed, Charlie.

363
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,640
Get the hell out of there.

364
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,040
Yeung.

365
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,960
What is the status of my fleet?

366
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,120
Your fleet?

367
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,320
The one you are building
to conquer the globe.

368
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Right.

369
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,480
Fleet's great.

370
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,360
In fact, I have to go
check on it right now.

371
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,400
Don't freak out. I can explain.

372
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,520
Never mind.

373
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
<i>Clotho...</i>

374
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,120
<i>No matter what face you wear...</i>

375
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,840
<i>you can't hide from us.</i>

376
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,520
No! Leave me alone!

377
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Are you okay?

378
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,360
Yeah.

379
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
I'm fine.

380
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,400
So? What's the verdict?
Can you heal me?

381
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,120
Well, then, screw you.

382
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,280
Come with me.

383
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
He didn't mean that.

384
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Yeah, I did.

385
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,720
I wish you would let us
take you to the oncologist.

386
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,600
Raymond, how many times
do I have to tell you?

387
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,320
This is a disease caused by magic
and only magic can fix it.

388
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,960
"How to add years to your life"?

389
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,160
Oh, that should do it.

390
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,080
Although the ingredient list
is a little unusual.

391
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
We'll need a medieval knight.

392
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,720
I was once knighted
Sir Raymond of the Palms.

393
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,840
Great. Gary, grab a knife.

394
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,520
We're gonna perform a little
back-alley surgery on the big man.

395
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,600
Oh, what kind of surgery?

396
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,720
Well, first off, are you
uncircumcised?

397
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,000
- I... I...
- Well, I'll take that as a yes.

398
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,480
- Gary, the knife.
- No!

399
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,240
We tried Nora, we tried the Puca.

400
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,320
What if there isn't a cure?

401
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,320
Isn't there anyone you...
that you need to say goodbye to?

402
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,000
What about a bucket list?

403
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
Goodbyes are for saps

404
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,440
and bucket lists
are for mealy-mouthed cowards

405
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,120
who don't have the courage
to <i>carpe</i> the bloody <i>diem.</i>

406
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,280
I have a bucket list.

407
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,680
Thank you for proving my point,
Raymond.

408
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,360
Stop being so mean.
We're trying to help you.

409
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,160
- Help me?
- Yes.

410
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
Captain America
and the village idiot?

411
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,560
Well, I don't need your help.

412
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,520
I take care of myself. I always have.

413
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,640
What, you think
I'm gonna let Astra beat me?

414
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,680
I will fight and I will scheme

415
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,240
and I will make a deal
with the archangel himself.

416
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,360
You hear that, Gabriel, eh?

417
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,360
Come and get me.

418
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,800
Have I got an offer for you.

419
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,920
Looks like he's not coming.

420
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,080
I'll think of something. I always do.

421
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,000
Now piss off,
I've had enough of the pair of you.

422
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,880
Go on, piss off!

423
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Hello.

424
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Who the hell are you?

425
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,280
I am the last queen of France.

426
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,360
Right. Just when I thought this ship
couldn't get more barmy.

427
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,040
Looking for a Time Courier?

428
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,840
Why are you in such a hurry
to leave... again?

429
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,120
You know me.
Always looking for the next party.

430
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,840
Usually I would buy that...

431
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,600
but you just almost walked
into a truck.

432
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,320
Something has you spooked.

433
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,440
Is whatever's going on
the reason why you left?

434
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,240
- Here we go.
- Look, I'll admit it.

435
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
I liked you.

436
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,520
I was hurt when you left

437
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,560
and I've felt weird
ever since you returned.

438
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
Now, can you be honest with me?

439
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Honestly...

440
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,800
you are starting to piss me off.

441
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,240
We had sex and it was mediocre.

442
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,400
Get over it.

443
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,000
Wow. Okay, I'm gonna ignore that.

444
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,880
If you don't want to talk, fine.

445
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,800
But we're about to go up
against Genghis Khan.

446
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
Don't leave now.

447
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,320
Just give me the Courier.

448
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Bye, Charlie.

449
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,960
Mediocre is not bad.

450
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,280
Charlie's gone?

451
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,520
- How could you let her leave?
- I didn't.

452
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,200
It was her choice.

453
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,040
Okay. Hey, how about we focus
on Genghis Khan?

454
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
You're right.

455
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
We need to stop him from
attacking Prince Charles' motorcade.

456
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,200
But he is on his way to a ceremony
ending 156 years

457
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,560
of colonial rule, so...

458
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,000
Have you been researching history?

459
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,040
Oh, sorry. That's your thing, right?

460
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,800
- No. But...
- Okay.

461
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,000
Hey, okay. Moving on, right?

462
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,400
Turns out the person
Charlie impersonated is an engineer.

463
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
There's a shipment coming in tonight.

464
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,040
I'll bet you that's the fleet
Genghis uses for his attack.

465
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
What kind of fleet?

466
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,120
Whatever it is, it's the next step
of modern warfare.

467
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,240
I'll go to the docks,
I'll try to figure it out.

468
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,560
Okay.

469
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,560
Zari and I will monitor
the airspace above the motorcade

470
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,800
and you'll be on the street.

471
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
I know it's a lot of ground to cover.
If Charlie was here...

472
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
I get it. I'm on my own.

473
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,440
I can't believe you stooped

474
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,160
to trying to make a deal
with an angel.

475
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,000
Gabriel would have turned you
into his slave.

476
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,920
Well, at least I'd be alive.

477
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,960
There are worse fates than death.

478
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
<i>Oi.</i>

479
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,320
I will shove you where the sun
don't shine just to shut you up.

480
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,600
You'd probably enjoy that.

481
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,600
Hell of a way to spend
your last night's on Earth, though...

482
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,360
you arrogant bastard.

483
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,920
Especially when you could be

484
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,480
with two of the only friends
you have left.

485
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,880
Yeah. Nice one.

486
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,560
I... I just feel so helpless,
you know?

487
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,520
Me, too, Gary.

488
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,000
If he has to go, I just...

489
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,560
I want him to be at peace.

490
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,080
Well, that's not his style.

491
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,880
John's gonna go out the way he lived.

492
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Like a bloody wanker, eh?

493
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,400
You know, it occurs to me

494
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,160
that I might owe you two
a bit of an apology.

495
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,080
We accept.

496
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,360
Okay.

497
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,680
Go on, sit down.

498
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,440
All right.
Okay, you're hurting me. Go on.

499
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,440
Sit down. Stop bloody fussing,
will you?

500
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,160
You know, I can't remember
the last time this room

501
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,520
was used as an actual kitchen.

502
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,720
Well, there's roast in the oven.

503
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
It'll be ready soon.

504
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,800
Did I ever tell you both

505
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,800
about the time I met
the ghost of Winston Churchill?

506
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,600
<i>Behrad, what's your status?</i>

507
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,480
It's complete gridlock.

508
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,600
No one's getting through
on the ground.

509
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,240
- The fleet must be in the air.
- Nate...

510
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
did you find the shipment?

511
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,280
Oh, no.

512
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,480
<i>We're too late.</i>

513
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,200
<i>Whatever there was,
there was a lot of them.</i>

514
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,120
Nate, get downtown and help Behrad.

515
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,320
<i>Hold up.</i>

516
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,760
I think they might have left
something.

517
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
What's that noise?

518
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,040
Oh, my God.

519
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,440
Scoots.

520
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,360
Khan!

521
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,840
Charge!

522
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,800
They're getting through the gridlock
on their scooters!

523
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,480
<i>Heading straight
for Prince Charles' motorcade.</i>

524
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,720
Stay down, Your Majesty!

525
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,440
Turn here!

526
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,000
I could really use some help!

527
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,600
Nate, tell me you're close, please.

528
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,640
I'd be lying.

529
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,040
B, it's your time. You got this.

530
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,160
Protect the Prince!

531
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,680
Get down! Take cover!

532
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
Look out!

533
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,880
Not again.

534
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,800
Look who it is.

535
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,520
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you,
Prince Charles.

536
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,640
It's not your fault.

537
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,640
But my friends call me Charlie.

538
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,960
Apprehend this imposter.

539
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,320
Show your true form or I end him.

540
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,320
Looks like your luck has run out,
shapeshifter.

541
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,240
Where is the Prince?

542
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,120
Sorry, Gengi.

543
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,200
He's somewhere you'll never find him.

544
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,760
Your shapeshifting friend

545
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,400
said you need to tell your team
that I'm here.

546
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,600
And I told her, I'm on my beer break.

547
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,760
Now, shut up, princess, and listen.

548
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,920
I've never met
one of your kind before.

549
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,480
You will be my 13th wife.

550
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,440
Come again, mate?

551
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,800
Your power will serve my reign well.

552
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,400
Join me, as I build a new empire
that will span the globe.

553
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Look, I'm flattered.

554
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,000
But I've had power of immortals
and gods alike.

555
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
It blows.

556
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,920
My past is complicated.

557
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,520
And being in a relationship...

558
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,360
Trust me, that wouldn't end well
for either of us.

559
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,080
Wait.

560
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,200
Did you two sleep together
or something?

561
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,200
Oh. What a shame.

562
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,880
- Kill her!
- What?

563
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
No.

564
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,120
Come on.

565
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,720
Unless you lot want those bullets
firing back at you...

566
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
bugger off.

567
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,880
Run away! Run away!

568
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,680
Run away! Run away!

569
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,240
I told you you could stop bullets!

570
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,800
Not how I wanted to find out.

571
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Come here.

572
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,480
- Yeah, that was sick.
- I know.

573
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,520
Is that Genghis' toothpick?

574
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,680
Yeah, you want it?

575
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, no, it's disgusting.

576
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,040
You said you were gonna tell us
what's really going on with you.

577
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,360
Look, I'm just... I'm still trying
to find the words, all right?

578
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,000
Can you try to find them faster?

579
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Fine.

580
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,520
I'm just gonna come out with it.

581
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,040
I am a Fate.

582
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,080
One of the three old Greek ladies?

583
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,480
That's offensive, but correct.

584
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,680
Which one are you?

585
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,960
Clotho, the spinner.

586
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,640
I'm super-confused,
but what do you spin?

587
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,400
Look, I don't spin anything anymore
but I used to spin people's futures.

588
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,480
<i>On your loom.</i>

589
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,480
Oh, lovely.
Even Gideon's joining in. Yes.

590
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,120
There was a loom, but I
destroyed it thousands of years ago.

591
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,760
No one should have
that kind of power.

592
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,720
I think people should just decide
their own destinies.

593
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,680
Why didn't you just tell us?

594
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,160
Look, I've been keeping this secret
for my entire bloody existence.

595
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,560
All right?

596
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,720
I've never told anyone.

597
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,680
Can we see your OG form?

598
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,920
Absolutely not.

599
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,720
Is it 'cause you're old?

600
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,560
It's because your eyes will explode,
all right?

601
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,400
And your ears, too,
if you could hear my original voice.

602
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,600
Why are you running?

603
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,960
My sisters are coming after me.

604
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,880
They have been
ever since I destroyed our loom.

605
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,680
Wait, you've been running
for thousands of years?

606
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,440
Yes. And I've always stayed
one step ahead.

607
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,040
I scattered the loom pieces
across the multi-verse

608
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,080
which took away my sisters' powers.

609
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,480
But, now that we're all in one
universe...

610
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,680
thanks to Sara
and her merry band of Paragons...

611
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,400
the Loom pieces are back
on one plane.

612
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,600
And now it's only a matter of time
until my sisters find me.

613
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,560
And when they do?

614
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,200
They'll kill me
and anyone that I'm with.

615
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,160
Which is why I left.

616
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,280
And it's why I'm out that door now
that we're done playing "Ask a Fate."

617
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Stop running.

618
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
We got your back.

619
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,440
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.

620
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,360
My sisters are no joke.

621
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,320
Well, we're the Legends.

622
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah.

623
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,280
We can take out a couple old ladies.

624
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,360
What is with all these damn scooters?
They're a menace!

625
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,240
Oh. Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

626
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,960
Well, I lost my scooter at first.

627
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,600
But the good news is,
don't worry about it, I found it.

628
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
John, this wine is delicious.

629
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,680
And nutritious.

630
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,560
Well, there's no point
in saving the good stuff, eh?

631
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,160
I'm never gonna drink with you again.

632
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,000
Come on, mate. Stiff upper lip, eh?

633
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,440
I'm gonna miss you so much, you know?

634
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,200
Nothing can make me feel better!

635
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,480
Oh, bollocks, all right.

636
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Look.

637
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,040
I didn't want you
to see my will until I died, but...

638
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,080
Raymond, if you'd do the honors.

639
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Oh, sure.

640
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,760
You're giving this house to Gary?

641
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,040
Bloody hell. That was supposed
to make you happy, not insufferable.

642
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,520
I promise to take great care
of this place.

643
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,680
You know, I'll feed the Hell hounds,
I'll vacuum...

644
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,720
Why don't we talk about what you had
on your bucket list, eh, Ray?

645
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,360
- Really?
- Yeah.

646
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,960
Give me something meaningful, ey.

647
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,520
Well eventually...

648
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,480
I plan on asking Nora to marry me.

649
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Can I be your flower boy?

650
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,800
Oh. That's very sweet, Gary.
Odd, but very sweet.

651
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,080
Why haven't you asked her yet,
big man?

652
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,880
I've been engaged twice before.

653
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,000
Both times didn't end as I had hoped.

654
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,800
You know, life, it is...

655
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,280
too short to dilly-dally, Raymond.

656
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,840
You can take that from a man
who has nothing but regrets.

657
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,120
So, if you love that witch...

658
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,640
you bloody well marry her, all right?

659
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,160
No, no, no, I'm all right.
I'm all right.

660
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,560
Now, how about a toast, ey?

661
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Okay.

662
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
No, no.

663
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,080
Of all the ways
that I thought I'd go...

664
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,440
decapitated by a demon,
eviscerated by an elemental...

665
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,160
I wouldn't have picked
being at home with my mates.

666
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

667
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Cheers.

668
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,320
You know, I just wish

669
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,480
I had more time with you,
lovely idiots.

670
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,480
Well, you're not dead yet, John.

671
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,040
No, but I will be momentarily.

672
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,800
John Constantine...

673
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,160
he always goes out on his own terms.

674
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
John?

675
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,160
Couldn't wait to see me, John.

676
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,520
Sixty seconds and you're dead.

677
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,360
Poison does that.

678
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,240
It's the same poison
your mother used to kill herself.

679
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,560
You won't change my mind.

680
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm not trying to.

681
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,160
I just want you to know that...

682
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,480
even though you gave up on her,...

683
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,920
your mom never gave up on you.

684
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,400
<i>Are you going to Scarborough Fair</i>

685
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,280
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

686
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,600
- Stop.
<i>- Remember me to one who lives there</i>

687
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,520
<i>For once she was a true love of mine</i>

688
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,320
That was our song!

689
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,600
Aye, it was.

690
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,320
But she sang it to me first.

691
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,760
You can really bring her back?

692
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,320
Answer me!

693
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,400
I can fix everything.

694
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,280
I'm glad that hurt.

695
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,080
Tick-tock, John.

696
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,600
I can kill you anytime I want.

697
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,880
Oh, my God!

698
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,200
I can't take this anymore.

699
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
You're alive.

700
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,760
Astra, she reconsidered.

701
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,880
She reconsidered.
She reconsidered. She reconsidered.

702
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,400
She reconsidered!

703
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,320
I can't bloody believe it.

704
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,560
I'm back in the game!
Oh, bully. Bully, Bully, Bully!

705
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,280
I love you!
Bully, Bully, Bully, Bully, Bully!

706
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,240
Yes, I can't believe
she bloody reconsidered!

707
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,200
I feel like a new man.

708
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,480
I can't believe
I was gonna leave my house to you.

709
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,760
- What?
- Here, give me that will.

710
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,360
How did you get Astra
to change her mind?

711
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,200
By making a promise...

712
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,760
that I intend to keep.

713
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,600
Hail the <i>Waverider.</i>

714
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,800
I need to see a lady about a loom.
