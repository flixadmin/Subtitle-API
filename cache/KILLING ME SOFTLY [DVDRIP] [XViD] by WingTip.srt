1
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,292
You know what happens
at that height?

2
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,869
The brain dies
from lack of oxygen...

3
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,598
cell by cell.

4
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,707
It just shuts down...

5
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,265
and the body goes with it.

6
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,941
I can't stop thinking about
what it must have been like.

7
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,790
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

8
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,781
It's always the easiest.

9
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,455
OK, I'll start
at the beginning.

10
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,628
I grew up on the plains
in lndiana.

11
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,222
I was a flatlander,
through and through.

12
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,333
To be honest...

13
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,569
I really didn't have
much to leave behind.

14
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,562
Virtually no family
and very few friends.

15
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,577
Anyway, it was January.

16
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,314
I'd already been in London
a year and a half.

17
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,684
For the first six months,
I'd been incredibly lonely.

18
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,174
Then I met Jake.

19
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,757
What I loved the most...

20
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,658
was how comfortable
we were with each other.

21
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,495
I felt safe.

22
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,576
OK, let's go.

23
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,051
I design CD-roms
and websites...

24
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,253
for corporate clients.

25
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,754
That must pay well.

26
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,090
It sounds fancier
than it is.

27
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,825
Jake was an engineer.

28
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,328
Tunnels and bridges,
that sort of thing.

29
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,730
He kept his tube tickets...

30
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,999
in a wallet he got
when he was twelve.

31
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,168
Same wallet,
same inside pocket.

32
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,830
Alice? Alice?

33
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,068
See you later.

34
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,183
Hey, Alice.

35
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,184
You going in?

36
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,173
Yeah.

37
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,242
I'll see you in a minute.

38
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,884
Reconfigure the training
program manual...

39
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,753
to make it look like
a game on the website.

40
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,448
We tried that with
the appliance kings.

41
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,460
Yes, but this isn't
about washing machines.

42
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,759
Now we're training
a worldwide sales force.

43
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,503
You're the new media pioneers.

44
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,138
Think of something.

45
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,800
Alice, you still have
the old template, don't you?

46
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,777
Are you with us, Alice?

47
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,561
I'm going out
to get my hair trimmed.

48
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,755
I'll be back after lunch.

49
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,212
Oh, shoot!

50
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,842
And you got in?

51
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,244
Yeah...

52
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,542
I got in.

53
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,562
What's your name?

54
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,824
Alice.

55
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,963
Alice.

56
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,095
Don't turn away.

57
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,140
Come here tomorrow.

58
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,517
I have to work.

59
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,958
Then come back tonight.

60
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,293
I can't.

61
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,170
Whenever you want, Alice.

62
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,402
You decide, and I'll be here.

63
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,089
I couldn't believe
what had happened that day.

64
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,386
I knew it shouldn't
happen again.

65
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,123
I wanted everything
back the way it was.

66
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,401
What do you want me to do?

67
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,544
Nothing, just keep doing
what you're doing.

68
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,734
That was when
I found out his name...

69
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,003
Adam Tallis...

70
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,834
and that he climbed mountains.

71
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,349
He caused quite a stir
here yesterday.

72
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,785
He saved
six people up there...

73
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,185
with no oxygen.

74
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,109
You stop me
whenever you want.

75
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,804
Please don't stop.

76
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,779
I bought your book today.

77
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,660
It isn't my book.

78
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,355
I'm just in it.

79
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,789
It looks good.

80
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,500
People died, Alice.

81
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,572
Something went very wrong.

82
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,822
There was a woman
named Francoise Collette.

83
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,968
I lost the whole group.

84
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,843
I still don't understand
what happened.

85
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,979
There was no room for error.

86
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,344
Everything had been checked.

87
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,051
I was in love with her.

88
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,519
Do you know what it's like
over 20,000 feet?

89
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,096
It's like this.

90
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,199
Without air,
the brain cells die.

91
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,311
It shuts down.

92
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,449
and then the rest
of the body follows.

93
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,127
It's been two years...

94
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,459
and it doesn't go away.

95
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,196
I live with someone.

96
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,975
But you're here.

97
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,180
I have to go.

98
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,425
Don't put them on.

99
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,911
Hi. Where are you?

100
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,189
I'm running some errands.

101
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,824
Do you think you could
pick up my watch...

102
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,825
on the way home?

103
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,826
I'm running behind schedule.

104
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,827
I'm never going to make it.

105
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:15,816
Of course I can.

106
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,631
I missed you today, Alice.

107
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,700
Miss you.

108
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,701
I love you.

109
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,759
Love you.

110
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,914
Knock it! Not nice.

111
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,552
And give it!

112
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,586
Go in!

113
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:11,011
A card? Ref,
that's a bit harsh.

114
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,223
Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...

115
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,885
There's nobody there!

116
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,361
I have to leave you.

117
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,364
You what?

118
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,195
I can't go on like this.
I'm sorry.

119
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,894
I have to leave.

120
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,834
You have to leave me?

121
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,151
We're together.

122
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,524
We're perfect together.

123
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,291
I want to marry you.

124
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,031
I met somebody.

125
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,585
Who did you meet?

126
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,847
You don't know him.

127
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,755
I'm sorry.

128
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,958
When did you meet him?

129
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,226
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

130
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,127
It's not the point--

131
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,829
It's very much the point!

132
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,198
We go to the market
together every Sunday!

133
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:37,035
I buy your fucking
tube tickets for you!

134
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,468
Jesus!

135
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,573
Where you going?

136
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,575
You were looking for Adam.

137
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,844
He's not here
at the moment...

138
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,779
but it's cold out there.
Come in.

139
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,283
Please, come in.

140
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,121
I've been climbing in Chile.

141
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,499
Adam always takes
his pictures down...

142
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,195
or makes sure his back
is turned to them.

143
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,094
Oh, please, sit down.

144
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,411
For me, pictures
tell me who I am...

145
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,812
but for Adam,
they steal his soul.

146
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,986
Want some?

147
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,020
No, thank you.

148
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,044
No, it's quite good.

149
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,492
I'm his sister.

150
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,994
You're his sister?

151
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,196
Yep. I'm Deborah.

152
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,800
We climb together a lot.

153
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,735
He was having some work
done on his place...

154
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,602
so he stayed here
while I was gone.

155
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,107
This...

156
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,270
is Mr. Know-it-all.

157
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,742
It's his name.

158
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,056
This is Francoise, right?

159
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,524
That's the real reason...

160
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,027
my brother takes
the pictures down...

161
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,289
because it's...

162
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,294
too hard for him to see her.

163
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:51,200
My brother's a brave guy,
but sometimes...

164
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,105
he's afraid of remembering.

165
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,646
What he forgets...

166
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,182
is that he's not
the only one responsible.

167
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,013
I was up there, too.

168
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,746
She was
my best friend, Alice.

169
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,428
Yes, I know your name.

170
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,537
You're very beautiful.

171
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,169
I can see why he'd
fall so hard for you.

172
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,752
The thing about my brother...

173
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,525
is you're either
with him or you're not.

174
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:50,629
And once you've made
the jump and you're with him...

175
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,930
that's it...

176
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,420
there's no discussion.

177
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,306
Can I have his address?

178
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,332
Yes, of course.

179
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,245
Thank you.

180
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,222
I left him.

181
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,260
You're hurting me.

182
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,809
Morning.

183
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,185
Alice, this is Joanna.
Joanna, Alice.

184
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,030
Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

185
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,098
I'm interviewing Adam

186
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,866
about his Himalayan
clean-up project.

187
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,061
Nice to meet you.

188
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,394
Where can I find a shirt?

189
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,145
Your phone?

190
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,271
Would you get that for me?

191
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,883
No one there.

192
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,193
In some respects,
it's just become...

193
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,060
a playground for
the rich and inexperienced.

194
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,789
Thank you.

195
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,372
I have to go to work.

196
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,807
Will you think
about me today?

197
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,043
Yes.
What are you doing today?

198
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,032
Thinking about you.

199
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,781
Do you want to learn
how to climb?

200
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,449
Sure.

201
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,110
Come and see me after work.

202
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,869
That's good.

203
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,860
He's not as strong
as he was last week.

204
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,145
It's lovely to see you.

205
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,454
I see you've got a harness.

206
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,956
Do you want to put it on?

207
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,925
Just put your feet
in there...

208
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,916
and pull it up
like a pair of trousers.

209
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,527
That's great.

210
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,474
That's right, double-back in.

211
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,609
There we go.

212
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,610
It suits you.

213
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,599
Thank you.

214
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,087
It's OK. I'm helping her.

215
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,355
How are you?

216
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,556
OK, fine.

217
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,825
I'm sorry.

218
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,951
Let me check your harness.

219
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,229
Seems to be good.

220
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,138
She's my sister,
but she drives me mad.

221
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,366
I swear it's chemical.

222
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:10,875
You ready?

223
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,343
I don't know. Maybe.

224
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,537
Come on.

225
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:20,351
Well, finally, Alice.

226
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,321
The flatlander captured
the mountain boy.

227
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,591
Alice, meet Klaus.
Klaus, Alice.

228
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,922
I liked your book.

229
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,388
Well, thank you.

230
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,198
Well, nice to meet you.

231
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,073
This looks hard.

232
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,472
It's all in the mind.

233
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,163
I mean, my taste in clothes
has completely changed.

234
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,364
Really?

235
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,527
I bought this practically
transparent pink T-shirt.

236
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,737
And I won't even tell you
about the lingerie.

237
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,573
No. Probably best not
to mention the lingerie.

238
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,343
I'm still in the big
white cotton panties.

239
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,833
I'm sorry.
I'm a little manic.

240
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,073
Have you seen Jake?

241
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,552
Of course I have.

242
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,383
He's been my friend
for 15 years.

243
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:31,923
How is he?

244
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:32,924
What can I say?

245
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,192
He's smoking like a fiend...

246
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,284
and he's completely fucked up.

247
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,392
It's not like there's
no reason, is there?

248
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,497
Sorry.

249
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,639
I think that you're
destroying both of your lives.

250
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,476
I'm sorry.

251
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,884
You had somebody
who loved you.

252
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,353
You loved each other...

253
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,323
and you let him go
for good sex.

254
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,892
Love isn't just
a good fuck, you know?

255
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:08,893
This is more.

256
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,328
More what?

257
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,329
More everything.

258
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,598
When I'm with him,
everything is more.

259
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,599
Oh, God, Alice.

260
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,800
You could write
greetings cards.

261
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,233
You really bloody could.

262
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:23,963
Sorry.

263
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,839
Right.

264
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,418
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

265
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,687
I could do with some retail
therapy myself, I think.

266
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,854
I can't,
but come with me.

267
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,323
I'm gonna
see Adam at 3:00.

268
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,312
You can meet him.

269
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,398
And there's this
really amazing store...

270
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,866
and I haven't bought it
yet, but I will...

271
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,603
It's OK. She's fine.

272
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,836
Call the police.

273
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,511
Adam! Stop!

274
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,367
When I saw him...

275
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,669
oh, Jesus.

276
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,371
That'll never happen again.

277
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,463
I won't let it.

278
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,244
Are you OK?

279
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,545
Yeah.

280
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,180
I'll always be here, Alice.

281
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,681
Yeah.

282
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,083
I'll protect you.

283
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,084
Say you believe me.

284
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,244
I believe you.

285
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,117
Marry me.

286
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,168
The sooner the better.

287
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,370
Tomorrow.

288
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,238
The day after,
as soon as possible.

289
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,331
-Marry me!
-Yes!

290
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,821
Sir, can we ask you
some questions, please?

291
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,884
"Use your head, Alice.

292
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,011
"What do you really know
about him?"

293
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,261
Hey, you ready?

294
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,489
Look at this.

295
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,101
Someone's trying to scare you.

296
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,102
There's been
a call this morning.

297
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,103
There was someone there...

298
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,263
but they didn't say anything.

299
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,007
Makes me sick.

300
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,277
If anything else
happens like this again...

301
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,871
make sure you tell me, OK?

302
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,111
You'll be fine.

303
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,681
Do you, Alice...

304
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,383
promise to love
and cherish Adam...

305
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,418
for as long
as you both shall live?

306
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,153
I do.

307
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:32,957
And do you, Adam, promise
to love and cherish Alice...

308
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,293
for as long
as you both shall live?

309
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,761
I do.

310
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,963
May the Lord
bless this union...

311
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,625
and secure it from all harm.

312
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,057
How do you know the priest?

313
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,793
This is my family church.

314
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,162
You have a family church?

315
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,964
Wow, I have a mother
who doesn't talk to me...

316
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,295
and a dad I've never met.

317
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,667
It doesn't matter.

318
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,431
My life began
when we first saw each other.

319
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,609
Come on.
I need you to see something.

320
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,598
What?

321
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,494
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

322
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,895
Now, I want you
to see this...

323
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,954
through my eyes
when I was six.

324
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,864
Look. Like this.

325
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,909
You know the story that
we're broken into two pieces?

326
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,247
And we spend our lives

327
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,044
searching for
our other half.

328
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,950
You're it.

329
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,686
OK, here we are.

330
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,830
We're getting dressed here?

331
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,067
Yep. Here.

332
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,628
No! No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

333
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,357
I need to remember you
like this.

334
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,047
Come on. I don't want you
to freeze to death.

335
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,776
Come on.

336
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,384
This is the only
way station...

337
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,715
for hikers
in the whole area.

338
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,778
The church has kept supplies
up here for years.

339
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,134
You went hiking
on your wedding day?

340
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,125
That's his idea of romance.

341
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,977
I thought a honeymoon
was lying in bed...

342
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,111
with room service.

343
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,348
Oh, I'll give you
a honeymoon you won't forget.

344
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,350
I promise.

345
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,339
No, no, sit down.

346
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,083
Choose your rhythm and then
commit to following it.

347
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,624
Count if you have to.

348
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,397
I'm gonna make you strong!

349
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,846
I wanted him to be
proud of me...

350
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:51,076
so I followed the trail
for hours.

351
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,494
You made it.

352
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,179
What's that?

353
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,380
It's an anchor...

354
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,507
to catch a falling body.

355
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,708
Catch.

356
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,959
Do you trust me?

357
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:09,983
Yes.

358
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,035
Don't move.

359
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,641
I gave up all control.

360
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,311
I let him decide
when I could breathe...

361
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:03,113
and when I couldn't.

362
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,013
I loved it.

363
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,860
God, I love you!

364
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,051
We returned to London...

365
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,042
and Joanna Noble's
article came out.

366
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,354
I was happier
than I'd ever been.

367
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,649
Excuse me.

368
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,758
-There you go.
-Thanks.

369
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,871
Hello, Jake?

370
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:19,149
No, it's Sylvie speaking.
Hello, Alice.

371
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,417
Sylvie?

372
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,418
I must have dialed wrong.

373
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,419
I thought I was
calling Jake.

374
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,721
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

375
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,356
I just happened to be
over, actually.

376
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,393
Jake's going to be
back soon, I think.

377
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,329
Look, Alice, this is
gonna sound a bit weird...

378
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,997
but I was definitely
going to tell you...

379
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:37,334
but Jake and l
have actually been...

380
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:38,869
seeing each other.

381
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,200
You and Jake?

382
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:44,572
Well, it...
just sort of happened.

383
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,066
Did you move in?

384
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,517
Yeah. Yeah, I did,
uh, sort of.

385
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,417
Oh, Lord.

386
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,622
How cliche is this?

387
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,390
Old friend moves in...

388
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,025
to console jilted boyfriend...

389
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,323
and then these two find
themselves together.

390
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,866
You gonna be OK with this?

391
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,800
Yeah, I'm OK.

392
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,434
We're gonna be late!
Hurry up!

393
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,575
Yeah, I gotta go.

394
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:19,803
We'll talk
about it later, OK?

395
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:41,653
Here we go.

396
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,364
How you doing?!

397
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,266
Hey, Alice, Alice,
I'm sorry.

398
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,057
Sorry.

399
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,149
Excuse me.

400
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:15,988
How you doing?
It's really nice to see you.

401
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,645
It's Alice Tallis.

402
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,559
My rhyming sister-in-law.

403
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,997
Are you OK?

404
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,832
I have a headache and was
looking for some aspirin.

405
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,390
Oh, no, give me your hand.

406
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,609
Can you feel that?

407
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,099
Yeah, it really hurts.

408
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,368
Close your eyes.

409
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,673
Breathe.

410
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,144
Slowly.

411
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,263
That's good.

412
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,139
It's the meridian
that controls the kidney

413
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,607
or the brain
or the left big toe.

414
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,440
I forget which.

415
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,640
But...it's whatever
works, right?

416
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,886
Thank you.

417
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,013
Close your eyes.

418
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,130
OK, you can open them.

419
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,360
Oh, my God.

420
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,903
I want to drink to that
beautiful lady in blue.

421
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:33,961
Where is she?

422
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,371
I don't think she's ever
climbed past the third floor...

423
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,973
but she has conquered
our Adam.

424
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:51,488
But what she doesn't know
is that to get Adam...

425
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,357
she also gets us.

426
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,257
Hear, hear!

427
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,171
Most of the people
using the program are women...

428
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,439
and we try
to sell them a game...

429
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,441
but women don't like games.

430
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,442
Women like stories.

431
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,610
Men like games.

432
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,345
Men like to slay the dragon...

433
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,446
and get the princess...

434
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,647
but women like to know...

435
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,082
how did the dragon
and the princess...

436
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,879
all get there
in the first place.

437
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,153
A game is
the wrong approach.

438
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,486
Sorry.

439
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:35,866
Excuse me.

440
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,200
Alice Tallis.

441
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,668
This is Joanna Noble.

442
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:39,669
Do you remember me?

443
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,471
Yes, I remember you.

444
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:45,909
I got a weird note
about the article.

445
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,911
I'm not gonna do
anything with it.

446
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,247
I mean, I'm certainly not
going to follow it up.

447
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,349
It's probably
stupid of me...

448
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,184
but I somehow felt obliged...

449
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,549
to tell you about it.

450
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,755
Shall I send it to you?

451
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:01,658
Yeah, you can send it.

452
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,827
Is it private?

453
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,163
I don't want this sitting
in a public "in" basket.

454
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,265
I understand.
You can fax it.

455
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,733
OK, I'll do that.

456
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,734
You have the number?

457
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,735
Yeah, I got it
from your secretary.

458
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,336
OK, thanks for calling.

459
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,701
Sorry.
I had to take that.

460
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,508
No problem.

461
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,010
Gave me a chance to think.

462
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,145
We shouldn't be playing games.

463
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,807
It's obvious
women don't like games.

464
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,121
I think this project
needs a new face.

465
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,057
"Dear Joanna Noble,
what you wrote made me sick.

466
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,860
"Your big hero Adam Tallis
raped me.

467
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,328
"Why don't you try
reporting the truth?"

468
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,292
It's out of paper.

469
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,540
I've decided
that from now on...

470
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,143
this is Alice's project.

471
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,145
You're the new point man...

472
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,047
I mean, point girl...

473
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,115
woman.

474
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,104
Excellent.

475
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,157
Congratulations, Alice.

476
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,385
Thank you.

477
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,364
Open or closed?

478
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,854
Closed.

479
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,139
Fuck!

480
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,622
Alice Tallis' office.

481
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,891
Hello, Claudia,
it's Adam.

482
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,292
Oh, hi, Adam.

483
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,326
Hi. Is Alice there?

484
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,128
No, she's just left,
actually.

485
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,329
Left? Where'd she go?

486
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,456
I think she went
to the doctor's.

487
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:03,346
So, you thought this woman
was sending the notes?

488
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,370
Yes.

489
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,101
Yeah?

490
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:28,004
Hello, I'm Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

491
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,172
I called you before.

492
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:30,340
Yeah.

493
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,205
-Are you Michelle Stowe?
-Yeah, I am. Come in.

494
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,741
It was at a birthday party.

495
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,050
I asked him to dance...

496
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,610
and then, I don't know...

497
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,480
we start kissin'.

498
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,015
I mean, I was shit-faced.

499
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,786
I came and put my hand
in his shirt...

500
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,698
then we went outside.

501
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,431
Guess at the end, I was just
straightening up a bit...

502
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,334
'cause I remember wondering...

503
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:12,913
what the hell I was doing.

504
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,191
Then he pulled me
into the bushes...

505
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,594
undid my dress.

506
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,997
It was a zip...

507
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,125
in the back.

508
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,674
I was so young.

509
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,849
I started to cry.

510
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,348
He put his hand
over my mouth and kept going.

511
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,297
He's strong.

512
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,288
There was nothing
I could do.

513
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:05,996
I tried to fight him.

514
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,044
When he was done,
he shook me...

515
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,773
and said something like...

516
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,549
"It's only sex.

517
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,540
"Just sex."

518
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:23,887
Then he got up...

519
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:27,050
and left the party
with his sister.

520
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:40,601
So, you want to write
an article about this, then?

521
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,407
I mean, he's not royal
or anything...

522
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:45,999
but it's close enough.

523
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,575
We can make some money
out of this, Joanna.

524
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,054
It doesn't work that way.

525
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,123
Yeah, it does.
Everybody's always blabbin'...

526
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,758
about who's stickin' it
into who.

527
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,453
They make plenty.

528
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,363
You have no proof.

529
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,696
This is a question of
"he said, she said."

530
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:14,170
Jesus, Alice, I can't
believe you did this.

531
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,639
What if she calls
my editor?

532
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,741
I could be fired.

533
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,342
Do you think
that nosy wives...

534
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,211
have immunity
from normal behavior?

535
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,679
I knew the minute
that I called...

536
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:23,780
that it was a mistake.

537
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,281
Sorry, Alice.

538
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,283
It's OK. I just--

539
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,485
I thought you should know
what I did.

540
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,253
It was really
just innocent curiosity.

541
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,222
It's never innocent.

542
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,859
Curiosity gets people killed.

543
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,460
What would you do
if it was your husband?

544
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,529
I don't have one.

545
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,097
You not only have one...

546
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,428
but one who's wild
about you.

547
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,795
You're right.
I have to trust him.

548
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,766
People have stories.

549
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,436
You and l, everyone.

550
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,305
But I couldn't tell you
one complete story...

551
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,107
about my husband.

552
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,443
Practically everything
I knew about him...

553
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,579
came from a book
or a newspaper...

554
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,283
or shreds of information
dropped by other people.

555
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,552
I couldn't help myself.

556
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,918
I needed to know more.

557
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,912
"Adele Blanchard."

558
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,192
"It's crazy...

559
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,558
"but I want to show
the world my bruises."

560
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,099
"What we're doing
is dangerous...

561
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,727
"but I still can't help
wanting more."

562
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:36,346
"The only way to end this
is to be brutal.

563
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,649
"We have to stop
what we're doing.

564
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:43,119
"I've decided to go back
to my husband.

565
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,890
"I'm not strong enough to live
on the edge with you anymore.

566
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,192
"l know you won't fall,
but I will.

567
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,394
"I'm sure of it.

568
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,730
"This tears me apart...

569
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,499
"But I have to go back
to Michael.

570
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,635
"l love you.

571
00:58:58,635 --> 00:58:59,727
"Adele."

572
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,798
I've been thinking about you.

573
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,335
Me, too.

574
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,869
I called the office yesterday
looking for you.

575
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,404
Oh, yeah?

576
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:42,805
Claudia said
you weren't feeling well.

577
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,670
She thought you might be
at the doctor's.

578
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,211
I, um...

579
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,413
I had an appointment,
but, um...

580
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:51,778
I never got out
of my meeting.

581
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,064
Where was the meeting?

582
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,157
At the, um, client's hotel.

583
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:18,608
Which hotel?

584
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:19,905
The Hilton.

585
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,510
I'm sorry for being nosy.

586
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,245
I just like to picture
what you do during the day.

587
01:01:57,947 --> 01:01:59,972
Where'd you get this?

588
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,548
Deborah gave it to me.

589
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,615
She has good taste.

590
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,271
I got a call about, um...

591
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,501
a weird call
about the article.

592
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,611
There was this woman
named Michelle Stowe.

593
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,169
She sent a fax.

594
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:34,450
Didn't happen, Alice.

595
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,474
I never raped her.

596
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,620
I shouldn't have...

597
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,692
I've known her
since we were kids.

598
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,786
I think she saw me
as a way out.

599
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:50,032
If you met her,
you'd understand.

600
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:52,159
I'm not surprised
she contacted you.

601
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,896
I'm just sorry
you had to hear all that.

602
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:10,653
Good morning.

603
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:11,654
Hi there.
Are you ready?

604
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:13,554
I'll just get my jacket.

605
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:21,397
I'm sorry to barge in
like that...

606
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,199
but your husband refuses
to understand the fact...

607
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,034
that sponsors need talk shows...

608
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:28,162
and he would only show up
if I drove.

609
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:34,744
Why didn't you tell me...

610
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:36,412
you were gonna be
on a talk show?

611
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,209
It's just
a stupid jazz show.

612
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,306
Directory inquiries.

613
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,841
Yes. Adele Blanchard.

614
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:47,109
Which city, please?

615
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:48,177
It's London.

616
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,912
Do you have a listing
for Adele Blanchard...

617
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:51,480
on Marchmont Road?

618
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,469
One moment.

619
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,863
This train is about to depart.

620
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:09,694
Please mind the doors.

621
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,990
I'm looking
for Adele Blanchard.

622
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:41,831
I'm her mother.

623
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,196
Is she home?

624
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,437
You must be one
of her American friends.

625
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:50,928
We tried to contact everyone.

626
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,805
She's been missing
for eight months.

627
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,750
Missing?

628
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,240
What did you say
your name was?

629
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,055
Joanna.

630
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:09,091
She never tried
to contact her husband?

631
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:10,493
Not even a letter
to an old boyfriend...

632
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,894
or something?

633
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:14,764
Eight months
and not a word.

634
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,533
And this is from a daughter...

635
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,696
who manages to e-mail
her mother from Nepal.

636
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:30,780
Joanna, promise me you'll never
think the worst about Adele.

637
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,315
It helps a little...

638
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:35,647
if one tries to be positive.

639
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:48,330
She was so happy that day.

640
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,230
No jitters, nothing.

641
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,534
Do you know him?

642
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,141
Adam Tallis.

643
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,445
She climbed all over
the world with him.

644
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:04,780
My son-in-law Michael...

645
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,748
is a trader in Milan.

646
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,753
At first, he never
stood in her way...

647
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,981
when it came to climbing.

648
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,192
Then after two years,
he got fed up.

649
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:19,762
It was either climbing
or the marriage.

650
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,389
She chose the marriage.

651
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,893
The day before she was
supposed to go back to Milan...

652
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,606
she went out...

653
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,665
and never came back.

654
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:38,314
I found that
in her bags.

655
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:41,181
It's probably the last
picture taken of her.

656
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:48,958
Today I've had two signs
that Adele is close by.

657
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,017
You arrived,
and Adam called.

658
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,437
He wanted to know
if there was anything new...

659
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,098
in the investigation.

660
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:06,709
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

661
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,911
No, thank you.
I just--I have to get home.

662
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,503
It's really late.

663
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,083
I'm disappointed.

664
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,950
He should be here around 5:00.

665
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,281
You and Adam
would love each other.

666
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,295
Sit, sit.

667
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,024
I'll get it.

668
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,144
Is it all right if
I set it up for next week?

669
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:43,712
I haven't managed
to get to the bank yet.

670
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:46,115
Yes, of course.

671
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,484
Mrs. Blanchard.

672
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,519
I'm sorry, I just--
I have to get back.

673
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,887
I don't want
to be late.

674
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:53,055
I was hoping
you would stay a little.

675
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,579
I'm sorry.

676
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,110
This train is about to depart.

677
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,101
Please mind the doors.

678
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,091
What are you doing?!

679
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,423
What am I doing?
I'm making you mine.

680
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:02,104
Sometimes I feel
like I don't know you.

681
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,696
Oh, you know me.

682
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:07,967
You know everything
you need to know.

683
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:11,735
Look at me.

684
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,081
Open your eyes.

685
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,122
Please.

686
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,590
Open your eyes!

687
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:36,698
You've been with another man.

688
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,310
No.

689
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,946
What are you doing, then?

690
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,743
What's going on in there?

691
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,818
Why do you keep sneaking around?

692
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,820
Is the suspicion exciting?

693
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,720
Do you need it go get off?
What is it?

694
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,719
I found Adele's letters.

695
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,332
You...

696
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,267
found...

697
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,859
her letters?

698
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,101
Is that how
you tell the story?

699
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,675
What, they were just...

700
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,344
sitting with my keys
on the table...

701
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,902
and you just happened
to notice them?

702
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,062
Look what I just
happened to find!

703
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,698
These and these!

704
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,066
And I found these!
Here, read them!

705
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:40,432
I have nothing to hide, Alice!

706
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,517
Did you sneak around
behind my back because you...

707
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,361
need it to get
rougher and rougher?

708
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:08,192
I mean, is that it?

709
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:10,933
I'm trying
to understand you, Alice.

710
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,561
If you do this,
will I punish you?

711
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:16,967
Is that what your goal...

712
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,418
Please untie me.

713
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,545
If you trusted me...

714
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:35,789
you wouldn't be
in this position, Alice.

715
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,631
I just...

716
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:44,700
I wanted to know more...

717
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,401
about you.

718
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,704
And I wanted
to know your past...

719
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:51,138
and I wanted to know
your stories.

720
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,110
I just thought
if I knew more...

721
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,908
that I could love you more.

722
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:04,252
I know the only thing
that matters is us together.

723
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:05,821
I know that.

724
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:08,090
Because when
you're not around...

725
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,192
I get lost.

726
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:13,184
It drives me crazy
to think about losing you.

727
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,432
I'm yours, Alice.

728
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:27,070
What more do you need to know?

729
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:39,610
I could break your neck,
I love you so much.

730
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,062
Do you want to stay here?

731
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,324
I mean...

732
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,160
do you like this?

733
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:58,168
Adam, I have to pee.

734
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,080
My God.

735
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,357
Alice, please,
don't do this! Alice!

736
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,659
Please!

737
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,137
Where are you going?!

738
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,211
Alice, please!

739
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:11,236
What are you doing?!

740
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:41,665
And that's when
I came to you.

741
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,423
I want to be clear
with you.

742
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,725
In my experience,
charges of domestic violence...

743
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,260
are usually too little
too late.

744
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,728
I want you to reopen
the Adele Blanchard case.

745
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,133
It's not easy
to reopen a case like this.

746
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:13,969
Britain is swimming
in missing persons.

747
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,103
He killed her.

748
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:17,105
Mrs. Tallis, any case...

749
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:21,076
missing person or murder,
needs evidence.

750
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:22,744
I have to ask you
what you have.

751
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:25,110
Adele's letters?

752
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,249
No.

753
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:28,884
Warning notes?

754
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,319
No.

755
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,188
You have...

756
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,587
two photos.

757
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:39,261
Proof of nothing.

758
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:40,896
He raped Michelle.

759
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,488
She never reported it.

760
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,635
Start without me.
I'll be there in a bit.

761
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,515
I'd like to help you,
Mrs. Tallis.

762
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:09,821
What everyone else
does to be like him.

763
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,827
He can't see you.

764
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:15,230
She's pretty shaken up.

765
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,399
Is she? I mean,
is she hurt?

766
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,367
She--Jesus, she was
running into traffic.

767
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:20,869
Let's get a doctor.

768
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:23,235
She'll be fine.

769
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,605
I would never hurt her.

770
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,480
I love her.

771
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,282
You brought him in?

772
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:37,852
He walked in,
looking for you.

773
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,087
He brought in
a pair of shoes.

774
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:41,078
He was worried
about your feet.

775
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,396
I believe your husband...

776
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:51,266
has the potential
for violence.

777
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:54,135
I believe he's unpredictable.

778
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,433
But is he a murderer?

779
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,037
I don't know.

780
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:02,877
The truth is, what you two
have been doing together...

781
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:04,469
was consensual.

782
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,107
You said it yourself.

783
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:09,841
You liked it.

784
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,266
Can you close the blinds?

785
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:48,886
I won't be able to keep him
for much more than a few hours.

786
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:53,194
That's as much of a window
as I can give you.

787
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,997
You're accusing a hero,
Mrs. Tallis...

788
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:58,625
and you have
absolutely no evidence.

789
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:14,449
Alice, what's happened to you?

790
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,551
Oh, Deborah, I'm sorry.

791
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,253
I'm not crazy,
I just--I just--

792
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:19,487
I went to
the police station...

793
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,856
but no one believed me,
and I just--I just--

794
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,124
He came in and he
brought my shoes...

795
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,426
and they thought
I was nuts...

796
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:25,693
but, I mean, I know
he's your brother...

797
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:27,228
but, I mean,
you were her friend, too.

798
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,097
Maybe you could, um--

799
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:30,365
Look, you remember when
you said that you were...

800
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:32,834
either with him or not,
no discussion?

801
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,969
Well, I'm--I'm not--
I'm trying to understand.

802
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:39,201
I--I just, I want to ask,
I mean, um--uh...

803
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:43,539
Was Francoise
with someone else?

804
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:51,707
Yes.

805
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:57,325
It wasn't an accident.

806
01:24:57,325 --> 01:24:58,553
She left him...

807
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,461
so he killed her.

808
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:11,127
Maybe.

809
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,852
This is the anchor
that we used.

810
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,788
It's made of titanium,
but the important thing is...

811
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,791
it can hold
2,000 falling pounds.

812
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,126
I've got a friend
in Kathmandu...

813
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,928
who sent me an anchor
that they're making locally...

814
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:35,597
with the wrong material.

815
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:39,467
This is what happened
with just seventy-five pounds.

816
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,736
Maybe you're right.

817
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:43,738
Adam could have
switched the anchors...

818
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:44,966
for Francoise's group.

819
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:51,205
He killed them.

820
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:31,920
Leave him, Alice.

821
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,388
I know him.

822
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:35,083
You have to leave him,
for your own good.

823
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:41,196
Deborah...Deborah,
it's not the only time.

824
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,330
What?

825
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,932
I think that, um,
he was with a woman...

826
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,233
Adele Blanchard,
and I think...

827
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:47,302
that she was gonna leave him
to go back to her husband...

828
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:50,135
and--and I think that--
that he killed her.

829
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:53,641
Adele was never gonna
go back to Michael.

830
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:56,075
Everyone knew
their marriage was over.

831
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:59,143
I read her letters.

832
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:03,083
She ended it with Adam.

833
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:07,055
And, uh, Ijust, um...

834
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,991
I think that, uh,
that she's there.

835
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:10,980
What?

836
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,129
I went to the police.

837
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:16,130
The police,
they won't do anything.

838
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,119
They need evidence.

839
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:21,236
I think he buried her here...

840
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,294
at Saint Edmund's.

841
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:25,363
I need you
to help me find her.

842
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:28,408
Do you want to go with me?

843
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:44,447
I have a confession to make.

844
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:47,819
I sent you those notes.

845
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:52,533
I know about
my brother's violence.

846
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:54,057
I've seen it.

847
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:59,007
I should have done more, but--

848
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:00,599
it's no excuse--

849
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,306
but he scares me.

850
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,278
I'm glad you got away
from him, Alice.

851
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:15,652
You'll be OK now.

852
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:54,856
Can I take that?

853
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,153
Yeah, sure.

854
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:00,225
I think it's here.

855
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:04,892
He took the pictures
just by the angel.

856
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:48,741
Oh, my God.

857
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:32,716
She didn't have to die.

858
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:37,658
If only she'd told me...

859
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,523
she was going back
to Michael.

860
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:43,755
Yeah.

861
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:48,067
I gave her one, too.

862
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:52,039
She thought it was beautiful,
just like you did.

863
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:54,064
Why did you do this?!

864
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:02,383
Who do you think gave him
his first piece of silk?

865
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:04,018
He was just 15!

866
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:06,646
I'm talking
about fucking, Alice!

867
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,953
That's right!
We fucked right here!

868
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,867
Adam is mine!

869
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:21,232
He's mine!

870
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:39,754
Why?!

871
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:42,490
I was never yours!

872
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:45,118
We were kids. Kids!

873
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:48,763
It's over.

874
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:50,025
It's all over.

875
01:32:58,306 --> 01:32:59,739
Oh, God.

876
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:04,736
She and l...

877
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:11,939
We used to come
here together.

878
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:20,881
I just thought
you had to trust me.

879
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,836
And that's how it ended.

880
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:13,207
Yet not a day goes by...

881
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:16,577
without at least one thought
about the passion.

882
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:18,979
Maybe I was so blinded by it...

883
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:23,109
that I missed all the clues
to his past.

884
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:35,162
I often wonder...

885
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:36,497
what would have happened...

886
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:39,227
if I hadn't looked up
that morning.

887
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:52,175
Two years later,
I saw him once more.

888
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:31,513
I don't know.

889
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,855
Maybe a flatlander like me...

890
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:37,255
can't live at that altitude.

891
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:40,227
Maybe it never would
have been possible...

892
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:42,559
to sustain what we had.

893
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:45,020
Maybe.

894
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:49,863
Well, that's what
I tell myself.
