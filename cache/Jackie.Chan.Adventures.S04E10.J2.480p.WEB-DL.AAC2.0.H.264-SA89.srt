1
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:09,541
We should be home
preparing to celebrate
Chinese new year,

2
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,878
not running around
on a wild goose chase.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,880
Uncle's new <i> chi</i> detector

4
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:18,283
registers disturbing
levels of dark <i> chi.</i>

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,185
Are you sure, uncle?

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,322
You jury-rigged
an old metal detector,

7
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,957
and we are in a--

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,125
is it just me,

9
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,260
or is this place
a dump?

10
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,896
Aah! Jade,
what are you doing here?

11
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,766
Spending
Chinese new year
with my loved ones.

12
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>(Chi</i> detector crackles)

13
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,669
(Gasps)

14
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,338
Dark <i> chi!</i>

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,920
You're not supposed
to be here.

16
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,223
I must be running late.

17
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,792
For what?
Halloween?

18
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:02,494
Look, Jade has
to get out of here...Now!

19
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,229
Me? What'd I--

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,631
hey! How do you
know my name?

21
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,132
Who are you,

22
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,101
and what do you want
with Jade?

23
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,737
Not me. Him!

24
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,080
(Gasps)
Dark <i> chi.</i>

25
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,699
Look out!

26
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,902
Aah!

27
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,103
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

28
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,105
Dark magic?

29
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,708
He won't be down for long.
Let's go!

30
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,810
Jade is not going
anywhere.

31
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,347
Hyah!
(Grunts)

32
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,648
Whoa!

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,684
Sorry,
but I don't have time
to negotiate.

34
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,020
I said Jade stays.

35
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,172
Who is this stranger?

36
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,908
Beats me,
but she kinda rocks.

37
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,186
Heyee!

38
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,221
Nephew has
slow reflexes,

39
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:12,024
but if you want
piece of uncle...

40
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,099
Jade!

41
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,805
(Sniffs)

42
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,242
Stranger uses
good <i> chi</i> magic?

43
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:33,145
Good or bad,
she kidnapped Jade.

44
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,418
You find Jade.

45
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,020
Uncle will find
dark <i> chi.</i>

46
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,425
I think
I'm gonna hurl!

47
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,260
This from the girl
who rode the pukinator

48
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,295
10 times in a row
at moose world?

49
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,897
Jade: Hey...
How'd you know that?

50
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,899
Talk later.

51
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,567
Now, wait a second!

52
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,804
We have
to keep moving,
Jade.

53
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,038
Trust me.

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,206
Uncle Jackie told me--

55
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,341
to never trust
strangers,

56
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,609
never chew
- with your mouth open,

57
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,110
and never spit
into the wind.

58
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,311
Duh.

59
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,913
Whoa. Time out.

60
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,881
Are you...

61
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,786
You?

62
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,054
Took you
long enough.

63
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:19,091
If you're me,
then you must be...

64
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,593
From the future!

65
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,595
Double bonus score.

66
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,732
But how? Why?

67
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,034
I'll give you
the download
on the way.

68
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,669
(Whistles)

69
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,804
I learned
to whistle like that?

70
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,173
Cool!

71
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,481
Jade!

72
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,982
(Ice cream truck jingles)

73
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,924
Follow that cab!

74
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,529
I will buy an ice cream.

75
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,830
A dozen.

76
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,332
Deal.

77
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,501
Jade: So they have
- time machines in the future?

78
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,902
How old do I look?

79
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,071
I used
one of uncle's spells.

80
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,040
Hey...
Do I ever get braces?

81
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,241
No.

82
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,375
Acne?

83
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,510
Some.

84
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,944
Wild threads
like those?

85
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,780
Section 13
standard wear.

86
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,783
I grow up to be
a section 13 agent?!

87
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,085
Boss. You take--

88
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,853
I took over
for captain black

89
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,455
after he was transferred
to the east coast

90
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,190
to start up section 14.

91
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,293
Me?! The big cheese
of section 13?!

92
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,395
We rock!

93
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,004
So why didn't you
just tell Jackie and uncle
who you were back there?

94
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,906
Didn't have time
to convince them.

95
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,507
Too busy trying
to save the future.

96
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,010
From what?

97
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,513
Him! Shendu's son.

98
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,950
Please.
Call me drago.

99
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,856
Hey, you two related?

100
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,625
Because I definitely
see a resemblance here.

101
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,694
Resemble this,
junior!

102
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,896
Aah!

103
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,766
That's how
you blasted him
in the junk yard.

104
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,167
The dragon talisman:

105
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,969
Never leave the future
without it.

106
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,778
Whoa!
Whoa!

107
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,889
(Grunts)

108
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,725
Drago's a hothead.

109
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,293
Like father,
like son.

110
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,102
Dive! Unh!

111
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,379
Fire magic.
- It does a talisman good.

112
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,447
Good news is

113
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,115
we still have one
just like it

114
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,316
in the vault
at section 13.

115
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,519
Bad news is
we're not at section 13.

116
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,261
Whoa!
Whoa!

117
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,630
Heh. Parade float.

118
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,765
Heh. Chinese new year.

119
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,440
Well, Jade...

120
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,042
We played
follow the leader
into the past,

121
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,812
so why not
hide-and-seek?

122
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,246
You distract lizard lips,

123
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,282
and I'll jump him
from behind.

124
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,516
Wha--

125
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,318
if drago
bumps you off
in the present,

126
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,220
I could
pop right out
of existence,

127
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,189
and the future'll
be history.

128
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:41,092
Whoa. This time travel stuff
is freaky.

129
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,700
Kick some tail!

130
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,538
(Grunts)

131
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,615
Look, Jade has
nothing to do with this.

132
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,884
Talk later!
Talk later!

133
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:11,623
Ahh, Mr. Jackie chan.
My <i> dad</i> sends his best.

134
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,527
Your father?
Who is your father?

135
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:20,031
Aah! Never mind!
I have a pretty good idea,
thank you!

136
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,334
(Grunts)

137
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:31,643
There's nothing more festive
than fireworks!

138
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,978
(Gasp)

139
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,047
No!

140
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:40,318
(Whimpers)

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,386
Aah!

142
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,256
Happy new year,
everyone.

143
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,757
(Chuckles)

144
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,059
It's gonna blow!

145
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,368
Aah!

146
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,277
Aah!

147
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,445
(Grunts)

148
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,522
Jade!

149
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,157
Yes, Jackie?
Yes, Jackie?

150
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,394
Explain?

151
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,663
I didn't intend
to involve you guys,

152
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:27,566
but I arrived
a lot later
than I'd hoped.

153
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,668
Heh. Never tested
uncle's spell.

154
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,172
Oh! And I thought
one Jade gave me
a headache.

155
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,541
But why did you
come back here?

156
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,177
Duh! Isn't it obvious?

157
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,645
Future me is so mega-bad

158
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,247
that dragon-boy
had to come back to the past

159
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,982
to rub me out
while I'm just a squirt.

160
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,684
So I surfed the time waves
here to protect myself

161
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,186
and his kick his scaly butt
all the way back to
the future.

162
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,890
Then why did drago leave
without charbroiling you?

163
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,825
Well, because...

164
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,094
Yeah,
why did drago leave?

165
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,563
Because he has
bigger fish to fry.

166
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,764
How much bigger?

167
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,466
I didn't
follow drago here.

168
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,168
Drago followed me

169
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,805
to keep me
from putting the kibosh
on the age of dragons.

170
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,106
Age of dragons?

171
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,009
I do not like
the sound of that.

172
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,613
Soon after I became
section 13's head honcho,

173
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,782
Sonny boy made it to the top
of our most wanted list.

174
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,584
Luckily,
I convinced you and uncle

175
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:23,922
to become section 13's
official magic consultants.

176
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:28,927
You mean
I never leave
section 13?!

177
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,330
But even you and uncle
couldn't prevent
what happened next.

178
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,900
Junior dusted off
an old spell
of his dad's

179
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,871
and conjured up an army
of dragon minions,

180
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,272
giving him
more than enough muscle

181
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,508
to take over section 13.

182
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,943
I soon realized
the only way

183
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,946
to save the future...

184
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,714
Was to change the past.

185
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,487
It took some doing,

186
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,390
but I escaped
drago's troops.

187
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,943
But junior got wise
to my plan

188
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,646
and hitched a ride
on uncle's spell.

189
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,284
Whoa!
So all this
already happened?!

190
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,886
In the future?!

191
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,888
There is one thing
you have not told us.

192
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,292
What exactly is drago trying
to stop you from changing
in the past?

193
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,061
He's trying to stop me
from preventing

194
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,763
the resurrection
of his father.

195
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,331
Shendu.

196
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,169
Uncle: Hmm.

197
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:52,377
Source of dark <i> chi</i>
must lie here.

198
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,722
(Gasps) Ayah!

199
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,424
Dragon teeth!

200
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,928
More dark <i> chi?</i>

201
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,797
Hey! What do you know?

202
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,300
I'm off the scale.

203
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,802
Drago's
racing to protect
the magic dragon teeth

204
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,637
that'll revive
his father.

205
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,606
I have to get
to them first

206
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,341
and destroy them
by midnight.

207
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,676
Why midnight?

208
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,644
The moment
I left the future
it was sunset--

209
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,247
the evening before
Chinese new year.

210
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,152
The exact time
you arrived here.

211
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,922
And in the future,
drago has already cast
the dragon teeth spell.

212
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,424
So if we don't
destroy the teeth,

213
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,626
shendu makes
his big comeback

214
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,963
at the stroke
of Chinese new year.

215
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,464
Big whoop.

216
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,400
Future Jackie
and future uncle
can beat future shendu.

217
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,302
They've done it before.

218
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,340
Jackie and uncle
were taken prisoner

219
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,575
during the dragon raid
on section 13.

220
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:01,846
They're set
to become shendu's
"welcome back" snack...

221
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,282
In 15 minutes.

222
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,858
(Both grunt)

223
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,975
The good news--

224
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,777
I know where
the teeth are buried.

225
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,512
And the bad news?

226
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,048
The can only
be destroyed by magic,

227
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,784
and there's no time
for a talisman run.

228
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,654
No problem.
Uncle's always packing
hocus pocus.

229
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,000
We're too late!

230
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,002
Jackie: Uncle.

231
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,871
You don't think he's--

232
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,006
Jackie!

233
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,276
We must retrieve teeth!

234
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,980
Oh!

235
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,883
I imagine
- grampy's referring to...

236
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,185
These little choppers!

237
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,689
You're taking a risk
hanging around here,
aren't you, drago?

238
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,291
Can't go anywhere
without my ride.

239
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,492
What's he mean?

240
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,161
Time-travel spell.

241
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,496
Never leave the future
without a return ticket.

242
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,932
Dad's homecoming
is just minutes away,

243
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,236
and I really
don't want to miss
the appetizers.

244
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,171
No deal, drago.

245
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,639
How about this...

246
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,341
Hand me the spell,

247
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,576
or the old guy
goes bungee jumping

248
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,211
without a bungee.

249
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,252
(Snarls)

250
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:50,088
Have it your way!

251
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:55,593
Ayah!

252
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,865
(Grunts)

253
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,601
Stay here!

254
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,637
Oh!

255
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,116
Hyah!

256
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,554
Like old times.

257
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,356
Sorry, scaly.

258
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,158
I'm not
the sentimental type.

259
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,660
Hyah!

260
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,867
Hurry, slowpoke!

261
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,169
Uncle at end
of his rope!

262
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,751
Ayah!

263
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,324
Jackie, do not know
what young dragon's
up to,

264
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,426
but teeth are very evil.

265
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,928
You do not know
the half of it.

266
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,940
Unh!

267
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,878
Sometimes
the future is now.

268
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,848
(Growls)

269
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,852
Apologies
for my bad breath.

270
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,487
Hyah!

271
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,090
(Grunts)

272
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,694
You were
supposed to stay put.

273
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,896
Tch. You know me
better than that.

274
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,165
My, what big teeth you have.

275
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,371
We're almost
out of time.

276
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,209
(Imitates buzzer)

277
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,443
You lose.

278
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,580
Dad just got
his wake-up call.

279
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:10,595
I live again!

280
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,366
No finer way
- to emerge from a slumber

281
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:20,471
than to a nice hot cup
of revenge.

282
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:24,242
Say, are you sure
he's shendu's kid?

283
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,544
Who?
The tooth fairy here?

284
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,347
Tch. I mean,
shendu had edge.

285
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,349
But this drago
dude's more like--

286
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,985
a gecko with zits?

287
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,162
No!

288
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,238
No! Not again!

289
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,909
Aah!

290
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,817
Teeth do not disintegrate
all by themselves.

291
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,654
Jade.
Jade.

292
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,262
I shall destroy you
now and forever!

293
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,137
Told you a thousand times,

294
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,739
magic must defeat magic.

295
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,142
Where did teeth go?

296
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:35,213
Dragon's firebreath
is magic. Duh.

297
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,748
Who is smarty-pants,
good <i> chi</i> magic know-it-all

298
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,517
who looks like Jade?

299
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,186
Ayah!

300
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,365
The dragons
will rise again!

301
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,368
(Echoing)
Again! Again! Again!

302
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,737
I really appreciate
you saving me the hassle

303
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,506
of hauling
drago's scaly tail

304
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,374
all the way back
to the future.

305
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,377
Aww, do you have
to go back so soon?

306
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,712
We haven't
gone rollerblading

307
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,381
or--or mastered the pukinator
at moose world!

308
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,616
Been there,
done that.

309
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,217
Besides,
don't you think--

310
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,219
hanging around with myself
is a little weird?

311
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,421
Yeah. We'd probably
just sit around all day...

312
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,224
Both jades: Finishing
each other's sentences?

313
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,160
One more thing.

314
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:26,230
Future uncle allows you
to use his spells?

315
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:30,368
Oh, uh, yeah.
Total access.

316
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,370
You really mellow out
as you age.

317
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,640
Tch. As if.

318
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,241
Oh, almost forgot.

319
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,243
Pop quiz tomorrow
in spelling.

320
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,846
Study chapter 8.

321
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,349
Uh, Jade...

322
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:50,021
Thank you for saving
our, uh, lives.

323
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,622
Be careful.

324
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,292
And I just
wanted you to know,

325
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,061
I am proud of who
you turned out to be.

326
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,363
I owe who
I turned out to be

327
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,466
to one person,
uncle Jackie.

328
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,069
You. Duh.

329
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,586
Hey, Jackie,
how do you celebrate
Chinese new year?

330
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:24,789
We do a celebration
that everybody wear red.

331
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,926
Everything's--new socks,
new shoes, new tee shirt.
Everything is new.

332
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,796
I would book the hotel
with all my staff together.

333
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,199
I sing karaoke,
play a little bit of games,

334
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,335
and I give a red envelope.

335
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,104
We have, like,
a Chinese tradition
of red envelopes.

336
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,505
Put some money inside,

337
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:44,275
then I will say
<i>"gong xi fa cai,"</i>

338
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,010
it's "happy new year,"

339
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,311
traditional Chinese new year.
