1
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,750
Son of a...

2
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,875
I'm not leaving.

3
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,193
Walt, I'm not leaving.

4
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,634
Oh, my God.

5
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,388
I can hear your cell phone ringing.

6
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,752
This is ridiculous. I can't...

7
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,117
What is going on with you?
I've left you, like, 23 messages.

8
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,278
- And?
- And?

9
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,228
We need to talk about the car wash.

10
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,874
Skyler,
now is not a good time for me, okay?

11
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,674
- Can we talk about this later?
- No, okay? We can't.

12
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,039
Why are you doing-?

13
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,392
Oh, Jesus.

14
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,433
- What happened?
- Nothing. I just bumped it. That's all.

15
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,154
Okay, I'm- I'm coming in.

16
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,109
Okay.

17
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,039
Exactly what happened?

18
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,511
It's complicated
and I don't wish to discuss it.

19
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,598
- It's none of your concern.
- Are you in danger?

20
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,113
Walt.

21
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,629
Walt, I need you to look me in the eye
and tell me right now.

22
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,070
- Are you in danger?
- You know what?

23
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,757
Let's just say that I have a hell
of a lot more on my mind right now...

24
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,758
...than thinking about buying
a damn car wash.

25
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,995
Okay?

26
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,077
So if you could you just -

27
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,077
Please.

28
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,873
Okay.

29
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,954
Okay. Then we go to the police.

30
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,675
- What?
- We tell them everything.

31
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,952
That you're a drug dealer
afraid for your safety...

32
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,197
...and the safety of your family
and you need help.

33
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,637
- What choice is there?
- What choice?

34
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,035
If you're in danger then it would be -

35
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,390
Wait, wait, stop, stop. Stop.

36
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,068
You keep saying that word.
"Danger. " "Danger."

37
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,794
- But you said -
- No, I have never used that word.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,798
I said "complicated"
and then you flew off the handle.

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,912
Yeah, I flew off the handle
when I saw that.

40
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,759
Okay? Where'd that come from?

41
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,595
A fall in the shower?

42
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,475
This is just so passive-aggressive,
you know.

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,715
Passive-aggressive?

44
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,356
I go two days without returning
your phone calls, two days...

45
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,678
...and I have one minor little incident,
and now you're telling me...

46
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,394
...that I should turn myself
in to the police!

47
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,749
- A minor incident?
- Yes.

48
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,713
What minor little incident?

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,629
I had an argument with a coworker,
okay?

50
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,269
And?

51
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,109
I had an argument.

52
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,117
We were in this bar...

53
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,312
...and we were discussing
a particular business strategy.

54
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,277
And it got heated and out of control,
and he hit me. Once.

55
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,472
And I didn't retaliate
because he's a much older man.

56
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,750
And that's it.

57
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,555
You were in a bar fight?

58
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,074
Yes, Skyler. I was in a bar fight.

59
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,550
So you're okay?

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,958
Really?

61
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,919
Yes.

62
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,792
I'm okay.

63
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,557
And I think, in the end,
that it may have been a good thing...

64
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,752
...because we were able to clear the air
and, you know...

65
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,871
Mutual respect, and...

66
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,278
So...

67
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,192
Frozen peas.

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,914
- What?
- It's the best thing for the swelling.

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,476
Oh, it's not really swollen, it's just -

70
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,432
No peas.

71
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,513
You don't even have ice.

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,679
I will get peas, I will get ice.
Peas and ice, I'm writing it down.

73
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,713
I...

74
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,031
I need you to promise me...

75
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,630
...that if things do get dangerous -

76
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,274
- Skyler -
- Promise me.

77
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,592
Absolutely.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,353
So...

79
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,597
Car wash.

80
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,033
Honey. Charles.

81
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,632
Take a look at this kitchen.

82
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,718
Hi there.
Can I answer any questions?

83
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,275
Yes. Any chance of a top off?

84
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,029
Oh, I think we can
help you out there.

85
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,755
So, what do you think?

86
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,918
Oh, very nice. Very open.

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,270
Oh, I agree. It flows.

88
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,596
Whole lot of natural light.

89
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,994
Michael Kilbourne.

90
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,668
- Tori Costner.
- It's nice to meet you.

91
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,509
Well, three bedrooms, one and a half
baths on just under half an acre.

92
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,359
There's a non-attached casita
out in back.

93
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,916
Permit useable as office
or guest suite.

94
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,473
Plank wood floors.

95
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,033
Central heat and air.

96
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,238
I see you're married.

97
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,998
No, divorced.

98
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,428
Very recent.

99
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,471
- Old habits.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,956
- But any children?
- Yes, as a matter of fact. A little boy.

101
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,559
Oh, how old?

102
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,797
He turned 4 in May. He's a Gemini.
Would love this yard.

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,911
Oh, plenty of space for a jungle gym.

104
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,759
And the neighbourhood preschool
is fantastic.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,195
I think Eli is going to be
homeschooled.

106
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,470
- Well, great.
- Not for religious reasons.

107
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,955
I wanna make sure
he's getting attention.

108
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,913
He'll still go to summer camp
and whatnot, playdates.

109
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,237
- Don't want him to be socially awkward.
- Makes sense.

110
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,278
He tests very highly, 96 percentile.

111
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,393
But that whole right brain, left brain.
You want those in balance.

112
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,635
Oh, yeah.

113
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,310
You said the casita has plumbing?

114
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,308
I work a lot with clay,
so I need access to running water.

115
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,353
Well, it's pipe fitted
for a quarter bath so...

116
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,835
Make a perfect studio.

117
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,915
This could work.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,037
Hell, that's the doctor's plan
to get her patients at ease.

119
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,272
If you know what I mean.

120
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,708
But, nurse -

121
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,751
Hello? I'm back.

122
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,393
That's okay.

123
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,989
- Hank?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,836
I had to go to three places
to get the moisturizer that you like.

125
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,234
But I got that.

126
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,319
And I got your Shiner Bock
and your chips.

127
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,512
And I couldn't resist.

128
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,511
The complete encyclopaedia
to fantasy football.

129
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,350
- Look, it has all the latest rankings.
- Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos.

130
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,549
Wait, I...

131
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,911
I said Cheetos, like, 10 times.
You need me to write it down?

132
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,839
No, and I don't need you to be mean
about it either.

133
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,828
Well, I'm just saying, you know,
I said Cheetos... sound.

134
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,033
Virtually impossible to confuse
Cheetos with Fritos, seems to me.

135
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,153
- Where are you going?
- I- Back to the store, I guess.

136
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,713
Here.

137
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,753
And the draft's not for two months,
so this is useless.

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,911
Can you believe it?

139
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,358
What?

140
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,835
What? This.

141
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,993
Well, you always said this place
could be bugged.

142
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,111
- Now we know.
- Yeah, well.

143
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,278
I don't like it.

144
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,869
It's a violation of the work space.

145
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,473
Yeah, I guess.

146
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,870
You wanna do something?

147
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,593
Do something?

148
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,392
Like what?

149
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,757
Go-karts?

150
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,592
Go-karts. What-?

151
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,749
Yeah, there's a track
down by the Coliseum.

152
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,871
It's pretty fun.

153
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:10,158
No, actually I have
some kind of a meeting, so...

154
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,509
All right, whatever.

155
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,074
Rain check?

156
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,589
Yeah. Sure.

157
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,878
How you doing?

158
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,880
- Good.
- Yeah?

159
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,037
You okay?

160
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,877
Is there anything
we should talk about?

161
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,231
How's your eye?

162
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,869
Yeah, it's fine.

163
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,073
Anything we should talk about?

164
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,915
For what it's worth...

165
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,954
...getting the shit kicked out of you...

166
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,355
...not to say you get used to it...

167
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,199
...but you do kind of get used to it.

168
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,955
Two words: nail salon.

169
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,193
Perfect for money laundering.

170
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,312
It's a high-volume business
with a discreet work force.

171
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,080
I mean, nobody does,
"Mister, me know nothing"...

172
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,635
...better than Mrs. Mookjaiaporn
and her gals.

173
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,239
Mr. Goodman -

174
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,429
"Saul," please.

175
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,710
Now, for the lady of the house.

176
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,070
Drum roll.
How about a lifetime supply...

177
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,430
...of French manicures
and enzyme peels?

178
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,676
Oh, yeah, go ahead. Pinch yourself.

179
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,952
We're not buying a nail salon,
Mr. Goodman.

180
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,196
- We're getting the car wash.
- I'm sorry.

181
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,517
Am I missing something here?
Didn't you already try that?

182
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,998
Yeah. I mean, Walt told me that you
took a run at this Bogdan character...

183
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,112
...and he wrestled you into submission
with his eyebrows.

184
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,118
Ten million,
that was the asking price, right?

185
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,073
Apparently, he upped it to 20.

186
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,074
Nice negotiating. Yeah, I mean,
hey, you bombed. It happens.

187
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,433
You were smart to call me. Now -

188
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,872
You just sit back, relax
and let a professional take over.

189
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,958
That's for me. Excuse me.

190
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,876
What do you want? I'm in a meeting.

191
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,913
Why didn't you think of that before?
It's not my...

192
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,111
I'm in a meeting.

193
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,236
Can Huell use your bathroom?

194
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,952
Huell?

195
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,432
Sure. The top of the stairs.

196
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,471
He'll be quick.

197
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,918
It's a stomach thing. It's...

198
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,951
So where were we?

199
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,830
- Professionalism.
- Yeah.

200
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,395
So if the guy won't sell, he won't sell.

201
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,433
I don't accept that.
I don't accept that he won't sell.

202
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,632
I think he just lacks the proper...

203
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,955
...motivation.

204
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,991
Motivation.

205
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,837
As in, "motivation" motivation? I mean,
just so we're on the same page here...

206
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,873
...are you saying we make him an offer
he can't refuse?

207
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,389
Nothing so dramatic as that, no.

208
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,352
Motivation.

209
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,478
Attitude adjustment.

210
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,078
This one, she's a keeper.

211
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,396
Well,
an audit can be highly motivating.

212
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,352
I know a gal at Tax and Revenue.

213
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,791
You give her 10 minutes,
she'll have his sky raining frogs.

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,595
No, we don't want to draw
any unwanted tax attention.

215
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,872
We don't want them looking at us
after Bogdan sells.

216
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,674
All right, how about an ICE raid?

217
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,394
He's got illegals working over there.
He has to.

218
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,149
We are not getting a bunch
of poor innocent people in trouble, no.

219
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,796
Yeah, and also you're gonna need them
after you take over.

220
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,229
Hey, how about terrorism?

221
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,316
"Oh, Agent Hoover, I gotta tell you...

222
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,513
...I've seen some real Islamic comings
and goings over there at the car wash.

223
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,395
Yeah, I mean, guys in turbans
pulling up in vans and stuff like that."

224
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,956
Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.

225
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,234
Okay, well,
we're just spitballing here, so...

226
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,188
Okay, there's always:

227
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,555
"You got a real nice place here.

228
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,193
Be a shame if something
happened to it. " That angle.

229
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,233
What are you talking about?

230
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,711
Violence?

231
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,628
Attitude adjustment.

232
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,875
Oh, no. That, no.

233
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,197
That is not at all what I meant.
I- We do not do that.

234
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,789
That's not who we are, right?

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,549
Yeah, no, no, no. She's right.

236
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,718
Look, do I need to state the obvious?

237
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,879
I mean, there's gotta be dozens
of car washes in this area.

238
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,514
Who says it has to be this one?

239
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,519
I do.

240
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,519
I say it has to.

241
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,199
Why?

242
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,318
I just do.

243
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,158
God.

244
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,273
Well, that clears things up.

245
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,710
I don't like him. Bogdan.

246
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,198
He was condescending to me,
rude about you, and I do not like him.

247
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,118
Simple as that.

248
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,590
Hey, nobody appreciates
a passionate woman more than I do.

249
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,518
But in this business -

250
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,756
And Walt can back me up on this.

251
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,032
- The number one rule
is don't take things personally.

252
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,550
What do you mean, rude about me?

253
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,350
Something along the lines
of you weren't man enough...

254
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,471
...to face him yourself.

255
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,117
- What?
- That you had to send your woman...

256
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,788
...to do your business for you.

257
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,869
Speaking as your lawyer, I'm gonna
go on record and say this is a bad idea.

258
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,913
- Now, I advise against -
- It's this one. It's this one.

259
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,876
Okay, so...

260
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,029
All we have to do is think
of a non-violent, unsuspicious way...

261
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,516
...to purchase the car wash,
that protects the innocents...

262
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,030
...and doesn't cost $20 million.

263
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,239
Don't everybody speak at once.

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,353
I like it.

265
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,913
Yeah.

266
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,639
Hi.

267
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,592
Can I answer any questions?

268
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,510
- Spoons.
- Yes, the owner is quite the collector.

269
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,473
Aren't they something?
One for each of the 50 states.

270
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,555
Puerto Rico is technically a territory.

271
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,757
You know, maybe they were thinking,
"Someday."

272
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,434
So no basement?

273
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,108
- No basement. Sorry.
- That's a problem.

274
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,710
My brother's in the Peace Corps
and won't be back for 18 months...

275
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,115
...and I said I'd hang on
to his furniture.

276
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,835
Well, if you're looking
for storage space, there's an attic area.

277
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,959
Well, an attic might be even better,
as long as it's dry.

278
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,639
- Let's take a tour.
- Okay.

279
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,718
Actually, I have a handout for you.

280
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,393
It has all the information.

281
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,512
- I'm Stephanie Doswell, by the way.
- Charlotte Blattner.

282
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,234
- So nice to meet you, Charlotte.
- You too.

283
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,839
So I told him point-blank.

284
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,272
You're my husband and I love you,
but you're 53 years old.

285
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,112
This job has just gotten too stressful
and difficult, and it's time to quit.

286
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,392
And, miracle of miracles,
he listened.

287
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,512
What a fascinating career
that must have been for him.

288
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,869
It was.

289
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,516
I mean,
NASA was like a second family to us...

290
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,395
...but, you know,
it was time for a new adventure.

291
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,435
So between his pension and the income
I bring in from hand modelling...

292
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,792
...we're, you know, comfortable.
When were these floors redone?

293
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,116
Two years ago.
The counters are brand-new.

294
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,231
I can tell. Travertine.

295
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,953
Nice.

296
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,954
- Any children?
- No.

297
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,879
I don't really want kids.

298
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,595
- Is that horrible for me to say?
- Not at all.

299
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,189
Not everyone has to have children.

300
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,034
You should talk to my husband.

301
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,151
Garbage disposal?

302
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,598
Check it out. Score, yo.

303
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,555
- Come on. Come on. What you got?
- You're going down!

304
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,276
I really love your home.

305
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,357
Oh, well, thank you, Mimi.

306
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,870
It has a very European feel.

307
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,469
- You think?
- Oh, I lived in London for years...

308
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,319
...so, yeah, this feels familiar.

309
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,638
Where in London?
I was stationed at Upwood in the '60s.

310
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,910
Downtown,
but we were almost never there.

311
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,874
My husband is an illustrator. We
travelled a lot. Paris, Italy, Denmark.

312
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,197
It was before the kids were in school,
so it was easy to pick up and go.

313
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,234
That was before my youngest, Lucy,
was diagnosed with endocarditis.

314
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,590
- Oh, my.
- Gosh, is that-?

315
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,076
It's a bacterial infection
of the heart valves. It's...

316
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,793
Yeah, it can be...

317
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,558
That's terrible.

318
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,988
Is she all right?

319
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,153
Your daughter?

320
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,679
Is she okay?

321
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,713
Yes. Thank you.

322
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,469
The doctors put in a prosthetic valve
so she's- Lucy's fine.

323
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,148
Running and walking, riding horses.

324
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,119
- Thank goodness.
- Yeah.

325
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,437
We're very lucky.

326
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,439
- Excuse me, miss.
- Very nice, thank you.

327
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,995
- I just called the police.
- Okay, then.

328
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,077
I know you stole that spoon.

329
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,918
What are you talking about?

330
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,872
You're a thief.

331
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,591
- Excuse me?
- And a liar.

332
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,995
Making stories up.
What's wrong with you?

333
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,872
No, what's the matter with you?

334
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,435
You better just back off, okay?

335
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,792
- My husband is a DEA agent.
- Oh, I thought he was an astronaut.

336
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,434
Or an illustrator.
Get your crazy lies straight.

337
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,676
You know what, fatty?
You are so lucky...

338
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,270
- ...that I am late for an appointment.
- You're not going anywhere.

339
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,358
- Let go of my purse!
- Not until the police get here.

340
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,834
Let it go!

341
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,395
Let it go! Let it go!

342
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,270
You are in big trouble.

343
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,559
Yeah.

344
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,079
Just slow- Hey, just -
Slow down. Start from the- You're -

345
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,672
You're where?

346
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,272
Why the f-?

347
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,152
Why are you-?

348
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,638
Are you seriously doing this
to me again?

349
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,316
Jesus, just -

350
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,836
Would you stop crying?

351
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,478
I'll make a phone call. Just sit tight.

352
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,197
Where they got you?

353
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,598
So good news.
The officer spoke to the homeowners.

354
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,438
They're not gonna press charges.

355
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,517
Good. I won't either.

356
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,590
Okay, then. So we're good to go.

357
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,638
You ready?

358
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,991
Marie, you wanna go home?

359
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,349
Marie?

360
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,189
Yes, it's Skyler White
calling for Saul Goodman, please.

361
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,437
Yes, it is important.

362
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,198
Thank you.

363
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,390
Sorry. Same as before.

364
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,919
But this is not right.

365
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,839
You cannot shut me down.
You cannot do this.

366
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,270
I've checked your wastewater
inside and out.

367
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,473
I've checked your runoff gutters,
and now out here, more contaminants.

368
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,752
Ammonia, acetone, benzene,
nitrobenzene.

369
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,951
No, no, no, this is a mistake.

370
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,550
Where is Gary? He'll tell you
my soap is very good, very green.

371
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,638
Your soap is not the issue,
it's your filtration system.

372
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,035
The very least,
you'll need to retrofit.

373
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,595
But if you're leeching
into the groundwater...

374
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,791
...which is a real possibility here...

375
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,355
...you're gonna need
to replace your system.

376
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,549
Replace?

377
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,832
Do you know what cost that is?
Two hundred thousand dollars.

378
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,314
It's a hardship.

379
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,557
If you like, we can give you
a list of approved vendors.

380
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,435
If you get going, your downtime
shouldn't be any more than five weeks.

381
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,200
Okay. So sorry, you are right.

382
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,951
From now on,
we will be extra careful and clean.

383
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,516
- No more pollution, okay? Yes?
- No, I'm sorry.

384
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,234
The state requires you to suspend
all activity...

385
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,000
...until these levels
reach the mandated minimums.

386
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,470
- Where is usual man? Where is Gary?
- Got transferred to Las Cruces.

387
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,389
- If you'd like to file an appeal -
- I have done nothing wrong.

388
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,352
Tell me why you shut me down.

389
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,313
- What laws did I break?
- What laws? Several.

390
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,159
Tell me exact specific laws or I refuse.
Right now.

391
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,800
- Tell me what laws I broke.
- The specific laws...

392
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,638
Hold on, okay, hold on, hold on.

393
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,671
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

394
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,236
Okay. The New Mexico
Hazardous Waste Act of 1978...

395
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,194
...section 74, chapter four,
part 13 states:

396
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,676
"Whenever the disposal
of solid or hazardous waste presents-"

397
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,996
- An imminent
or substantial endangerment...

398
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,792
...the offender may be fined...

399
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,310
...not more than $5000 each day
in which the violation occurs.

400
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,635
All right, okay.

401
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,513
Now the...

402
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,032
Okay, baby.

403
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,998
All right. The EPA can cite him
under the Toxic Substances -

404
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,952
- Control Act of 1976.

405
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,197
U.S. code, title 15, chapter 53 -

406
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,389
"- subchapter 1-"

407
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,795
- Section 2606.

408
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,872
Satisfied?

409
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,593
Was that specific -

410
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,392
- Specific enough for you?

411
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,636
Threw one in the channel
in the 10th.

412
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,115
- I guess they're even now.
- Yep.

413
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,435
And they're even in this match.
Both have -

414
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,392
All done with lunch?

415
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,875
You hardly touched this.

416
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,433
I'm not hungry.

417
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,233
Well...

418
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,509
I'm leaving the rice pudding.

419
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,399
I'm not hungry, Marie.

420
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,318
So don't eat it.

421
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,199
Speaking of babies, he has a new one,
Joseph, and a son, Anthony.

422
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,832
Hey, Marie. How you doing?

423
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,439
- I'm okay. Is there a problem?
- No, no.

424
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,239
Everything's fine.

425
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,873
I'm here for Hank, actually.

426
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,596
Oh, you're so sweet.
Hank'll be thrilled.

427
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,873
Hard and straight.

428
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,116
- And makes it the wrong way.
- Sweetie.

429
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,276
You have a visitor.

430
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,917
Oh, Jesus.

431
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,270
What now? She rob a bank?

432
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,959
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

433
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,751
Oh, well...

434
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,873
Can't complain.
You know, every day a little better.

435
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,674
- That's good. You're looking good.
- Yeah, well...

436
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,791
...handsome was never the hard part.

437
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,195
Come on in, grab a seat.

438
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,830
Yeah, just throw that stuff anywhere.

439
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,393
Listen...

440
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,792
...thanks again for the other day.
You know, this whole thing, it's...

441
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,759
It's been hard on her.

442
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,679
Forget it. Glad to help.

443
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,720
So rock collecting?

444
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,868
They're minerals, but, yeah.

445
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,352
It's cataloguing.
You know, sort them, label them.

446
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,631
- It's actually a lot of work.
- Yeah.

447
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,354
No, it looks like it.

448
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,354
- So, what's up?
- Well...

449
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,073
Actually,
I could use your help on something.

450
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,510
Homicide. Possibly drug-related.

451
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,915
You want my help on a case?

452
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,708
What am I, Ironside?

453
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,480
No, you're a drug cop
who knows the local talent.

454
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,150
And a pal I just did a favour for,
so let me pick your brain a sec.

455
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,909
You ever come across a guy
by the name of Gale Boetticher?

456
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,629
No.

457
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,593
Someone came along
and shot him in the face.

458
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,039
- Okay.
- No signs of forced entry...

459
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,639
...no signs of robbery.

460
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,038
Okay, so it's a crime of passion.
Where's the drug angle?

461
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,274
We found a notebook at his place.

462
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,153
I made a copy for you,
in case you're interested.

463
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,158
Looks like it pertains to some kind
of methamphetamine superlab.

464
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,349
Yeah.

465
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,838
It's filled with scientific formulas
and chemical purchase lists...

466
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,952
...drawings,
pages and pages of this stuff.

467
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,870
It looks big-time, but I'm no authority,
so I wonder if you might take a look?

468
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,949
Come on, Tim, seriously?

469
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,240
What is this,
some sort of a charity thing?

470
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,351
Your expertise could be useful here.

471
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,393
I'm lying here like third base...

472
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,034
...living from bowel movement
to bowel movement.

473
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,595
I'm not even useful to myself.

474
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,718
Want my advice?

475
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,115
You take this to Steve Gomez.

476
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,278
- He'll help you out.
- I give this to Steve Gomez...

477
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,234
...and all of a sudden it becomes a
DEA case, what good does that do me?

478
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,150
If you could just take a look,
tell me what I got here.

479
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,391
I'd really appreciate it.

480
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,788
Yeah.

481
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,353
Whatever.

482
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,192
Thanks, man.

483
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,119
Take it easy.

484
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,551
That's what I do.

485
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,237
- No, no.
- The three, seven, nine. He says, "No."

486
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,838
Well, it was a good try.

487
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,876
Here we go. Time for your nap. Yeah.

488
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,359
Okay.

489
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,998
So...

490
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,829
Nail salon sounded promising.
What do you think?

491
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,632
I think we wait.

492
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,239
Wait?

493
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,916
Skyler, it has been five hours.

494
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,553
He'll call.

495
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,910
- Just wait.
- Just wait.

496
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,394
Look...

497
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,392
It was a good idea.
It was a great idea, but it didn't work.

498
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,036
So why don't we simply chalk it up
as a learning -

499
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,511
White residence.

500
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,032
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

501
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,752
Am I still interested?

502
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,474
Well, I think that depends.

503
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,390
Yes, 879 was the original offer,
but that seems high to me now.

504
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,750
- Now I'm offering 800.
- No, no, no.

505
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,313
- No, don't do that.
- Why?

506
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,796
Well, because you're
an unpleasant person, Mr. Wolynetz.

507
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,560
You were rude,
disrespectful towards my husband.

508
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,718
Furthermore, I've met
with quite a number of sellers...

509
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,232
...and the market seems much softer
than I thought, so 800.

510
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,919
Well, I understand that you're
disappointed, but that is my final offer.

511
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,109
I'm sorry we couldn't make it work.
Goodbye.

512
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,389
What are you doing?

513
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,397
I'm negotiating.

514
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,079
Why?

515
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,679
Because I want to pay less.

516
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,313
Oh, no.

517
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,829
Seventy-nine thousand dollars less?

518
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,076
Who cares?
Do you know how much I make?

519
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,192
Yeah, but that's the very reason
we need to negotiate.

520
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,756
We don't wanna arouse suspicion
by not trying to get a good deal.

521
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,272
Look, I get the logic, I do,
but you just went too far with it.

522
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,754
You're calling him names?

523
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,270
I didn't call him names.
I said he was unpleasant.

524
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,115
Well, he's not calling you back.

525
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,279
I mean,
you didn't honestly think that worked?

526
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,910
Yeah, I do.

527
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,832
No way. Sorry. No.

528
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,191
So look, it's time to move on.

529
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,039
Okay? I'm gonna call Saul.

530
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,351
Where's my phone?

531
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,628
- No.
- What?

532
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,159
- No, just -
- What for?

533
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,874
Wait. Wait.

534
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,038
Oh, my God.

535
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,192
Hello.

536
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,033
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

537
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,038
No one's paying attention
to where these things are.

538
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,552
There's gotta be thousands of them
all over the world coming right for us.

539
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,548
And put one inside an ice cream truck,
drive it into San Francisco.

540
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,638
I'm not even that scared
of burning up and cannibalism.

541
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,877
To me, the thing that worries me
is getting trampled...

542
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,389
...or shoved up
against a chain-link fence.

543
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,797
If you think about it,
if you're against a chain-link fence...

544
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,232
...and you've got a lot, I mean,
a lot of people trying to escape...

545
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,749
...pushing hard enough forward...

546
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,430
...you are gonna get squeezed
right through the chain-links.

547
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,996
Like Play-Doh
or some kind of soft meat.

548
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,952
And this is inevitable, okay?

549
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,311
And there's nothing you or me
or anyone can do about it.

550
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,149
And if the fence posts are stuck deep,
really deep with the cement...

551
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,998
...way down inside the ground...

552
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,111
...it's definitely happening to you.

553
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,000
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, bitch.

554
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,272
Somebody got shot.
Somebody probably got shot.

555
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,557
Like soft meat, man.

556
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,117
Right through.
Squeezed through there like soft meat.

557
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,589
Like soft meat.

558
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,071
Right through the chain-links,
right through the chain-links.

559
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,874
Hey. Hey.

560
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,509
Money!

561
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,518
That one was mine.

562
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,280
- Take it easy!
- Hey, you took mine, man!

563
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,993
Yeah!

564
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,030
- Nice.
- Yeah.

565
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,832
To clean cars and clean money.

566
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,558
Hear, hear.

567
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,555
You see?

568
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,478
I told you we'd get it.

569
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,238
Did you?

570
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,832
Seriously.

571
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,634
It was really great work.

572
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,512
It's impressive.

573
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,029
Thank you.

574
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,760
And Saul finally came through.

575
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,271
Well, I mean,
he found the guy, right?

576
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,158
Well, yes, he found the guy, but
I told him what to do and what to say.

577
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,033
You're right. That's the hard part.

578
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,274
But, yes, Saul was finally useful.

579
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,357
Throw him a bone.

580
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,473
Oh, my God.

581
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,558
- This is truly amazing.
- Yes, well, it better be.

582
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,830
Three hundred twenty dollars
a bottle.

583
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,155
What?

584
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,272
"Cuvée Pol Roger
Sir Winston Churchill."

585
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,755
Apparently,
it was his favourite champagne...

586
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,076
...so they just named it after him.

587
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,431
- How did you pay for it?
- What do you mean?

588
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,188
No. Cash, I paid cash.

589
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,836
No, I'm asking how did you,
Walter White...

590
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,270
...an unemployed school teacher,
pay for it?

591
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,311
- How do you explain it?
- Skyler.

592
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,993
No one saw me.

593
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,633
Whoever sold it to you did.

594
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,515
And that's not the point.
The point is we're broke, remember?

595
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,474
I'm waiting for your unemployment
cheque so I can pay the phone bill.

596
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,399
I asked for an extension
from the power company. Why?

597
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,832
- Because on paper, we have no money.
- You are completely overreacting.

598
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,953
I'm not apologising for wanting
to celebrate in some small way.

599
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,276
I'm not asking you to apologise,
Walt.

600
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,198
I'm asking you to be smart.

601
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,039
I bought one bottle of champagne.

602
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,232
One single bottle, Skyler.

603
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,510
I paid cash. That's it.

604
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,439
That's all it takes, okay?
I mean, look at Watergate.

605
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,437
One piece of duct tape on a door...

606
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,313
...brought down
the president of the United States.

607
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,192
- What? I'm Nixon now?
- No.

608
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,073
What I'm saying is
the devil is in the details.

609
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,511
One little mistake,
one slipup in our story...

610
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,756
...that could ruin us.

611
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,239
Fine.

612
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,109
Gotta destroy the evidence.

613
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,431
And when I look at this image
that is part of the record...

614
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,349
...I am very concerned about
what sort of distraction that could be...

615
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,755
...whether it's from
any sort of signage...

616
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,270
...but especially signage that's
changing every five seconds.

617
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,959
Thank you.

618
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,756
Any other questions?

619
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,595
We have a motion and a second
on the floor to grant the appeal.

620
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,270
All those in favour, raise your hand
and say yes. Yes.

621
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,153
There's four in the affirmative.
Those opposed?

622
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,558
There's five no's and the -
That motion fails.

623
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,797
I would like to make a motion
to uphold the decision...

624
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,109
And the motion, then, is seconded
by Councillor Cook. Any questions?

625
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,474
I see none. All those in favour, signify
by saying "yes" to deny the appeal.

626
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,555
All those in favour,
signify by saying "yes."

627
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,832
There's five in the affirmative
All those opposed, say "no."

628
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,629
There's four in the negative.
Now, that passes.
