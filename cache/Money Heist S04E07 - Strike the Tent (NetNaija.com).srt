1
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,375
<i>Any news on the rooftop?</i>

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,875
<i>All in order here, sir.</i>

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,333
Suárez.

4
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:33,958
Martínez!

5
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,541
Colonel, it's Gandía.

6
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,083
Gandía, I'm here.

7
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,166
<i>Colonel,</i>

8
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,083
<i>I've eliminated Nairobi and Tokyo.</i>

9
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,625
<i>I'm launching another attack.</i>

10
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,208
<i>-I'll take a radio. This is the frequency.</i>
<i>-Radio!</i>

11
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,416
-I want all units on alert.
-Alpha and Beta units, get ready.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,125
<i>-Everyone ready and on alert.</i>
<i>-</i>Go.

13
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,541
<i>Everyone ready.</i>

14
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,000
Colonel, they're shooting!

15
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,666
Gandía, answer me.

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,000
<i>Gandía, do you copy?</i>

17
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,291
<i>Gandía here.</i>

18
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,583
<i>They're closing in on me.</i>
<i>I'm caught in the cross fire.</i>

19
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,125
Where are you? Can we give cover fire?

20
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,000
<i>Negative, Colonel. I'm going to the roof.</i>

21
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,291
<i>I request evacuation!</i>

22
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,708
Suárez, send a helicopter, now.

23
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,833
-Come on!
-Delta 1, prepare for takeoff.

24
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,958
Rescue operation
at the Bank of Spain, now!

25
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,291
<i>Taking off.</i>

26
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,000
<i>They're starting a fire. I can't see!</i>

27
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,708
Colonel.

28
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,541
<i>Smoke! There's smoke on the roof, sir.</i>

29
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,041
Hold on. The helicopter's coming.

30
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,291
Go to the roof. We'll cover you.

31
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:55,166
<i>Exiting now. I'm wearing black</i>
<i>and a ski mask. Hold fire.</i>

32
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,458
Our man's in black. Cover him.
Be ready for possible cross fire.

33
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,625
Come on!

34
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,916
Go!

35
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,125
Let's go!

36
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,666
They're on the roof. They're firing!

37
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,750
Cover fire!

38
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,833
<i>No visual. There's too much smoke.</i>

39
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,416
-Where's the helicopter?
-Delta, position.

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,750
<i>Two minutes, fifty seconds, sir.</i>

41
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,833
Delta, begin approach maneuver. 

42
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,500
<i>Rescue protocol.</i>

43
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,958
I want a quick, clean extraction.

44
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,750
<i>Helicopter in position.</i>

45
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,625
Get it down there!

46
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,583
Go ahead, proceed.

47
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,875
<i>Target in sight.</i>

48
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,833
<i>I have one in my line of fire.</i>
<i>Permission to shoot.</i>

49
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:27,291
45 HOURS EARLIER

50
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,083
<i>Mutt, I said I was going to kill you.</i>

51
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,166
No!

52
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,833
{\an8}Ten, nine,

53
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,875
{\an8}eight, seven,

54
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,458
{\an8}six, five,

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,083
{\an8}four, three,

56
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,000
{\an8}two, one...

57
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,541
{\an8}zero!

58
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,958
{\an8}What happened?

59
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,583
{\an8}Your friend Nairobi threw a grenade at me.

60
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,041
{\an8}Is Nairobi OK?

61
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,083
{\an8}I asked if Nairobi is OK!

62
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,916
{\an8}I don't know if she's OK,

63
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,291
{\an8}but she can certainly get up, the bitch.

64
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,833
{\an8}Is she recovering?

65
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,166
{\an8}I think so.

66
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,750
{\an8}You were an awesome surgeon.

67
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,083
{\an8}Are you aware
you're bleeding like a stuck pig?

68
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,625
{\an8}Do you have to change your suit
in front of all these people?

69
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,166
{\an8}This isn't a suit. It's the uniform

70
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,583
{\an8}of a filthy executive
who checks stocks during dinner.

71
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,833
{\an8}It got you an interview
with the governor of the Bank of Spain.

72
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,041
{\an8}Isn't it good enough for a cocktail?

73
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,750
{\an8}You should have parked the car.
Martín complains much less.

74
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,708
{\an8}Of course.

75
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,291
{\an8}Now what's wrong with Martín?

76
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,666
{\an8}He follows you everywhere.

77
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,375
{\an8}So?

78
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,208
{\an8}He's in love with you.

79
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,875
{\an8}In love with me.

80
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,708
{\an8}Does he write my name in his notebooks?

81
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:56,583
{\an8}-Or did he confess in drunken tears?
-I see how he looks at you.

82
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,583
How he smiles at all of your crazy ideas.

83
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,041
How he agrees with what you say
about the plan.

84
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,333
He can't formulate a critical opinion.

85
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,875
He's in love.
That stops him being objective.

86
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,291
He's totally objective.
He's an engineer. He doesn't weigh in.

87
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,166
He does equations,

88
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,750
and no feelings are involved
in any of those calculations.

89
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,666
-We both know the plan's a disaster.
-The plan is fantastic.

90
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,916
It has some fantastic details,

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,791
but it doesn't work as a plan.
It doesn't work.

92
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,750
-Why did you call me?
-I want to share it with you.

93
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,833
It's the biggest job of my life.
I want my brother there.

94
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,583
You want me to be the brains
that he's not providing.

95
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,375
And you...

96
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,083
you know how to get the gold out,
not yourselves.

97
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,125
And you have no idea
how you'll live the rest of your lives

98
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,500
with 90 tons of gold
without being found out.

99
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:52,666
An analytical mind, however small,
would work that out straightaway.

100
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,750
But not you guys.

101
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,666
Because you're in love with the plan...

102
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,291
and he's just in love with you.

103
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,791
We're guided by passion.
You're blinded by hatred.

104
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,041
Hatred for romanticism.

105
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,541
Maybe because suicide
is one of its main characteristics.

106
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,208
This plan is suicide.

107
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,791
Still finding faults?

108
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,541
He'll get over it. When he's stressed,
he's all doom and gloom.

109
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:18,375
Well... I'm going to the bathroom.

110
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,625
Do you want to come with me, Sergio?

111
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:27,208
Have you ever had the privilege
of an experienced man giving you fellatio?

112
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,791
I'm joking.

113
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,333
<i>Freezing up,</i>
<i>disorientation, a blank stare...</i>

114
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,958
<i>and, above all,</i>
<i>the feeling of floating outside reality.</i>

115
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,375
<i>Those are the consequences</i>
<i>of emotional shock.</i>

116
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,958
<i>But you can also go the other way.</i>

117
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,791
<i>An unbridled rage</i>

118
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,708
<i>that only seeks...</i>

119
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,416
<i>revenge.</i>

120
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,500
It's open.

121
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:27,916
Clear.

122
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,125
Blood.

123
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,458
Fuck.

124
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,583
Clear.

125
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,166
<i>We've found the panic room, sir.</i>

126
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,833
Gandía is shut up inside.
He's injured and he has Tokyo.

127
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,583
Is he badly injured?

128
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,791
<i>A grenade exploded on his back.</i>

129
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,458
He'll try to negotiate.
Time's on our side.

130
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,708
-If he wants to live, he can't harm Tokyo.
-I'm not so sure.

131
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,583
Professor...

132
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,208
he killed Nairobi.

133
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,166
Is that a yes?

134
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:15,083
We'll pay them back 100 times over
for what they did to Nairobi.

135
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,541
<i>The Professor no longer felt any pain.</i>

136
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,458
<i>He was detached from his emotions</i>
<i>and was operating like a machine.</i>

137
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,958
We'll destroy that tent in seven steps.

138
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:34,291
<i>-All he could think of was his next move.</i>
-It starts with the truth.

139
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:38,041
If you want to tell the truth,
you need to speak to Rio first.

140
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,916
There are things you don't know.

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,833
Professor.

142
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,333
<i>From that moment,</i>

143
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,666
<i>absolutely everything</i>
<i>would become a plan of attack.</i>

144
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,750
<i>-Professor.</i>
<i>-In the hours that followed,</i>

145
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,375
<i>he'd launch missiles.</i>

146
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:56,166
You said getting out was impossible,
but we'd get out. Keep your word.

147
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,250
I said when we'd melted
and extracted the gold, I'd get you out.

148
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,500
And I stand by that.

149
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,875
Palermo, get Tokyo out.

150
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,750
I'll go to the foundry.
Denver, come with me.

151
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,625
<i>Everyone on alert.</i>

152
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,625
<i>Bomb disposal robot is advancing.</i>

153
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,208
Go ahead. Let's go.

154
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,708
<i>Ready to deactivate</i>
<i>the bombs at the entrance.</i>

155
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,000
Nairobi is dead.

156
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,500
From now on, I'm in charge.

157
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,166
We're going to be efficient.
How many tons have we done?

158
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,125
Forty-four.

159
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,875
-What is this, recess?
-That's three less than the target.

160
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:04,125
Raise the temperature to 1,750ºC.
We need to increase the production rate.

161
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,791
-Is there no one inside?
-No.

162
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:10,083
There should be. Let's get moving.
We have to get this gold out.

163
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,041
Denver.

164
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,708
Get every last gram of gold.

165
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,875
I want to get the hell out of here.

166
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,458
Now! Quick! Come on!

167
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,375
Professor.

168
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,833
No, we have a problem.
I'll create a firewall.

169
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,208
-I'll put you through.
<i>-</i>OK, hurry up.

170
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,791
Out!

171
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,125
Shame on you!

172
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,291
<i>Beginning procedure to defuse</i>
<i>the first explosive. Take cover.</i>

173
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:50,041
<i>Units one and two, ready to advance</i>
<i>once the devices are disconnected.</i>

174
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,666
Fucking firewall.

175
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,333
-<i>Professor.</i>
-Yes.

176
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,083
I shouldn't tell you,
but they're planning a massacre.

177
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,083
<i>They're going to storm the bank.</i>

178
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,166
<i>They're trying to contact Gandía</i>
<i>to work together.</i>

179
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,333
Understood.
Did you give Lisbon my message?

180
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,541
Yes.

181
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,083
Antoñanzas, stay and watch Murillo.

182
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,916
Don't let anyone in.

183
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,416
For God's sake,
why didn't you say anything?

184
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,708
What would I have gained? A bit of pity?

185
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,375
Oh, Alicia...

186
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,750
Paris.

187
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:51,041
<i>She got very emotional.</i>
<i>She went all doe-eyed.</i>

188
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,958
<i>If you had seen her...</i>

189
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,458
Thank you, Benito.

190
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,708
-Listen.
-I'm listening.

191
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,916
The cops and Gandía
are planning an attack.

192
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,666
Knock out the phone in the panic room.
Cut it all off.

193
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,208
One very important thing:
don't kill Gandía, I need him alive.

194
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:20,833
-With Tokyo in there, it'll be difficult.
-I said alive. It's key to the plan.

195
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,500
Search for electromagnetic waves
and cut the cables.

196
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,750
When he's totally incommunicado,
without cameras, start opening the door.

197
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,958
Use angle grinders, hammers...
Make lots of noise.

198
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,416
<i>Make sure he knows about it</i>
<i>and won't look elsewhere.</i>

199
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,750
Meanwhile, we drill a small hole
through the back wall

200
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,958
and pump in sleeping gas.

201
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,541
When he's asleep, knock the door down.

202
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,666
<i>-Understood?</i>
-Understood.

203
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,625
<i>Bombs defused, sir.</i>

204
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,375
Good. Get me Gandía.

205
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,000
Bingo.

206
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,666
Yoo-hoo.

207
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,083
That'll be my friends.

208
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,000
Colonel!

209
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,375
Colonel!

210
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,291
Colonel!

211
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,625
Now you really are fucked, you bastard.

212
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,958
<i>Of course I'll do it, however tough it is.</i>

213
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,875
-Are you sure?
-<i>You can count on me.</i>

214
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,791
Thank you, Rio. Thank you.

215
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:31,250
THE ALGERIAN DESERT

216
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,000
<i>-Did you find anything?</i>
-Find anything where?

217
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,958
This is a desert.

218
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:42,000
You can't call a cab and say,
"Take me to the torturers' house."

219
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,500
I gave you local backup.

220
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,958
I speak Spanish, I speak German,

221
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,250
Italian, French,
English, Croatian, Serbian...

222
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,291
But I don't speak fucking Berber.

223
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,833
I need coordinates.

224
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,125
Give me ten minutes.

225
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,250
Shakir, I need those satellite images.

226
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,208
<i>You have ten minutes.</i>

227
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,416
Palermo, they're coming in.

228
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,916
...special operations have been deployed

229
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,208
and armored cars
and assault vehicles are on the move.

230
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,625
<i>Just as the police</i>
<i>were about to close in on us,</i>

231
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,541
<i>the Professor launched the first missile.</i>

232
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,083
Open the doors.

233
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:49,958
Hold position!

234
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,333
What the hell is that?

235
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,916
<i>A missile which was</i>
<i>a salute of honor in memory of Nairobi.</i>

236
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,458
They're the governor's bodyguards.

237
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,375
A funeral.

238
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,000
THE FUCKING BOSS

239
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,541
<i>The tent came to a standstill.</i>

240
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,500
What's happening?

241
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,791
Get her back inside!

242
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,125
Let her. Out of respect.

243
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,291
<i>Nairobi's departure filled the air</i>
<i>with a heavy silence.</i>

244
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,833
<i>It was the disappointment of those</i>
<i>who had believed the Dalí story...</i>

245
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,791
<i>would have a happy ending.</i>

246
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,250
<i>But it was just a war.</i>

247
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,166
<i>And then, the Professor launched</i>
<i>his second missile.</i>

248
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,750
BURIED ALIVE

249
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,250
<i>He covered Madrid with posters of Rio</i>
<i>and sent his story</i>

250
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,208
<i>to the entire national</i>
<i>and international press.</i>

251
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,750
<i>I was illegally detained on January 20</i>
<i>by Panamanian police...</i>

252
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,458
Colonel, Inspector.

253
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,000
<i>...and transferred on a secret flight</i>
<i>with the CNI colonel...</i>

254
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,041
<i>Luis Prieto.</i>

255
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:58,250
<i>We landed somewhere in the Maghreb,</i>
<i>and they tortured me until April 4.</i>

256
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,625
<i>They put me in a cell that was so small...</i>

257
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,375
{\an8}<i>that I could only stand.</i>

258
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,416
<i>They left me to shit and piss myself.</i>

259
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,458
<i>And they left me there,</i>
<i>living in my own shit.</i>

260
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,791
<i>One night...</i>

261
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,791
<i>they took me out of my cell,</i>
<i>they took me to the desert...</i>

262
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,250
<i>and they forced me to dig my own grave.</i>

263
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:30,541
{\an8}<i>They put me in a box,</i>
<i>and they buried me alive...</i>

264
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,125
{\an8}<i>until I lost consciousness,</i>
<i>believing that I had died.</i>

265
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,166
-You buried the boy alive?
-Of course we buried him alive.

266
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,958
What the hell gave you that idea?

267
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,375
Why do you think we sent him to Algeria?
For a slap on the wrist?

268
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:51,125
I would've preferred you put him
in a ditch, in quicklime, in cement...

269
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,750
But buried alive?

270
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,750
A guy describing how he was buried alive
is a fucking horror movie.

271
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,375
In PR terms, it's like suicide.

272
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,291
The <i>New York Times </i>published the video.

273
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,333
Some are calling for
a commission in Strasbourg.

274
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,875
Even Amnesty International
is filing a private prosecution.

275
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,041
We're fucked.

276
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:12,000
Did that fucking place
have phones, CCTV, Wi-Fi,

277
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,625
or anything they may have used
to get proof?

278
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,125
It was an abandoned hovel.

279
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:19,041
There were no cameras, internet,
or roads.

280
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,583
-That's why we went.
-It's the middle of nowhere.

281
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,791
Not even Algerian intelligence
knows about it.

282
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:27,958
And there isn't a scratch on him.
No bruising or internal bleeding.

283
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,125
We were careful.

284
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,125
OK.

285
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:36,333
We're going to deny it like crazy.
It's his word against ours.

286
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,791
-And you're going to do it.
-Me?

287
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,708
Yes, you.

288
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:44,666
Give it your all. The full works.
Press conference and urgent announcement.

289
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,541
Transparency, Luis.

290
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,416
My sugar levels are down.

291
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,833
Where are the damn cookies?

292
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:37,666
Darko.

293
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,833
Benjamín.

294
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,875
Thanks for coming.

295
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,458
If Agustín, Moscow, trusted you...

296
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,416
consider me your friend.

297
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,833
And my daughter, is she well?

298
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,333
Manila is fine.

299
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,166
-Are they all miners?
-All of them.

300
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,000
And all trustworthy.

301
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,291
Asturians.

302
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:09,750
Except...

303
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,250
this guy.

304
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,041
He's Polish.

305
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:15,708
Captain.

306
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,083
Thank you.

307
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,833
Welcome, everyone.

308
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:22,916
Follow me, please.

309
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,916
Where are we going?

310
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,916
To class.

311
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,416
I'll explain what we're going to do
in the next 30 hours.

312
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:41,708
This plan would be written off as madness
by anyone with any sense.

313
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,875
So forget about sense.

314
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:54,000
-Fucking sauna, Christ.
-Do you go to saunas?

315
00:25:56,666 --> 00:26:01,000
You're one of those repressed guys
who get horny in the locker room.

316
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,083
Isn't that right?

317
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,875
Did you know we're the same?

318
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,416
We're just on opposite sides.

319
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,333
I can offer you a job.

320
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:27,875
Honestly...

321
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,500
I'd rather you offered me a fuck.

322
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:40,875
Is there a rule that forbids
soldiers from different sides fucking?

323
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,208
That's not treason, right?

324
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:48,083
They should put it
in the Geneva Convention.

325
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,500
"Cease-fire!

326
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:54,791
Time to fuck!"

327
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:04,916
What is it that you want?

328
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,041
I don't want anything.

329
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:12,166
You turn me on.

330
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,625
I was doing a lot of thinking.

331
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:00,208
I don't really know
what's going on with me.

332
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,291
Or what's going on with you,
but I love you.

333
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:08,750
And whether we're together or not,
I'll look after you.

334
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,166
What do you mean?

335
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,083
What do you mean?

336
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,666
Nairobi is dead.

337
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,500
Things happen here
you think could never happen.

338
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:18,458
But they do.

339
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,583
It was easy in Indonesia because...

340
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,458
you were with the only guy
who wasn't a local.

341
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:27,625
But it's different here,
and I'll put up with that.

342
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,291
And I love you.

343
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:33,625
You got here, started comparing,
and I was the loser.

344
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:36,500
-That's OK.
-No one's comparing you to anyone.

345
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,500
Honestly.
And with Rio... it's not like that.

346
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,583
I want you to know
that if you need that,

347
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,208
if you need to be with Rio...

348
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,583
go ahead.

349
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,916
That's not what I need.

350
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:56,583
I don't even know what I need.
Not right now.

351
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:02,166
We're in the middle of all this,
and I can't think or make decisions.

352
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,000
But you and I met each other
during a heist.

353
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,416
And we made loads of decisions.

354
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,333
Together.

355
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,583
Arturo, what did you do to me?

356
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,708
What did you do when I was asleep?

357
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:46,333
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-You took advantage of me.

358
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,125
I don't know what you mean,
but now's not the time.

359
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,166
You drugged me.

360
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,708
You made me take
more sedatives than I should have,

361
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,541
and I basically passed out.

362
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:59,958
But before I did, I felt you up close,
touching my neck, my breast.

363
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:03,583
I was drugged,
but I felt you lowering my zipper, and...

364
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,583
you kept on touching me.

365
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,666
You lifted my panties, Arturo.

366
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,458
I woke up, I drifted back off...

367
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:15,208
But I keep seeing images,
and my bra was broken when I woke up.

368
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,333
Amanda.

369
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,416
You're just very anxious. It's normal.

370
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,333
With all this circus, OK?

371
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,916
You must be confused

372
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,500
and seeing and believing things
that didn't really happen.

373
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,208
Or maybe...

374
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:34,416
you had an erotic dream about me.

375
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,166
I don't mind being
the object of your desire,

376
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,291
but to go from that
to accusing me of something...

377
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,041
You raped me, Arturo.

378
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,541
You drugged me and you raped me.

379
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,458
Listen to me.

380
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,666
You brat.

381
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,250
I didn't rape you.

382
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,666
I didn't take advantage of you.

383
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,208
You're accusing me
of something really very serious.

384
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,000
Something I loathe.

385
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,333
Something I detest.

386
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:03,458
I've always been
a defender of women's rights.

387
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:07,666
I've always advocated respect for women.
I won't allow this.

388
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,166
Nothing happened.

389
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,875
You were scared, you had a panic attack...

390
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,833
It's normal, OK?

391
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:23,000
Can you believe it?

392
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,291
That's Bogotá.

393
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:49,583
Now you really are fucked.
It's the shrapnel in your neck.

394
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,041
Brachial plexus.

395
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,333
It controls muscles in your arm...

396
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:58,708
in your hand... in your shoulder.

397
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,625
You know all that?

398
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,791
-I learn this stuff with the Professor.
-Yeah?

399
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,250
Is it hard to breathe?

400
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,125
That's normal.

401
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,083
It's your diaphragm.

402
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,708
-Tough break.
-Do you want me to release you?

403
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
If you don't release me, you're dead.

404
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,875
If you release me...

405
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,875
I'll treat your wounds.

406
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:37,500
I'll undo your hands
so you can remove the shrapnel for me.

407
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,750
But you'll still...

408
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,708
be tied at the neck.

409
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,250
I'll have my back to you,

410
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:52,833
but I only have to do this...

411
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:57,500
to blow your clever little head off.

412
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,541
MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR
19:45 HOURS

413
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,125
Good morning, everyone.

414
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,000
My name is Luis Prieto.

415
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,458
I'm a colonel
from the National Center of Intelligence.

416
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:15,291
I stand before you at the request
of the Minister of the Interior

417
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:20,541
to firmly deny the accusations
about the alleged torture of Aníbal Cortés

418
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:25,125
and to clear up any doubts
you may have about his arrest.

419
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,041
-Yes, here, please.
-Colonel.

420
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,666
How did Ágata Jiménez, alias Nairobi, die?

421
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,375
We are currently
still gathering information.

422
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:35,666
All I can say
is that she was killed in a skirmish

423
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,875
with the Bank of Spain's head of security,
who broke free.

424
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,375
Was Cortés illegally arrested in Panama?

425
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,833
The arrest was made legally

426
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:48,541
in accordance
with an arrest warrant issued by Europol.

427
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,791
-Excuse me.
-You.

428
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:58,041
No democratic country in the world
respecting the rule of law

429
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,250
would do such a thing.

430
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,125
He claims to have been buried alive.

431
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,750
Do you deny that too?
That he was left to defecate himself?

432
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:12,750
That they gave him 40 coffees
and cold showers?

433
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:17,458
Those statements
are as ridiculous as they are grotesque.

434
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,250
<i>Prieto did what the Professor</i>
<i>expected him to:</i>

435
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:24,458
<i>lie, lie, and lie again.</i>

436
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:28,333
<i>He did it better than the Professor</i>
<i>could ever have imagined.</i>

437
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:31,166
<i>With sarcasm and arrogance.</i>

438
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,083
They'll be confident.

439
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:38,041
They'll be confident because they think
it's our word against theirs.

440
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:42,958
And that's what will make them drown
in the quicksand of their own dirt.

441
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:47,458
Because what the CNI
could never imagine...

442
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,416
is that our intelligence could be better.

443
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,250
But we'll show them.

444
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,791
We're going to show them...

445
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,291
because we'll be there.

446
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,958
This is the same old
conspiracy theory as always:

447
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:25,041
that the police use torture.

448
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
We won't accept this kind of talk.

449
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,875
Talk.

450
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:41,833
We tortured Aníbal Cortés
for around two months.

451
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,833
<i>We were paid 200,000 euros to do it,</i>

452
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,791
<i>by Colonel Prieto</i>
<i>from Spanish Intelligence.</i>

453
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,666
<i>And that was his third missile.</i>

454
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,666
Colonel Prieto.

455
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,833
Excuse me.

456
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:57,875
We're receiving documentary evidence
that contradicts your words.

457
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:00,833
Do you know a Turkish citizen named Osman?

458
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,166
I don't know who that is.

459
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:07,583
This e-mail sent from your account
to this Osman

460
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,500
in which you order,

461
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,958
"Use any means necessary
to obtain the information."

462
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,625
-Did you send this?
-I don't know what you mean.

463
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,708
Maybe these images
will refresh your memory.

464
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,750
<i>This is</i>
<i>where we buried Aníbal Cortés alive.</i>

465
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,458
You can see the wooden box.

466
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:29,208
We had him in there
for two or three hours.

467
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:31,500
He dug the hole himself.

468
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,125
Do you deny this evidence too?

469
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:39,750
Do you still claim that this grave
in a place called Timimoun, in Algeria,

470
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:43,250
that you refer to in several e-mails,
is a setup?

471
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,958
Of course it is.

472
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,750
Colonel, please.

473
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,250
Colonel, here, please.

474
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,833
I have nothing more to say.

475
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:59,000
Tamayo will be like a tennis player
in the middle of the court,

476
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:03,958
trying to return all the balls
that a machine is firing at him nonstop.

477
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,416
{\an8}<i>They put me in a box.</i>

478
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,250
{\an8}<i>...€200,000 to do it.</i>

479
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,791
He'll be so focused
on stopping the balls we're firing

480
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:21,083
that he won't have the time or energy
to think about the heist.

481
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:24,125
<i>Because his whole world</i>
<i>will be falling apart.</i>

482
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,458
We're ready to resume the attack.

483
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,625
-We're not attacking.
-Colonel!

484
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:32,583
Can't you see what's happening?
They want to take us all down.

485
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:37,000
The finishing touch
would be killing a hostage on our way in.

486
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,958
-They're weakened.
-No, it's out of the question.

487
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,416
Do I have to remind you
that you've tried to go in 4 times?

488
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,958
What's going on in there?
Is there an open bar?

489
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:51,666
When you have a fire of such magnitude,
you can only think about one thing.

490
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:55,208
-Putting it out.
-Putting it out.

491
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:59,416
Not for Spain's credibility,
nor for the integrity of the CNI...

492
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,500
but for your own freedom.

493
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,500
Listen, everyone.

494
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:07,791
I need all non-essential personnel
to step outside.

495
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:11,541
Take a breather, have a coffee,
and back to work in 5 minutes.

496
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,416
Oh, Alicia...

497
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,625
We tried to get out there and deny it,

498
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:28,708
but that son of a bitch, the Professor,
was waiting with the evidence in hand.

499
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,791
Now the only way out is to take the blame.

500
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,625
And who's going to do that?

501
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,125
For the CNI, Prieto.

502
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,541
For the police, you.

503
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:50,791
We need you to create a firewall
so the institutions come out clean.

504
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,708
What should I say?

505
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:01,166
That I did it all without telling anyone?

506
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:05,041
That I did it...
out of professional ambition?

507
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,916
To see if they'd give me
the police medal of merit?

508
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:12,708
They have Prieto's e-mails.
I'm sure they have yours.

509
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:16,416
You have to resign,
leave the negotiations...

510
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:21,583
and take the blame for acting illegally.

511
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:26,208
If I'm taking the blame,
why don't you add that I killed Manolete,

512
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,041
the Kennedy thing,
the attempted coup in '81...

513
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:31,166
shooting the pope...

514
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:33,958
I'm getting blamed for it all, right?

515
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:37,000
You're going to take the rap anyway,

516
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,458
but if you help us,
we won't leave you hanging.

517
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,708
I'll have the CNI discredit the evidence.

518
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:47,041
The state attorney
and the prosecution are on our side.

519
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:49,458
You'll get a friendly judge.

520
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:54,291
Someone who we've got by the balls.
You'll be suspended without pay.

521
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:58,291
But don't worry,
you'll be paid from reserve funds.

522
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:05,458
I promise you won't set foot in prison.

523
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:06,958
I don't care about that.

524
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:15,458
Well.

525
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,416
It's not like I have much choice.

526
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,416
Right?

527
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:24,875
Alicia...

528
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:26,791
be strong.

529
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,708
We're with you.

530
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,500
Sierra... and Colonel Prieto.

531
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:50,500
They will be the first to fall.

532
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:51,916
Why?

533
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:55,375
Because that's how
we'll paralyze the tent,

534
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:58,416
and by doing so,
protect our crew inside the bank.

535
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,333
Tamayo will have difficulty
maintaining control.

536
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:05,375
Once everyone in the bank is protected,
what do we do, Benjamín?

537
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,583
Huh? Well... you tell me.

538
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:13,041
Rescue another member of the gang.

539
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,541
We're going to rescue someone

540
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,166
who is being guarded
by a group of 26 police officers.

541
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,000
That's impossible, Professor.

542
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,333
It's almost impossible,

543
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,500
but there is a possibility

544
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,750
if you know these details:

545
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,666
where they are going to take her
and when.

546
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,750
And we will know that information...

547
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,291
because I'll make them transfer her.

548
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,916
Now just the one in your neck.

549
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:39,041
How's it look?

550
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:46,083
It doesn't look good.
If I do it wrong, you could be paralyzed.

551
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,666
Pull it out.
Pull upwards, without hesitation.

552
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,666
Put your head down a bit.

553
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,750
The camera.

554
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,083
For fuck's sake, Gandía's dead!

555
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,916
Bogotá, Tokyo killed Gandía!
Knock the door down!

556
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,375
Fuck!

557
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,583
<i>Then came the fourth missile.</i>

558
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,916
Look at the screens.
Is that the Professor?

559
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,583
Is that the Professor?

560
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:52,041
Our colleague Lisbon
has been illegally detained.

561
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:56,250
She was captured and is being held
at the command post in front of the bank.

562
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,833
Without a judge being informed.

563
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,291
<i>-With no right to a defense.</i>
-What the hell?

564
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,916
<i>And after the police faked her execution.</i>

565
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,791
<i>Here's the proof.</i>

566
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,250
<i>The recording of that moment.</i>

567
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:11,416
<i>Suárez, put down the gun.</i>

568
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,208
<i>Where's the Professor?</i>

569
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:15,916
<i>Tell them I'll surrender.</i>
<i>Buy time.</i>

570
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:17,541
<i>Raquel, tell him.</i>

571
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:20,291
<i>-Where's the Professor?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>

572
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:22,375
<i>Tell him, I'm on my way. Raquel!</i>

573
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,708
<i>-Where's the Professor?</i>
<i>-</i>I don't know!

574
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:25,666
<i>Get them out.</i>

575
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:28,666
<i>Get out of there!</i>

576
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,583
I don't know where he is.

577
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,375
Wrong answer.

578
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:34,375
<i>I'm on my way. Get out of there.</i>

579
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,916
Get out of there!

580
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,166
<i>It was self-defense.</i>

581
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:44,500
<i>Do you understand, Solana? She shot first.</i>

582
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:48,125
<i>Take the gun, clean the prints,</i>
<i>put it in her hand.</i>

583
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,375
I implore the authorities to investigate

584
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,291
and to confirm
the accuracy of these facts.

585
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:10,041
Tied up, and you still took him out.

586
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,125
Great. See if he has a pulse.

587
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:13,791
Yes, I have a pulse.

588
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:16,500
Sorry, you're more interested in Gandía.

589
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:19,666
There he is.
A bit under the weather.

590
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,750
-He's alive.
-Good.

591
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,208
Are you going to untie me?

592
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:30,791
How are you?

593
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:57,875
How's Nairobi?

594
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:38,125
<i>The last missile</i>
<i>arrived at the tent in an official car,</i>

595
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:41,208
<i>with a badge and a judge's order.</i>

596
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:42,583
Attention.

597
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,625
Stop what you're doing.

598
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:52,583
-I'm Colonel Tamayo. I'm in charge.
-I don't care.

599
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,208
Internal Affairs Unit.

600
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:57,791
-What's going on?
-Where's Raquel Murillo being held?

601
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,041
Raquel Murillo,

602
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:17,708
you're under arrest for the crimes
of belonging to an armed group,

603
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:21,750
abduction, attacking an officer
and the institutions of the state.

604
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:24,500
You have the right to remain silent.

605
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:27,875
You have the right
to an attorney of your choice.

606
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,000
You have the right to medical care.

607
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,333
You have the right to make a call.
