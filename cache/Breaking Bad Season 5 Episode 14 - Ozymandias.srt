2
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,654
Yo, so what's next?

3
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:23,288
We wait.

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,660
You don't got, like, eight more anal
things we gotta do first?

5
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,729
The reaction has begun.

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,964
Yeah, I... I know.

7
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:33,932
So how long?

8
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:34,699
Well, if we had a freezer,

9
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,769
the condensed liquid
would cool more quickly,

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,037
because, of course,

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,439
this is an exothermic reaction,

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,942
which means "giving off heat".

13
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,594
And our desired product is...

14
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:49,912
Put me into a coma,
why don't you?

15
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,050
What did you just say?

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:56,121
What... what? Nothing.

17
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,522
Hmm.

18
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:06,131
No, no, no.
Not in here.

19
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:08,867
Duh. Like I'm an idiot.

20
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:12,637
Yeah. Like you're an idiot.

21
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,005
Dick.

22
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,851
Ah, god. Jesus.

23
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,153
God.

24
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:31,389
Shut up.
Oh, wow.

25
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,566
Huh.

26
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:47,172
Bogdan... Bogdan says I'm not
doing the receipts right.

27
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,974
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.

28
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,810
He's... he's got a stick
up his butt?

29
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,413
He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

30
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,150
So anyway,
he's insisting that I...

31
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:04,022
He's demanding
that I stay and, uh,

32
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,790
Look over his system,

33
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,760
And I cannot get out of it.

34
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:11,095
Yeah.

35
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,307
Hello.

36
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,575
<i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>

37
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,610
Hey, you.
What's going on?

38
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,678
<i>Nothing much.</i>

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,881
I...I was...
I was just, um,

40
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,383
calling to...
say I'm sorry,

41
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,686
But I'm gonna be late tonight.

42
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,721
Bogdan. He's got
a bug up his butt.

43
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:41,426
That's okay. I wasn't planning
anything special for dinner, so...

44
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,895
in fact, you could
take pity on us

45
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,797
and bring a pizza home.

46
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,532
They're having a
two-for-one at Venezia's,

47
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:51,636
and at this point I could
eat a whole one by myself.

48
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,370
Yeah, yeah, sure.

49
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,272
I can...
I can pick up a pizza.

50
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,675
Hopefully Bogdan
won't keep me too late.

51
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,277
<i>He better not.</i>

52
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,078
Trust me.
He does not want to piss off

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,746
a hungry, pregnant woman.

54
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,047
Ooh. What's that sound?

55
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,151
<i>I just sold your favorite piece.</i>

56
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,854
The hideous crying clown.

57
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,221
<i>Wow.</i>

58
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,725
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks
more than I paid for it.

59
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,693
Shows what I know about art.

60
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,162
<i>Hey, what do you think
about Holly?</i>

61
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:21,332
<i>For the baby's name.</i>

62
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,700
Do you like it?

63
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,103
I think I really like it.

64
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,306
Holly. Yeah. It's nice.

65
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,741
Let me think about it.

66
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,643
Just feels right, you know?

67
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,944
It's my new favorite.

68
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,214
Well, it's a front-runner,
for sure.

69
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,016
Hiyah!

70
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,521
Listen, I was thinking, um,

71
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:47,625
Maybe we can have a little
family time this weekend?

72
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,726
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

73
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,462
Yeah, you know.
Just take a drive.

74
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,731
The almost four of us.

75
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,066
<i>Maybe we can head up
the turquoise trail,</i>

76
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,437
<i>And stop at Tinkertown,
maybe grab some lunch in Madrid.</i>

77
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,273
Oh, my god.
We haven't been there in forever.

78
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,276
<i>I know.
So why don't we just do that?</i>

79
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,978
<i>Take a little break.</i>

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,447
<i>Sold. Sounds fun.</i>

81
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,017
Holly. It's growing on me.

82
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,519
Yep. Me too.

83
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,522
All right, well, I had better go

84
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,457
and get this in the mail.

85
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,325
<i>Why don't you call me</i>

86
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,126
<i>When you're on
your way home, okay?</i>

87
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,895
Will do. Love you.

88
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,397
<i>Love you too.</i>

89
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:09,901
Ah. Whoa. Simmer
down there, sparky.

90
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,075
What the hell
did we just walk into?

91
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,411
Hey, Uncle Jack,
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.

92
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,179
He was right here before.

93
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,514
Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
No.

94
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:28,653
What do you figure? He may be
headed down that gully there?

95
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,854
That's the way I'd go.

96
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,891
Frankie, Lester, go find him.

97
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,493
Jack.

98
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,462
These guys are DEA.

99
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,106
No! Jack, no!

100
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,707
Jack! Jack! Jack!

101
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,676
No! No, don't!

102
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,578
Jack, don't. No.

103
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,981
No, Jack!
Jack, no!

104
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,717
Jack, no.
Don't kill him.

105
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,551
Uh-uh, back it up.

106
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,053
Don't kill him.
Don't kill him, Jack.

107
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,422
Get back here.
The hell not? He's DEA.

108
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,725
No, he's...
he's family.

109
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,061
Say again?

110
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,563
He's my family.

111
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,065
He's my brother-in-law.

112
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,967
Didn't cross your mind
to maybe tell us

113
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:20,037
You had a DEA agent
for a brother-in-law?

114
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:22,006
Did you know about this?

115
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,375
I called you off, remember?

116
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,176
I told you not to come.

117
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,878
Well, it seems to me
we did you a solid.

118
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,213
You weren't supposed to be here.

119
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,181
It's too late now.

120
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,683
How's about you tell me
what was going down out here?

121
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,353
Hmm? Yeah,
you and your brother-in-law

122
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,089
Don't seem to be
getting along too well.

123
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,391
It doesn't... doesn't matter.

124
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,526
It doesn't concern you.

125
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,060
We just wasted his partner here,

126
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:43,995
And he's wearing a bullet.

127
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,431
So, yeah,
I'd say it does concern me.

128
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,768
This is...
between him and me.

129
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,837
No cavalry comin'?

130
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,271
No.

131
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,873
You bet your ass
the cavalry's comin'.

132
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,407
No! No, no.

133
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,808
Jack. No...

134
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,413
Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.

135
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,682
Not yet.

136
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,921
Hank.

137
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:14,192
Nothing can change
what just happened,

138
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,628
But you can walk
out of here alive

139
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,630
If you just promise us

140
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:24,101
That you'll...
you'll let this go.

141
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,572
Yeah, I thought as much.

142
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,139
Sorry, man.

143
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,874
Just no scenario
where this guy lives.

144
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,742
No, no, no, listen!
I have money!

145
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:36,747
I have money!
It's buried out here. It's...

146
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,086
It's $80 million.

147
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:49,827
80 million.

148
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:57,435
So that's what got
this party started, huh?

149
00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:01,105
But this money of yours won't do
me much good in prison.

150
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,573
You can go anywhere.

151
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,376
You can do anything.
Think about that.

152
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,247
You can have any future
that you want.

153
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:11,916
Jack.

154
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,987
80... million.

155
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,257
And all you've got to do...

156
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,459
is let him go.

157
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,794
That's a hell of an offer.

158
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,364
What do you think, fed?

159
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,199
Would you take that deal?

160
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,635
It's Hank.

161
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,671
His name is Hank.

162
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,441
How about it, Hank?

163
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,611
Should I let you go?

164
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,586
My name is ASAC Schrader.

165
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,555
And you can go fuck yourself.

166
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:57,361
Hank... listen to me.

167
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,929
You gotta tell him.

168
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,799
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

169
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,201
Please. Please.

170
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:08,539
What? You want me to beg?

171
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,577
You're the smartest guy
I ever met.

172
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,882
And you're too stupid to see...

173
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:21,886
He made up his mind
10 minutes ago.

174
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:32,930
Do what you're gonna do.

175
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,202
Pretty specific directions.

176
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,004
You know, most people
tell me to be somewhere,

177
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,905
They say, "west on the 40,

178
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,476
"this or that exit, second gas
station on the left."

179
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,443
You know?

180
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,147
This here?
This is a whole other story.

181
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,782
That fancy phone of yours,

182
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:28,252
Where does it say
this is exactly?

183
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:34,024
Yeah...

184
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,898
Look at this.
I even brought a shovel.

185
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,368
Jack.
No sign of Pinkman.

186
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,808
All right.

187
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,778
Says this is it right here.

188
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,713
So dig.

189
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,340
What's that?
A barrel?

190
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,409
Couple barrels?

191
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:32,082
Oh, Jesus.

192
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:32,950
Hell yeah!

193
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,518
Jesus. Would you look at that?

194
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,721
Hell yeah!

195
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,057
Whoo!

196
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:45,162
What are you waiting for?

197
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,964
Yeah, boss.

198
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:47,431
Hells yeah.

199
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,067
Let me get on...
Get that out of there, brother.

200
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,369
Ah.
Oh, snap.

201
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:36,080
Okay.

202
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:39,650
Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in the Chrysler.

203
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,218
Seriously?

204
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,052
Jack.

205
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,788
That's, like, 10 or 11 million
right there.

206
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,357
You sure you wanna do that?

207
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,792
You gonna make me say it again?

208
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,461
Go. Go. Chop, chop.

209
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,464
Jesus. What's with
all the greed here?

210
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:56,400
It's unattractive.

211
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:01,539
Hey.

212
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,341
Hey.

213
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,477
I'm leaving you a barrel.

214
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,613
Boys are gonna load it for you.

215
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,816
You got the keys to these cuffs?

216
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,729
I'm sorry for your loss.

217
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,269
My nephew here, he respects you.

218
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,637
He would never forgive me

219
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,576
If things...
went another way.

220
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,244
Also, I'll be honest,

221
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,745
You caught me
in one hell of a good mood.

222
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,047
So here's what's gonna happen.

223
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,315
You're gonna get in your car

224
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,384
And you're gonna
drive out of here.

225
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,320
All right?

226
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,423
No hard feelings.

227
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,759
Understand me?

228
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,162
We square?

229
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,064
Hey, man,
I gotta know we're square.

230
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,534
Or we're gonna have
to go that other way.

231
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:20,184
Pinkman.

232
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,521
Pinkman.

233
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,524
You still owe me.

234
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:32,229
If you can find him,
we'll kill him.

235
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,668
Found him.

236
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,444
No!

237
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,514
Get off me!

238
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,082
Get off!

239
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,454
No. No.

240
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,239
Good to go?

241
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:22,846
Hey, Uncle Jack.

242
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:32,923
Well, he was out here
with those feds.

243
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:34,425
Right? Working with them.

244
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,726
Shouldn't we maybe find out

245
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,593
What he told them first?

246
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,297
'cause, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff

247
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,100
That might not
be too good for us.

248
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:48,238
And I bet we could
get it out of him back home.

249
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,008
I mean, I could do it.

250
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,013
Me and him, we got...
we got history.

251
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:58,582
And then, you know,

252
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:02,219
We'd take care
of the job after that.

253
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:06,090
Works for me.
It work for you?

254
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,963
Let's go.
No.

255
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,598
No!

256
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,467
No!

257
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,534
No!

258
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,069
Wait.

259
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,583
I watched Jane die.

260
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,559
I was there.

261
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,195
And I watched her die.

262
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:51,034
I watched her overdose
and choke to death.

263
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:55,739
I could have saved her.

264
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:58,675
But I didn't.

265
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:32,749
Hi.

266
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,018
Hello.

267
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,255
That truck belong to you?

268
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,725
It does.

269
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:44,628
I'd like to buy it.

270
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:48,131
It's not for sale.

271
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,824
Hey, Walt, it's me.

272
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,226
Um, just thought
I'd try you again.

273
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,728
We were just wondering when you
thought you'd be back,

274
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,167
So, um, just give us a call
whenever you can.

275
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:27,037
Bye.

276
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:29,106
Hey, Aunt Marie.

277
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,575
Hey, sweetie.

278
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,910
I haven't seen you for a while.

279
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,212
What have you been up to?

280
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,581
Oh, you know.
This and that.

281
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,649
Your mom and I
need to talk, so...

282
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,351
thought I'd stop by.

283
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,855
Well, I, uh,
wish you'd called first.

284
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,623
This isn't the best time.

285
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,493
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

286
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,762
Why don't we go into your office?

287
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,403
I...I got it.

288
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,207
Okay, honey. Thanks.

289
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:19,256
Marie, I have nothing to say.

290
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:19,990
Well, I do.

291
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:24,261
So you can just
sit there and listen.

292
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:26,763
I got a call from Hank.

293
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,933
He arrested Walt three hours ago.

294
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:30,967
It's over.

295
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,504
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

296
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,772
Hank and Steve Gomez

297
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,375
Are working with
a former associate of Walt's,

298
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:41,511
Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know,

299
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,213
And Pinkman has supplied them

300
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,449
With everything they need.

301
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,953
Hank is booking Walt as we speak.

302
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:53,523
And I, for one,
could not be happier.

303
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:01,464
I almost didn't come here.

304
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,968
Christ, I barely
even know who you are,

305
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,102
And I sure as hell don't know

306
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:09,272
If I can ever trust you again.

307
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:18,315
And then I think about how
you were so upset with Walt

308
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,384
And how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

309
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,687
And all of this makes me believe

310
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,089
That there has got
to be hope for you,

311
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:30,260
That whatever
he did to you can be undone.

312
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:39,002
All I know... all I have been
forcing myself to remember,

313
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,438
Is that you are my sister.

314
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,575
And so I'm here.

315
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:49,913
Marie.

316
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,014
Everything changes now.

317
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,650
And you have got
to prepare yourself.

318
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,987
Hank will help you
as much as he can.

319
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:57,654
I know he will.

320
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:02,559
And... I will support you
through this.

321
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,862
But I have conditions.

322
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:06,696
I want you to give me

323
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,098
Every single copy
of that obscenity

324
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,033
That the two of you made
to discredit Hank.

325
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:14,938
That DVD.
Every single copy.

326
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:17,841
You understand me?

327
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,543
Answer me.
Do you understand me?

328
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,512
Yes.

329
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,615
Good.

330
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:28,551
Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here,

331
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:32,022
Because you are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything, Skyler.

332
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:35,458
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

333
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,760
Not a bunch of
uniformed strangers.

334
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:40,030
No. No.
No, he cannot... no.

335
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:43,566
You tell him. Or I will.

336
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,435
There's no way around this.

337
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,506
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

338
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:22,973
No.

339
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:44,694
Look, I gave you what you wanted.

340
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,630
- Come on.
- Please.

341
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:48,331
Hey, please.

342
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,735
I told you where
to find the tape, okay?

343
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:54,070
Hey, just... just just go.

344
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,038
Just... just go there.

345
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,973
Just go to his house and get it.

346
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,108
We're on it.

347
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,176
Get it!

348
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:02,479
No one else knows about it.

349
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,514
Just me and his partner.

350
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,448
Okay.

351
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,585
No one else knows!
I swear!

352
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,966
Let's cook.

353
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:17,313
You're completely
out of your mind.

354
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,849
- It's the truth.
- It is, Flynn.

355
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,918
Then both of you
are out of your minds.

356
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,120
You're full of shit,
is what you are.

357
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,190
Both of you.
If... if this is true,

358
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,492
Then how could you
keep this a secret?

359
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:34,197
I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

360
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:36,633
I'll be asking myself that

361
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,601
For the rest of my life.

362
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,237
So you're saying all this time

363
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,739
You were lying about this?

364
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:45,008
I mean, so you're saying...

365
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,909
you're a liar.

366
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,877
You... you just admitted it.

367
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:52,382
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

368
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:53,016
Which lie is it?

369
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:56,286
Flynn honey, your mother
is telling you the truth.

370
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:59,322
Right here, right now.
Believe it.

371
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,590
You know what?

372
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,158
This... this is bullshit.

373
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,127
This is bullshit.
Baby...

374
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:05,762
I wanna talk to dad.

375
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:06,596
Your dad's in custody.

376
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,698
You won't be able to talk to him
for a while, Sweetie.

377
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,833
I'm calling Uncle Hank.
I've tried. He's not answering.

378
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,736
Probably because he is in the thick of it
with your father.

379
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:17,373
Honey, I know this is a lot
to process, Flynn,

380
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,608
But if you could just breathe.

381
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,677
Just try to breathe,
and just trust...

382
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,580
Really? Really?
Try to breathe?

383
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,684
Oh, my god.

384
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,388
Go home.

385
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,490
Just take the kids home, okay?

386
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,225
Go home and regroup.

387
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,328
I'll stop by later.

388
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,096
Flynn?

389
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:17,066
Could you put
your seatbelt on please?

390
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:23,306
Please. It's not safe.

391
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,376
You're shittin' me, right?

392
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:33,349
If all this is true
and you knew about it,

393
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:37,754
Then... then you're
as bad as him.

394
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:50,933
Whose truck is that?

395
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:59,208
Dad?

396
00:32:59,210 --> 00:32:59,776
Listen.

397
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:03,046
I need you to come inside
and pack right now.

398
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,949
Mom, Aunt Marie, they said
that you were arrested?

399
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:07,517
Don't, just...

400
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,752
They say that you're
some kind of drug dealer?

401
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,754
No, just come inside,
please. Now.

402
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:12,989
Come inside. Come on.

403
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,157
Go, go, go, go.

404
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,293
Dad, stop.
Just talk to me please.

405
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,528
Our priority
right now is to pack.

406
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,263
Uncle Hank,
they said he arrested you?

407
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:23,032
I will discuss
all of this later, okay?

408
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,767
Just tell me what...

409
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,635
Just listen to me!

410
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,470
I need you to go
into your bedroom right now

411
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,172
And grab anything
that's important.

412
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,673
You understand?
Go. Now.

413
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,375
Both of you. Go.

414
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,976
Walt.

415
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:36,546
Why are you here?

416
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,615
Skyler, please, will you just go
get your things?

417
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,651
For you and the kids.
Right now.

418
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:42,518
This is our priority.

419
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,953
Hank had you in custody.

420
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,889
He wouldn't just let you go.
I...

421
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:47,690
Where is he?

422
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,425
I...
Where's Hank?

423
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,227
I...

424
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,829
I negotiated...

425
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,864
Negotiated?
Uh, yes.

426
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,366
What does that mean?

427
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:00,369
It means...

428
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,171
We're fine, okay?

429
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,406
We are. We're fine.

430
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,807
Everything is gonna be fine,

431
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,642
But we need to leave right now.

432
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,344
All right?
Can we do that?

433
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,046
What happened?

434
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,514
Where is Hank?

435
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,349
Why do we need to leave?

436
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:17,386
I need both of you to trust me.

437
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,088
Right now, okay?

438
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,923
Please just work with me here

439
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:25,428
And I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?

440
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,532
Where... is... Hank?

441
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,238
Skyler.

442
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:42,979
I have $11 million in cash

443
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,314
Right outside.

444
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:48,518
We can have a fresh start.

445
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:51,721
Whole new lives.

446
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:55,158
All we have to do is go.

447
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,760
We have to go right now.

448
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,496
That's all we have to do.

449
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,067
You killed him.

450
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,407
You killed Hank.

451
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,144
What?

452
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,150
No. No. No.

453
00:35:14,163 --> 00:35:16,963
- You killed him.
- No, no. No!

454
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,481
I tried to save him!

455
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,417
Uncle Hank
is dead? I...

456
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,619
Mom, it can't be true.

457
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,053
- Just stop, please.
- It just can't be true.

458
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,655
Everything...
everything is gonna be okay.

459
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,591
Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise you.

460
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,326
But we need to leave right now.

461
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,496
Dad, what's going on?
Talk to me.

462
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,332
Just stop for one second.

463
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,899
Look, I told you
to get your things.

464
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,900
- Stop walking away.
- There is no time.

465
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,005
Tell me about Uncle Hank.

466
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,740
- No, just drop it! But...
- What's wrong with you?

467
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,542
We're going.
We're going...

468
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,544
- You have to tell me.
- Dad, wait.

469
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,718
What happened
to Uncle Hank? What...

470
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,588
Get out.

471
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,225
Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.

472
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:03,126
Enough.

473
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,962
Mom, what are you doing?

474
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,297
Skyler, put the
knife down, please.

475
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,599
I promise you, everything...

476
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:14,370
Don't say one more word.

477
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:18,407
Get out of here. Now.

478
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,109
Skyler.

479
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,479
- Get out.
- Ahhh!

480
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,918
Stop it.
Stop it. Just stop!

481
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,053
Let go!

482
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,288
Let go.

483
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,223
Get away from us!
Let go.

484
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,894
- Just stop! Stop!
- You'll hurt dad.

485
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,029
Stop it. Stop.

486
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,098
Mom, stop it.

487
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,399
Stop, dad.

488
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,701
Stop it now. Stop.

489
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,670
Just please stop!

490
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,306
Stop! Stop!

491
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,475
Stop it.
Ahhh!

492
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,148
What the hell is wrong with you?

493
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,883
We're a family!

494
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,624
We're a family.

495
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,430
What are you doing?

496
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,631
What are you doing?

497
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,466
Yeah, I... I need the police.

498
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,236
My dad, he pulled
a knife on my mom.

499
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,805
He attacked her.
He's dangerous.

500
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,509
I...I think he might
have killed somebody.

501
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,044
Yeah.

502
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,447
He's still...
he's still here.

503
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:35,217
Yeah, he's...
he's still in the house.

504
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,987
We're at 308 negra arroyo lane.

505
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,991
308 negra arroyo lane!
You've gotta come quick.

506
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,593
Hurry. Oh, god, no!

507
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,931
Oh, my god. No.

508
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,967
Walt, no!
Mom!

509
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,170
Walt! Walt! Please, no!

510
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:57,239
No! No! No!

511
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,975
Walt, no! Let her go!

512
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,843
You can't take her!

513
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,145
Don't go, please!
You can't take her!

514
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,915
Let her go! Walt!

515
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:09,018
Walt! Please, don't!

516
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,821
Walt, no!
Walt, please!

517
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:15,358
Walt! No!

518
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,327
Walt, please, no!

519
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:22,665
Walt! Please! Please, stop!

520
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,633
Walt!

521
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:38,814
Why don't you say,
"da-da"?

522
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,951
How about, "da-da"?
You say, "da-da"?

523
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:46,522
There. Get rid of that
stinky old diaper, huh?

524
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,356
Don't be sad.

525
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,158
Where's your belly button?

526
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,660
Where's your belly button?

527
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,397
There. Now,
don't you feel better?

528
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,632
You're all nice and dry.

529
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,634
Huh? That feels good?

530
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,970
Oh, I know.
You were so wet and so cranky,

531
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,539
But now you feel better,
don't you?

532
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,740
Next order of business

533
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:08,210
Is to get you
a brand-new car seat.

534
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:11,547
Won't that be nice, Holly?

535
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,852
Mama... Ma.

536
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,688
Mama.

537
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,958
Mama.

538
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,161
Mama.

539
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,935
Mama... Ma.

540
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,172
Mama... Ma.

541
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,510
Mama.

542
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:53,222
Confirming the abduction.

543
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,559
Amber alert.
Holly White.

544
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,761
Female. 18 months.

545
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,162
Blond hair, blue eyes.

546
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:05,367
Last seen wearing a pink and white
Jacket and pink pants.

547
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,370
Abductor is the father.
He's considered dangerous...

548
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,905
He was in handcuffs.

549
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,073
Hank had him in handcuffs.

550
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:17,680
Fifty-one years of age, bald head,
goatee, gold wire-framed glasses.

551
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,550
You expecting a call?

552
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:25,988
<i>Hi, you've reached
the White family.</i>

553
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,056
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

554
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,758
<i>Skyler, it's me.
Pick up. Pick up.</i>

555
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,861
That's him.
That's my husband.

556
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,496
<i>I need you to pick up the phone.</i>

557
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,264
Start a trace on the landline.

558
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,533
The number's 177-8987.

559
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,669
<i>I know you're there.
So pick it up!</i>

560
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:41,637
<i>Skyler. You hear me?</i>

561
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:46,208
Need the location of an incoming call.
<i>Answer the phone.</i>

562
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:52,515
Walt. Where's Holly?

563
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,383
<i>Are you alone?</i>

564
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,253
<i>No police?</i>

565
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,654
No.

566
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,422
No police.

567
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,091
Where are you?

568
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,960
Where's Holly?

569
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:06,896
Walt!

570
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,631
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

571
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:13,936
<i>Why can't you do one thing I say?</i>

572
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:14,937
What?

573
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:15,771
<i>This is your fault.</i>

574
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:19,441
<i>This is what comes
of your disrespect.</i>

575
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:20,809
I told you, Skyler.

576
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,845
I warned you for a solid year.

577
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,548
You cross me,
there will be consequences.

578
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,017
What part of that
didn't you understand?

579
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,986
You took my child.

580
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,755
<i>'cause you need to learn.</i>

581
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,490
You bring her back.

582
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,624
Maybe now you'll listen.

583
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,460
Maybe now you'll use
your damn head.

584
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,629
You know,
you never believed in me.

585
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,966
You were never grateful for anything
I did for this family.

586
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,603
<i>"Oh, no. Walt.
Walt, you have to stop.</i>

587
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:52,775
<i>"you have to stop this.
It's immoral. It's illegal.</i>

588
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,043
<i>"someone might get hurt."</i>

589
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:57,813
<i>You're always whining
and complaining</i>

590
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,348
<i>About how I make my money,</i>

591
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,150
<i>Just dragging me down.</i>

592
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:05,487
<i>While I do everything.</i>

593
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,722
<i>And now...</i>

594
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,626
Now you tell my son what I do

595
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:14,296
<i>After I've told you and told you</i>

596
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:18,334
<i>To keep your damn mouth shut.</i>

597
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:22,338
You stupid bitch.

598
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:27,409
<i>How dare you?</i>

599
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,421
I'm sorry.

600
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:48,330
You, you have no right

601
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:51,767
To discuss anything
about what I do.

602
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:55,004
Oh, what... what the hell
do you know about it anyway?

603
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:57,106
<i>Nothing. I built this.</i>

604
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,842
<i>Me. Me alone.
Nobody else!</i>

605
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,845
You're right.

606
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:05,814
You're right.

607
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,585
You mark my words, Skyler.

608
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,255
Tow the line,

609
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,259
Or you will wind up
just like Hank.

610
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:21,730
Walt.

611
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,668
Tell me what happened.

612
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:28,837
Where is Hank?

613
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,806
Please.

614
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,941
We need to know.

615
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:41,750
You're never gonna
see Hank again.

616
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:50,192
<i>He crossed me.</i>

617
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:53,696
<i>You think about that.</i>

618
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:55,731
<i>Family or no.</i>

619
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,666
Oh, god.

620
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:01,837
You let that sink in.

621
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:05,074
<i>Walt.</i>

622
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:09,778
<i>I just want Holly back.</i>

623
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:13,282
<i>Please, Walt.</i>

624
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:19,588
Just come home.

625
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:29,765
I've still got things left to do.

626
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,678
Hey.
