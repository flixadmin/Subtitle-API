1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,621
My name
was Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,622 --> 00:00:05,148
For three years,
I worked to save my city.

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:08,859
But to save my sister,
I had to become someone else.

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:13,102
I had to become
something else.

5
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,304
Previously, on "arrow"...

6
00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:17,186
Roy's alive.
We faked his death.

7
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:19,355
He's starting
a new life.

8
00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:20,570
John.

9
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:21,155
Oliver?

10
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:22,258
Bring Nyssa
to the warehouse

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,960
at Fullerton
and Halstead...

12
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:25,595
and I'll let your wife go.

13
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:27,964
There's no way
I'm getting him back.

14
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:32,402
He's gone, Felicity. There's only thing
left of him now--us.

15
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:34,103
Do you recognize this?

16
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:36,039
The Alpha and Omega
bioweapon.

17
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,275
You will unleash this
on Starling City.

18
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:58,494
His fever
is getting worse!

19
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,064
Maseo!

20
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:03,800
A pharmacy!

21
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:13,362
The Romans
call it "vastatio."

22
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:17,366
The systemic destruction
of a land to insure its subjugation.

23
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,834
And what they found was

24
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:22,771
that immolation left
a blank slate to build anew.

25
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:25,907
Until you have
destroyed your home

26
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,009
and severed all ties
from your old life,

27
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:30,412
can you begin anew.

28
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:33,181
I did not foresee the day
that Maseo Yamashiro

29
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:34,983
appeared at my door.

30
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:35,819
You had the courage

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,120
to demand
an audience of me.

32
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:41,918
And those who do
usually offer money and treasure

33
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,696
in exchange
for my favor.

34
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:48,465
But you gave me
the Alpha and Omega.

35
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,601
The plane is en route.

36
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:55,906
It will be ready tomorrow,
as you've commanded.

37
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,879
You will marry my daughter,

38
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,948
and you will ascend
to Ra's al Ghul,

39
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,783
and then you will
fly to Starling City

40
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:09,720
carrying death itself.

41
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:13,744

43
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,738
I hate when they run!

44
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,507
Well, at least you're getting
your cardio workout in.

45
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:32,542
I still have 40 minutes
on an elliptical

46
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,444
in my immediate future.

47
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,085
You supposed to be
undercover or something?

48
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,288
I sniffed you
three blocks back.

49
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,357
You led me right
to your gang.

50
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,692
Smart plan.

51
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:49,826
Thanks.

52
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:52,396
No, I meant smart plan...

53
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:54,264
Because it was mine.

54
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,858
John, I think he gives up!

55
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:23,927
John!

56
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:26,830
John!

57
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:34,971
Thanks for coming in
through the back.

58
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,873
With Sara and Lyla
gone, the last thing I need

59
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,408
are the neighbors
talking.

60
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,310
About some strange woman
dressed in all black leather,

61
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:41,207
Yeah.

62
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,713
You're out of ice.

63
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:44,347
How can you be out of ice?

64
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,536
Here.

65
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,351
Thanks.

66
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,018
Ok, so the night's young,

67
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,821
and there's a meth dealer
working a corner on Fulton.

68
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:51,636
Sounds good.

69
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,824
Actually, it doesn't.

70
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:55,659
You were completely unhinged
out there tonight, Dig.

71
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,161
You're in denial
about how angry you are.

72
00:03:58,163 --> 00:04:01,431
No, Felicity,
I'm not in denial.

73
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:03,900
But I am angry!

74
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:09,239
Oliver.

75
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:13,710
He was my best friend.

76
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,416
And he kidnapped...

77
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,084
my wife.

78
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:24,154
And you think that justifies
hospitalizing people?

79
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:25,689
No, Felicity,
it doesn't,

80
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:27,824
you're right.
It won't happen again.

81
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:29,860
I'm not saying that
life doesn't suck right now,

82
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,662
but you can't go around the city
taking it out on every criminal you see.

83
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:34,397
How can you, out of all people,
be so sanguine

84
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,866
after what happened
last week?

85
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,434
Because I know
that that wasn't Oliver.

86
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:38,320
Now who's in denial?

87
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,737
It wasn't!

88
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,404
Our Oliver, my Oliver,

89
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,139
died the day
he joined the League.

90
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,416
This is someone else!

91
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
You truly believe that?

92
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,647
I have to.

93
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:02,359
Don't try to talk me
out of going.

94
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:06,162
Mr. Harper went through
a lot of trouble to fake his death.

95
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:08,131
You know he can never
come back here.

96
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:12,202
Yeah, well, maybe
I'm just going to go there.

97
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,049
Permanently?

98
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:14,539
Look, I don't know.

99
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,774
Honestly, I--I don't
know anything anymore.

100
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,010
I barely know who I am.

101
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:22,112
Thea, it's
understandable.

102
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,747
You've been
through something

103
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:25,949
very few people have
ever experienced.

104
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,450
Of course you feel--

105
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,020
Is that what you think
this is all about?

106
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:33,356
Almost dying?
Because I'd rather have died

107
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:36,693
than have my brother
sacrifice his life for mine.

108
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,862
And don't think for a second

109
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:41,598
that I forgot the whole reason
Ra's al Ghul was brought into our lives

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,634
is because of you.

111
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,003
You're no longer
in danger from the League.

112
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:48,939
Maybe getting away
from Starling City for a while

113
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,974
is--is what's
best for you.

114
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,577
You approve?

115
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,612
Is that supposed
to worry me?

116
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:58,181
'Cause it actually
kind of does.

117
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:02,419
Look, the only thing
I know right now...

118
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:04,955
Is that I need
to go be with Roy.

119
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:11,661
My daughter.

120
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:14,788
I am not hungry.

121
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:15,663
Ah, yes.

122
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,535
Many a bride has skipped
a meal or two before their wedding day.

123
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:20,904
I would rather die
than wed this pretender.

124
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,139
Well, you speak as though they are
the only two options

125
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:24,975
before you,
my daughter.

126
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:26,576
Daughter.

127
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:28,778
And to think, I once wore
that title with pride.

128
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,548
Perhaps "mother"
will suit you better.

129
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,085
After your betrothal
to Al Sah-him,

130
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:37,587
you will extend my lineage by having
a child of your own.

131
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,189
If you think I will
bear his child--

132
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,491
Yes! I do.

133
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:46,997
And you will have no more say in it
than your mother was given.

134
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,403
You're quiet.

135
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:55,805
I'm prepared for my
ascension to Ra's.

136
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,176
But I'm still...

137
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:02,612
coming to grips
with marriage.

138
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:04,247
Perhaps a walk
to clear my head.

139
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:07,117
I will send a guard
to accompany you.

140
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,952
If I can't
protect myself,

141
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:11,855
I don't deserve to
inherit your mantle.

142
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,871
You're late.

143
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:30,140
Sorry.

144
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:32,909
Nanda Parbat's not exactly
the easiest place to infiltrate.

145
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,779
Don't joke!

146
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:37,981
Things are worse
than we thought.

147
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:46,233
Tomorrow?

148
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,493
Ra's plans to transport

149
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:48,893
the virus to Starling
on a plane.

150
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:50,995
That is oddly modern
for the League.

151
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:52,197
Do you think
Ra's suspects you?

152
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,665
He has no reason to.

153
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:54,899
I warned you it
would be difficult.

154
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,768
I just thought that I'd--

155
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,337
ahem--we'd have more time,

156
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,807
when you explained to me
that my ascension to Ra's

157
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:05,009
would include
the destruction of Starling.

158
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,545
I anticipated you wouldn't be
Ra's for months.

159
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,368
More than enough time to dismantle
the League from the inside.

160
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:13,485
Malcolm, we need help.

161
00:08:16,624 --> 00:08:18,123
From all accounts,
you were...

162
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,724
too good at convincing
your friends

163
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:22,193
that you'd allied
yourself with Ra's,

164
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:24,896
and I don't think
I carry much credibility with them.

165
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:27,198
I know someone
who they'll trust.

166
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,351
You've been
gone a while.

167
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:44,318
There was concern.

168
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,287
I've just been here thinking.

169
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:51,059
We need to find
ibuprofen!

170
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:52,894
You know that
can't help him now.

171
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:54,896
Why isn't the inoculant
working on him?!

172
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:58,199
He's young. His immune system
probably isn't strong enough.

173
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:04,605
Akio!

174
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:07,041
Swallow.

175
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,814
Okaasan...Boku kowaiyo.

176
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:14,882
Shinitaku naiyo...

177
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:25,293
♪ Nennen korori yo ♪

178
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:28,796
♪ okorori yo ♪

179
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:34,902
♪ boya wa yoi ko da ♪

180
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:36,537
General Shrieve...

181
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,007
Maseo. I want to
kill Shrieve, too,

182
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:42,844
but you need to focus
on helping Akio!

183
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:44,245
Shrieve's men
made a vaccine.

184
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,047
Maybe they also made a cure.

185
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:47,248
No, Maseo, they
didn't make a cure!

186
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,516
I know it's unlikely,

187
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:49,984
but I have to try.

188
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,653
Ok.

189
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:55,156
I'll help you.

190
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:09,303
Hi, I'm looking for Jason.

191
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:11,539
Oh, yeah?
Well, lucky him.

192
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:15,076
Yo, Jason.
Got a visitor.

193
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:19,413
Jason?

194
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,885
That's right.

195
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:27,688
I have a '67 Mustang that
needs a little work on it.

196
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,491
Somebody said you were
the guy to see.

197
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:32,393
You came
to the right place.

198
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:38,232
I can't believe
you're still alive.

199
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:40,168
Look, I wanted to tell you,

200
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,836
but if you knew,
you'd tell Oliver.

201
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:42,613
And then Oliver
would have...

202
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:44,016
Would have broken
you out of prison.

203
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,940
Yeah.

204
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,741
And probably
kicked your ass.

205
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:49,043
And I would have
helped him.

206
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:50,311
I had to do it.

207
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:51,879
For Oliver.

208
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,414
Do you think there's maybe
some other place

209
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,815
we can go talk?

210
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:56,951
There's my place.

211
00:10:56,953 --> 00:10:59,620
That's such
a good answer.

212
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:13,868
Hey.

213
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,603
You got it to fly.
What more do you want?

214
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:17,071
Well, true art
is never finished,

215
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:18,359
it's only abandoned.

216
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,928
Plus, I had this
little idea I just couldn't kick.

217
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,430
You ok?

218
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,231
You have this
little cloud

219
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,399
that keeps
following you around.

220
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:27,867
Yeah.

221
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:29,135
Well, something
happened while you were away,

222
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:32,205
and...I'm just
handling it.

223
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:34,441
Is it, uh,
Oliver-related?

224
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,242
It's Oliver-related.

225
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:37,877
If you want
to talk about it...

226
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:40,180
Maybe we shouldn't
cross that line.

227
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:41,581
It's a long story, anyway.

228
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,249
Well, if you change
your mind, I have time.

229
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:45,018
And, hey...

230
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,220
you're my friend.

231
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:49,255
I'm always going
to be there for you.

232
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:51,124
It's non-negotiable.

233
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:54,027
Thanks, Ray.

234
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,730
So, while I'm waiting to do
something for you,

235
00:11:56,732 --> 00:12:01,301
there's a little something that
you can do for me.

236
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:05,004
Sign...here
and here.

237
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:07,006
Ok.

238
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:08,541
Right.

239
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:09,976
What's this for?

240
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:11,945
Just a little
corporate stuff,

241
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:13,313
Miss Vice President.

242
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,447
Mm-hmm.

243
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:19,119
Everything ok?

244
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,688
Probably not.

245
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:29,496
You've been quiet.

246
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,964
I have a lot on my mind.

247
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,066
I meant
about the virus.

248
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:36,069
The Alpha Omega.

249
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,505
When did you take it?

250
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,340
From the truck.

251
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,510
Before
we blew it up.

252
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,945
So before...

253
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:48,081
Even before
Akio died,

254
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,516
I wanted revenge
on Shrieve

255
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,317
for the pain
he caused.

256
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:54,587
But instead, you used it to trade
your way into the League.

257
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,723
I am not strong.

258
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:59,559
Not enough for myself,

259
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,795
and certainly not
enough for Tatsu.

260
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,596
If you could go back
to her, would you?

261
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:05,498
That is immaterial.

262
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,668
Maseo Yamashiro
is no more.

263
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,370
He doesn't have to be.

264
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,206
When I'm Ra's, I can
release you from your oath.

265
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,142
I can set you free.

266
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:19,112
The League
is not my prison.

267
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:22,849
From my prison...

268
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:26,019
There is no escape.

269
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:30,820
So now Malcolm Merlyn
can summon us.

270
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,689
I really don't like the idea
that he can summon us.

271
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,657
Any idea what this is about?

272
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:38,360
No, but Merlyn assures me that
he'll be waving the white flag.

273
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,429
I'm sorry.
I forgot the flag.

274
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:43,031
That's too bad. I would have told you
where you can put it.

275
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:45,034
What is this about, Malcolm?

276
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,103
Well, this isn't going
to be easy for all of you to believe--

277
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:49,905
Only because
you're a sociopath and a liar.

278
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:52,174
Be that as it may,
this will be much quicker

279
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:55,043
for all of us if we can fast forward
through the cynicism

280
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:58,280
and reach the conclusion
that I am telling you the truth.

281
00:13:58,282 --> 00:13:59,282
About what?

282
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:01,683
Oliver.

283
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:04,353
His allegiance with the League
is a charade.

284
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,455
Why would you even begin to play with
our emotions like that?

285
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:08,924
This plan was
born the moment Oliver realized

286
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:10,959
that he had to capitulate
to Ra's to save Thea.

287
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,294
And instead
of sharing this plan

288
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,530
with us,
he trusted you?

289
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:17,299
The man who
had my sister murdered.

290
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:18,934
Well, I am better
practiced in the art of deception.

291
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:21,103
And no offense,
none of you are

292
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,305
particularly good actors.
I'm out.

293
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:25,140
You've seen for yourselves

294
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:26,809
how dangerous Ra's
and the League are.

295
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,611
The circle of trust
had to remain as small as possible.

296
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:30,613
Until now?

297
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,115
What changed?

298
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:33,463
Forget it, Felicity.

299
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,185
There's nothing he can
say that we can believe.

300
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:36,451
Mr. Diggle's right.

301
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:38,520
Which is why
I brought along

302
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,155
a friend of Oliver's.

303
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,565
My name is Tatsu Yamashiro.

304
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:53,689
And your city
is in great danger.

305
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,458
You expect us
to believe her?

306
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,712
We never even met her.

307
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:05,527
We never met her, right?

308
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:06,225
No.

309
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:08,259
Apart from my brief time
helping Oliver

310
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:10,895
recover from the wounds
Ra's al Ghul inflicted on him,

311
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:15,433
my life has been
one of...isolation.

312
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:17,101
Ok, Merlyn, this is
your big plan?

313
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,904
A woman that we've never met
or even heard of?

314
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:21,773
Oliver doesn't like
to speak about the past.

315
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:24,175
Apparently, he's not so forthcoming
about the present, either.

316
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:26,144
My son was killed by the virus

317
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:28,112
Ra's intends to use
on your city.

318
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:30,281
Are you--you're
Akio's mother?

319
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,750
Oliver was with me
en it happened.

320
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:36,387
He knows that the danger
you all face is very real.

321
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,922
Ok, you know what,
how many times are we going

322
00:15:37,924 --> 00:15:39,390
to believe him after
everything that he's done?

323
00:15:39,392 --> 00:15:43,228
I am not privy
to your history with Malcolm.

324
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,797
This request
comes from Oliver.

325
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,465
We're not sure
that's any better at the moment.

326
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:50,802
Look, I am not
playing a game here.

327
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:53,938
My daughter lives
in this city, remember?

328
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,407
This is everything I have
on the bioweapon.

329
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,977
I've arranged passage
for all of us to go to Nanda Parbat.

330
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,411
If you're coming...

331
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:03,414
be at Ferris Air
before sunrise.

332
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,424
Charming.

333
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:15,994
It's a sublet. I won't
be here for much longer.

334
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:18,296
What about
the auto shop?

335
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,465
It's...temporary.

336
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,267
Sure, they don't ask
a lot of questions,

337
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:24,769
but it's inevitable someone
puts two and two together.

338
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,872
How about your
other night job?

339
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:30,041
I figured I'd just leave
the crime fighting to the cops.

340
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:32,543
I kind of just want
to be normal.

341
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:35,179
Yeah? And how's that
going for you?

342
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:37,448
I am so bored.

343
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,486
Yeah, well,
that's why

344
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:43,921
I brought you this.

345
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:48,426
Malcolm stole it
out of impound.

346
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:51,896
Don't worry--I made him promise
nobody would get killed.

347
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:53,631
I never thought I'd see
this thing again.

348
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:55,667
I figured since everybody
thinks that

349
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:57,468
Roy Harper
is the Arrow,

350
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,104
They don't have to know
that he's Arsenal, too, right?

351
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,639
Hmm.

352
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,141
So that's why you came here?

353
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:05,443
Just to give me this?

354
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:08,946
Well...yes, this.

355
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:11,849
And...

356
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,078
How could we not
know about this?

357
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:42,206
How could anyone not know about
a terrorist attack in Hong Kong?

358
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:44,107
Because Beijing had us believing
that these deaths were caused

359
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:45,542
by a local chemical spill.

360
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,344
You don't really
believe Merlyn?

361
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,346
Well, looking at this, we can't
afford not to believe Merlyn.

362
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,615
He is a mass murderer
who has lied to us so many times

363
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:53,150
it should be
a drinking game.

364
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:55,285
And I have never
even heard of this Tatsu person.

365
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,520
Felicity, I don't know
if you're right

366
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:58,722
that Oliver's gone
forever or not.

367
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,757
The truth is, for me,
it doesn't matter.

368
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,226
If there's even a possibility of this
kind of danger in my city,

369
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:05,695
I'm reporting for duty.

370
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:06,697
Me, too.

371
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,132
I don't believe them.

372
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,601
And even if I did,
I can't go back there.

373
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,638
Not after what they did
to Oliver.

374
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,418
Relax, my child.

375
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:25,383
Another order
I cannot follow.

376
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:27,419
You speak to me
as though I'm a monster.

377
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:28,954
I'm your father,
Nyssa.

378
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:31,723
Then why do you ask me
to marry someone I do not love?

379
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:34,159
When I was in a desert

380
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:36,428
tending to some affairs,

381
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,864
I crossed paths
with a woman.

382
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,132
She was breathtaking

383
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:44,669
in her visage
and fortitude.

384
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:48,173
Her name
was Ameena Raatko.

385
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:52,177
I had taken
other lovers before,

386
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,879
but she was different.

387
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:56,478
She had a wit
and a fire about her

388
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:59,332
that I found myself
I could not live without.

389
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,567
So she became my concubine

390
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,502
and the mother of my child.

391
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:17,182
This was my gift to her
in honor of you.

392
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:19,218
A gift that she gave me.

393
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,787
And so I kept it
in the hopes that one day,

394
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:24,923
you would wear it
on your wedding day.

395
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:29,328
You expect me to marry Al Sah-him
because of some trinket?

396
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,598
I expect you to marry
Al Sah-him

397
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,433
because it is my will.

398
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,435
You defy that,
and I will

399
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:39,939
see you suffer the pain
of a thousand deaths.

400
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:58,090
I am sorry
to intrude.

401
00:19:58,092 --> 00:20:00,993
Mr. Merlyn said that
I would find you here.

402
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:05,765
That might be the only
thing he's ever said that isn't a lie.

403
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,733
I did not come here
to convince you

404
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:09,602
of the threat to your home.

405
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:12,004
There's nothing I can say
that you will believe,

406
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:14,640
more than what you have seen.

407
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:18,778
Then why
are you here?

408
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,714
To speak with you
about Oliver.

409
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:24,850
During his recuperation,

410
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:26,886
Oliver spoke of you.

411
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:30,523
Of how his last thought
before the fall

412
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:33,759
was of you.

413
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:36,529
You love him...still.

414
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:39,899
Oliver belongs
to Ra's now.

415
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:42,401
If you believe that,
you must fight for him.

416
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:45,204
There is no
"him" left.

417
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:47,907
I thought as you do once.

418
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:51,210
My husband, Maseo,

419
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:54,747
was consumed by
the League's darkness.

420
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:58,217
I was so convinced
that he was lost to me

421
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:02,221
that I didn't even try
to reach him.

422
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:04,590
Don't make my mistake...

423
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:06,759
Felicity.

424
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:15,996
Are you sure
Shrieve will be here?

425
00:21:15,997 --> 00:21:18,698
Do you know of any other rogue
U.S. army bases in the area?

426
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,331
Shrieve will have
reinforced the station

427
00:21:20,332 --> 00:21:22,733
since the last time
we were here.

428
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:31,409
Two there.

429
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:33,122
Waller took you
from Lian Yu

430
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:35,257
because she saw
something in you.

431
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,860
My son needs that from you.

432
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:41,229
The killer inside.

433
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,865
Sir, this is
a restricted area.

434
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:58,296
Is that
a Masamune blade?

435
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:00,033
A katana.

436
00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:02,868
Passed on for centuries
within my family.

437
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,904
The first son
of each generation.

438
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,107
You are not
a son, Tatsu.

439
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:11,877
No, I am not.

440
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:13,679
Let's get this
over with.

441
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:16,148
The plane's ready;
It should be big enough for all of us.

442
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,449
Including her.

443
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:19,585
Thought
you weren't coming.

444
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:21,553
I changed my mind.

445
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:23,922
But if you betray us,
I'll make sure the whole world knows

446
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:27,326
that you are alive,
and where they can find you.

447
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:46,803
So this
is Nanda Parbat.

448
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:48,971
Next time, we should
really look into getting some horses.

449
00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:51,374
You think they rent
horses here?

450
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:52,942
There won't be a next time.

451
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,312
There it is.

452
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:58,247
The plane Ra's
intends to use

453
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:00,850
to spread the Alpha
Omega over Starling.

454
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:02,852
I need to be within
50 yards to breech the plane's

455
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:04,687
internal mainframe
and navigation software,

456
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:05,847
but then I should be able to remote
ground the thing.

457
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:06,848
Quiet.

458
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:08,489
I don't see anything.

459
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:14,096
There'll be more.

460
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:32,081
Get to the plane.
We'll cover you. Go!

461
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,526
Close enough.

462
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:15,758
Surrender now,
and you might live.

463
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,093
Maseo.

464
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:18,361
Maseo is a memory.

465
00:24:18,363 --> 00:24:20,263
Our child was gone,

466
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:22,598
and you left me when
I needed you most.

467
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,334
But you can still
come back to me.

468
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:27,303
It's not too late.

469
00:24:27,305 --> 00:24:29,605
Yes, it is.

470
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,684
You know I wouldn't
have done the same thing for you.

471
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:43,686
I know.

472
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:50,793
Your husband is long dead.

473
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:52,395
If Sarab must die as well,

474
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:55,998
then so be it.

475
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,475
Oh, frack!

476
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:08,010
More frack!

477
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:15,851
Oh. That makes
more sense.

478
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:27,663
Can you bring it
down from the sky?

479
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:30,166
They destroyed my gear,
but I had some insurance come along.

480
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:32,134
What kind
of insurance?

481
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:36,205
The atomic kind.

482
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:01,564
Ray!

483
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:10,072
Ray!

484
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:12,375
Ohh. You should see
the other guy.

485
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,398
Tell Akio...

486
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,766
I love him.

487
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:46,709
You tell him for both of us.

488
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:57,820
Thank you...

489
00:26:57,822 --> 00:27:01,190
for releasing me...

490
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:03,325
from my prison.

00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,293
Enough!

496
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:39,495
You have failed.

497
00:27:39,497 --> 00:27:44,099
Any further attempt to undermine
our cause would be futile.

498
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:46,302
Uh, you see that burning
plane over there?

499
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,138
We destroyed your
city threatening bioweapon.

500
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,706
No.

501
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:53,542
You merely think you did.

502
00:27:55,745 --> 00:27:58,414
Surrender!

503
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,649
Or die.

504
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:11,909
Hey.

505
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:14,112
Oliver. Oliver,
what's going on?

506
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:16,848
If any of you speak,
we're all going to die.

507
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,250
What...?
I need you to trust me.

508
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:28,292
Chinese have a saying.

509
00:28:28,294 --> 00:28:30,361
Stir the grass,

510
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:32,597
and you stifle
the snake.

511
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:35,767
My ruse with the plane was
meant to reveal

512
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:38,436
any traitors among me.

513
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:41,172
How did you know
of the virus?

514
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:44,642
Of the plane?

515
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,518
Maseo told me,

516
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,119
and I told them.

517
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:57,288
So a dead man told you.

518
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:00,091
How convenient.

519
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:03,327
He said only three men
knew about your plan.

520
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:07,298
You, him, and Oliver.

521
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,267
Oliver Queen is dead.

522
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:10,768
I am Al Sah-him.

523
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,170
This would not be
the first time

524
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:13,671
that Sarab has
betrayed me

525
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:15,306
to Maseo Yamashiro's
weaknesses.

526
00:29:15,308 --> 00:29:18,609
And though your timing
was a function of my gambit,

527
00:29:18,611 --> 00:29:21,012
it was nevertheless
fortuitous.

528
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:24,515
You see, by tradition,
Ra's would contemplate mercy

529
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:27,485
upon his enemies
on the eve of a wedding.

530
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:30,521
You are
getting married?

531
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:32,824
I guess there really is
a kettle for every pot.

532
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:36,127
The wedding is mine.

533
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:38,429
I am betrothed
to Nyssa al Ghul.

534
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:43,534
Take them below.

535
00:30:08,394 --> 00:30:10,962
So can you
tell me now?

536
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:13,064
Tell you what?

537
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:14,232
What you're really
doing here?

538
00:30:14,234 --> 00:30:17,001
What, seeing you
is not good enough?

539
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:18,503
What's going on?

540
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:25,710
Something happened.

541
00:30:25,712 --> 00:30:27,712
I was hurt.

542
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:29,881
And...

543
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:31,749
to save me, Ollie...

544
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:36,487
had to accept Ra's offer
to join the League.

545
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:38,189
Oh, my God.

546
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:39,524
Thea...

547
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:41,292
I tried to stop him.

548
00:30:41,294 --> 00:30:43,928
I--I couldn't, and...

549
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,332
Now he's become
someone else.

550
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:50,334
Everything just slips away
when I'm with you.

551
00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:52,637
I understand that.

552
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:55,239
But?

553
00:30:55,241 --> 00:31:00,311
When bad things happen,
your go-to move is to bolt.

554
00:31:00,313 --> 00:31:03,147
To get out
of Starling.

555
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:04,449
I don't think
this is something

556
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:05,850
you can
run away from.

557
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:08,753
I'm not running away.

558
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:11,556
Running to you.

559
00:31:12,858 --> 00:31:15,159
Do you not want me to?

560
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,694
The only thing
that I want

561
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:18,896
is what's best for you.

562
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:21,999
You always have.

563
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:24,035
Come here.

564
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,672
Mmm.

565
00:31:33,312 --> 00:31:35,480
I can't believe
he's going to marry her.

566
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:39,183
You should worry more about getting
out of here alive.

567
00:31:39,185 --> 00:31:42,987
Is that even
a remote possibility?

568
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:44,989
Didn't think so.

569
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,891
We aren't going
to die here.

570
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:48,860
Oliver would never
let that happen.

571
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:51,362
He let this happen.

572
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:59,237
Wareeth al Ghul
commands your presence.

573
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:20,358
Leave us.

574
00:32:25,197 --> 00:32:27,365
Is everyone ok?

575
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:28,168
Like you give a damn!

576
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:29,345
Didn't Malcolm speak to you?

577
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:30,202
He did.

578
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:31,937
So was a part of your plan
to leave my daughter alone

579
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:33,238
when you kidnapped my wife?

580
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,372
I had to do something

581
00:32:34,374 --> 00:32:35,774
to prove
my loyalty to Ra's.

582
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,876
So taking Lyla?
That was your idea, Oliver?

583
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:39,511
In front of our daughter?!

584
00:32:39,513 --> 00:32:41,913
Yes.
You met Tatsu.

585
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:43,581
What does that have
to do with anything?

586
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,717
Tatsu told me...

587
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,752
that in order
to beat Ra's,

588
00:32:47,754 --> 00:32:49,387
I would have
to sacrifice

589
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:51,623
all of the things in my life that I
hold most precious.

590
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,225
And your friendship
is on that list.

591
00:32:54,227 --> 00:32:57,262
Oliver, you didn't just...
lose my friendship.

592
00:32:57,264 --> 00:32:58,997
You lost my trust.

593
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,665
You lost my respect.

594
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:03,902
What?!

595
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:05,203
Ra's demands
that we return

596
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:06,738
this man
to his friends.

597
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:30,328
Give us the cure.

598
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,597
You boys make
quite the entrance.

599
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,933
The cure! Now!

600
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:39,938
The Chinese own enough
of our national debt

601
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,906
to decimate our economy,

602
00:33:41,908 --> 00:33:43,675
and all without
firing a shot.

603
00:33:43,677 --> 00:33:45,276
Or, they could destroy us

604
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:47,512
with the largest army
in human history.

605
00:33:47,514 --> 00:33:49,647
Enough!

606
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:51,816
My son needs your cure.

607
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:53,284
What makes you think--

608
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:55,954
The next one
goes in your head.

609
00:33:57,656 --> 00:34:00,859
You see that safe
over there?

610
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:02,861
The passcode is 4587.

611
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:07,866
He'll have to deliver
the cure subcutaneously,

612
00:34:07,868 --> 00:34:10,201
in the exact ratio
I give you.

613
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:12,637
You may want
to write this down.

614
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,672
You don't
need to tell us.

615
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:18,710
You're coming with us.

616
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:25,583
This is so
beautiful...

617
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:29,487
and yet so dangerous.

618
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,058
Much like
its former owner.

619
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,026
Sarab's former love,

620
00:34:35,028 --> 00:34:37,328
who's now
my prisoner,

621
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,199
along with Al Sah-him's
former friends.

622
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:44,536
You see, their treachery
was anticipated.

623
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:47,372
Yours, however, Al Sa-Her,
is disappointing.

624
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:50,008
Because I expected
more loyalty

625
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,710
from a man whose
daughter I saved.

626
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:54,946
The last time I appeared
before you in chains,

627
00:34:54,948 --> 00:34:57,348
I offered my fealty,

628
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:00,218
and I am here
to offer it again.

629
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,987
You had nothing
to offer then,

630
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:05,223
and you have nothing
to offer now.

631
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:06,558
I have the name
of the person

632
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,893
who betrayed you
to Al Sah-him's friends.

633
00:35:08,895 --> 00:35:11,362
It wasn't Maseo Yamoshiro.

634
00:35:11,364 --> 00:35:13,698
It was Oliver Queen.

635
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,136
He's been
lying to you all along.

636
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:27,916
What's this?

637
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:28,594
I'm sorry, Oliver.

638
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:30,286
My name is Al Sah-him.

639
00:35:30,287 --> 00:35:33,088
Not according to Mr. Merlyn here.
You see, he claims

640
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,324
that you've been
deceiving me the entire time.

641
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:38,293
I have killed
for you.

642
00:35:38,295 --> 00:35:40,729
I have severed all
ties to my past.

643
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,697
I have hurt people
who were friends to Oliver Queen,

644
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,400
and if you hadn't
have stopped me,

645
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:47,435
I would have murdered your daughter
at your command.

646
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,004
But what if this is all
just part of your own

647
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:50,972
elaborate ruse?

648
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:54,576
Then I will have nothing
and no one to go home to.

649
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:57,211
Oliver Queen is dead,

650
00:35:57,214 --> 00:35:59,381
and the Arrow
is gone.

651
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:01,783
We shall see.

652
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:18,767
Roy?

653
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,007
Excuse me, I'm,
uh, looking for--

654
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:27,342
Jason's friend,
yeah, I remember.

655
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:30,011
He said you probably
would be stopping by.

656
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:32,013
Oh. Can I talk
to him?

657
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:34,682
I don't know where he is.
He came in an hour ago to quit.

658
00:36:34,684 --> 00:36:37,385
He, uh, said
to give you this.

659
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:45,393
Dear Thea, I wasn't supposed
to make it this far.

660
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:48,196
I was supposed to end up
in jail or dead by now.

661
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:51,266
But then I met you, and you made me
want to be the man

662
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:53,234
I saw through your eyes.

663
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:55,837
And now all I want to do
is give that back;

664
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,206
help you be the person
you can be without Oliver,

665
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,741
without your father,

666
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:01,543
and without me.

667
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:03,011
Living on the run
from the police

668
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,313
isn't the life
you deserve, Thea.

669
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:08,083
It's not what Oliver
gave up his life for you to have.

670
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:10,218
Whatever happens with me,

671
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,454
I'll always love you.

672
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:15,390
P.S.--Thanks for the suit,

673
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,326
but I always thought red
was more your color, anyway.

674
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:33,441
So what did
Oliver say to you?

675
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:37,011
Nothing worth hearing.

676
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:41,082
You were right
about Oliver.

677
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:42,617
I should have
listened to you.

678
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:48,723
I told you about Oliver.
You were supposed to--

679
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,226
I was supposed to do
what, Mr. Merlyn?

680
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,727
Grant you mercy?

681
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,829
I am.

682
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:56,598
Because this death will be
a lot shorter

683
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,399
than the one I had
planned for you.

684
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,635
You--

685
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:04,739
Oliver, if what Malcolm
said is true,

686
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,242
if you're going to do anything,
now is the time!

687
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:10,879
Al Sah-him has said that
the swordswoman is inoculated,

688
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:14,015
so you can take her
to another chamber.

689
00:38:14,017 --> 00:38:16,651
No! Oliver!

690
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:19,053
Oliver,
we believed in you!

691
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,990
Seal the room.

692
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:27,195
You're not listening.
Oliver!

693
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:28,997
For the love of God!

694
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:30,598
No, Oliver!

695
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,133
What the hell are you doing?!

696
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,363
Come on, you got
to get us out of here!

697
00:38:33,364 --> 00:38:34,506
We trusted you.

698
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,530
You asked us to trust you
and we trusted you!

699
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:39,174
Don't
do this! Oliver!

700
00:38:43,846 --> 00:38:47,048
Tatsu.

701
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,685
There's a cure, and he knows how
to administer it.

702
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,288
A little help.

703
00:38:57,694 --> 00:38:59,794
Maseo...

704
00:39:00,863 --> 00:39:02,463
He's not breathing.

705
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,567
The cure, he needs it now!

706
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:13,341
Akio.

707
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:16,010
Please wake up.

708
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:18,613
Please wake up!

709
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:21,549
He was dead the moment
he was exposed.

710
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:22,650
But you said...

711
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,185
That there is no cure.

712
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:26,087
Then what the hell
is that?!

713
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:27,655
Insulin.

714
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,190
I'm diabetic.

715
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:31,993
Ah.

716
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:35,530
I want to thank you
for bringing me here.

717
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:38,266
It would have taken us weeks
to track you all down.

718
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:42,036
And I do so hate loose ends.

719
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:01,022
You are
Wareeth al Ghul,

720
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,391
Heir to the Demon.

721
00:40:03,393 --> 00:40:05,026
Before the night
is over,

722
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,729
you will be
Ibn al Ghul.

723
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:09,764
Son of the Demon.

724
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,265
There is no vow
more sacred,

725
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:46,701
nor covenant more holy

726
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:50,171
than the one between
man and woman.

727
00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:51,873
With this ceremony,

728
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:53,408
your souls
are bound together,

729
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,143
forever joined.

730
00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:57,712
You will never be free.

731
00:40:57,714 --> 00:40:59,580
You will always
be held captive

732
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,816
by your love
for each other.

733
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:11,826
Continue.

734
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:13,428
I'm sorry,
Felicity, for everything.

735
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,998
You don't have
to be sorry for anything, John.

736
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:20,300
I'm glad to have
known you.

737
00:41:20,303 --> 00:41:21,969
We offer blessings.

738
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:45,293
The union is sealed.

739
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:07,067
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

740
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:25,585
Greg!
Move your head.
