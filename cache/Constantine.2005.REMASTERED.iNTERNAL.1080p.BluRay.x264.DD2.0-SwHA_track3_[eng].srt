1
00:01:58,786 --> 00:01:59,662
Manuel.

2
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:01,914
Manuel!

3
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,596
Manuel.

4
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,405
I think...

5
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,450
I think I found you one.

6
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,873
Look, I called you, right?

7
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,005
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself,
I called you, John.

8
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,982
It's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

9
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,650
It's okay.

10
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,372
This is Constantine.

11
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:35,753
John Constantine, asshole.

12
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,845
Sure.

13
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,912
What the hell?

14
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,931
I need a mirror.

15
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,226
Now. At least three feet high.

16
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,020
Move! Go, now!

17
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,953
This is Kramer.

18
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,747
Chas Kramer, asshole.

19
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:55,874
Asshole.

20
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:01,797
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

21
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,049
- Chas!
- What?

22
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,927
-Move the car.
-Why?

23
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:08,887
Move the damn car!

24
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,351
"Chas, move the car."

25
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,896
There, car's moved.

26
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,743
Lift it up over the bed.

27
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,540
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

28
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:43,797
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

29
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,019
No!

30
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,402
Show yourself.

31
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,368
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

32
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,002
For your boss.

33
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,505
Pull it!

34
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,742
Ma? Ma?

35
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,282
Like I said, I found you something,
didn't I, John? Didn't I?

36
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:35,951
What happened in there?

37
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,753
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

38
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,921
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

39
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,049
I have to sleep, John.

40
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,386
I need some help, Father.

41
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,680
You do?

42
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,016
From me?

43
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,476
What kind of--

44
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,232
-Hey, listen, I--
-That exorcism wasn't right.

45
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,112
Listen to the ether.

46
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,700
Anything unusual, you let me know.

47
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:21,622
Come on, you don't need its protection.
It'll be like back in the day.

48
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,877
A few days.

49
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,129
Okay.

50
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,965
Okay. For you, John.

51
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,890
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

52
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,684
-1 told you to move it.
-You did tell me to move it,

53
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:46,438
but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon,

54
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,106
I would've moved it further, John.

55
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,568
- Take Alvarado.
- Yeah, thank you. I know what to take.

56
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,281
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe I could help out?

57
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,867
- No?
- Nope.

58
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,118
Nope?

59
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,662
Of course it's a nope.

60
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,826
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

61
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,706
It's been...

62
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,751
two weeks since my last confession.

63
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,048
I killed a man today.

64
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,260
Another one.

65
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,477
I didn't even see his face, I just...

66
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,273
pulled the trigger, and he went away.

67
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:17,988
Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.

68
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,493
Why do I always know
where these guys are?

69
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,372
Where to aim, when to fire.

70
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,252
I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?

71
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,172
Something damned?

72
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,801
God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.

73
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:44,681
You mustn't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.

74
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,767
Yeah, I'm trying.

75
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,978
I'm trying real hard.

76
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,523
Isabel.

77
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,159
Isabel.

78
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,218
Things I've beaten.

79
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,722
Things most people never even heard of.

80
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,476
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

81
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,104
Wouldn't be the first, John.

82
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,900
Come on, Les.

83
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,153
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

84
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,655
This is aggressive.

85
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,701
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

86
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,871
Now you don't wanna leave.

87
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,665
Yeah, that's a good idea.

88
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,338
John, you really need to prepare.

89
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,220
-Make arrangements.
-No need.

90
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,598
I already know exactly where I'm going.

91
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,146
- Morning.
- Good morning.

92
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,607
- Good morning.
- Detective.

93
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,401
- No, no, no.
- Angela, wait.

94
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,403
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

95
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,865
Give us the room, please.

96
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,481
Isabel.

97
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,532
She fell from the roof?

98
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,576
She jumped.

99
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,955
- No.
- Look,

100
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,500
I know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

101
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,679
- Isabel wouldn't kill herself.
- Angie.

102
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,391
-She wouldn't kill herself.
-Detective.

103
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,517
- Period.
- Detective.

104
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,518
Period!

105
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,190
Angie, there were security cameras.

106
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,870
-Hold the door. You going down?
-Not if I can help it.

107
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,672
A new case?

108
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:15,095
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

109
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,265
- Humor me.
- Don't I always?

110
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,022
Oh, yeah, that's...
Much obliged. Thank you.

111
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,610
How you feeling, John?

112
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:31,945
So, what's new?

113
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,657
Uh...

114
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:40,578
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope,

115
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:44,291
holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan,

116
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,503
and, oh, you'll love this,
screech beetle from Amityville.

117
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,174
Yeah, it's funny to you,

118
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,635
but to the fallen,
that's like nails on a chalkboard.

119
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,721
What is it exactly with you and bugs?

120
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,224
I just like them.

121
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,060
Yeah. Who doesn't?

122
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,772
Yeah, easy there, hero.

123
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:12,027
-That's dragon's breath.
-1 thought you couldn't get it anymore.

124
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,903
Yeah, well, I...

125
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,239
...know a guy who knows a guy.

126
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,915
So, what's the action?

127
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,878
I just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

128
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,506
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

129
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,302
Yeah, I know how it sounds.

130
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,306
No, we're finger puppets to them, John,
not doorways.

131
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,643
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

132
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,355
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

133
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,316
Sure thing, John. Uh...

134
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,692
Anything else?

135
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,570
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a, uh...

136
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,324
On the house.

137
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,701
All right, question.

138
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,953
How much longer do I have to be
your slave, John?

139
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,624
You're not my slave, Chas.

140
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,044
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

141
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,421
Like Tonto or Robin.

142
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,050
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

143
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,179
Right. So then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

144
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,767
John? John.

145
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,812
I love our little talks, John.

146
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,203
May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

147
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,123
No, thanks,
I'm not gonna be staying long.

148
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:52,168
- How about you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

149
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,505
I really need to speak with him.
It's very important.

150
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,882
First come, first served.

151
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,638
Oh. So you're rude
no matter where you are.

152
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,024
- Father.
- Hi.

153
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,611
- You have news.
- Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

154
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,529
Yes.

155
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,662
I know what you want, son.

156
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,207
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

157
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,878
I'm flattered.

158
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,048
Well, I could offer something

159
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,594
about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock,

160
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,597
but it might sound disingenuous.

161
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,433
She has to have
a Catholic funeral, Father. She has to.

162
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,561
Angela, it's still considered
a mortal sin.

163
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,062
She didn't commit suicide.

164
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,690
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

165
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,233
Oh, rules.

166
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,194
Father.

167
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,613
David.

168
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,699
This is Isabel.

169
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,661
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

170
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,247
Please.

171
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,666
I'm sorry.

172
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,757
I've been seeing
some unusual soul traffic lately.

173
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,134
You might consider
giving me an extension.

174
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,429
I could do your side
some good these days.

175
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,848
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

176
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,185
What about the minions I've sent back?

177
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:36,439
-That alone should guarantee my entry.
-How many times have I told you?

178
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,275
That's not the way this works.

179
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,528
Why, haven't I served him enough?

180
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:46,074
-What does he want from me?
-Only the usual.

181
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,327
Self-sacrifice, belief.

182
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,705
-Oh, I believe, for Christ's sake.
-No, no, you know.

183
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,333
And there's a difference. You've seen.

184
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,627
I never asked to see.

185
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,963
I was born with this curse.

186
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,631
A gift, John.

187
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,801
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

188
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,303
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

189
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,014
Who's that for?

190
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,310
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

191
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,730
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

192
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,608
Impossible rules, endless regulations,

193
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,653
who goes up, who goes down and why.

194
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,535
You don't even understand us.

195
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,164
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

196
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,345
Why me, Gabriel?

197
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,099
It's personal, isn't it?

198
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,813
I didn't go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough,

199
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,484
I was five bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

200
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,488
You are going to die young

201
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:12,076
because... you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

202
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,747
And you're going to go to hell...

203
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,750
because of the life you took.

204
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,757
You're fucked.

205
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,479
At least it's nice out.

206
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,526
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

207
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,619
And his punch lines are killers.

208
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,543
John!

209
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,129
Constantine, it's raining! John!

210
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,006
Hey!

211
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:23,648
Twenty-two women were found
buried in the assailant's back yard.

212
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:27,151
<i>So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match...</i>

213
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,779
Police report
she had been physically penetrated

214
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,989
over 100 times and buried alive.

215
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:36,577
...found locked in a freezer,
his head severed and his organs...

216
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,496
He stuffed Holly's body into...

217
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,834
- The bodies ravished...
- He used a small handsaw...

218
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:46,337
Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out.

219
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,922
Isabel.

220
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,990
I'm so sorry, lzzy.

221
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,617
Constantine.

222
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,028
Dodson.

223
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,322
Hello?

224
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,657
Hello.

225
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,208
Hello?

226
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,438
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

227
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:43,973
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

228
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,956
I know where you're going, John.

229
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,791
I know where you're going.
You're going to Midnite's.

230
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:13,169
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

231
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,338
It's a haven
for those who rise and fall.

232
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,173
I remember reading about this, John.

233
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,176
-You read too much, kid. It's a bar.
-It's a bar?

234
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,762
It's a bar.
Papa Midnite is a crusader for good.

235
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,555
He swore the oath of neutrality.

236
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,266
-John, the man's a legend.
-Yeah.

237
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,936
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

238
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,771
I'm begging you, John, please?

239
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,149
-Sure, you can get in.
-I can get in?

240
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,734
If you can get in.

241
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,196
If I can get--
It's a bear, though, right?

242
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,989
Or two ducks in a cloud?

243
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,703
Two frogs on a bench.

244
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,250
Two frogs on a bench.

245
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,253
No, no, I'm with the guy you just--

246
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,713
John! John!

247
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,590
I'm with him, though.

248
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,635
Rat in a dress.

249
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,555
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

250
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,141
I'm just testing. I'm just testing.

251
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,520
Dead as dead can be

252
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:15,272
My doctor tells me

253
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:21,612
Ever the optimistic one

254
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:28,577
I'm sure of your ability to become

255
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,747
My perfect enemy

256
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:37,712
Wake up
And face me

257
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:40,506
Don't play dead

258
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,633
"Cause maybe

259
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:49,223
Someday I will walk away and say

260
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:52,309
You disappoint me

261
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,438
Maybe you're better off this way

262
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,280
Don't get up.

263
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,284
You've been absent some time.

264
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,412
Have you come here with relics to sell?

265
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,832
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

266
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,795
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

267
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,881
Midnite, Jesus.

268
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,759
I thought the thing was authentic.

269
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,513
I see now.

270
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,726
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

271
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,561
A few months, maybe a year.

272
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,688
I thought I heard thunder last night.

273
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,108
Must have been Satan's stomach growling.

274
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,988
You're the one soul
he'd come up here himself to collect.

275
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,823
So I've heard.

276
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:51,994
Well, I am most certain
you did not come here

277
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,330
for a sympathetic shoulder to cry on.

278
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:01,378
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

279
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:02,963
They don't like you, John.

280
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,966
How many have you deported back to hell?

281
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,885
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.

282
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,638
A full-fledged demon,
here, on our plane.

283
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,432
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

284
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:16,060
And yesterday, I saw a soldier demon

285
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,521
trying to chew
its way out through a little girl.

286
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:23,025
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven,

287
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,237
the great détente
of the original superpowers.

288
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,658
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

289
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,576
Now...

290
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,705
I need to use the chair.

291
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:44,505
John, forgetting the fact that
it would almost certainly kill you,

292
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,382
you know I am neutral.

293
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:50,052
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

294
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,764
Before you were a bartender,

295
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:59,103
you were one witch doctor against,
what, 30 Ashgar?

296
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:03,065
-And I--
-You were Constantine.

297
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,860
The John Constantine.

298
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,696
Once.

299
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,075
This isn't the usual game,
I can feel it.

300
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,494
Something's coming.

301
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,372
Ooh, spooky.

302
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:20,666
Balthazar.

303
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:25,462
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

304
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,590
I'll make your night.

305
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:31,260
I'll deport your sorry ass right
where you stand, you half-breed shit!

306
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,598
You know the rules of my house.

307
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,975
While here, you will abide by them.

308
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,643
Johnny boy.

309
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,941
Word is you're on your way down.

310
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,360
Fresh meat.

311
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,116
Finger-licking good.

312
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,869
We have a meeting now, John.

313
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:07,254
What? I didn't catch that.

314
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,007
Welcome to my life.

315
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:03,852
Mr. Constantine.

316
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,648
-I saw you--
-I remember.

317
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,068
-And then I saw you at the--
-Regular kismet.

318
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,824
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

319
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,201
I'm not really
in the talking mood right now.

320
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,871
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

321
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,581
Please?

322
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,963
Always a catch.

323
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,855
My sister was murdered yesterday.

324
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:50,816
-Sorry to hear.
-Thanks.

325
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:56,947
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She... jumped off the roof.

326
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,408
Thought you said
she was murdered.

327
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,745
Yeah, well,
Isabel wouldn't have taken her own life.

328
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,789
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

329
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,792
That's just crazy.

330
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,717
Look, I've heard your name
around the precinct.

331
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,553
I know the circles you travel in.

332
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,389
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

333
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,727
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

334
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,648
She started talking about
demons, angels.

335
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,526
Now, I think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

336
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,489
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

337
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,909
Some kind of legion or cult.

338
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,412
Sounds like a theory, detective.

339
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,831
Good luck.

340
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,836
I thought with your background,
you could at least

341
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,505
point me in the right direction.

342
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,298
Yeah, okay, sure.

343
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,804
It wasn't a suicide.

344
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:03,972
My sister was a devout Catholic.

345
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,142
Do you understand that?
If she took her own life--

346
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,853
Her soul would go straight to hell...

347
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:15,651
where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony

348
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,529
for all eternity. That it?

349
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,489
That about right?

350
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,665
Goddamn you.

351
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:01,864
Detective.

352
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,200
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager,

353
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:08,871
a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

354
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,581
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

355
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,961
Humor me. No direct contact with humans.
That would be the rule.

356
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:20,507
-Just influence. See who would win.
-Okay, I'm humoring you.

357
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:22,801
- Why?
- Who knows.

358
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,553
Maybe just for the fun of it.
No telling.

359
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,221
Oh, so it's fun.

360
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,807
It's fun when a man
beats his wife to death,

361
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,226
it's fun when a mother drowns her baby.

362
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,438
And you think the devil is responsible?

363
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,150
People are evil, Mr. Constantine.
People.

364
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,778
You're right.
We're born capable of terrible things.

365
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,156
Then sometimes something else
comes along

366
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,616
and gives us just the right nudge.

367
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,493
Well, this has been real educational,

368
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:51,121
but... | don't believe in the devil.

369
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,874
You should. He believes in you.

370
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:15,854
It's a power outage.

371
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:17,981
Not likely.

372
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,530
- What?
- We should go. Now.

373
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,537
What is that?

374
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,498
Wings.

375
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,251
Maybe talons.

376
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,213
You're kidding. Of what?

377
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,966
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

378
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,556
That's really not going to help.

379
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,772
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

380
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:00,482
Suit yourself.

381
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,007
Demons stay in hell, huh?

382
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:28,844
Tell them that.

383
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,851
Don't worry.
Happens to everyone the first time.

384
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,061
It's the sulfur.

385
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,814
Sulfur.

386
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,235
What were those things?

387
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,697
Demons.

388
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:55,412
-Scavengers of the damned.
-No, no. It's impossible.

389
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:59,333
Yeah. And I don't think
they were after me.

390
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:04,546
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

391
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,048
Isabel?

392
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,967
Never in a million years.

393
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,594
Well, let's be sure.

394
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,305
Let's see if she's in hell.

395
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,791
Oh, was it
supposed to be hot or cold?

396
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,334
In front of the chair.

397
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,131
I can't believe I'm doing this.

398
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,425
-These are all Isabel's things?
-Yeah.

399
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,929
-How about the cat?
-Duck?

400
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,931
Yeah, why?

401
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:58,642
Duck.

402
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,061
Oh, you think that's strange.

403
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,313
Cats are good.

404
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:05,065
Half in, half out anyway.

405
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,586
If this is some kind of spell
or something,

406
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,923
don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

407
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,383
Why, do you have any?

408
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,886
-This is crazy.
-Yes.

409
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,684
I need you to leave.

410
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,604
-I'm sorry?
-Angela, please.

411
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:50,736
The apartment.

412
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,823
Okay.

413
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,498
Be careful with that cat.

414
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,671
God, I hate this part.

415
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:16,715
-Isabel.
-Constantine.

416
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,219
Angela.

417
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:08,642
Jesus.

418
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,648
-Constantine, what--
-Twins.

419
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,733
Jesus. What?

420
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:19,110
-You were twins.
-What did you say?

421
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,113
-She killed herself.
-What?

422
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,700
And she's damned for it.

423
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:41,383
How is this possible?

424
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,387
I need to eat.

425
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,081
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing in here?

426
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:40,293
Relax, man.

427
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:42,837
Slow down!

428
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,738
What the hell kind of place is this?

429
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:01,416
John.

430
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,325
When I was a kid, I could see things.

431
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,828
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

432
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:41,706
Things you shouldn't have to see.

433
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:04,437
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

434
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,065
They made it worse.

435
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:12,612
You think you're crazy long enough,

436
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,906
you find a way out.

437
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:18,868
- You tried to kill yourself.
- I didn't try anything.

438
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:25,291
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

439
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,878
But when you cross over,

440
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:31,881
time stops.

441
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,136
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

442
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:40,848
When I came back,

443
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:44,602
I knew...

444
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,147
all the things I could see were real.

445
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:51,609
Heaven and hell are right here.

446
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:54,529
Behind every wall, every window.

447
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,948
The world behind the world,

448
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,866
and we're smack in the middle.

449
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:03,496
Angels and demons
can't cross over onto our plane.

450
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,582
So, instead,
we get what I call half-breeds.

451
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,919
The influence peddlers.

452
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:15,800
They can only whisper in our ears,
but a single word can give you courage

453
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:19,554
or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.

454
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,724
Those with the demon's touch...

455
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:28,229
like those part angel,
living alongside us.

456
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:29,981
They call it the balance.

457
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,568
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

458
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,573
So when a half-breed breaks the rules,

459
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:42,118
I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

460
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,538
I don't get them all,

461
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,084
but I've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my...

462
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,756
-retirement.
-I don't understand.

463
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,801
I'm a suicide, Angela.

464
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:02,638
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

465
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,849
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

466
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,602
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison

467
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,063
where half the inmates
were put there by you?

468
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:14,984
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

469
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:17,653
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

470
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,239
He's not planning anything.

471
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,492
When we were little,

472
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:26,120
Isabel saw things, too.

473
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,127
Dodson.

474
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,841
Guard spotted him groping
the body, then he ran across the street.

475
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,929
Came in here,
and he had a go at the entire stock.

476
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:45,640
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

477
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,268
Could've been a member of my fraternity.

478
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:53,940
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

479
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,733
He's okay.

480
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:08,079
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

481
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:44,657
Yes?

482
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:47,493
What do you mean?

483
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,413
What?

484
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:51,706
How?

485
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:01,632
Mm-hmm.

486
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:06,137
Got it. Bye.

487
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:15,313
I need to see where Isabel died.

488
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:19,609
Seances, Ouija boards, channeling.

489
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:23,154
Our father thought
she was just trying to get attention.

490
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,823
She certainly did that.

491
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,785
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

492
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,331
She'd scare my mother half to death.

493
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,628
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

494
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,047
So you had her committed.

495
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,507
Yeah.

496
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,799
How long?

497
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:45,635
Two weeks.

498
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,095
This time.

499
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,057
She'd get better,
and then she'd get worse.

500
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,683
Recently, a lot worse.

501
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:59,065
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand,

502
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:01,526
does it have something to do with this?

503
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,986
I'm a cop, John, remember?

504
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,864
You don't walk off
the roof of a building

505
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:09,450
without leaving something behind.

506
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:14,497
And I showed you everything she left
behind in that box, but feel free.

507
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,207
Maybe she left something else.

508
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,043
Not something a cop would find.

509
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,130
Something just for you.

510
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,884
You were her twin, Angela.

511
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:28,844
Twins tend to think alike.

512
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:32,348
-I'm not like my sister.
-But you were once.

513
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,392
When you were Kids.

514
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,812
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

515
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,981
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.

516
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,816
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

517
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,359
That was a long time ago.

518
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,528
That kind of bond
doesn't just disappear.

519
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:46,904
There is nothing here.

520
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:51,492
-Hey. Come on.
-She planned her death in this room.

521
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:55,079
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

522
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:58,541
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw,

523
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:01,877
feel what she felt, know what she knew.

524
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:04,839
-What did she do, Angela?
-How should I know?

525
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,300
-What did she do, Angela?
-I don't know.

526
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:12,179
-What would you do?
-I don't know.

527
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:14,890
What did she do, Angela?
You know what she did.

528
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:16,684
What did she do, Angela?

529
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,228
You know what she did.
What are you afraid of?

530
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:20,438
What did she do, Angela?

531
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,690
-What did she do?
-I don't know!

532
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,376
When we were girls...

533
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,548
we would leave each other messages.

534
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,386
In light.

535
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:56,766
In breath.

536
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:03,272
On the windows.

537
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:10,488
John, there is no
17th act in Corinthians.

538
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:16,410
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

539
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,081
They have Bibles in hell.

540
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:23,167
Paints a different view
of Revelations.

541
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,503
Says the world will not end
by God's hand,

542
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,547
but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.

543
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,216
Though if you ask me,

544
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,760
fire's fire.

545
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:37,223
76:29, 76 30.

546
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,643
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

547
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,523
"The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son."

548
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:49,610
-Whose son?
-But he can't cross over, B.

549
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:52,446
-Impossible to cross over.
-Whose son? God's son?

550
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:56,075
No, the other one. Devil had a son, too.

551
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,035
Here it is.

552
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,162
This is the sign of Mammon,

553
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:03,290
the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here--

554
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,503
- Beeman?
- Yeah.

555
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:10,589
Sorry, I'm-I'm sorry, no,
I'm right here.

556
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:17,388
It says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule

557
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:22,393
and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

558
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:31,318
Yeah. Mammon would be the last demon

559
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,863
we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

560
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:37,658
No, wait, wait, wait. I'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

561
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:39,368
Always a catch.

562
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:46,876
It says first Mammon would have to
possess a very, very powerful psychic.

563
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:49,670
-Isabel.
-But that wouldn't be enough.

564
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:54,884
To cross over,
Mammon would need divine assistance.

565
00:59:56,385 --> 01:00:00,473
To cross over,
Mammon would need the help of God.

566
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:04,435
-The help of God?
-It says--

567
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:14,612
- Beeman?
- John, look,

568
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:19,366
I know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to,

569
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:23,370
but that doesn't mean
that we don't have faith...

570
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:25,331
in you.

571
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:31,712
Beeman? Beeman?

572
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,423
Drive. Fast.

573
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,274
Beeman!

574
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:54,610
Sulfur.

575
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,571
Beeman!

576
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:03,994
Beeman!

577
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,399
Wasn't just Isabel.

578
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:19,028
I used to see things, too.

579
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:21,864
But...

580
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:26,785
-you already knew that, didn't you?
-Go home, Angela.

581
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,537
I need to understand.

582
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:31,123
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

583
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,459
I'm stronger than Isabel.

584
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:35,920
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours.

585
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:37,546
Denial is a better idea.

586
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:42,426
It's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

587
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,470
I don't need another ghost following me.

588
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:46,180
John, they killed my sister.

589
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,021
I'd trade places with her if I could.

590
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:59,860
I used to pretend that I didn't.

591
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,154
That I didn't see things.

592
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:04,657
And...

593
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:09,453
by the time we were ten,
they started forcing her to take...

594
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,498
antipsychotics...

595
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:16,627
and have treatments.
They would come for her

596
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,506
and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, "Tell them."

597
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:24,510
"Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them, too?"

598
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,012
But I lied.

599
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:29,348
I said,

600
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,935
"I don't see anything."

601
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,230
Until one day...

602
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,608
I finally stopped seeing.

603
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,737
I abandoned her, John.

604
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:47,032
I left her all alone.

605
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,417
I need to see what she saw.

606
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:00,254
Please.

607
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:08,012
You do this, there's no turning back.

608
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,016
You see them,

609
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:15,352
they see you.

610
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:17,855
Understand?

611
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,524
Yeah.

612
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:28,323
Sure.

613
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:11,575
So do I have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can I leave them on?

614
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,541
John?

615
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,877
I'm thinking.

616
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:27,591
John?

617
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,927
On is fine.

618
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:46,819
-So why water?
-It's a universal conduit.

619
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:51,031
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

620
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:54,660
-Now ask me if there's water in hell.
-Is there water in hell?

621
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,497
Sit.

622
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:03,502
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended,

623
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,924
but you wanted the crash course.

624
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:11,218
Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

625
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,595
So, um...

626
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,598
So, what's gonna happen?

627
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:17,933
Lie down.

628
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:22,563
-What do you mean lie down?
-You have to be fully submerged.

629
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,983
For how long?

630
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:28,527
As long as it takes.

631
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:40,038
Take a deep one.

632
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:24,434
Oh, God.

633
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:28,021
Oh, God, all those people.

634
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:31,316
Oh, Isabel.

635
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:33,944
I've always known.

636
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:38,615
I've always known where they are.
I've always known where to find them,

637
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:41,994
where to aim and where to duck,

638
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:43,829
and I've always known where they were.

639
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:45,539
I've always known that it wasn't luck.

640
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:48,959
Always known that it wasn't luck.
I've always known...

641
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:52,504
I've always known that I could see.

642
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:57,092
I've always known that I could see.

643
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:03,890
Angela.

644
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,063
Someone was here.

645
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:38,633
It was his.

646
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,261
Rolling.

647
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:45,223
Not a ball.

648
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:49,436
Something smaller.

649
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:53,857
Shiny.

650
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,225
Balthazar.

651
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,384
Sorry.

652
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,309
Can you just kill him?

653
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,479
What about the balance?

654
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:18,316
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

655
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,277
I'm just adding some counterweight.

656
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:56,188
John, I really want--

657
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,322
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

658
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:14,956
Uh-uh. I'm coming with you.

659
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,627
You're staying in the car.

660
01:12:43,902 --> 01:12:46,863
Fire? I was born of this.

661
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:51,576
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

662
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:58,708
That's better. Au naturel.

663
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:07,926
"Stay in the car."

664
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:09,928
"Wait here."

665
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:12,889
Men.

666
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:28,113
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

667
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:30,740
Enjoy it.

668
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:07,652
We'll see you very soon.

669
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:10,780
Not really, no.

670
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:16,536
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

671
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:17,746
True.

672
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:19,873
But you're not.

673
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:24,169
-What are you doing?
-I'm reading you your last rites.

674
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:28,006
Spare me your remedial incantations.

675
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,508
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

676
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:33,219
To be welcomed into the Kingdom of God.

677
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:35,805
Demon in heaven.

678
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:39,559
I'd love to be a fly on that wall.

679
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:41,061
You're not a priest.

680
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:43,855
You have no power.

681
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,359
Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over

682
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:49,903
and you can go back to your shithole.

683
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:56,701
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

684
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,506
"May God have mercy on you

685
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:11,800
and grant you the pardon
of all your sins."

686
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:16,763
"Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in heaven."

687
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:21,726
-How? How's he doing it?
-No.

688
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:23,061
No, I can't.

689
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:28,274
Grant your child entry
into thy kingdom...

690
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:33,905
in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

691
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:37,158
Amen!

692
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:41,329
The blood of God.

693
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:43,748
He found it.

694
01:15:43,832 --> 01:15:48,128
Whatever killed the son of God

695
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:52,841
will give birth to the son of the devil.

696
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:56,761
By the way...

697
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:02,976
you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven...

698
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:05,979
asshole.

699
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:12,610
My work here is done.

700
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:16,030
What are you laughing at?

701
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:19,659
She was my only mission

702
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:23,371
and you brought her right to us.

703
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,502
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

704
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:32,714
Jesus didn't die
from being nailed to a cross.

705
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,674
He was killed by a soldier's spear.

706
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:36,217
The Spear of Destiny.

707
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:40,054
I'm a Catholic, John.
I know the Crucifixion story.

708
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:53,151
I drew out the sister as you asked.

709
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:58,865
She's been made flush and ready.

710
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:02,827
So much power.

711
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:09,167
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
I shall serve.

712
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:14,380
Wait. But I did as we agreed.

713
01:17:15,173 --> 01:17:18,676
No. Please. No!

714
01:17:21,805 --> 01:17:25,934
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

715
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:30,563
How's the blood of God's only son?

716
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:33,441
The stains on the spear.

717
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,279
-Yeah.
-So he gets the spear.

718
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:40,532
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

719
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,243
Not really.

720
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:47,664
Twins.

721
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:50,625
Where's the amulet?

722
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:54,587
I don't know,
I must have left it in the--

723
01:17:57,382 --> 01:17:58,508
What's wrong?

724
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,760
I don't know, I just feel--

725
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:34,419
- Bird on a ladder.
- Sorry.

726
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:41,885
-Wait here.
-Yeah.

727
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,515
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

728
01:19:02,113 --> 01:19:04,824
Have you lost what little mind you have?

729
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:05,783
Don't.

730
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,412
I need to use the chair.

731
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:14,459
I offer no aid to one side or the other.

732
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:18,212
-The balance.
-Screw the balance.

733
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:26,763
You dare? In my house?

734
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:32,977
Is this neutral? Bullshit.

735
01:19:33,061 --> 01:19:36,064
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

736
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:39,233
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

737
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:44,614
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once, too, remember?

738
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:47,784
I need your help!

739
01:19:50,495 --> 01:19:53,081
Consider it a last request.

740
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:58,836
You play a dangerous game.

741
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:08,846
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

742
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,725
That little shit has been trying

743
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:15,103
to climb out of
his father's shadow for eons.

744
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:19,983
I'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

745
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:25,780
Forgot how big it was.

746
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:27,782
Two hundred souls

747
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,994
passed through this wood and steel
at Sing Sing.

748
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,328
Yeah.

749
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,500
Which way's east?

750
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:57,812
How many years since you've surfed?

751
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:01,899
Like riding a bike.

752
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:03,234
No, not really.

753
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:09,490
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

754
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:14,579
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

755
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:22,837
Cold.

756
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,380
Little flavor?

757
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,573
-Sure about this?
-No.

758
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:41,791
Midnite!

759
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:51,217
-Any luck?
-That's a word for it.

760
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,971
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

761
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:06,149
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

762
01:23:09,152 --> 01:23:12,363
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

763
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:13,781
Half-breeds are most vulnerable

764
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:17,368
when their outer skin
is breached by holy water.

765
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:22,456
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of Isteria

766
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,001
have been used by even
the unordained to bless and sanctify

767
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:27,503
commonly occurring waters, even rain.

768
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:30,631
Maybe if...

769
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,347
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

770
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:42,977
So you wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet

771
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,896
maybe we could take with us?

772
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:46,147
Look, John, no offense,

773
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:49,901
I just don't think that
it's a great idea, you know,

774
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:53,321
you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

775
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:55,740
I don't know what pops thinks,
but that's...

776
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:00,494
Take him, John. Kill him after.

777
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:09,921
If you get back,
see me about membership. Maybe.

778
01:24:10,004 --> 01:24:12,006
Okay. I will.

779
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:20,097
-What are you doing?
-Praying.

780
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:22,308
Praying. Okay.

781
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:25,186
Come on.

782
01:25:22,827 --> 01:25:24,245
Half-breeds, right?

783
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:27,915
A birth like this,

784
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:31,085
they're definitely gonna be
guarding her, right? Definitely.

785
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,045
Yeah.

786
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:41,137
We can get through them. I mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

787
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,471
Right?

788
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,308
It's not always like it is in the books.

789
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:36,150
What is that?

790
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:38,486
Hellspeak.

791
01:26:41,781 --> 01:26:43,157
You know what to do.

792
01:26:47,078 --> 01:26:48,162
I'm okay.

793
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:51,665
Sure.

794
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:06,055
One last show.

795
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:41,674
Hi.

796
01:27:43,134 --> 01:27:44,427
My name's John.

797
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:49,265
You are in violation of the balance.

798
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:52,601
Leave immediately...

799
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:55,020
or I will deport you.

800
01:27:58,232 --> 01:27:59,483
All of you.

801
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,826
Go to hell.

802
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,542
Holy water?

803
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:35,788
Angela.

804
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:09,613
Uh, John?

805
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:13,742
John.

806
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:20,624
Shit.

807
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:47,610
Pull!

808
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:30,319
Angela.

809
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:55,052
Angela, what is it?

810
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:03,644
Get it out.

811
01:32:18,492 --> 01:32:19,576
Get it out.

812
01:32:20,077 --> 01:32:21,286
Get it--

813
01:33:06,665 --> 01:33:07,833
Oh, my God.

814
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,759
Not bad, kid.

815
01:33:19,762 --> 01:33:21,138
"Not bad." You hear that?

816
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:24,933
You know why that is?
It's because this is Kramer.

817
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:26,351
Chas Kramer, ass--

818
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,277
Chas.

819
01:33:44,328 --> 01:33:46,163
You're right, John.

820
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:49,708
It's not like the books.

821
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,085
No...

822
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:54,713
It isn't.

823
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:18,195
Into the light, I command thee.

824
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:22,699
Into the light, I command thee.

825
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:28,121
Into the light, I command thee.

826
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:36,922
Into the light, I command thee.

827
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:42,261
Your ego is astounding.

828
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,388
<i>Gabriel.</i>

829
01:34:45,389 --> 01:34:46,515
Figures.

830
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:51,144
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

831
01:34:51,228 --> 01:34:52,479
You judging me now, John?

832
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:58,986
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

833
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:03,115
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

834
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:06,368
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

835
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:09,246
Help me here.

836
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:17,588
You're handed this precious gift, right?

837
01:35:18,714 --> 01:35:22,634
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

838
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:26,513
Murderers, rapists and molesters,

839
01:35:26,597 --> 01:35:28,891
all of you, you just have to repent

840
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:31,018
and God takes you into his bosom.

841
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:36,565
In all the worlds in all the universe,

842
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:39,568
no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

843
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,363
It's not fair.

844
01:35:47,576 --> 01:35:50,412
If sweet, sweet God loves you so,

845
01:35:51,705 --> 01:35:54,666
then I'll make you worthy of his love.

846
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,587
I've been watching you for a long time.

847
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:04,343
It's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

848
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:07,429
And you can be so noble.

849
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:12,142
So...

850
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:14,811
I'll bring you pain.

851
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:18,065
I'll bring you horror.

852
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,778
So that you may rise above it.

853
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:30,786
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth

854
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:33,205
will be worthy of God's love.

855
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:35,332
Gabriel...

856
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:38,627
you're insane.

857
01:36:40,504 --> 01:36:43,298
The road to salvation begins tonight.

858
01:36:44,508 --> 01:36:45,717
Right now.

859
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,970
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

860
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:34,391
I'm not even welcome in your house.

861
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,895
But I could use a little attention.

862
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:44,151
Please.

863
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:32,449
Come forth.

864
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:54,221
Hurry.

865
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:13,448
] Mammon...

866
01:39:14,241 --> 01:39:16,118
son of Satan...

867
01:39:16,827 --> 01:39:21,123
I unleash you unto this world.

868
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:16,511
Hello.

869
01:40:16,595 --> 01:40:18,346
What took you so long?

870
01:40:18,889 --> 01:40:20,390
Hello, John.

871
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:24,519
John, hello.

872
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:32,485
You're the one soul...

873
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:37,741
I would come up here
to collect myself. Mm-hm.

874
01:40:40,452 --> 01:40:41,995
So I've heard.

875
01:40:43,622 --> 01:40:44,873
You mind?

876
01:40:45,874 --> 01:40:48,293
Oh, go-- Go right ahead. I've got stock.

877
01:40:49,211 --> 01:40:50,670
Coffin nail.

878
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:52,589
Very fitting, John.

879
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,471
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons...

880
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:02,557
finger movement goes out the window.

881
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:04,017
Let me help you.

882
01:41:16,196 --> 01:41:17,280
See?

883
01:41:19,616 --> 01:41:20,992
Sonny,

884
01:41:21,076 --> 01:41:26,248
I've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

885
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:28,541
Well, aren't you a peach.

886
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:33,463
I didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

887
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,470
And you didn't...

888
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:42,597
did you?

889
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:45,392
So how's the family?

890
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:47,477
Family's doing just fine.

891
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,939
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

892
01:41:51,898 --> 01:41:55,443
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

893
01:41:55,527 --> 01:41:58,738
Well, one does what one can.

894
01:41:58,822 --> 01:42:00,407
He's in the other room.

895
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,534
Boys will be boys.

896
01:42:04,411 --> 01:42:05,870
With Gabriel.

897
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:11,501
No accounting for taste, really.

898
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:14,296
They have the Spear of Destiny.

899
01:42:17,132 --> 01:42:19,968
"They have the Spear of Destiny."

900
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,604
Or is it another one of your cons?

901
01:42:34,274 --> 01:42:35,900
Go look for yourself.

902
01:42:39,529 --> 01:42:42,699
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu,

903
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:45,744
what's another 20 seconds?

904
01:43:51,393 --> 01:43:56,064
-Lucifer.
-This world is mine. In time.

905
01:43:56,773 --> 01:43:59,442
You, best of all of us, Gabriel,

906
01:43:59,526 --> 01:44:04,823
should understand ambition.

907
01:44:04,906 --> 01:44:06,741
Son of perdition.

908
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:09,702
Little horn.

909
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:14,082
Most unclean.

910
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,584
I do miss the old names.

911
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:19,921
Time to go home, son.

912
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:21,631
I will smite thee...

913
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:25,218
in his honor.

914
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:35,437
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

915
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:54,873
Father?

916
01:45:18,605 --> 01:45:19,856
So...

917
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:28,698
So...

918
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:32,827
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

919
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:38,958
The sister...

920
01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:41,836
Isabel.

921
01:45:43,755 --> 01:45:45,673
What about her?

922
01:45:47,509 --> 01:45:49,260
Let her go home.

923
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:56,809
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

924
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:09,405
Fine. It's done.

925
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:16,329
Time to go, John.

926
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:17,622
Yeah.

927
01:47:15,972 --> 01:47:18,141
The sacrifice.

928
01:47:29,736 --> 01:47:34,824
No. This one belongs to me.

929
01:47:45,627 --> 01:47:51,549
No. You will live, John Constantine.

930
01:47:54,302 --> 01:47:56,054
You will live.

931
01:47:58,264 --> 01:48:00,391
So you will have...

932
01:48:02,727 --> 01:48:05,438
...the chance to prove...

933
01:48:08,024 --> 01:48:12,987
that your soul truly belongs in hell.

934
01:48:16,074 --> 01:48:18,910
Oh, you will live.

935
01:48:23,748 --> 01:48:26,876
You will live.

936
01:49:41,409 --> 01:49:42,827
Thank you.

937
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:47,165
No problem.

938
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:05,183
Human.

939
01:50:07,435 --> 01:50:10,229
You don't deserve to be human.

940
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:15,610
Do you want revenge?
Is that what you're thinking right now?

941
01:50:18,905 --> 01:50:19,947
Do it.

942
01:50:21,741 --> 01:50:22,909
Do it.

943
01:50:24,869 --> 01:50:26,287
Seek revenge.

944
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:28,706
End my life.

945
01:50:29,916 --> 01:50:31,083
Go on.

946
01:50:33,795 --> 01:50:35,379
Be the hand of God.

947
01:50:35,463 --> 01:50:36,923
It's your choice.

948
01:50:38,007 --> 01:50:39,550
It's always been your choice.

949
01:50:45,765 --> 01:50:47,058
Yeah.

950
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:54,190
That's called pain.

951
01:50:55,233 --> 01:50:56,651
Get used to it.

952
01:51:03,032 --> 01:51:05,243
You could've shot me, John!

953
01:51:07,411 --> 01:51:09,497
You chose a higher path!

954
01:51:11,749 --> 01:51:13,668
Look how well you're doing!

955
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:41,362
Nice spot.

956
01:51:46,242 --> 01:51:47,785
I have something for you.

957
01:51:50,705 --> 01:51:53,583
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

958
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:58,629
Oh, how thoughtful.

959
01:52:04,093 --> 01:52:04,969
John...

960
01:52:07,722 --> 01:52:09,098
why are you giving me this?

961
01:52:10,141 --> 01:52:11,267
Rules.

962
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:12,935
Hide it.

963
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:16,272
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

964
01:52:17,773 --> 01:52:18,900
Not even me.

965
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:20,735
Ah.

966
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:24,864
Always a catch.

967
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:27,867
Yeah.

968
01:52:41,631 --> 01:52:42,840
So...

969
01:52:44,926 --> 01:52:47,303
I've got some cleaning up to do.

970
01:52:51,766 --> 01:52:53,059
III...

971
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,561
see you around.

972
01:52:58,689 --> 01:53:00,191
I'd like that.

973
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,057
I guess there's a plan for all of us.

974
01:53:33,808 --> 01:53:36,936
I had to die... twice...

975
01:53:37,019 --> 01:53:38,813
Just to figure that out.

976
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:43,818
Like the book says,
He works his work in mysterious ways.

977
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,862
Some people like it

978
01:53:46,946 --> 01:53:48,531
some people don't.

979
01:59:42,843 --> 01:59:44,511
You did good, kid.
