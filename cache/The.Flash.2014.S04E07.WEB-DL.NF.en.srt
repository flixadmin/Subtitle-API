<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

7
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,225
<i>It took everything in my

<i>to bring me back.</i>

9

by even a decimal...

- There is not a decimal,
a fraction,

22
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:48,465
an infinitesimal variable
beyond my thought.

23
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,843
- The name we're looking for
is Clifford DeVoe.

no other DeVoe comes close.

58
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,022
- Your plan will work.

59
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,108
We just need to refashion
the delivery system.

60
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,901
- It's not the
plan that's flawed,

61
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,903
it's my ability to execute it.

62

63
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,697
- I'm simply not smart enough.

64
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,075
- You are the most
brilliant mind I know.

65
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,661

68
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,340
- At this point,
it's just a concept.

69
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,383
I call this my thinking cap.

70
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,094
And just like their minds

71
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,138
have gotten too small to
handle their full capacity,

72

mine's too small to deliver it.

73
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,642

DeVoe's a common name.

92

in the Central City

- The name's been identified

96
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,212
for its connection to four
separate criminal cases.

97
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,714
- So you think my husband is a
witness to these crimes?

98
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,051
- No, we'd like to eliminate
him as a suspect.

99
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,635
- You can't be serious.

00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,847
- That's all right, Marlize.
Do go ahead.

101
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,975
- So, Professor, what brought
you to Central City?

102
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,604
- I grew up in South Africa.
After studying history

103
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,314
and econometrics at the
University of Johannesburg,

104
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,234
I took a teaching position
at Oxford.

105
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,318
That's where we met.
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,697
He swept me off my feet and we
have been together ever since.

107
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:44,952
- It did take a tenured offer
from Central City University

108
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,745
to lure me away from
the Oxford faculty.

109
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,747
That was four years ago.

110
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,834
- Question: Do you know
Ramsey Deacon?

111

- No, should I?

112
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,675
- What about Becky Sharpe?

113
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,552
- No, I'm afraid not.

Mina Chaytan?

116
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,059
- Mina Chaytan.
Now, that name's familiar.

117
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,894
- Isn't this the Native
American woman

118
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,229
that left abruptly?

119
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,022
You know, the anthropologist?
- Yes, I remember.

120
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,857
I was so sad to see her go.

121
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,776
- You were colleagues.

122
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,402
Did she mention her work?

123
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,824
- No, no, no. Mina was
an animated woman.

124
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,744
Then again, people like us

Uh, it's beautiful.

128
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,546
- The samurai. They were
formidable foes.

129
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,092
They'd often make unstoppable
enemies to their opponents.

130
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:45,637
You wouldn't want to cross one.

131
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,265
- So you spent time in Japan?

132
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,391
- The feudal history of
medieval Japan

It gives me the opportunity

But you can't just inspire

You somehow need to change

Self-reflection and a

806
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,765
- So you found what
you were looking for?

807
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:13,101
- I don't know, to be honest.

00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:16,688
- Well, we are
glad you're home.

guy behind the bus metas.

00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,399
- Yeah.

811
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,944
- So you want to suit up?
Take him down?

812
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,446
- No, now it's his move.

813
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:29,159
I think we take our time,
formulate a plan.

814
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:34,289
- What now, boss lady?

815
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,374
- We get married.

816
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,545
- He came to you, just
like you said he would.

817
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:45,675
- He's finally seized
control of his fear.

818
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,052
He drew his strength

819
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,471
from those he calls
friends.

820
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,224
- Sounds like you admire him.

821
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,059
- It is fascinating.

In the chain of 4,900 possible
events I predicted,

there was one which resulted in
them calling me "The Teacher."

I prefer "The Thinker."

826

They will be the first to
experience the Enlightenment.
