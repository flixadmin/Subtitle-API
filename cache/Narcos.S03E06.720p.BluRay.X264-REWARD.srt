1
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,399
'The Cali cartel is
an almost-perfect organism.

2
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:28,863
'Even though we had cut off its head,
the body kept right on going,

3
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,574
'making and selling cocaine.

4
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,576
'They stuck to the plan.

5
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,329
'And for a long time,
that plan had worked for them.'

6
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:41,125
The guy's innocent.
He didn't do any of it.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,629
Easy, honey, easy, okay?
Be careful.

8
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:49,842
- The glove.
- Screw the fucking glove, brother!

9
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,846
- That Fuhrman's a son of a bitch.
- He's an asshole.

10
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,432
- And he's been fucking the sister.
- Which one?

11
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:01,645
The sister! I don't even know her name.
Geraldo is fucking her, too.

12
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:04,065
'But no plan is perfect.

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,277
'Especially when you deal
with a substance as volatile as cocaine.

14
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,198
'At some point,
you're gonna make a mistake.

15
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:16,577
'And your enemies
are watching and waiting.

16
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,623
'They're gonna see your weakness
and make a move.

17
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,292
'See, that's the thing about plans.

18
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,295
'No matter how perfect
you think they are,

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,424
'however brilliant or audacious
they may be,

20
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,803
'well, they can still go to shit

21
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,196

there's no going back.

22
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,491
'It's all downhill from there.'

23
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,905
Oh, hey, hey.

24
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,409
Think that's him?

25
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,746
Has to be.

26
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,743
Let's go.

27
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,142
Close enough.
Lift up your shirt. Turn around.

28
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,779
- I'm unarmed.
- Approach slowly, hands out.

29
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,616
- You told nobody about this?
- Nobody.

30
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,786
- And you weren't followed?
- We're clean.

31
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,539
You headed north to Yumbo
instead of east from Cali.

32
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,208
And then straight on to Rozo.

33
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:40,215
I had to make sure you are
who you say you are. That you're alone.

34
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,635
Get in the car.

35
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,347
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're in the front seat.

36
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,234
I'm Chris Feistl. This is Daniel...

37
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,281
- Daniel Van Ness. I know your names.
- What about yours?

38
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,325
I don't want to be sitting here
more than two minutes.

39
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,952
This is the only time we're gonna
speak to each other face-to-face.

40
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,205
So you said you work
for the Rodríguez brothers.

41
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,791
I'm the chief of security
for the Cali cartel.

42
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,336
- You're the head of security?
- Yes.

43
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,171
I have valuable information for you.

44
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,967
In exchange, I want safe passage
for my family and myself to the States.

45
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,096
Once there, with full immunity,
I'll help you in any way I can.

46
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,307
Listen, here's the thing, man.
You're head of security for the cartel.

47
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,393
You have a lot more to offer us
than just testimony.

48
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,019
Like Miguel Rodríguez.

49
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,524
Is that gonna be a problem?

50
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,776
Besides the fact that
we're all gonna end up dead?

51
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,611
There's a security system
that I designed.

52
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,197
Safe houses, lookouts on every corner,

53
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,074
a radio communication system.

54
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,867
- We can work around all that.
- Maybe.

55
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,662
Then there's David, Miguel's son.

56
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,790
He personally controls
his father's security now.

57
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,709
- I don't even know where he is.
- But you can find out.

58
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,422
And if I do?
The police? The military?

59
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,257
You can't trust them. I pay them.

60
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,427
We can get guys we trust, all right?
Don't worry about it.

61
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:12,182
Don't worry about it?
No. I'll testify. That's it.

62
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,104
Let me ask you something.
Why are you doing this? Talking to us?

63
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,733
I'm not a murderer. I'm not like them.
I want to get my family out.

64
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,194
Well, we'd love to help you
with that, but...

65
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,239
...we can't do that
unless you give us Miguel.

66
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,658
And honestly,
we don't need your testimony.

67
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,870
Bottom line, you have a better option,
you're free to take it.

68
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,044
I need to think about this.

69
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,799
Still didn't catch your name.

70
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,014
Jorge. Salcedo.

71
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,784
I think we found a gold mine.

72
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,663
Guy says he's head of security
for the cartel and he wants to roll?

73
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,833
They don't call it the Cali KGB
for nothing, Chris.

74
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,087
Let's get the fuck out of here.

75
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,719
Franklin Jurado...

76
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,931
One testimony from him and he can
take down the entire Cali cartel.

77
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,807
He travels on multiple passports.

78
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,769
So, he gets on a flight, we lose him
who-the-fuck-knows-where.

79
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,688
I need him on a plane today
so that he's testifying in Miami tomorrow.

80
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,732
Okay, guys, listen up.

81
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,944
We will provide Agent Peña
and his men with any support they require.

82
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,195
Understood?

83
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,156
Okay, typically,
he goes to a cooperative credit bank

84
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,574
and then has breakfast.

85
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,661
- We sit on it and get him there.
- Hey, hey...

86
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,958
- You plan to take him at the bank?
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,460
You cannot do that, Agent Peña.

88
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,004
'So here's what you need
to know about Curaçao.

89
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,881
'It's a smuggler's paradise.

90
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,884
'And for the Cali cartel,
you can't beat the location.

91
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,013
'Only 40 miles separates
South American coast from Curaçaon ports,

92
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,685
'prized for centuries by smugglers,
slave traders, and now cartels.

93
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,772
'Cruise ships filled with old people
next to speed boats filled with cash.

94
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,943
'And what doesn't get smuggled through,
it ends up in banks. Hundreds of them.

95
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,028
'Way back,
some enterprising Dutchmen

96

on money launderers parking their cash,

'that you can make an arrest,
just not at or near a bank.

99
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,711
'Of course, where do you think
Franklin spent most of his time?'

100
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,841
All right, we tail him. Then we catch him
somewhere that suits us both.

101
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,051
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay.

102
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,304
Okay, let's go.

103
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,567
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

104
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:13,488
As many of you know, since Córdova's
resignation, I am the head of security.

105
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:21,121
It's festival time.
That means the city will be crowded.

106
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:26,460
The festival is not an excuse
to party on the job.

107
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:32,090
One more thing. David and his team will
now be handling security for his father.

108
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:38,388
Let's make them feel welcome.
And help them any way you can.

109
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,436
That's all, boys. Get going!

110
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,819
Wow. Look at you. You're sliding
into your new job like a glove.

111
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,780
You're a natural.

112
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:01,161
Look, David, if we're going
to work together, we need to cooperate.

113
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:07,417
If you have questions or you want
to talk about your father's security,

114
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,252
I'm here.

115
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,922
Thank you.

116
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,466
I do have a question, Jorge.

117
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,053
How come none of your men
carry fucking guns? Huh?

118
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:22,933
Because we use our radios
if we have a problem.

119
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,604
For what? To say goodbye
when you're getting clipped?

120
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,898
Do me a favour, Jorge.

121
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,860
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
All right?

122
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,707
Boss, you didn't mention
the DEA agents that are in Cali.

123
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,251
That's something David
might be interested in.

124
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,880
Last thing we need right now is David
and his crew killing a federal agent.

125
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,717
Well, that's true.

126
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,137
For now,
we'll monitor the DEA ourselves.

127
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,932
Besides... I doubt they have much.

128
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,857
I don't want to leave New York, Chepe.

129
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,654
- Why, Chepe?
- My love...

130
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,242
I know you don't want
to leave New York. I know.

131
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,287
I don't either.

132
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,250
But if they connect this lab to us,

133
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,670
we're going to have
every cop in the city after us.

134
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,549
Hey, look. Here it comes.

135
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,428
'Spokesmen for the DEA say that
the cocaine lab that exploded in Queens

136
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,597

137
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,851
Exactly! Thank you, lady.
Fucking Dominicans!

138

of others in the area,

he knows who you are, Chepe.

Don't worry.
We're not going anywhere.

150

Is that so?

151
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,850
So do me a favour and fix this.

You hear me?

153
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,530
Motherfucker.

154
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,699
So a new surrender deal.

155
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,452
Three years in jail. All of you.

156
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,206
Turn in the illicit businesses,
and we can keep all of the legal assets,

157
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,875
as in the old plan.
It's a good deal.

158
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,669
He would've told you himself,

159
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,213
but he thought it was best for me
to explain in person.

160
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,507
Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.

161
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,510
I understand.
Thank you for coming, Nicolás.

162
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,180
Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.

163
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,850
An update?

164
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:13,728
On our efforts to maximise business
before surrender.

165
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,526
- So I can inform my father.
- Tell him everything's still on track here.

166
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:24,072
Pacho's settled new terms with Amado
Carrillo Fuentes and is coming back soon.

167
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,534
And this accident in New York?

168
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,707
Chepe encountered an obstacle,
but you know Chepe.

169
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,667
I'm not worried.

170
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,628
Are we done?

171
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,798
One last thing.

172
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:46,636
Our friends in Bogotáare concerned
about their exposure.

173
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,930
Too many people know
about the deal.

174
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:54,769
They worry about Mr. Pallomari.
My father would like you to handle it.

175
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,233
"Handle it"? Do you know
what you're talking about?

176
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,403
Do you have any idea? Hmm?

177
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,870
Pallomari's our chief accountant in Cali
and is not easily replaced.

178
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,997
He's too valuable to just kill.

179
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,584
Tell your father I'll take care of it.
He doesn't have to worry about Pallomari.

180
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,379
Thank you, Uncle Miguel.

181
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,551
Take care.

182
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:40,440
So now the little prince
is giving you orders?

183
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,400
His father's orders.

184
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,614
Have Salcedo put Pallomari
in one of the safe houses.

185
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,075
Keep an eye on him.

186
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,455
You decided if you're coming tonight?

187
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,628
Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.
It's important.

188
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:06,132
You know how I feel about parties.
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.

189
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,511
Which is exactly why you should go.

190
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,765
Dad, you're the new boss here.

191
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,892
Please, show them.

192
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,857
Or at least have a good time
before we have to roll over and play dead.

193
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,276
'Now why would
a Cali godfather come out of hiding

194
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,404
'and risk getting captured?

195
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:31,324
'Because what good is being the king
if nobody knows it?

196
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,911
'The biggest thing to come out of Cali
wasn't cocaine.

197
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,955
'It was salsa.

198
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,291
'And every year, the two combined
at the annual <i>Feria de Cali,</i>

199
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,629
'a week-long extravaganza
of parties and salsa concerts.

200
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,383
'And the man who always presided
over the opening-night festivities?

201
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,010
'Gilberto Rodríguez.'

202
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,595
Cheers, gentlemen!

203
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,141
'But with him in jail,
it was time for a new king.'

204
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,269
How would you
like to be my date tonight?

205
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,689
Hmm...
Where would we go?

206
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,692
Come here.

207
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,908
Let's go dancing.
Do you like dancing?

208
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:19,622
As you discussed with Don Miguel,
he'd like you to keep working from here.

209
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,916
Yes, I know what needs to be done.

210
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,836
Come in.

211
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,640
Guillermo, what's this?
You've got to be kidding, right?

212
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,935
- You're playing me for a fool.
- What's this?

213
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,480
This is unacceptable.
I need to speak to Miguel.

214
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:47,567
Talk to whoever you want. This is
the biggest apartment we have right now.

215
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,028
- Three bedrooms. Two bathrooms.
- Uh-huh.

216
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,822
A/C. Kids seem to like it.

217
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,949
- Kids, do you like it?
- Yes!

218
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,911
Really, Patricia.
Are you going to smoke inside?

219
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,954
What's the problem? This is a dump.

220
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,833
- The boys are here.
- Now you're concerned about the boys?

221
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,378
Do not leave this apartment,
for your own safety.

222
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:20,475
Everything you've done for these people,
and this is how they repay you?

223
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,146
Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Stoddard.

224
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,233
All right, last hit
Duffy and López had on Salcedo,

225
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,276
he was deputy chief of security
for the cartel.

226
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,195
All right. So that much is true.

227
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,613
Had a degree in engineering.

228
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,117
Business license for a bio-diesel factory
that went belly up.

229
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,701
- Wonder why.
- Ex-military.

230
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,079
Served under a Carlo Córdova. Major.

231
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,706
Who became head of security
for the cartel.

232
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,250
Must've been how he got the job.

233
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,710
Wonder if he clipped his old buddy
to take his spot.

234
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,588
And he was connected to the purchase
of bombs in a plan to kill Pablo.

235
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,132
Oh, just that?

236
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,051
Does that sound like the everyman
who only signed on

237
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,178
- to protect Miguel's family to you?
- Okay.

238
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,682
So he's a scumbag. Last I checked,
he's our best bet to get Miguel.

239
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,394
Scumbags I can handle.
What I don't like are liars.

240
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,605
So when he calls back
with Miguel's location...

241
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,025
- how you want to play it?
- If he calls at all,

242
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,570
we ask the hard questions,
see how he holds up.

243
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,826
I'm telling you, they're done.

244
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,912
Gilberto's looking
for some new way to surrender.

245
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,457
And you heard about this thing
in New York with Chepe, right?

246
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,586
And Miguel's in charge
of everything here.

247
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,715
'Better said, the Cali cartel is dead.'

248
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,758
And you intend to...?

249
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:40,805
To do whatever I have to do
for the North Valley cartel.

250
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,100
Which is why I'm talking to you.

251
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,441
Funny how things change, isn't it?

252
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,486
So, Amado... what do you say?

253
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,994
I say you're no fucking fun,
that's what I say.

254
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,456
But we both see the future
the same way.

255
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,959
Look, starting next week...

256
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:15,840
...I'll only be shipping product
for my new North Valley friends. Good?

257
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,886
And what about the other thing
we discussed?

258
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,898
Look, I need you
to make room here.

259
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,902
And I want you to take care of the guests,
get them everything they need.

260
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,321
I also want a bottle
at each of these tables.

261
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,740
But I want the good stuff.
None of that shit you serve here.

262
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,283
Understood?

263
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,995
I was told you needed me.

264
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,040
I need to talk about something.

265
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,167
Leave your bitch down here.

266
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,127
Come on.

267
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,559
You don't tell anyone about this, okay?

268
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:15,191
I was thinking about what you said
if I ever need your advice...

269
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,111
...and I could use your help.

270
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:22,073
- With your father's security?
- He's coming to the party tonight.

271
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,492
He's coming here?

272
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,621
Unless there's another fucking party
I don't know about? Yeah, here.

273
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,418
What do you want me to tell you, David?

274
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,213
- Public places are always bad.
- I know.

275
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,048
Too many people.

276
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,971
- When does he plan on arriving?
- I was thinking around eleven.

277
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,891
Well, what fucking time is best, then?

278
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,103
Well, I think ten is better.

279
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,065
It's less crowded.
Maybe I can take him up to the balcony.

280
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,442
You'll take care of it?

281
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,905
I knew I could count on you.

282
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:09,454
I just need this night to be perfect.
Everything has to go well.

283
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,875
You can relax.
I think we can manage that.

284
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,054
Boss, did you tell him
it isn't a good idea?

285
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,891
- Of course. You think he listened?
- He's an imbecile.

286
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,895
Pull over here.

287
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,065
Pinchadito said there's
a bad phone tap or something.

288
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,446
Stay here. I'll be two minutes.

289
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,751
- Hello?
- 'It's Salcedo. I only have a minute.'

290
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,381
- You got us both.
- Miguel's going to a party tonight.

291
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,259
'Libre Club. Carrera Ocho. Ten o'clock.'

292
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,262
It's gonna be crowded, so you have
to wait to get him until he's outside.

293
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,056
Is there any way we can check this, Jorge?

294
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,976
No. You're gonna have to trust me.

295
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,187
'And this promotion to security chief?
How'd that come about?'

296
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,064
That's... really complicated.

297
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:05,445
We're trying to understand why
you'd call us a day after you get a raise.

298
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,447
'We don't have time for this right now.

299
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:11,075
'He's going to be in the club
at ten o'clock. Carrera Ocho.'

300
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,035
Take him outside.

301
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,462
- Hey. What's going on?
- Nothing, boss.

302
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,005
- Is he bothering you?
- No, sir.

303
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,507
- I'm just buying fritters for my brother.
- Great, let's go.

304
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,092
- You want some?
- Sure.

305
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,678
"Complicated."
Everything with this guy is complicated.

306
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,680
Still, there's something about him
I believe.

307
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,557
Enough to walk into a cartel party blind?

308
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,643
For a chance
to get Miguel Rodríguez, maybe.

309
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,938
He's just stringing us along, Chris.
Or worse.

310
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,373
Stop! Hey!

311
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,502
Hey! Come here!

312
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,332
Get the back. Get the back.

313
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,220
Fuck!

314
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,240
Don't run.

315
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,928
Franklin Jurado...

316
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,183
Javier Peña, DEA. You're being extradited
for money laundering and racketeering.

317
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,561
- My wife. You need to make sure...
- She's in Bogotá.

318
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,355
She'll meet us in Miami.

319
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,532
'Ambassador,
I've got Agent Peña, line one.'

320
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,951
- 'Peña?'
- We got him.

321
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:25,621
I'd like to get him into the United States
before the cartel knows he's in custody.

322
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,874
I spoke to the Prime Minister
this morning. Extradition papers are set.

323
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,043
As soon as he starts talking,
you let me know.

324
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,671
- 'I'll update Justice.'
- Yeah, will do, sir.

325
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,840
'Agent Peña. Good work.'

326
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,888
- Let's see here.
- Zuelma prays every morning.

327
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,473
Very good. And here?

328
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,977
- The worm...
- Gotero...

329
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,020
- Dad!
- Hi, kids!

330
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,861
- I need to speak to you.
- Okay. Girls...

331
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,448
Please, go to your room
and finish your homework.

332
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,081
Something came up.

333
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,627
- What is it?
- I know how hard this has been for you.

334
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,548
I just want you to know
that I've almost got it figured out.

335
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,886
- All right.
- I'll tell you more tonight.

336
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:25,848
But for now, I want you to get
everything ready to leave.

337
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,769
- Where are we going? How...
- Do you trust me?

338
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:36,150
My love...
Paola... do you trust me?

339
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:38,736
Yes?

340
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,200
Everything will be all right.
I promise.

341
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,876
Done. I'm finished.

342
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,588
I love that length on you.

343
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,673
Thank you. I like it, too.

344
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,386
And a little extra for you.

345
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,933
And I have a little extra for you, too.

346
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,523
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

347
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,719
You were the one
who approached my wife?

348
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,223
You enjoy it?

349
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,935
Using her to get to me?

350
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,771
You know what I'd be
thinking about if I were you, Franklin?

351
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:59,483
That if your wife wants to see you...

352
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,445
...she's gonna see you in jail.

353
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,365
Drive hours every week.

354
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,535
Get felt up by some sweaty guard
whose only highlight at work

355
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,996
is getting his hands
under your wife's dress.

356
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,790
You can say whatever you want.

357
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,919
- You can't scare me.
- No...

358
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,423
I can just ruin your life.

359
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:27,094
You know the brothers.
Pretty well.

360
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:31,432
What do you think will happen to them
without Gilberto running things?

361
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:36,228
You're young, Franklin.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

362
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,647
You really want to spend it in a cell?

363
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:44,111
Talk to me. I'll get you a deal.

364
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:48,574
You and Christina... can start over.

365
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,038
Have a new life.
In the United States.

366
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,377
I'm not going to say a single word...

367
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,632
...until I see my wife.

368
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,511
Okay.

369
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,808
Then you'll have your witness.

370
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,989
Stop. Stop here.

371
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,207
Turn around.

372
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,592
Franklin.
His name is Franklin Jurado.

373
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,135
- Jurado or...
- 'Yes, ma'am.

374
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,263
'We've called his room several times.
We're unable to locate him.'

375
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:54,974
Okay, well, did he check out?

376
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:58,435
Have you seen him at all?
It sounds like you don't know anything.

377
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,562
'We haven't seen him
and he has not checked out.'

378
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,690
'I'm sorry, ma'am. I cannot help you.

379
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,359
'Thank you for calling
Baoase Luxury Resort.'

380
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,069
No, thank you.

381
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,196
Thank you for fucking nothing.

382
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,602
Manny.
Thanks for meeting.

383
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:46,650
Julia said you might have
something on Crespo?

384
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,493
Well, yes.

385
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,123
It's something I hope you like.

386
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,336
How can I help you, Mr. Crespo?

387
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,798
Or should I say, Mr. Santacruz?

388
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,009
Well...

389
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,138
I was hoping I could help you.

390
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,682
Where are you from?

391
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,395
- Cuba.
- Cuba! Gorgeous.

392
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,857
When you were young,

393
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:32,321
did you ever think you would come
to this country and do something special?

394
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,659
Well, I did.

395
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:42,122
I imagined myself coming here
to the United States, to New York,

396
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,208
to build something important.

397
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,336
That was also my dream.

398
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,881
The dream of a young immigrant,
like yourself.

399
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:55,302
And that's why I want to help you,
to make whatever dream you have a reality.

400
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,554
Whatever it is.

401
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,890
Regardless how much it costs.

402
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,642
In dollars.

403
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,690
You think you and I are the same

404
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:11,318
because we came
to this country with dreams?

405
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,070
Well...

406
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,573
My family fled Cuba
because we believed in freedom.

407
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,285
You came to sell cocaine.

408
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,163
Yes, we are both immigrants,

409
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,042
but we have nothing in common,
Mr. Santacruz.

410
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,340
My story is going to print.

411
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:43,016
Okay.
Thank you for hearing my proposal.

412
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,479
Can I ask you a question?

413
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:53,861
How long will it take
to get to the airport from here?

414
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,613
I have no idea.

415
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,199
An hour or so.

416
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,830
I'll miss a lot about New York.

417
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,458
But not the traffic.

418
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,959
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. How are you?

419
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,136
- Good evening.
- Hello. How are you?

420
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,264
Good evening. Welcome.

421
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,183
Good evening.

422
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,735
Good to see you, David.
What's up?

423
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,321
Looks like the whole family
showed up.

424
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,490
Why don't we have a drink upstairs?

425
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:40,550
You know what? I don't want
this many people up here.

426
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,296
Good evening!
Welcome to the Cali Fair!

427
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:25,345
Let's give a warm welcome
to a friend of the festival,

428
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,057
and our patron,
Mr. Miguel Rodríguez!

429
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,688
Come. Come here.

430
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,774
Come! Come here!

431
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,036
Say a few words.

432
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:02,007
Thank you all for coming.

433
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,594
Please, enjoy the party.

434
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:16,039
Your brother's a character.

435
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,042
His passion for tequila
exceeds his tolerance.

436
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,463
Well... my shift started already.

437
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,466
Bring me a pack of cigarettes
when you come back.

438
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,802
You're giving me a tip.

439
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:40,147
- I told you he'd be here.
- You came through.

440
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,816
I also said to take him outside.
It's too risky in here.

441
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,652
Tell your men to wait
until he's leaving.

442
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:58,707
- What men are you talking about?
- Your men standing by the DJ booth.

443
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,835
We came tonight to make sure
you were telling the truth.

444
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,171
We didn't bring any men.

445
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,632
- Fuck are you talking about?
- What?

446
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:12,596
- What's wrong?
- Fuck. You need to go. Go!

447
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,063
Shh.

448
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,232
We aren't here for you.

449
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,652
Where is Pacho?

450
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,030
Pacho!

451
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,753
I need to talk to you.

452
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:47,964
- Don't interrupt me...
- We have a problem. We have to leave.

453
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,091
- Relax. It's a fucking party.
- We need to leave now!

454
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,844
- I said calm down! I'll say when we go.
- What's going on here?

455
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,514
We have to leave, sir. Please.

456
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,856
Get down!

457
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,112
Go! Watch out!

458
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,405
Pacho!

459
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,139
Watch out!

460
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,351
Stay there!

461
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,896
- Keep going!
- Careful! Get out of the way!

462
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,232
- Keep going!
- Get out of the way!

463
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,067
Keep moving.

464
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,154
- When I run...
- They're over here.

465
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,200
Shit!

466
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:04,082
Give me the gun.

467
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,922
Go ahead.

468
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,635
Are you all right?

469
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,846
Motherfucker!

470
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,932
Álvaro!

471
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:36,781
Shoot them! Shoot them!

472
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,949
Go!

473
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,536
Over there!

474
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,603
- Careful!
- Head down, sir.

475
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,605
Head down!

476
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,691
- Slow down.
- Move it!

477
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,318
Motherfucker!

478
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,487
- Go!
- Let's go! Move it!

479
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,700
This shit...

480
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,709
Little brother, I need you to shoot.

481
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:32,712
Your gun. Keep shooting at them.

482
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,172
Pacho...

483
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,811
- Head down!
- I'll drive, Enrique. I'll drive!

484
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,188
Over here!

485
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,117
Who drove the car?

486
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:07,038
You got here by car.
Who was driving?

487
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,958
- Me.
- Give me the keys.

488
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,376
Fuck you.

489
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:26,641
Peña.

490
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,018
'There are men
at my apartment.'

491
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,979
- Yeah, they're ours.
- Yeah, no shit.

492
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,272
'Are you with them?'

493
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,774
No. I saw them and I freaked out,
so I left.

494
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,193
They're meant to protect you.
Have you talked to anyone?

495
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,321
No, I tried calling Franklin,
but I couldn't get in touch with him.

496
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,449
'What the fuck is going on?'

497
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:47,162
- We arrested Franklin.
- You did what?

498
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,289
'Christina, listen to me.'

499
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,458
I... You fucking asshole.

500
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,544
- Listen to me.
- I told you I was gonna talk to him.

501
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,255
- I told you.
- Christina. You want it? This is it.

502
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,175
As soon as we hang up the phone,
you get yourself to the American Embassy.

503
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,594
'You don't talk to anyone,
you don't call anyone.

504
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,846
- 'You get yourself there.'
- Okay.

505
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:18,777
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

506
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,407
- Are we close?
- Yes. It's just around the corner.

507
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:29,287
Thank you.
You saved me. Really.

508
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:34,501
Just tell your friends about me.
But only the ones with money.

509
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,438
Why isn't this imbecile moving?

510
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,402
When is this car gonna move?

511
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,286
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.

512
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,081
- Oh, my God.
- God.

513
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:16,376
- Oh, my God.
- Go! Fucking drive! Oh, my...

514
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,450
We start with just the basics. Okay?

515
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:52,704
Where they move the money,
where they keep the money.

516
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,507
Let me guess.
It's his fucking lawyer?

517
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:13,516
Agent Peña.
Alan Starkman. Mr. Jurado's lawyer.

518
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,270
Yeah. Your client has indicated he's open
to a deal in exchange for testimony.

519
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,023
Before he learned that
his wife won't be joining him.

520
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:23,902
No. I've just spoken with his wife.
She's on her way to the embassy in Bogotá.

521
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:27,572
Now, I was informed she never arrived.

522
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,741
Oh, go ahead. Check with your people.

523
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:38,666
It's my understanding that she met up
with Mr. Jurado's employers... instead.

524
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,879
I guess she's had a change of heart.

525
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,843
Whatever deal you had with my client...
is off.

526
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:06,694
Dad! Are you okay?

527
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,154
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

528
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,282
- Let's go inside.
- It's those North Valley motherfuckers.

529
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,702
- We got one of the shooters.
- They shot Álvaro, too.

530
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,413
Pacho's okay.
They're on their way back.

531
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,375
Are you okay?

532
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,836
- Close the damn door.
- What a fucking night.

533
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,964
Darío, please take her upstairs.

534
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,174
I'm coming soon.

535
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,558
What happened there?

536
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,103
It looked like...

537
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,898
...like you knew
something was coming.

538
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:48,027
Jorge, you know what? I know why.

539
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,241
Because you are always working.

540
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,244
You saved my life tonight, Jorge!

541
00:49:57,245 --> 00:50:00,081
- Dad, it wasn't my fault, I...
- One moment.

542
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:05,253
From now on, I want you back in charge
of my personal security.

543
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,338
Only you, Jorge.

544
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,174
Of course, Don Miguel.

545
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:14,637
And if you allow me, we don't know
if this will be the only attack or not.

546
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,849
So I need to know
where you are at all times.

547
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:19,434
Tomorrow is another day.

548
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,486
- 'Gilberto, it's me.'
- Thank God.

549
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,864
- How are you, brother?
- 'We're okay.

550
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,742
Look, Gilberto,
they tried to kill Pacho, too.

551
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:38,828
- 'Pacho? No, it can't be...'
- No, he's okay. He survived.

552
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,164
- 'He's on his way home.'
- Thank God.

553
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:45,084
These North Valley motherfuckers,
I'm going to kill them. Sons of bitches.

554
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:49,088
Listen to me, Miguel.
Now's not the time for...

555
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,174
Everybody's watching.

556
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:56,345
- 'It could ruin everything.'
- Look, Gilberto. They tried to kill me.

557
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:58,514
They tried to kill my son.

558
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,476
They tried to kill María.
They tried to kill Pacho.

559
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:03,686
Yes, I understand, brother, but...

560
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,566
...for now,
we can't afford to start a war.

561
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,651
Especially being so close
to the surrender.

562
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,279
What fucking surrender, Gilberto?

563
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,074
Before we can surrender,
they'll take everything from us.

564
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:20,787
- Brother, listen to me.
- Okay, no war. I understand.

565
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:25,291
You'll see.
Everything is going to be okay, brother.

566
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,170
Okay, Gilberto. Bye.

567
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:51,859
It's Salcedo.

568
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,909
- You alone?
- Yeah.

569
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,453
- Get the fuck in.
- How the fuck did you know where we were?

570
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,748
The same way I knew where to call you.
You think I would bring a gun here?

571
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,334
- We don't know what to think.
- Why didn't you have a team there tonight?

572
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,169
Because you never gave us
a straight answer.

573
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,089
- Did you know that was gonna happen?
- You're serious?

574
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,925
How's the North Valley
shooting up the place gonna help me?

575
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:19,345
You look like a hero,
escorting Miguel out the back.

576
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,013
I had to do my job.

577
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,141
You're still not telling us
the fucking truth.

578
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,101
They killed the guy I replaced.

579
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:27,895
And they killed his wife.

580
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,773
And they're gonna do the same thing
to me and my family.

581
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:35,862
And you two are the only ones that can
help me get them out. You understand?

582
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:37,321
Yeah.

583
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:41,367
Then we need to trust each other.

584
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,202
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

585
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,290
Tell me you know where Miguel is.

586
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:02,597
This is a skypager. All right?
It's untraceable. Even by you.

587
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,557
We'll be in touch.

588
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:10,062
'Over 15 people were killed,

589
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:11,939
'with dozens more injured
and in critical condition,

590
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,401
'in a deadly shootout tonight
at the kick-off party for the Cali Fair.

591
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,446
'Police say it's too early to say
what caused the incident...'

592
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,452
- I was worried.
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

593
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,913
- We're safe. We're safe.
- What happened?

594
00:53:28,164 --> 00:53:31,042
It was the North Valley. I'm okay.

595
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,377
Where are we going?

596
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:37,048
Why do we have to leave?
What's going on?

597
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,092
Come with me. Come. Come. Come.

598
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,847
Tell me what's going on right now!

599
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,558
What I'm about to tell you
has to stay here.

600
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,685
You can't tell anyone, understand?

601
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:54,023
I'm working for the Americans.

602
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:57,777
It can't be.

603
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,863
It can't be.

604
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:04,075
I contacted the DEA.
I'm giving them Miguel.

605
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,411
In exchange, they will help us
get out of the country.

606
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:11,749
It's our only option.
There's no other way.

607
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,087
You're crazy.

608
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,382
They're going to kill all of us.

609
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:22,468
- You're insane. What were you thinking?
- Paola...

610
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,980
'Things don't always go
according to plan.

611
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:39,068
'You can use every hope and prayer
you have, take your shot,

612
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,237
'and everything still goes to shit.

613
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:47,868
'And when that happens, it's almost
like you never had a plan at all.

614
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:52,790
'That's when people get desperate.
And things get dangerous.'

615
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:58,921
I want to welcome Pacho, Chepe.

616
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,550
I'm sorry it's under these circumstances.

617
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:05,136
North Valley attacked us.

618
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:07,555
Their intentions were clear.

619
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:13,060
They saw us as vulnerable
without Gilberto.

620
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,813
Weak, with me in charge.

621
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,691
They're trying to destroy us.

622
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,028
Take what's ours.

623
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,158
I...

624
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:33,497
All of us know there's only
one appropriate response to this.

625
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:38,044
One way to react against these people
who want to take everything from us,

626
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,546
what we've worked so hard to build.

627
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:45,926
War.

628
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,018
This is Gilberto's decision?

629
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,857
It's...

630
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,234
...mine.
