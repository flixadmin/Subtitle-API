1
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,056
There's simply no way to shield
against every weaponized agent.

2
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,016
Instead, I can make
super-immune systems

3
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,144
by strengthening
the human cellular response.

4
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,062
Banner, I know
where you're going.

5
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,023
But manipulating the immune
system is dangerous and stupid.

6
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,944
The President's science
advisors made it absolutely clear,

7
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,030
<i>no human subjects.</i>

8
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,180
David, I have wonderful news.

9
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,101
I'm gonna have a baby.

10
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,035
What's it gonna be?

11
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:53,289
Look at that, Bruce.
Want a dinosaur?

12
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,665
Let's have a little fight.

13
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,418
You don't scare me.

14
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,130
That's a delicious eyeball.

15
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,257
You're big and green
and scary. I'm gonna run away.

16
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,870
Really, speaking of Cheryl,
guess what...

17
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,955
Bruce, you're hurt!

18
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,876
Jack hit him with the stick,
but Bruce wouldn't hit him back.

19
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,170
He just stood there, shaking.

20
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,464
It's okay.

21
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,640
Yeah, strange
he didn't make a peep.

22
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,767
Any other kid would've
wailed his head off.

23
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,229
That's Bruce. He's like that.
He's just so bottled up.

24
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,737
The samples we found in your
lab, they were human blood.

25
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,656
You've ignored protocol.

26
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,825
You had no right
snooping around in my lab.

27
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,994
- That's my business.
- Wrong, Banner.

28
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,122
It's government business,
and you're off the project.

29
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,731
Attention, all personnel!
Fail-safe has been initiated.

30
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,109
Gamma decontamination
will occur in 30 minutes.

31
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,569
Evacuate immediately.
I repeat,

32
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,780
<i>evacuate immediately!</i>

33
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,093
- Edith?
- David, what's going on?

34
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:14,304
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

35
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,350
What are you doing?

36
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,178
What are you doing?

37
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,472
I'm trying to tell you
what's gotta be done!

38
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,558
David, please stop it! No!

39
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,143
David, no!

40
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,648
- No!
- Yes!

41
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,734
David! No!

42
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,534
Bruce.

43
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,745
Bruce, wake up, Son.

44
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,081
Bruce. Bruce.

45
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,587
Another nightmare?

46
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,048
I don't know.

47
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,258
I don't remember.

48
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,054
Hi, Mom.

49
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,016
Already off to college.

50
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,603
- I'm gonna miss you terribly.
- I'll miss you, too.

51
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,439
Please, come here.

52
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:54,404
Look at you. Soon to be
a great scientist.

53
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,242
- I guess. I mean, who knows?
- I do.

54
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,955
There's something
inside you so special.

55
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,083
Some kind of greatness.

56
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,254
I'm sure someday you're gonna
share it with the whole world.

57
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,729
But as far as I'm concerned,
security ought to be...

58
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,498
- Good morning, Dr. Krenzler.
- Good morning.

59
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,524
Security ought to be
beefed up a lot more.

60
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,818
In a place like this
you can't be too careful.

61
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,447
Bruce! Big day. Did
you sleep? I didn't sleep.

62
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,617
- I slept okay. ls Betty here?
- She's around.

63
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,495
I really gotta say, seeing
you in that styling headwear...

64
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,998
You're implying something
about my helmet?

65
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,335
You look like a massive nerd,
even around other scientists.

66
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,253
Can I just ask?

67
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,589
Were you wearing the helmet
while she dumped you?

68
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,216
See, it protects my very
important brain, Harper.

69
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,719
Go prep the samples.

70
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,057
- Hey. I found you.
- Betty, hey.

71
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,730
- I hate them.
- Wait, I just got here. Who do we hate?

72
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,691
The review board. We have to
make a presentation on Tuesday.

73
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,861
And you're gonna
make it with me.

74
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,491
- You think I should?
- Yeah, you're great with that stuff.

75
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,202
You start talking about
microbes and nanomeds,

76
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,829
you sound almost passionate.

77
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,877
I'm sorry. That was rude.

78
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,046
Look, nobody expects
this to be easy,

79
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:20,217
us working together
after being so close.

80
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,427
We were close?

81
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,847
Look, if I could be more

82
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,394
whatever, you know.
I'm just...

83
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,730
Don't. It's not
your fault, really.

84
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,317
You're just a by-product
of my inexplicable obsession

85
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,194
with emotionally distant men.

86
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,363
I'll get over us.

87
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,824
Good for you.

88
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,368
Anyway, I'm just really
stressed about this review.

89
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,260
If we don't get
impressive results today,

90
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,789
we're gonna have a really
hard sell come Tuesday.

91
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,751
Well, then,
let's go be impressive.

92
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,338
Harper?

93
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,341
- Ready when you are.
- Let's hit it.

94
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,681
Are we passing inspection?

95
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:54,269
Safeties all going green.
Countdown's started.

96
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,691
Nanomeds released.

97
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,403
Four seconds.

98
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,659
Okay, nanomeds fully dispersed.

99
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,664
Okay, let's hit Freddie
with the gamma radiation.

100
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,763
Gamma exposure.

101
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,141
Nanomeds now active.

102
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,482
Nanomeds
replicating cells on border.

103
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,025
It's working.

104
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,991
Cell copy to disassemble
ratio holding within 1%.

105
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,918
Imbalanced nanomed activity.

106
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,450
You wanna go to
the review board on Monday

107
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,602
and tell them we've developed a
brand-new method for exploding frogs?

108
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,605
Yeah, I think maybe
there's a market for it.

109
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,649
I mean, what if
there's a plague?

110
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,944
What have you had, Betty,
like, one beer?

111
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:31,575
I'm just... I'm just saying, you
know, frogs start falling from the sky,

112
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,910
who do they come to?

113
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,290
- We'd be world-renowned.
- Make any parent proud.

114
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,376
I bet they would be.

115
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,504
They actually did want me
to be a scientist.

116
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,841
I mean, your birth parents.

117
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,261
Guess we'll never know.

118
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,684
I don't understand why you
don't want to find out about them.

119
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,229
They're dead. They died before
I could remember anything.

120
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,690
Why do you always
come back to this?

121
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,817
Don't know.

122
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,446
I guess I figure there's more
to you than you like to show.

123
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,866
I guess there
couldn't be any less.

124
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,204
Right. So now we come
full circle back to that.

125
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,955
Nice work, Betty.

126
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,095
Betty.

127
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,349
- Glenn.
- Hey.

128
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,143
- Hi.
- Hi.

129
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,689
What happened to your uniform?

130
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,442
Oh, I switched over.

131
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,569
I'm still working
with your father, but...

132
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,672
Well, you know, the
military's subcontracting out

133
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,573
all the most
interesting work, and...

134
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,993
Can't argue with the paycheck.

135
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,163
I basically run all the labs
on the base now.

136
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,168
Hey, you're...

137
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,837
You're looking good.

138
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,804
You're the genetics expert.

139
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,859
Ah, the good old college days.

140
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,863
So, how's business?

141
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,866
What do you want?

142
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,538
All right,
I'll cut to the chase.

143
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,393
I've been hearing interesting things
about what you guys are doing here.

144
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,878
Your little molecular machines
have some incredible implications.

145
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,881
How would you like
to come work for Atheon?

146
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,718
Get paid 10 times as much
as you earn now

147
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,304
and own a piece of the patents.

148
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:04,060
- You just have to say the word.
- Two words, the door.

149
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,750
- General?
- Come in.

150
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,628
Talbot wanted you
to see this, sir.

151
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:35,258
It's about a lab Atheon is targeting for
acquisition and removal to Desert Base.

152
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,261
Why isn't it going through NSC?

153
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,683
It concerns your daughter, sir.

154
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,777
Hi. Sorry.

155
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,991
Hey, what happened to Benny? Is
he not working the night shift anymore?

156
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,203
Benny's dead.
I'm the new guy.

157
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:05,997
Oh.

158
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,834
- Good to meet you.
- Same.

159
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,738
- Let's try another.
- No, stay here.

160
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,784
- I look tired anyway.
- Yeah, but you look great.

161
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,872
What's the matter?

162
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,421
It's these dreams, Doctor. I keep
having them and they're terrible.

163
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,757
Tell me about your dream.

164
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,679
Well, it starts...

165
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,641
It starts with a memory.
I think it's my first memory.

166
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:09,561
It's this image I have

167
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,564
from when I was maybe
two years old.

168
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,306
Do you think it's just a dream?

169
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,558
No, I think it's something
that happened

170
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,895
when I was living at a
desert base with my father.

171
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,566
<i>Anyhow, the dream goes on</i>

172
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,486
<i>and suddenly I'm alone.</i>

173
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,775
That's terrible.
You know I'd never hurt you.

174
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,146
Hey, there.

175
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,817
What's your name, darling?

176
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,319
What's your name?

177
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,824
Okay. It's okay.

178
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,438
- <i>I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.</i>

179
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:47,607
C, T, G, A,

180
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,067
G.

181
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,529
Bruce.

182
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,871
My Bruce.

183
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,091
Morning. Glenn dropped by.

184
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,470
- What's he doing here?
- You know, Dr. Krenzler,

185
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,937
you and I have never had the chance
to get to know each other properly.

186
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:24,519
Well, that's because I don't want to
get to know you, properly or improperly.

187
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,897
So leave.

188
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,316
Hey, no worries.

189
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,244
Let me give you
a little heads up.

190
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:46,707
There is a hair's breadth between
friendly offer and hostile takeover.

191
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:51,087
I've done my homework. The
work you're doing here is dynamite.

192
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,923
Think, GIs embedded
with technology

193
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,759
that makes them instantly
repairable on the battlefield

194
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,886
in our sole possession.

195
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,015
- That's a hell of a business.
- Well, it's not what we're doing here.

196
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,810
We're doing the basic science
for everyone.

197
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:11,691
You know, someday I'm gonna
write a book and I'm gonna call it,

198
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:15,903
<i>When Stupid Ideals Happen
to Smart Penniless Scientists.</i>

199
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,657
In the meantime, Bruce,
you will be hearing from me.

200
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,267
- About Glenn, I...
- There's nothing to talk about.

201
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:50,980
Okay.

202
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,816
I just wanted to say,
don't worry about him.

203
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,568
I'll handle it.

204
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,031
<i>How'?</i>

205
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:05,745
I'm gonna call my father, ask
him to exert some pressure.

206
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,290
Last I heard, you and your
father weren't speaking.

207
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,127
Well,

208
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,505
I guess now I have something
to talk with him about.

209
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,675
<i>I think this circuit's
kind of fried. I don't know.</i>

210
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,844
<i>Maybe you wanna
come take a look at it.</i>

211
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:23,679
<i>Okay, I'll be right there.</i>

212
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,751
The gamma's too high!
Bruce, I can't stop it!

213
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,506
Harper, get out!

214
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,383
Get out!

215
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,413
- How's Harper?
- He's all right.

216
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,456
You saved him.

217
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:36,085
I don't think he's coming back
to the lab for a while, though.

218
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,593
I don't understand
how this is possible.

219
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,930
You should be dead.

220
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,726
They worked,

221
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:53,602
the nanomeds.

222
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,397
I mean, I feel great.
I feel like...

223
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,858
I don't know. They
must have, like, fixed me.

224
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:02,695
Bruce, they've killed everything else
that they've come into contact with.

225
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,158
Are you sure the doctor checked?

226
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,826
The doctor gave me
the full workup.

227
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,287
He wants to know where
he can get what I'm taking.

228
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,581
I'm 100%.

229
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,208
More.

230
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:20,129
- What do you mean?
- Remember my bad knee?

231
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:22,882
Well, now it's my good knee.

232
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:26,635
Bruce, this isn't funny.

233
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,055
I was watching you.

234
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,892
You were gonna die, and I
was gonna have to watch you die.

235
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,772
Betty, I'm sorry.

236
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,776
Really.

237
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,654
Hey, I'm not gonna explode.
Okay?

238
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,490
Yeah.

239
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,326
You should get some rest.

240
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:52,870
And I'm fine, really.

241
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:56,999
I've never felt better.

242
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,649
Your name is not Krenzler.
It's Banner.

243
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:11,115
- What?
- Your name, it's Banner.

244
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,784
Bruce Banner.

245
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,078
Bruce.

246
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:21,250
- How did you get in here?
- I work here now.

247
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,878
In the labs. The late shift.

248
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,131
It keeps me close to you.

249
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:31,302
You always work so late
yourself with your friend Miss Ross.

250
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,514
No, no. Please.
Please. Let me.

251
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,936
You're not well.

252
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,398
You've had a terrible accident.

253
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,777
You're wondering
why you're still alive.

254
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,658
You're thinking
there's something inside.

255
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,912
Something different,

256
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,540
inexplicable.

257
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:07,671
I can help you understand,
if you'll let me.

258
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,508
If you'll

259
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,845
forgive me.

260
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:23,646
Look, mister, I'm sure I have
nothing to forgive you for.

261
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:28,984
So perhaps you should
leave now. I'll be fine.

262
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,819
You must know.

263
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:36,909
You may not want to believe
it, but I can see it in your eyes.

264
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,746
So much like your mother's.

265
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,500
Of course,
you're my flesh and blood.

266
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:48,504
But then you're something
else, too, aren't you?

267
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,507
My physical son,

268
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,551
but the child of my mind, too.

269
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,847
No. You're lying.

270
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,517
My parents died
when I was a small boy.

271
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:05,562
No, no, that's not true. That's
what they wanted you to believe.

272
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:09,066
The experiments, the accident,
all top secret.

273
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:13,529
They put me away
for 30 years. Thirty years!

274
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:19,159
Away from you.
Away from our work.

275
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,871
But they couldn't
keep me forever.

276
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,291
After all, I'm sane.
They had to admit it.

277
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,670
You see,

278
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:33,882
everything
your extraordinary mind

279
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,469
has been seeking
all these years,

280
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:39,972
it's been inside you.

281
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,142
Now we will understand it.

282
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,311
We will harness it.

283
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:50,232
No, don't answer it.
It's Miss Ross again.

284
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,985
There's something you need
to know about her, Bruce.

285
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,653
Something troublesome.

286
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,655
Let me protect you from her.

287
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,908
No. Get out.

288
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:01,827
- Bruce...
- Get out!

289
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,079
Sit!

290
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,933
We're gonna have to watch
that temper of yours.

291
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,350
You sure you're okay?

292
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,477
Yeah,
just glad to be out of bed.

293
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:14,316
Got a message from my father.
He's coming to see me.

294
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,151
Your father?

295
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:19,822
- When?
- Lands in about an hour.

296
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:23,325
<i>The funny thing is,
he called me.</i>

297
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,506
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Betty.

298
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,351
- Here, ma'am.
- Thanks.

299
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,353
- You're welcome. Sir?
- Thank you.

300
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:52,729
You're welcome.

301
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:07,244
- Look, I'm gonna get right to it.
- It's about Glenn, isn't it?

302
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,706
He's been snooping
around my lab.

303
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:15,377
Glenn noticed some things,
asked me to make some inquiries.

304
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,300
Are you here to question me?

305
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:22,885
No.

306
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,096
We've turned up
some surprising things.

307
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,435
This Krenzler you work with,

308
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,062
you know who he really is?

309
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,483
How much do you actually
know about him?

310
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,197
I think the question is, what
is it that you know about him?

311
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,594
Well, right now,
I'm not at liberty...

312
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:50,996
Not at liberty to disclose
it to me. Right. Right.

313
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:56,001
You know, I think I was hoping

314
00:38:56,084 --> 00:39:02,090
that maybe this time you just
honestly wanted to see me again.

315
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,261
- You've got this all wrong, Betty.
- Do I?

316
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:10,057
Yes. I do want to see you.

317
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:15,604
I really wish that
I could believe you.

318
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,447
<i>Everything
your extraordinary mind</i>

319
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:10,409
<i>has been seeking
all these years,</i>

320
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,203
<i>it's been inside you.</i>

321
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,975
<i>Hi, you've called
Dr. Krenzler.</i>

322
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,352
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll call you right back.</i>

323
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,940
<i>Bruce, hey.
Are you there?</i>

324
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,695
<i>Look, I think I screwed up.
My father...</i>

325
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:50,198
<i>It's like he suspects you
of something. I don't know.</i>

326
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,535
<i>I was so impatient, like always.</i>

327
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,704
<i>I didn't hear him out.
I don't know, I...</i>

328
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:59,750
<i>I just think that they're
planning something with the lab.</i>

329
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,876
<i>So,</i>

330
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,171
<i>Call me. Okay? Bye.</i>

331
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,300
Betty?

332
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,650
Dispatch! Dispatch!
We have a 415 at the lab!

333
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:51,153
Send the Berkeley P.D. now!
Send them now!

334
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,348
Watch out!

335
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,667
<i>- Edith?
- David, what's going on?</i>

336
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:32,587
<i>- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.</i>

337
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,247
My Bruce.

338
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,179
Bruce?

339
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:01,676
There was some
sort of explosion.

340
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,095
They wouldn't let us
into the building.

341
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,099
I was worried about you.

342
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,353
Well, I'm okay.

343
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,231
What happened to you last night?

344
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,944
I had the most vivid dream.

345
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,073
It was like being born.

346
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:27,744
Coming up for air. Light
hitting my face. Screaming.

347
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,747
My heartbeat,

348
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,417
it was like boom,

349
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,087
boom,

350
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,757
boom.

351
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:50,100
- Were you at the lab?
- No.

352
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,228
But something...

353
00:46:56,147 --> 00:47:00,026
And there was that man,
the one with the dogs.

354
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,237
Who?

355
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,240
That new janitor.

356
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:07,993
He said he was my father.

357
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:15,750
I'll get it.

358
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,554
My father.

359
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,690
My, my.

360
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,402
So this is the young
Bruce Ban...

361
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:46,197
Krenzler.

362
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:51,119
I think you left something
in your lab last night.

363
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:59,794
Mitchell, escort my daughter
outside. I'll join her shortly.

364
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:03,631
- I'd rather stay here.
- Now, Betty.

365
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:10,346
It's okay. I'll be fine.

366
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:23,693
Keep him under observation.
I'll be back.

367
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,037
- What?
- Your friend in there,

368
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:38,291
there's a good chance he's caught
up in some very bad business,

369
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,168
unfinished business.

370
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,338
And I promise you, I'm
gonna get to the bottom of it.

371
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:46,549
You have my word
I'll make sure he's cared for.

372
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:49,427
But as of right now,
he is incommunicado.

373
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:51,846
And for the next
few days at least,

374
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,723
you're gonna stay away
from here.

375
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,725
For your own good.

376
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,070
Okay, and that's for the new
guy on the night shift, right?

377
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,031
Great. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

378
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,385
Dr. Ross.

379
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,179
How unexpected.

380
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,015
Please come in.

381
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:44,440
I'm sorry to just show up
at your house like this.

382
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,364
I came to ask you something

383
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:54,993
that I really have
no business asking.

384
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,080
He told you?

385
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:02,500
- He said you talked to him.
- Oh.

386
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,336
Please sit down.

387
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,264
Bruce was at the lab last night.

388
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:18,183
He said that
you were there, too.

389
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,310
But he can't remember
much about it.

390
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,146
I need to find out
what happened.

391
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:27,275
So, you want to know
what's wrong with him,

392
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:30,069
so you can fix him?

393
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:33,072
Cure him, change him.

394
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,951
My father's with the military.

395
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:41,331
He seems to think he's involved in
some kind of threat to national security.

396
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,460
Your father. Ross.

397
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:50,924
You brought your father
down upon his head?

398
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:53,843
How little you understand,
Miss Ross,

399
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:57,305
and how dangerous
your ignorance has become.

400
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,809
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

401
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,481
My son is unique.

402
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,275
That's why you can't
relate to him.

403
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:14,614
And because he is unique, the
world will not tolerate his existence.

404
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:15,990
Will they?

405
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:18,701
But you,

406
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,873
you try, don't you?

407
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,085
Yes.

408
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,134
And a very beautiful
woman like you,

409
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,637
your attentions

410
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:41,766
can't be completely unwanted.

411
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,185
Can they?

412
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:46,854
No.

413
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:51,025
Not with eyes like yours,

414
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:56,656
watching expectantly, lovingly.

415
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,996
But I'm afraid we're both
too late to help him.

416
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:07,542
There's nothing I can do
for him or for you.

417
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:09,836
Besides,

418
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:13,548
he's made it clear he wants
nothing to do with me.

419
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,425
His choice.

420
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:19,429
Now if you'll excuse me, Miss
Ross, I got some work to do.

421
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,765
And don't worry about the dogs.

422
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:26,728
You'll be fine. Just don't
look them in the eyes.

423
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:31,190
Goodbye.

424
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:37,030
<i>He gets released, and a
month later your lab is destroyed.</i>

425
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,573
What a coincidence.

426
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:41,576
So you're just not gonna
tell me where he is, are you?

427
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:43,536
How many times
do I have to tell you?

428
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:45,330
I'd like to help you,
but I just don't know.

429
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,457
You know who I am.
Right, Banner?

430
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,727
You're Betty's father.
You're a high-ranking general.

431
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:51,085
Let's cut the crap.

432
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:53,504
I'm the guy who had
your father tossed away,

433
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:54,589
and a lot more like him,

434
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,050
and I'll do the same with you
if I feel so disposed.

435
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,301
You understand?

436
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,887
If you had him tossed away,
then why are you asking me?

437
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:02,805
I don't remember.

438
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,724
I was always told
my father was dead.

439
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,351
Don't play with me!

440
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:09,103
You were four years old
when you saw it.

441
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:11,773
When I saw what?

442
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,443
You were right there. How could
anyone forget a thing like that?

443
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,197
What?

444
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,241
Oh, some more
repressed memories.

445
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,205
Just tell me.

446
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,793
I'm sorry, son.

447
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,422
You're an even more screwed-up
mess than I thought you'd be.

448
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,385
Until we get to
the bottom of this,

449
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:43,429
your lab has been declared
a top-secret military site,

450
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:46,516
and you're not gonna get a
security clearance to get back into it

451
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:49,936
or any other lab that's doing
anything more interesting

452
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:53,689
than trying to figure out the
next generation of herbal hair gel.

453
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,611
One more thing.

454
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:03,491
If you ever come
within 1,000 yards

455
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,743
of my daughter again,

456
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,163
I'll put you away for
the rest of your natural life.

457
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:25,138
Dogs!

458
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,643
Go! Go get her!

459
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:33,563
And let nothing stand
in your way!

460
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,023
Go!

461
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,840
<i>- Hello?
- Bruce?</i>

462
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:47,970
<i>So, they think they can just
throw you away as they did me.</i>

463
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:59,273
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?

464
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,942
<i>I got a visit today.</i>

465
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,402
A very unwelcome visit.

466
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:06,280
I'm afraid my hand
is being forced.

467
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:09,450
What did you do to me?

468
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,578
<i>You so much want to know,
don't you?</i>

469
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:16,791
But I think no explanation
will serve you half as well

470
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,709
as the experience.

471
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:23,673
In any case, I still don't
quite understand it myself.

472
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:26,968
If they'd only let me
work in peace...

473
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:30,304
Of course, my betters
would have none of that.

474
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,474
<i>So you experimented
on yourself, didn't you?</i>

475
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,310
And passed on to me, what?

476
00:56:37,353 --> 00:56:39,730
<i>An alteration. Genetic.</i>

477
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:43,317
A deformity. I guess
you could call it that.

478
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,404
But an amazing strength, too.

479
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:50,616
And now, finally unleashed,
I can harvest it.

480
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:52,243
<i>No.</i>

481
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,997
You'll do no such thing. I will
isolate it and treat it myself.

482
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:59,333
I'll remove it, and I'll kill it
before it does any real harm.

483
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:02,670
I'll bet you and your Betty
would love to destroy it.

484
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,382
But would you really destroy
part of yourself?

485
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,718
I don't think so.

486
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,178
And as for Betty,

487
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:16,100
I'm sending her a surprise visit
from some four-legged friends of mine.

488
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,688
You see, I've managed to culture
some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

489
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:22,982
and the results are tremendous.

490
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,861
They're unstable,
but very powerful.

491
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,531
What about my DNA?

492
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:35,411
<i>Let's just wait and see what
Betty makes of the results, huh?</i>

493
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:39,040
No. You're crazy.
I won't let you.

494
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,878
Get your hands off of me.

495
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:47,399
- Talbot, what's this...
- Inside, asshole. I wanna talk to you.

496
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,759
Listen to me, my father's
going after Betty...

497
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,570
What makes you think
you can go behind my back

498
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:53,220
and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

499
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,641
Listen to me!
Betty's in trouble!

500
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,062
You pathetic freak.

501
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,481
Betty's in danger. I swear
to you, she'll be killed.

502
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:05,399
I can state the obvious.

503
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,735
Something tells me you
aren't in much of a position

504
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:10,237
to be making
stupid threats to anyone.

505
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,410
- Talbot.
- Yeah?

506
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:18,245
You're making me angry.

507
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:20,081
Oh, am I?

508
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:18,597
My God, fire! Open fire!

509
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,418
Bruce?

510
01:06:38,245 --> 01:06:40,414
He sent these dogs, didn't he?

511
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,500
But I killed them!

512
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,277
My God.

513
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:13,530
It must be the nanomeds.
It must be the gamma exposure.

514
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:16,617
But we've never seen
any effect like this before.

515
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,619
No. Deeper.

516
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:22,247
The gamma just unleashed
what was already there.

517
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:23,874
Unleashed what?

518
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:26,877
Me.

519
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:29,463
It.

520
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,508
It's okay.

521
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,219
It's okay.

522
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,931
What were those animals?

523
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:42,017
My father sent them.

524
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,645
He is my father.

525
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,648
He wanted me to change.

526
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:50,776
He wanted me to change
into that mindless hulk.

527
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:53,153
Why would he want that?

528
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,865
Can you remember anything?

529
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:59,868
Is there anything
from when you were changed?

530
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:04,998
It was like a dream.

531
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,210
About what?

532
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:11,588
Rage.

533
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:15,259
Power.

534
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:18,929
And freedom.

535
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:41,326
Hello? Sir.

536
01:08:42,703 --> 01:08:44,496
- Hello.
- Dad?

537
01:08:44,538 --> 01:08:46,540
Betty! Are you all right?

538
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:52,671
I'm scared.
I need your help.

539
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:54,548
Where are you?

540
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:06,685
How are you?

541
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:09,855
Okay, I guess.

542
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,902
I think that somehow

543
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:19,406
your anger is triggering
the nanomeds.

544
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:24,286
How could it? We designed them
to respond to physical damage.

545
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:27,164
Emotional damage
can manifest physically.

546
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:30,250
Like what?

547
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,756
Serious trauma.

548
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,052
Repressed memories.

549
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:50,437
Your father grilled me about something
that happened to me from early childhood

550
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,773
that I'm supposed to remember.

551
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:55,609
- He did?
- It sounded bad, but...

552
01:09:57,486 --> 01:09:59,529
I honestly don't remember.

553
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,701
The thing that worries me

554
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:06,286
is

555
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:11,291
A physical wound is finite,
but with emotions,

556
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:14,419
what's to say it won't
just go on and on

557
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:17,589
and start a chain reaction?

558
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:23,637
You know
what scares me the most?

559
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:27,349
When it happens,

560
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:32,771
when it comes over me
and I totally lose control,

561
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:37,275
I like it.

562
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:57,671
It's okay. I got you.
I'm sorry.

563
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:01,675
You'll be okay.
It's just to make you sleep.

564
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,593
Target down. Target secure.

565
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,388
I'm going to take you
someplace safe.

566
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,473
Okay? Bruce?

567
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,101
Bruce?

568
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:13,562
<i>Bruce?</i>

569
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:50,343
Clear!

570
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:02,522
- Attention on deck.
- Carry on.

571
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,950
We're buried out here
in the middle of nowhere.

572
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:16,036
How long are you
gonna keep him sedated?

573
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:18,371
For the rest of his
natural life, if I have to.

574
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:21,499
- You said I could trust you.
- I'm your father.

575
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:26,212
You can trust me to do what I think
is right, not what you think you want.

576
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:29,674
- He is a human being.
- He is also something else.

577
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:33,720
Suppose he gets out, has
one of his little mood swings

578
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,096
in a populated area.

579
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,265
Yes, I'm aware of
the potential danger.

580
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:39,726
I'm also aware that
he saved my life.

581
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,270
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.

582
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,231
I'm indebted to him for that.

583
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:48,902
He also put three men in a
hospital, and Talbot's barely walking!

584
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:52,322
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to help him!

585
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:54,866
Why is he such a threat to you?

586
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:57,118
Because I know
what he comes from.

587
01:14:57,202 --> 01:15:01,247
He is his father's son,
every last molecule of him.

588
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,917
He says he doesn't
know his father,

589
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,421
but he's workin' in the same
exact goddamn field his father did.

590
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:13,885
So either he's lyin' or it's
somethin' worse, and he's...

591
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:15,095
What?

592
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,973
Predestined to follow
in his father's footsteps?

593
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:23,395
I was gonna say "damned."

594
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:26,606
Of course you were.

595
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:27,982
But I'm a scientist.

596
01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:32,362
As a scientist, I believe we can
figure this out and he can be helped.

597
01:15:33,405 --> 01:15:34,906
I know you do.

598
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:39,119
Whether you know or care,

599
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:43,790
I've got a lot of pride
in what you've done.

600
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,334
But this is too big for you.

601
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:50,797
Look, I know the government thinks
they have a weapon on their hands.

602
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,216
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.

603
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,385
They can probe and prod
all they want,

604
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,679
and in the meanwhile,
just let me try to help him.

605
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,223
Nobody knows him
better than I do.

606
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,730
What did David Banner do to him?

607
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:13,153
- Cover left.
- Clear left.

608
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:14,279
Cover right!

609
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:27,620
What's happening here?

610
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:29,956
My hand.

611
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,753
You see, the strength
of my son's DNA

612
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:41,217
combined with nanomed
reconstruction...

613
01:18:43,595 --> 01:18:47,098
You see, I can partake with
the essences of all things.

614
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,477
Gonna have to ask you to

615
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:54,230
put your hands up, pal, okay?

616
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:56,649
Nice and easy.

617
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:08,161
Do you really believe
that I am separate from you?

618
01:19:10,622 --> 01:19:11,748
Whoa!

619
01:19:27,347 --> 01:19:28,723
Where am I?

620
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:34,979
You're home.

621
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,578
It's hard to believe
we used to live here.

622
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:55,541
I must have seen you
or known you.

623
01:19:56,376 --> 01:19:58,378
If only I could remember.

624
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:35,206
This is my old house, isn't it?

625
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:16,622
Let's go.

626
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,667
Please try.

627
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:17,100
- What is it?
- Nothing.

628
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:20,353
Really?

629
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:24,690
Damn it.

630
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:31,447
Okay, Betty.

631
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,076
What do you want to know?

632
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:39,413
What was in that room?

633
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:53,094
What are you afraid
that I'll see?

634
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:01,853
See? There's nothing.

635
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,314
It's empty.

636
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:20,288
What do you mean
I don't have access to him?

637
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:23,791
NSA has decided
to turn over study

638
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,169
of the threat to Atheon.

639
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:31,257
But you're head of the base.
I thought you were in charge.

640
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,760
But I don't set policy,
and I still take orders.

641
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:41,559
I can't believe Talbot
would go around me like this!

642
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:47,398
Oh, there's a lot of powerful
people that want in on this.

643
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:50,193
And money to be made,
lots of it.

644
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:58,784
You know the worst part
about all this?

645
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:02,288
When I had David Banner
locked up and sent that kid away,

646
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:06,417
I didn't give that boy a second
thought. He was just collateral damage.

647
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:09,086
Well, he isn't anymore, is he?

648
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:14,008
What can I do?

649
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:17,803
You can go home now.

650
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:22,975
I'd tell you to go and say good-bye,
but I've already been informed

651
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:26,646
that for now all further
contact is out of the question.

652
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:29,232
Right.

653
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:12,024
Hiya, Bruce. How ya feelin'?
Grub okay in here for ya?

654
01:25:13,484 --> 01:25:16,362
- What do you want?
- That's a good question.

655
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:21,575
See, I need your cells to trigger
some chemical distress signals.

656
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:25,454
You know, so you can turn
a little green for me again,

657
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:28,749
and I can carve off
a piece of the real you,

658
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:32,044
analyze it, patent it,
make a fortune.

659
01:25:33,713 --> 01:25:35,089
Do you mind?

660
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:37,925
I'll never let you.

661
01:25:38,676 --> 01:25:41,220
I'm not sure you've got
much of a choice.

662
01:25:43,014 --> 01:25:45,683
Come on, Bruce. Aren't
you feeling a little angry?

663
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,411
After all, you've only got
me to play with

664
01:25:47,435 --> 01:25:49,645
now that Betty's dumped you
and gone back to Berkeley.

665
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:52,148
You're lying.

666
01:25:52,231 --> 01:25:54,942
You know, for me
this is a win-win situation.

667
01:25:55,026 --> 01:25:57,570
You turn green, and all these
guys come in and kill you,

668
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,155
and I perform the autopsy.

669
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,239
You don't...

670
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:04,201
And I mop the floor with you

671
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:07,079
and maybe by accident go
too far and break your neck.

672
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:11,542
Bad science, maybe,
but personally gratifying.

673
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:17,465
Come on, Bruce!
Let's see what you got.

674
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:20,384
Never

675
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:29,268
You know, consciously
you may control it,

676
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,605
but subconsciously,
I bet that's another story.

677
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,805
All right, let's jump-start
those brain waves.

678
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:18,234
<i>Bruce.</i>

679
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:35,543
My dear Miss Ross.
Welcome back.

680
01:27:36,836 --> 01:27:38,963
There are two guards
right outside.

681
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:43,342
You don't have to worry. I'm
not angry with you. Not anymore.

682
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,679
What do you want?

683
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,515
It's over for me now.
I know that.

684
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:52,852
And soon it'll be
over for Bruce.

685
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:56,188
That's why I've come to you

686
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:59,859
to ask you if you could
persuade your father,

687
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:03,112
as a man, as a father himself,

688
01:28:04,405 --> 01:28:07,867
that if I turn myself in now,
peacefully

689
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:10,953
and before
he puts me away forever,

690
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:14,039
that he would let me see my son

691
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,500
for one last time.

692
01:28:17,418 --> 01:28:19,462
Could you do that for me?

693
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:25,384
It's out of
my father's hands now.

694
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:33,142
I understand.
He's a puppet now.

695
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:37,396
- I don't blame him.
- You shouldn't.

696
01:28:37,563 --> 01:28:41,317
You should blame yourself for
what you've done to your son.

697
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:45,196
And what have I done to
my son, Miss Ross? Nothing.

698
01:28:45,863 --> 01:28:49,492
I tried to improve
on the limits in myself.

699
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:52,286
Myself! Not him!

700
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:56,165
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.

701
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:58,918
My nature!
Knowledge of oneself!

702
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,420
It's the only path to the truth

703
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:06,133
that give men the power
to go beyond God's boundaries!

704
01:29:07,218 --> 01:29:10,721
You know what's beyond
your boundaries? Other people.

705
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,600
All you've given Bruce is fear.

706
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:18,521
Fear of life.

707
01:29:21,941 --> 01:29:23,067
Fear?

708
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:27,029
Perhaps, Miss Ross.

709
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:31,242
And loneliness, too.

710
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:33,369
Yes.

711
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:36,872
I feel them both.

712
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:44,797
But I have lived
completely once.

713
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:49,051
<i>I was so much in love,</i>

714
01:29:50,344 --> 01:29:52,805
<i>and she so much wanted a baby.</i>

715
01:29:53,222 --> 01:29:54,473
<i>My baby.</i>

716
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:05,568
<i>I could tell
from the moment she conceived</i>

717
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,320
<i>that it wasn't a son
I had given her</i>

718
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,531
<i>but something else.</i>

719
01:30:11,282 --> 01:30:12,950
<i>A monster, maybe.</i>

720
01:30:13,242 --> 01:30:16,120
<i>I should have put
a stop to it right then,</i>

721
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:20,207
<i>but I was curious,
and that was my downfall.</i>

722
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,628
<i>And as I watched
this tiny life unfold,</i>

723
01:30:25,004 --> 01:30:28,215
I began to imagine
the horror of it,

724
01:30:28,549 --> 01:30:31,927
and my curiosity was replaced

725
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,805
with compassion.

726
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:40,185
<i>But they took away
my chance to cure him.</i>

727
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:42,271
<i>Your father threw me out.</i>

728
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:46,525
- What are you doing?
- <i>I remember that day so well,</i>

729
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:51,030
<i>every moment, every sensation
walking into the house,</i>

730
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:54,700
<i>the feeling of the handle
of the knife in my hand.</i>

731
01:30:55,159 --> 01:31:00,080
<i>I knew I was doing a father's
work, fulfilling a father's mercy.</i>

732
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:03,042
<i>David, please stop it! No!</i>

733
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:05,711
<i>David, no! Talk to me! Listen!</i>

734
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:08,589
But then she surprised me.

735
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,385
No! No!

736
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:15,012
David, no!

737
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:17,097
<i>It was as if</i>

738
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:20,559
<i>she and the knife</i>

739
01:31:22,019 --> 01:31:23,228
merged.

740
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,657
No!

741
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:37,076
<i>You cannot imagine</i>

742
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:40,913
<i>the unbearable finality of it.</i>

743
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,708
<i>And in that one moment,</i>

744
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:48,587
<i>I took everything
that was dear to me</i>

745
01:31:49,672 --> 01:31:53,550
<i>and transformed it
into nothing more</i>

746
01:31:54,218 --> 01:31:55,761
<i>than a memory.</i>

747
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:14,905
Bingo! That must be some
jumbo nightmare he just had.

748
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:21,870
Okay, do it now.
Start the enzyme extraction.

749
01:32:27,126 --> 01:32:29,169
Sir, negative
on drill penetration.

750
01:32:29,253 --> 01:32:31,296
Damn it, drill him harder!
Give him full RPMs.

751
01:32:31,338 --> 01:32:32,965
Come on, Holeman! Come on!

752
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:49,565
- Should I neutralize?
- No! I can't do anything with goop!

753
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:50,899
Come on!

754
01:33:04,163 --> 01:33:06,331
All right, put him to sleep.

755
01:33:15,841 --> 01:33:17,760
It's not stopping him!

756
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:26,852
Ready room, send in
our containment team.

757
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:30,147
Non-lethals only.
I repeat, non-lethals only.

758
01:33:30,189 --> 01:33:32,149
I must have a sample of him.

759
01:33:32,191 --> 01:33:33,317
Sir!

760
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:39,239
- Jesus!
- Hit him with the foam.

761
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:41,366
Deploy containment foam.

762
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:43,994
Talbot, talk to me.

763
01:33:45,913 --> 01:33:46,914
Cease fire!

764
01:33:46,997 --> 01:33:49,291
Under control, General. I'll
let you know if we need you.

765
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:52,211
Unacceptable. Unseat your
asses down there immediately.

766
01:33:52,252 --> 01:33:55,172
I want a full-court evacuation
now. I'm shutting you down.

767
01:33:55,214 --> 01:33:56,423
Lockdown.

768
01:33:56,924 --> 01:34:00,135
- Didn't you hear what the General said?
- I said lockdown!

769
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:04,723
Clear! I need a sample of him!

770
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,604
Take it easy there, buddy.

771
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:13,398
This might give you
a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

772
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:29,414
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Clear your weapon! Clear it!

773
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:32,835
Give me the M2.
So long, big boy.

774
01:34:33,627 --> 01:34:34,795
Clear!

775
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:48,642
Lockdown the entire
facility immediately.

776
01:34:53,063 --> 01:34:55,607
Target's still moving
towards blue level.

777
01:34:55,691 --> 01:34:57,609
Evacuate the main hall.

778
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:07,202
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.

779
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:09,496
Set firing lines left and right!

780
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:12,457
Heavy weapons, go, go, go!

781
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:36,815
Contamination, sir.
System readings are red line.

782
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:39,151
Data's on backup power supply.

783
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:47,451
Incoming!

784
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,961
- Shut down all power to the main hall.
- Sir?

785
01:35:58,003 --> 01:36:01,298
Show him the way out.
We'll fight him outside.

786
01:38:11,136 --> 01:38:13,805
Driver, stop. Driver, stop.

787
01:38:21,146 --> 01:38:23,774
- Gunner, traverse left!
- Traverse left!

788
01:39:06,983 --> 01:39:08,902
Clear back! Clear back!

789
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:06,126
Mr. President,
I have some bad news, sir.

790
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,545
Let's have it, General.

791
01:40:08,587 --> 01:40:10,338
I've briefed the President
on Angry Man.

792
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:11,923
I assume that's what
this is about.

793
01:40:12,007 --> 01:40:13,258
It is, ma'am.

794
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:16,553
I'm requesting a National
Command Authority override.

795
01:40:16,595 --> 01:40:19,014
Angry Man is unsecure.

796
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:24,060
I need everything we have at my
disposal in order to stop his movement.

797
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:27,272
You're expecting
civilian casualties, General?

798
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:29,524
Not if I can help it, ma'am.

799
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:32,152
Consider it done.
Keep us posted.

800
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:22,827
Contact Goodman Control.

801
01:41:22,953 --> 01:41:24,996
<i>Patch data to the assets.</i>

802
01:41:25,372 --> 01:41:26,831
<i>Contact H.Q.</i>

803
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:31,002
Have them initiate
an immediate evacuation

804
01:41:31,628 --> 01:41:34,714
in vicinity of
grid coordinates 6-5-15.

805
01:42:11,418 --> 01:42:13,503
Confirm that the area
has been cleared.

806
01:42:13,545 --> 01:42:15,213
Confirm area cleared.

807
01:42:15,297 --> 01:42:18,717
<i>- H.Q. confirms area cleared.
- Assets on-line, sir.</i>

808
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:21,052
<i>Gentlemen, it's time to dig in.</i>

809
01:42:21,094 --> 01:42:24,139
<i>I want this target
stopped in his tracks.</i>

810
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:16,441
Jesus.

811
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:35,168
Mayday! Mayday! Ah, shit!

812
01:43:40,882 --> 01:43:44,844
<i>Tango Four is down. Have
CSAR respond to our 20 ASAP.</i>

813
01:43:46,012 --> 01:43:49,182
<i>We're okay, but, damn it, get
him off us before he tears us apart!</i>

814
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:51,851
<i>I've got no shot. Do you
have a clear line of fire?</i>

815
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:54,145
Watch it, Tango Flight.

816
01:43:54,187 --> 01:43:56,648
Break left! Break left!

817
01:43:57,816 --> 01:44:00,318
<i>Tango Three, pull back
and set up for a Hellfire shot.</i>

818
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,737
<i>Hold your fire
till we draw him off.</i>

819
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:05,115
<i>Tango One is hot. Gun wazzed.</i>

820
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:07,450
<i>Roger.
Going hot. Guns ready.</i>

821
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:14,541
<i>Engage at will.</i>

822
01:44:35,353 --> 01:44:37,897
<i>Tango One,
pull back! Clear my line!</i>

823
01:44:38,106 --> 01:44:41,025
<i>Tango Flight, clear back.
I've got him painted for Hellfire.</i>

824
01:44:41,109 --> 01:44:42,485
<i>Roger that.</i>

825
01:44:43,695 --> 01:44:46,030
<i>Tango One clear.
Take the shot.</i>

826
01:45:04,883 --> 01:45:07,218
<i>- Tango One, Tango Three.
- I have contact.</i>

827
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:09,971
<i>Holy shit!
He's got my missile!</i>

828
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:13,433
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

829
01:45:16,019 --> 01:45:19,564
<i>Mayday! Mayday! We're hit!
We're going down!</i>

830
01:45:23,401 --> 01:45:24,986
Give me a head count.

831
01:45:25,069 --> 01:45:27,572
<i>Tango Three, give me a sit rep.</i>

832
01:45:28,156 --> 01:45:31,075
<i>Our kite's busted up,
but we're okay.</i>

833
01:45:33,036 --> 01:45:35,497
<i>Tango Flight, do you
have eyes on the target?</i>

834
01:45:36,623 --> 01:45:38,666
<i>Tango One.
I have him in the rocks.</i>

835
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:41,377
<i>Salvo all.
Turn it into a parking lot.</i>

836
01:46:02,607 --> 01:46:04,692
<i>T-bolt,
your parking lot is ready.</i>

837
01:46:04,776 --> 01:46:07,403
<i>We're bingo
for fuel and ammo. R.T.B.</i>

838
01:46:34,973 --> 01:46:36,808
<i>T-bolt, this is Goodman Control.</i>

839
01:46:36,891 --> 01:46:40,478
<i>Be advised, target not
destroyed. He's on the move again.</i>

840
01:46:40,812 --> 01:46:41,980
Damn!

841
01:46:42,522 --> 01:46:43,940
I've got it.

842
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:47,110
It appears he's heading home.

843
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:51,656
Launch fast movers. Have
them intercept and engage.

844
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:55,577
Hello?

845
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:57,620
Betty, Bruce got out.

846
01:46:57,662 --> 01:47:00,832
He's headed your way
and probably right for you.

847
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:02,875
<i>How far from the base are you?</i>

848
01:47:02,959 --> 01:47:06,087
I'm already here. They're
taking his father in now.

849
01:47:06,713 --> 01:47:09,841
That's all good news.
Stay there, Betty.

850
01:47:24,147 --> 01:47:27,025
<i>- Legend One rolling in hot.
- Legend Two breaking off left.</i>

851
01:47:27,734 --> 01:47:30,862
<i>I think I can come back around
for a gun attack.</i>

852
01:47:31,237 --> 01:47:33,865
<i>Acquire a clear target.
Fire at will.</i>

853
01:47:39,037 --> 01:47:42,290
<i>Increase altitude.
Civilian aircraft in vicinity.</i>

854
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:50,214
<i>Pull up! Pull up!
You're headed for the bridge!</i>

855
01:47:51,883 --> 01:47:54,302
<i>I can't pull up!
I can't pull up!</i>

856
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:05,897
Okay, you've got him now. Take
him on a ride to the top of the world.

857
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:08,900
<i>Let's see what the thin air
will do for him.</i>

858
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:11,569
<i>Initiating afterburn.</i>

859
01:48:28,753 --> 01:48:32,382
<i>I'm passing flight level 600.
This is out of my envelope.</i>

860
01:48:33,549 --> 01:48:35,009
<i>Hang in there, Legend.</i>

861
01:48:35,134 --> 01:48:38,262
I can't maintain.
He's all over my aerodynamics.

862
01:48:38,346 --> 01:48:40,515
<i>He'll lose consciousness
before you.</i>

863
01:48:44,519 --> 01:48:49,357
Nine-fifty. I can't hold it.
I'm pulling back!

864
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:38,656
Puny human.

865
01:49:47,707 --> 01:49:51,002
<i>Contact. He's in the water.
All units, weapons hot.</i>

866
01:49:51,169 --> 01:49:53,129
<i>Let's not take any chances.</i>

867
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:56,048
You are cleared to fire
on target, Legend.

868
01:50:18,571 --> 01:50:20,031
<i>- Dad?
- Betty?</i>

869
01:50:21,407 --> 01:50:22,658
<i>We don't have a choice.</i>

870
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:24,702
I have to destroy him.

871
01:50:24,827 --> 01:50:25,953
But you can't.

872
01:50:26,037 --> 01:50:29,540
You will only fuel his rage,
and you will make him stronger.

873
01:50:30,291 --> 01:50:33,044
It's you he's coming for.
You know that.

874
01:50:35,046 --> 01:50:36,923
Then let me go to him.

875
01:50:37,799 --> 01:50:39,050
Please.

876
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:43,554
<i>Just give him a chance
to calm down.</i>

877
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:07,829
<i>All aircraft vicinity of San
Francisco, this is T-bolt on guard.</i>

878
01:51:08,246 --> 01:51:11,332
<i>This area has been declared
restricted airspace.</i>

879
01:51:11,749 --> 01:51:15,586
<i>All aircraft are ordered to
clear the airspace immediately.</i>

880
01:51:57,795 --> 01:51:59,589
<i>Echo, One-niner.
Weapons are hot.</i>

881
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,133
<i>Target acquired.
Waiting your order to engage.</i>

882
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:04,886
<i>Repeat,
waiting your orders to engage.</i>

883
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:08,139
<i>Command code yellow.
Hold for authorization.</i>

884
01:52:18,274 --> 01:52:20,026
All units, hold your fire.

885
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:21,986
<i>This is T-bolt to all assets.</i>

886
01:52:22,028 --> 01:52:23,547
<i>You have direct orders
to hold your fire.</i>

887
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:25,823
<i>I repeat, hold your fire.</i>

888
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:27,742
<i>Echo, One-niner.
Roger that.</i>

889
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:44,467
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

890
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:16,207
Hold your fire until my command!

891
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:22,171
<i>- Engine 24 to command.
- We are in position now.</i>

892
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,282
You found me.

893
01:54:33,784 --> 01:54:36,078
You weren't that hard to find.

894
01:54:38,289 --> 01:54:39,665
Yes, I was.

895
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:47,525
Let's take a walk.

896
01:56:19,557 --> 01:56:22,852
That's the deal, gentlemen.
He stays on this base

897
01:56:22,893 --> 01:56:26,230
until we get the final word from
C-3 on how to dispose of him.

898
01:56:27,314 --> 01:56:31,360
In the meantime, if he does
anything but sit there in that chair,

899
01:56:32,987 --> 01:56:36,407
we're gonna turn on the juice
and he'll be incinerated immediately.

900
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:39,243
We've established
a 200-yard perimeter, sir.

901
01:56:39,577 --> 01:56:41,745
If we deploy
the electromagnetic array,

902
01:56:41,787 --> 01:56:43,831
there should be
no collateral damage.

903
01:56:43,956 --> 01:56:44,999
Here they come!

904
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:55,092
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.

905
01:56:55,259 --> 01:56:59,388
But one way or another, we're
gonna have to prepare for the worst.

906
01:58:48,747 --> 01:58:50,791
I should have killed you.

907
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:54,086
And I should have killed you.

908
01:58:55,546 --> 01:58:57,131
I wish you had.

909
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:05,055
I saw her last night.

910
01:59:07,308 --> 01:59:08,809
Saw her face.

911
01:59:10,185 --> 01:59:11,562
Brown hair.

912
01:59:13,605 --> 01:59:15,024
Brown eyes.

913
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,068
She smiled at me.

914
01:59:19,403 --> 01:59:21,363
She reached down
and kissed my cheek.

915
01:59:24,283 --> 01:59:26,577
I can almost remember a smell.

916
01:59:30,914 --> 01:59:33,083
It was like desert flowers.

917
01:59:35,085 --> 01:59:36,920
Her favorite perfume.

918
01:59:40,215 --> 01:59:44,094
It's my mother, and I
don't even know her name.

919
01:59:52,227 --> 01:59:55,981
It's all right, Son.
You go ahead and cry.

920
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:04,782
Go ahead and cry.

921
02:00:08,952 --> 02:00:11,163
Cry. Crying will do you good.

922
02:00:11,288 --> 02:00:12,831
Don't touch me!

923
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:17,961
Maybe once you were my father,

924
02:00:19,254 --> 02:00:22,049
but you're not now
and you never will be.

925
02:00:22,132 --> 02:00:23,717
Oh, is that so?

926
02:00:25,469 --> 02:00:30,140
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't come here to see you.

927
02:00:31,141 --> 02:00:33,727
I came here to see my son.

928
02:00:35,104 --> 02:00:36,605
My real son.

929
02:00:37,272 --> 02:00:39,149
The one inside of you.

930
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:43,987
You're nothing
but a superficial shell,

931
02:00:44,154 --> 02:00:46,448
a husk of flimsy consciousness

932
02:00:46,657 --> 02:00:49,701
ready to be torn off
at a moment's notice.

933
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:53,288
You can think what you like.
I don't care. Just go!

934
02:00:59,336 --> 02:01:02,548
No, Son. Listen to me.
I found a cure.

935
02:01:03,507 --> 02:01:04,716
For me.

936
02:01:05,634 --> 02:01:08,011
My cells can transform, too,

937
02:01:08,345 --> 02:01:10,806
absorb enormous
amounts of energy.

938
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:13,642
But, unlike you,
they're unstable.

939
02:01:14,059 --> 02:01:17,354
Son, I need your strength.

940
02:01:18,897 --> 02:01:21,024
I gave you life.

941
02:01:21,442 --> 02:01:24,403
Now you must give it back to me!

942
02:01:25,404 --> 02:01:30,033
Only a million times
more radiant, more powerful!

943
02:01:30,117 --> 02:01:33,454
- Stop it.
- Stop? Stop what?

944
02:01:33,662 --> 02:01:35,706
Stop what?

945
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:40,544
Think about all those men
out there in their uniforms,

946
02:01:41,295 --> 02:01:44,047
barking and swallowing orders,

947
02:01:44,339 --> 02:01:47,718
inflicting their petty rule
over the entire globe!

948
02:01:48,385 --> 02:01:50,929
Think of all the harm
they've done!

949
02:01:51,555 --> 02:01:53,849
To you! To me!

950
02:01:54,516 --> 02:01:55,934
To humanity!

951
02:01:56,894 --> 02:01:59,688
And know this,
that we can make them

952
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:02,566
and their flags and their
anthems and their governments

953
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:04,902
disappear in a flash!

954
02:02:05,235 --> 02:02:06,862
You in me.

955
02:02:07,237 --> 02:02:08,780
I'd rather die.

956
02:02:10,532 --> 02:02:12,910
Oh, that's your answer?

957
02:02:13,994 --> 02:02:18,332
Then indeed you shall die
and be reborn

958
02:02:18,749 --> 02:02:22,169
a hero of the kind
that walked the earth

959
02:02:22,503 --> 02:02:26,089
long before the pale
religions of civilization

960
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:28,926
infected humanity's soul!

961
02:02:29,092 --> 02:02:31,053
Go!

962
02:02:46,777 --> 02:02:48,487
Stop your bawling,

963
02:02:49,446 --> 02:02:52,074
you weak little speck
of human trash.

964
02:02:59,081 --> 02:03:01,833
All right. I'll go!

965
02:03:03,585 --> 02:03:06,338
- You just watch me go!
- Hit it.

966
02:03:32,447 --> 02:03:33,657
Hit it again!

967
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,158
We can't, sir.
There's no power.

968
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,536
Some kind of
counter-electromagnetic field.

969
02:03:42,666 --> 02:03:45,127
Move in and assault
the target. Move in!

970
02:03:45,335 --> 02:03:47,879
Move, move, move!

971
02:04:37,262 --> 02:04:40,223
Sir, I've located them
on radar. Pear Lake.

972
02:04:40,265 --> 02:04:42,225
Call up the task force.

973
02:04:49,691 --> 02:04:50,776
Yes.

974
02:05:56,383 --> 02:05:58,510
That's right. Keep fighting.

975
02:05:59,803 --> 02:06:03,098
The more you fight,
the more of you I take.

976
02:06:11,982 --> 02:06:15,902
Strange. We're reading a
phenomenal drop in temperatures there.

977
02:06:16,445 --> 02:06:18,864
Simultaneous
radiological activity.

978
02:06:18,947 --> 02:06:21,783
They're absorbing
all the ambient energy.

979
02:06:29,458 --> 02:06:31,001
<i>Relax.</i>

980
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:34,838
<i>Sleep now, Bruce,
and forget forever.</i>

981
02:06:35,672 --> 02:06:40,302
<i>Struggle no more
and give me all of your power.</i>

982
02:06:42,262 --> 02:06:45,348
<i>You think you can
live with it? Take it!</i>

983
02:06:46,516 --> 02:06:48,643
Take it all!

984
02:06:52,397 --> 02:06:55,025
Oh, yes! Yes!

985
02:07:08,747 --> 02:07:10,248
Take it back!

986
02:07:12,417 --> 02:07:15,045
It's not stopping!

987
02:07:15,879 --> 02:07:18,131
Take it back!

988
02:07:34,481 --> 02:07:36,900
Gentlemen, release.

989
02:07:45,075 --> 02:07:46,743
<i>Gamma charge away.</i>

990
02:08:11,935 --> 02:08:13,436
Sweet dreams.

991
02:09:07,407 --> 02:09:09,701
<i>- Hello?
- Betty, is that you?</i>

992
02:09:09,784 --> 02:09:12,454
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- I'm glad I caught you.</i>

993
02:09:12,829 --> 02:09:15,081
<i>- I'm glad you called.
- Thanks.</i>

994
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:21,004
Look, Betty, you and I...

995
02:09:22,172 --> 02:09:26,176
Well, we both know that Bruce
couldn't have survived that blast.

996
02:09:26,843 --> 02:09:29,346
<i>But... Well, you know...</i>

997
02:09:31,306 --> 02:09:33,850
- What is it?
<i>- Well, you know.</i>

998
02:09:33,892 --> 02:09:37,145
The usual loonies,
seein' things.

999
02:09:37,562 --> 02:09:39,522
Only now everything's green.

1000
02:09:41,191 --> 02:09:42,400
Right.

1001
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:44,778
Look...

1002
02:09:46,237 --> 02:09:48,865
If by some chance
he did survive,

1003
02:09:50,033 --> 02:09:53,745
and he should try to contact
you, try to get in touch,

1004
02:09:55,246 --> 02:09:57,415
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

1005
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:01,044
No, I wouldn't.

1006
02:10:02,545 --> 02:10:05,757
But you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.

1007
02:10:06,007 --> 02:10:09,302
I mean, my phones are bugged,
my computer's tapped.

1008
02:10:09,386 --> 02:10:11,304
I'm under surveillance.

1009
02:10:13,974 --> 02:10:15,892
I'll tell you, though,

1010
02:10:16,559 --> 02:10:18,395
that if he were alive,

1011
02:10:18,478 --> 02:10:21,690
I'm the last person
I would want him to come to

1012
02:10:21,773 --> 02:10:25,819
because as much as
I miss him, I...

1013
02:10:27,946 --> 02:10:29,990
I loved him. I...

1014
02:10:33,034 --> 02:10:34,160
<i>Yeah.</i>

1015
02:10:37,497 --> 02:10:39,165
I'm sorry, Betty.

1016
02:10:41,084 --> 02:10:42,585
I am so sorry.

1017
02:10:45,922 --> 02:10:47,465
I know you are.
