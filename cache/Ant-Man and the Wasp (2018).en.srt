Oh, Cassie.

163
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:58,342
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

164
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,212
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

165

Well, think of it this way.

Your school has rules, right?

167
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:05,722
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

168
00:08:05,724 --> 00:08:07,726
Well, your daddy went to Germany

169
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,830
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

170
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:12,471
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

171
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:14,541
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

172
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:16,678
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

173
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,916
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

174
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:20,786
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

175
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:23,424
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

176
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:25,328
followed by three years
of probation.

177
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,301
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

178
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:30,573
or contact with any
former associates who were...

179
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:33,779

in violation of said Accords.

180

181
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,586

of time before we get 'em.

189

violated the Accords, too.

190

And associating with them
breaks your deal.

we were building this.

be down there.

It's called a hypothesis.

Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

when you were down there,

you may have entangled with her.

And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

That's me. I'm sorry.

Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:14,786
"Cassie, 911."

00:48:14,788 --> 00:48:17,089
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

00:48:17,091 --> 00:48:18,493
No, that's not happening.

978
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,563
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

You're not making

No, I can't do that right now.

Ava, I want to help you.

1001

She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

Oh, really? How?

1003
00:49:01,513 --> 00:49:03,149
Janet.

1004
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:04,417
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

1005
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:05,553
absorbing quantum energy.

1006
00:49:05,555 --> 00:49:07,290
We can extract that energy.

1007
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:09,393
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

1008
00:49:09,395 --> 00:49:10,562
Extract it?

1009

- Yes.
- Are you insane?

1010
00:49:11,634 --> 00:49:13,569
That would rip Janet apart.

You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

When Janet's location

1013
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:19,248
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

to the FBI.

the entire system.

Look, we'll adjust the relays

while you go reprogram

with all this time

1053
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:53,500
to prepare I'd be more ready.

1054

Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

1055

It kind of melts your mind.

different person?

Yeah, like, uh,

I'm serious, Scott.

about me?

Good news, gentlemen.

the hard work for us.

- Can you knock?

00:58:53,759 --> 00:58:56,230
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

let us know if you get anything

1290
00:59:14,835 --> 00:59:16,002
that could be
a part of her message.

Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1299

No.

could it be?

how much time I have.

01:00:12,482 --> 01:00:13,685
I need to fix the algorithm.

1310
01:00:15,922 --> 01:00:18,192
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1311
01:00:18,194 --> 01:00:19,864
I've thought about it a lot.

1312

1316
01:00:37,732 --> 01:00:39,132
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1317
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:41,272
It's all so rushed.

1318
01:00:41,274 --> 01:00:43,710
You two have done
such great work.

1319
01:00:43,712 --> 01:00:45,681
You just need a little...

1320
01:00:45,915 --> 01:00:47,218
nudge.

1321
01:01:02,616 --> 01:01:04,920
HANK: Janet,
how is this possible?

1322
01:01:06,658 --> 01:01:08,158
It wasn't a message you put

1323
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,661
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1324
01:01:09,663 --> 01:01:11,665
Clever girl.

1325
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:13,870
- I'm so proud of you.
- (CHUCKLES)

1326
01:01:13,872 --> 01:01:15,741
Honey, tell us where you are.

1327
01:01:15,743 --> 01:01:17,710
Tell us how to find you.

1328
01:01:17,712 --> 01:01:19,714
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1329
01:01:19,716 --> 01:01:21,016
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1330
01:01:21,018 --> 01:01:22,254
You have to follow my voice.

1331
01:01:22,857 --> 01:01:24,123
Of course!

1332
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:25,795
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

using subatomic frequencies...

01:01:34,245 --> 01:01:36,649
between point two
and point nine.

1335
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,351
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1336
01:01:38,353 --> 01:01:39,654
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1337
01:01:39,656 --> 01:01:41,026
Look at us squabbling again.

1338
01:01:42,194 --> 01:01:45,065
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1339
01:01:45,067 --> 01:01:48,172
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

HOPE: (LAUGHS)
We got it!

1345
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:13,054
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1346
01:02:13,056 --> 01:02:15,725
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1347
01:02:15,727 --> 01:02:16,960
It's very dangerous,

1348
01:02:16,962 --> 01:02:19,167
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1349

Time and space work very
differently down here.

1350

You have two hours.

1351
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,212
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1352
01:02:25,214 --> 01:02:26,281
and it'll be another century

1353
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:27,917
before they align
like this again.

I know you will, Jellybean.

1356
01:02:43,183 --> 01:02:44,984
Nope.

1357

Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

How did we get up here?

1360
01:02:56,442 --> 01:02:58,277
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1361

and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1362
01:02:59,482 --> 01:03:02,252
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

get it out. You know?

To shrink that wall.

1525
01:10:21,729 --> 01:10:22,896
It looks load-bearing.

1526
01:10:22,898 --> 01:10:24,065
The ceiling could collapse.

Then we run like hell.

1528

Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

After we lost it
the first time...

1566
01:12:16,456 --> 01:12:19,427
I put on a new tracker...

1567
01:12:19,429 --> 01:12:21,099
of sorts.

1568
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:31,352

could be very dangerous.

have not used the tunnel yet.

and we lose her.

a lot to do before then.

"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

1583
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:34,176
So, we should do that.

1584
01:13:34,178 --> 01:13:36,449
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1585
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:39,087
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1586
01:13:39,089 --> 01:13:41,391
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1587
01:13:41,393 --> 01:13:43,795
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

1588
01:13:43,797 --> 01:13:45,499
Let's call it 2-A.

1589

Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1590
01:13:47,203 --> 01:13:48,571
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1591
01:13:48,573 --> 01:13:50,109
is fully grown
for you to come back.

1592
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:50,810
Otherwise, we're screwed.

You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

I'm going to dive.

I had my name
