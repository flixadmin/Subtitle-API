1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:05,204
Jackie chan, it was
nice knowing you.

2
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:06,739
Gorilla fist!

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,009
Horse kick!

4
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,610
Weasel strike!

5
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,879
Otter slap! Huh?

6
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,381
Perhaps you should
save it

7
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,816
for the real
Jackie chan.

8
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,952
Towel off and grab
your shoes, hak foo.

9
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:23,622
I have located
the next oni mask.

10
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,825
I shall wear it proudly,
master tarakudo,

11
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,560
and with its magic,

12
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:32,097
summon vast armies
of shadowkhan!

13
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,200
Oh, incidentally...

14
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,604
Floating head
annihilates
punching bag!

15
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,963
Jackie! Scruffy hates
puppy prison.

16
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,499
How long do we have to
keep tormenting him
this way?

17
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,502
Jade, scruffy must
attend obedience school

18
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,637
until he learns
to listen.

19
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,407
No doubt he takes
after his master.

20
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,175
Har har.

21
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,712
Look, I can prove
scruffy obeys
all my commands.

22
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,582
You ready, boy?
Play dead!

23
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:57,749
Whoa!

24
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,926
Heh! "Dead"
needs work,

25
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,995
but he has
the "play"
part down.

26
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,865
Uncle: It is
your move, tohru.

27
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,369
Hmm. No.

28
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,705
Huh!

29
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,073
Who's winning?

30
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,343
Jade, the Hana fuda
cards are no game.

31
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:25,944
Huh! Huh!

32
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,647
We are attempting
to make cards reveal

33
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,483
location of
next oni mask

34
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,052
before forces of
darkness find it.

35
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,787
(Scruffy sniffing)

36
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,926
Aiya! No animals
in shop! Shoo, shoo!

37
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,996
Uh, 52 pickup
is no game?

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,735
Whoa!

39
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:53,639
Ohh! It is
the next mask
we seek.

40
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:57,009
Jackie: And this card
shows us where to find it.

41
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,678
Right here
in San Francisco?

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,382
And it looks like
the mask removal
spell ingredient

43
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,150
is Japanese rice!

44
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,585
Tohru, boil rice!

45
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,353
Jackie, find mask.

46
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,122
Jade, read sign.

47
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,290
Sign?

48
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,992
The one
in shop window.

49
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,296
No pets allowed!

50
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,832
(Banging on door)

51
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,803
Mordecai!

52
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,709
Howdy, y'all.

53
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,711
Egbert!

54
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,613
Farmer MacDonald?

55
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,483
Did you not see sign
in uncle's window?

56
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,319
The one that says,
"stop on by

57
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,820
"if you're ever
in this neck of the woods

58
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,022
for a big city
tractor pull"?

59
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,225
Uh, farmer MacDonald,

60
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,960
we were just in
the middle of--

61
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,494
well, deal us in!

62
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,496
Mordecai and egbert
haven't had

63
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,833
much real fun since
y'all left my farm.

64
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,268
If you ask me,

65
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,739
they miss them crazy
magic powers they had.

66
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,784
You mean, heat-beam eyes
and levitation?

67
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,086
Float like a butterfly,

68
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,855
sting like a...
Hot-eyed pig.

69
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,590
Please,
farmer MacDonald,

70
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,693
Jade is very
impressionable.

71
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,795
Jackie!

72
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:27,232
Right, unc. Time to
play find that mask.

73
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,235
Say, y'all don't
mind if we bunk
here, do you?

74
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,238
Aiya!

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,942
Well, strap on
my feed bag!

76
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,443
What's for
supper?

77
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,113
Uncle was thinking
pork or chicken.

78
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,648
Oh! Heh heh heh!

79
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,983
Jade, why don't
you stay here

80
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,819
and help uncle find
farmer MacDonald
and his friends

81
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,856
more...Appropriate
lodgings.

82
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,724
Ohh!

83
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,832
(Growling)

84
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,335
Aah! Ohh!

85
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,405
Huh?

86
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,608
Wrong museum, Jackie.

87
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,277
The mask is Japanese,
not Jurassic.

88
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,546
Jade! I thought
I told you

89
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,616
to help farmer MacDonald
find a place to stay.

90
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,551
Tsk! Did!

91
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,786
(Squawking)
(Alarm)

92
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,587
Hey, there he is!
Hey, where's he going?

93
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,456
Hey, pig!
Come here, pig!

94
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,590
He's up there!

95
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,126
Fancy supersecret
underground base

96
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,995
you got here,
captain.

97
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,733
So where do you keep
the flying saucers?

98
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:41,873
Jade! Section 13
is not a hotel.

99
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,844
And ancient artifacts
are not doggie treats!

100
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,280
Scruffy, heel!

101
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,151
Heh!
He thought I meant
"dinosaur heel."

102
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:01,226
Jade, the card is
leading me to...

103
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,864
Jackie...

104
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,103
Unh!

105
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,838
Ohh! The oni mask!

106
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,975
I always said
scruffy was
part bloodhound.

107
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,510
They didn't teach
you that

108
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,612
at obedience school,
did they?

109
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,514
Did they,
you good boy?

110
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,283
Jade, we had better
leave before--

111
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:28,153
grr! T-Rex
decapitates dodo!

112
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,588
Go, go, go!

113
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,029
Give me the mask,
chan.

114
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,264
Uh-uh-uh!

115
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,334
Only if you promise
never to wear it.

116
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,269
Then suffer
extinction!

117
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,612
Jackie, I'm open!

118
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,814
He so never
obeys me, either.

119
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,785
Tarakudo Rex,

120
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,454
king of the shadowkhan!

121
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,156
Jackie, heads up!

122
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,959
Waah!

123
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,796
Lobster claw
pinches mask!

124
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,231
Hak foo,
show me a face

125
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,967
only a demon's
mother could love.

126
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,403
At last! Unh!

127
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,308
Check it out!
Scruffy's
totally helping.

128
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,377
No, he is
totally playing!

129
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,215
Ugg!

130
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,351
Unh!

131
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,953
Oof!

132
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,488
Hyah!
- Argh!

133
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,957
Jackie, go wide!

134
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,125
Drat!

135
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,564
Nice catch!

136
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,499
That is not a frisbee!

137
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,475
Not exactly who
I had in mind.

138
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:58,143
(Growls)

139
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,979
Um...Bad doggie?

140
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,120
Scruffy?

141
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,223
Tiger tears mask
off pooch!

142
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,095
Friendly reminder,
<i>muscles,</i>

143
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,997
the only thing
that can separate

144
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,466
a mask from
its wearer is--

145
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,768
blecch--good magic.

146
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,172
Now go enjoy
a protein shake.

147
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,641
Waah!

148
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,811
Here, boy!

149
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,714
Jade! Scruffy
could be dangerous.

150
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,849
Tsk! My dog loves me.

151
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,885
don't you,
scruffy-wuffy?

152
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,490
Huh?

153
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,325
Scruffy!

154
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,633
Oh, no.

155
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,036
Aah!
- Jackie!

156
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,810
Scruffy, stay!
Please?

157
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,012
Jackie!

158
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,648
Seems it's time
to walk the dog.

159
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,383
(Jackie groans)

160
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,219
Jackie,
are you all right?

161
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,354
(Moans)
No broken bones.

162
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,490
Come on!
We have to
find scruffy.

163
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:21,893
Before tarakudo
teaches him
any new tricks.

164
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,362
Both: Like
summoning shadowkhan!

165
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,165
Chan to section 13,

166
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,900
requesting
transport for Jade.

167
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,035

I'm sure egbert
and mordecai

just loped on down

171
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,981
to that silo you
mentioned for some grub.

172
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:47,552
It's a missile silo,
not a grain silo.

173

Scruffy's all

you guys miss the magic.

Motion for
a motionless moose!

Duh-huh!

Whoa.

Talismans.

184

They do a body good.

That is the largest

I must be on
the right track.

191
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,651
Well, doggie park
certainly has been
invigorating.

192
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,152
But it's time
you answered

193
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,254
a different
call of nature.

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,034
Scruffy?

198
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,870
don't you think
he looks more
like a spike?

199
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,906
Spike,

This is your team,

A child, a ham,
a stuffed moose?

Ha ha ha!

209

And a flying
chicken?

And growing worse.

Soon the mask

making doggie

Not if I pull it
off him.

Even your biceps
don't possess
enough strength

to remove
a demon mask
from its wearer.

Duh.

240

I just hope your
barnyard buddies

haven't
wandered into any
highly sensitive

quarantined areas.

265

Well, instead
of frettin',

why not try cluckin'?

Talk to the animals,

His transformation
is nearly complete,

00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,911
which I shall
demonstrate with
a little obedience test.

284

He does

334
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,891
Hey, Jackie,

335
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,093
if you could be a dinosaur,
which kind would you be?

336
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,695
If I were a dinosaur,

337
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,530
I would be
a brontosaurus,

338
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:36,400
because big,
but only eat vegetable.

339
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,802
Nobody can touch him.

340
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,537
Even the t-Rex.

341
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,038
The t-Rex, too violent.

342
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,373
And...Yeah.

343
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,176
I want to be
a brontosaurus.
Ah, difficult!
