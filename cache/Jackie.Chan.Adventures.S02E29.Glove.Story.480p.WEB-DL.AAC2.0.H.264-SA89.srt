1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:05,804
"X" marks the spot...

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:09,742
The spot where
Angus mckutcheon
finally gets his...

3
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:12,878
The legendary
treasure of
greenbeard the pirate.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,013
Haggis!

5
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,481
Aye, that's me.

6
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,915
Take us in.

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,524
20 years! 20 years
I've searched.

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,292
And now that I've
found it,

9
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,128
I'll be filthy rich!

10
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,602
Unh! Ahoy?

11
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,771
Get your mitts
off my Booty!

12
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,340
Uh, excuse me?

13
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,583
(Growls)

14
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,844
Hello. My name
is Jackie.

15
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,616
The only one gettin'
rich off this treasure
is mckutcheon!

16
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,884
What about haggis?

17
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,352
Ah, shut it!

18
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,658
I'm sorry, but this find
belongs to the museum.

19
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,195
Your name is
"the museum"?

20
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:14,099
Uh, no, the historical
museum of San Francisco.

21
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,703
I'm donating
greenbeard's treasure,
not getting rich.

22
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,505
Ah, shut it!

23
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,474
And, uh, since
I did find it first...

24
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,346
Would you like
these instead?

25
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,281
Haggis! Sic!

26
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,850
(Yelling)

27
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,162
I'll cleave you like
an aberdeen ham,
you wee piglet!

28
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,496
Unh! Uhh!

29
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,895
(Laughs evilly)

30
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,601
Mine! All--

31
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,103
sorry.

32
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,577
How did they get there?

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,515
Let me be
perfectly clear.

34
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,784
I don't want
the gloves!

35
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:40,118
Unh! Uhh!

36
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,689
(Groaning)

37
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,797
Whoa!

38
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,833
I knew you
were a pushover.

39
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,001
Waah!

40
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,941
(Coughing)

41
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,743
Haggis! Get him!

42
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,578
Haggis: Oh, haggis has him.

43
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,846
(Gasps)

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,935
Haggis! No!

45
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,577
Haggis!

46
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,815
I promise to call
the coast guard.
Bye-bye.

47
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,187
Curator:
Excellent work, Jackie.

48
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,189
"The glorious gold of
greenbeard's treasure"

49
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,759
will be my most elegant
exhibit ever.

50
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,727
I'm glad
you're so--huh?

51
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,031
How did they
get there?

52
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,367
Well, they shan't
remain there,
I can tell you.

53
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,369
My exhibit is
greenbeard's treasure,

54
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,405
not greenbeard's gloves.

55
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,109
Hmm.

56
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,324
Jade: Uncle!

57
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,492
Tohru! Hello?!

58
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,195
The game never ends
if nobody moves.

59
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,298
How can tohru
contemplate a move
with you yelling, Jade?

60
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,334
I thought it was
your move, sensei.

61
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:36,468
Ugh.

62
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,971
Jackie!

63
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,073
Unh!

64
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,342
Are these from
greenbeard's ship?

65
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,310
Can I keep 'em? Please?!

66
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,012
I've been reading
all about greenbeard.

67
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,281
You've been reading?
For pleasure?

68
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:52,718
Tch. Not like
there's anything else
to do around here.

69
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,788
"The meanest pirate
of them all,

70
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,125
greenbeard swore
he would keep
stealing forever,

71
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,960
even after he died."

72
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:05,397
Arr!
How cool was he?

73
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,533
There is nothing cool
about stealing, Jade.

74
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,735
(Whiny)
Ohh.

75
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,536
Crime does not pay.

76
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,474
If captain black
had not pulled strings

77
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,209
after I left
the dark hand,

78
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,277
I would be in prison
right now.

79
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,549
Instead, he lives
under the supervision
of his parole officer.

80
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,018
So tohru is free--
ai-yah--

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,155
to lose as many games
of mah-jongg as he likes!

82
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,225
(Sighs)

83
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,659
Thank you, Jade.

84
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,228
No. Thank you, Jackie.

85
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,096
Uncle can sell these.

86
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,736
(Snoring)

87
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,381
(Knock on door)

88
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,451
Uncle: Welcome
to uncle's rare finds.

89
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,986
How may I
help you?

90
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,021
Had a break-in
on this block
last night.

91
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,992
We're checking alibis
on all prior <i> offenders</i>
in the area.

92
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,061
Uncle: Tohru
was here all night.

93
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,163
He is good now.
You may go.

94
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,234
(Gasps)

95
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,706
Officer: You have
the right to remain silent.

96
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,609
Anything you say can
and will be used against
you in a court of law.

97
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,246
Tohru, what have you done?

98
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,721
Tohru: Please
believe me, sensei.

99
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,788
I did not--

100
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,624
(chanting chi spell)

101
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,633
So, do you think--
could you please

102
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,501
pull a few more strings?

103
00:08:56,503 --> 00:09:00,071
I want to, Jackie,
but my hands are
tied this time.

104
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,441
I really thought
tohru had left
his past behind.

105
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,809
So did I.

106
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:08,113
But the sad truth
is some people
never change.

107
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,815
Well, thank you,
anyway, captain black.

108
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,552
Wait! Call him back!

109
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,554
What if tohru was framed?!

110
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,623
There were
no evil spirits
in tohru's body.

111
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,125
If the forces
of darkness

112
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,627
did not reawaken
his criminal side,

113
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,896
I am to blame.

114
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,799
I did not provide
enough discipline!

115
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,401
We can't give up yet.

116
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,903
Tohru's innocent until
proven guilty, right?

117
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,905
(Groans)

118
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,908
We are all upset
about tohru, uncle.

119
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,077
Of course
I am upset!

120
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,679
Tohru had work
to do!

121
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,248
Now you must
move all these
antiques!

122
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,752
(Gulps)

123
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,955
(Groans)

124
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,293
(Sighs) Tohru never
used to groan like that.

125
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,629
Ow! What was that for?

126
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,197
Discipline!

127
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,234
I was too soft
on my old shopkeeper
and look what happened.

128
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,403
He became a criminal!

129
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,572
(Sighs)

130
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,076
(Groans)

131
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,618
Ohh. Finished.

132
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,757
Tohru never
used to get sore.

133
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,258
One more thing...

134
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,728
Lick this envelope.

135
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,329
(Yawns)

136
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,733
It's late, uncle.
Maybe we should just
spend the night.

137
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,035
It is very quiet
without tohru.

138
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,474
So, keep it down!
Uncle needs his rest.

139
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,548
(Snoring)

140
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,188
Uncle, I think
this bathtub has
spiders in it.

141
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,523
(Moaning)

142
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,328
Thank you.

143
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,797
Daah!

144
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,135
Diamonds?!

145
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,672
The gloves!

146
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,608
Stop! Thief!

147
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,776
Waah!

148
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,247
I told you
to keep it down!

149
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,784
Uncle! The gloves!
They're alive!

150
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,552
You are dreaming,
Jackie.

151
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:28,620
Go back to--

152
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,188
bwaah!

153
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,456
Ai-yah!

154
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,359
(Murmuring)

155
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,462
Hold still!

156
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,372
(Ticklish laughter)

157
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,773
Ohh! Stop!

158
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,677
Huh?

159
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:55,947
Ugh!

160
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,682
Daah!

161
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,087
Now can I keep 'em?

162
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,790
Greenbeard's life
of crime may be over,

163
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,826
but his gloves
are still stealing.

164
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,295
Tohru <i> was</i> framed,
sort of.

165
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,263
We must
tell the police.

166
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,104
Release tohru now!

167
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,974
Aren't you
the evil-spirits guy?

168
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,113
Tohru did not steal.
The gloves are to blame.

169
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,380
Jackie!

170
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,000
Maybe this
was a bad idea.

171
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,669
Get up! You do not
fool uncle!

172
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,906
Now, why don't
you folks just get
some rest, and we--

173
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,343
gloves are evil!
Tohru is innocent!
End of discussion!

174
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,014
Uncle, please
don't yell at
the nice policeman.

175
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,583
Jackie's right.
Let's just take
the gloves and...

176
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,786
(Gasps)

177
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,011
(Tohru struggles)

178
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,648
No! I do not want to...

179
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,121
What part
of evil gloves do
you not understand?

180
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,791
Tohru is innocent!

181
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:20,692
(Gasps)

182
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,630
One more thing--

183
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,831
we'll be right back.

184
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,266
Uncle: Aiy!

185
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,942
Tohru broke out of prison?
He is not innocent now!

186
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,714
Jackie: The museum!

187
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,250
He must be
after the treasure!

188
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:49,287
Tohru's not,
but the magic mittens
on his hands are.

189
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,622
Keep
the police busy.

190
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,892
We can't let them
see tohru.

191
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,794
Forgive
my earlier rudeness,
sergeant.

192
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,964
I wish to apologize
by telling you
my life story.

193
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,468
Doughnuts!

194
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,405
Whoa, hey!

195
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,973
Don't all crowd
around the window.

196
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,942
That's bad
for digestion.

197
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,346
Tohru!

198
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,615
Jackie! I cannot
control my...

199
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:30,828
And in the summertime,
mother would cook
big bowls of mung beans.

200
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,464
Heads up! There you go!
Who wants sprinkles?

201
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,866
Don't come
to the doughnuts.

202
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:37,168
The doughnuts
will come to you.

203
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,507
Uh-oh! Um, stay where you are!
I'll go get more!

204
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:47,979
We have to--gaah--
remove your gloves
from your hands!

205
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,347
Sorry.

206
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,581
Bwaah!

207
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,217
Most sorry.

208
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,322
Ha ha! Huh?

209
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,876
Uh-oh.

210
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,359
Why hasn't
the alarm gone off?

211
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,394
Perhaps they
disabled it.

212
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,000
Steal greenbeard's loot
from mckutcheon, will they?

213
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,669
Well, mckutcheon's
stealing it back!

214
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,070
The museum.

215
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,439
I know where we are,
you daft...

216
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,143
You!

217
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,845
Hello again.

218
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,413
You know them?

219
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,417
Whoa! Who's the old lady
with the mustache?

220
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,819
Haggis! Sic!

221
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,221
(Babbling)

222
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,497
Cool.

223
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,769
Nobody grabs
my Booty twice!

224
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,887
You're goin' extinct!

225
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,991
Unh!
- Bwaah!

226
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,259
Jackie!

227
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,831
(Babbling)

228
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,916
Aah! Me kilt!

229
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,418
Ohh! Eeh!

230
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,519
Oogah boogah!

231
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,688
That's caveman
for "we win."

232
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,623
Whoa!
Whoa!

233
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,792
Uh, guys?

234
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,495
Stop!

235
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,997
I don't think
the gloves
are listening.

236
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,371
Maybe they'll
listen to this!

237
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,107
Oh, gloves!

238
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,075
I'm stealing
your Jewel.

239
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,213
Both: Whoa!

240
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,351
Come and catch me!

241
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,153
Jade, what are you...

242
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,955
You want it? Fetch!

243
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,205
Good-bye, sticky fingers.

244
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,809
Yes, but now this
will be even more
difficult to explain.

245
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,113
Wait! I have not
told you about
fourth grade.

246
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,482
Please, just...

247
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,584
Hey! Freeze!

248
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,986
(Whistles)

249
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,625
Heh. It was
the gloves?

250
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,797
Guess we'll have
to kiss your Booty
good-bye.

251
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,332
Angus: Shut it!

252
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,335
And my people were
part of an undercover
sting operation

253
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,273
to catch these notorious
modern-day pirates.

254
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:39,677
Sorry about the mix-up.
Never would've guessed
you guys were agents.

255
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,013
Of course you're
all free to go.

256
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,681
(Sighs)

257
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,617
Thank you all
for helping to
clear my name.

258
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,353
We shall see
how thankful you are

259
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:53,824
after uncle trounces
you in another game
of mah-jongg!

260
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,028
Hey! Uncle's
frowning again.
That means he's happy.

261
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,198
Got it!

262
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,100
And section 13 did
locate the gloves,
right?

263
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,376
Huh?

264
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,153
Hey, Jackie.

265
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,155
Have you ever
been bullied?

266
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,891
When I very,
very young, yes.

267
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,793
When I don't like
being bullied,

268
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,461
I go to beat somebody.

269
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,163
Ok, what happen?
I win.

270
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,131
But one day,
I'm gonna lose.

271
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,334
After that,
after I get hurt,

272
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,936
somebody bullied me,
I just, "yes."

273
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:43,741
Why? Because
this guy get beaten
by somebody one day.

274
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,876
There's
so many tough guy
in the world.

275
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,778
They get
in trouble some day.

276
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,513
Don't try to be
a tough guy.
