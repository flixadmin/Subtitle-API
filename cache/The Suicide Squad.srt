10

Do it.

11
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:38,168
I got another 15.

12
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:40,883
Not today, you don't. You're up.

13
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:45,436
You know the deal.

14
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:48,767
Successfully complete the mission,
you get ten years off your sentence.

15
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:53,851
You fail to follow my orders in any way

16
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:57,772
and I detonate the explosive device
in the base of your skull.

17
00:01:57,949 --> 00:01:58,949
Good dog.

18
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:00,774
We are a black ops unit.

19
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:03,409
Meaning, nothing you see here
ever happened.

20
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,410
Savant.

21
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,901
Your commanding officer
will be Colonel Rick Flag.

22
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:08,907
Or would you rather be called Durlin?

23
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:10,871
I'd rather not be called at all.

24
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:14,546
But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

25
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:19,626
Well, welcome to "anything."

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,886
So this is the famous suicide squad.

27
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:28,518
Well, we consider
that term degrading.

28
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:30,849
The official term is "Task Force X."

29
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:32,309
And love 'em or hate 'em,

30
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:35,100
these are your brothers and sisters
for the next few days.

31
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:39,813
Oh!

32
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:41,867
Whoa.

33
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:57,588
Captain Boomerang.

34
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,216
Blackguard.

35
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:02,502
Mongal.

36
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,425
Javelin.

37
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,390
T.D.K.

38
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:09,809
Weasel.

39
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:13,388
And, of course...

40
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:16,149
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two.

41
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:17,726
Hmm, good to know.

42
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:19,651
Flag.

43
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,730
Oh, sorry. Comin' through.

44
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:22,772
Hey, Boomer.

45
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,467
What are you doing back
in prison, Harls?

46
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:26,484
I got road rage. In a bank.

47
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,787
Oh. So sorry. Comin' through.

48
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:31,198
- Turn it around. There. No.
- There? Here?

49
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:33,537
Put it in there.
Now you're safe.

50
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:34,542
All right.

51
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,203
Thanks, man.

52
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:39,464
Prepare for liftoff.
And away we go.

53
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,411
- Harley and T.D.K...
- Digger.

54
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:49,787
Have they worked
together before?

55
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,871
Not yet. I'm excited.

56
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:51,956
What does savant do again?

57
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,060
It's Brian Durlin.

58
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,643
He's an expert in weapons
and hand-to-hand combat.

59
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:58,098
Yeah, well, I'm putting 20 on
him that he's gonna bite it.

60
00:03:58,236 --> 00:03:59,567
Me too. And Weasel,

61
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:01,048
- Boomer and Mongal.
- Yeah, I think...

62
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,358
Is Mongal an alien
or some type of god?

63
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,239
- What are you doing?
- Oh. Hey.

64
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:06,387
Just making sure
everything was ready to go.

65
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:07,513
Good meeting, everybody.

66
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:09,277
Just our normal,
casual morning meeting.

67
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:10,808
Yeah, I just gotta, uh,
do this thing.

68
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:12,032
Nothing weird about it.

69
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,407
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

70
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:17,504
Flag.

71
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,108
Yeah, we're t-minus five
from the drop.

72
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,359
Get the whole team safely

73
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:21,589
to that beach, Colonel.

74
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,217
You will receive further orders
once there.

75
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,647
We're in a butcher's freezer, Harls,

76
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:45,063
surrounded by dead hogs
hangin' on hooks.

77
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,526
Only they don't know it yet.

78
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,942
Leave him alone, Boomer.

79
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,327
What does T.D.K. Stand for?

80
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:52,498
What?

81
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:55,115
Your name is T.D.K., correct?

82
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,460
Yeah.

83
00:04:56,544 --> 00:04:58,535
And it stands for what?

84
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:00,672
It stands for me.

85
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,007
It's what a name is.

86
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:03,797
Your name is letters?

87
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:06,300
All names are letters, dickhead.

88
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,265
I love your accent.

89
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,551
American women all love accents.

90
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,345
We do. 'Cause we don't got none.

91
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:21,603
Yo, is this a dog? “What?

92
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:23,898
Is this thing a dog?

93
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,187
- A... a dog?
- Yes.

94
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,607
What kind of dog
do you think it is, mate?

95
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:30,785
I don't know, I'm not familiar
with all the breeds.

96
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:32,573
I'm gonna go with Afghan hound.

97
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:34,783
Since when does an Afghan hound
have bloody thumbs?

98
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,823
Oh, my god, is it a werewolf?

99
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,521
I've wanted to meet a werewolf forever.

100
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,397
- Yo, they sat me next to a werewolf?
- That's not right.

101
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:42,912
Yo, let me out.
I do not fuck with werewolves.

102
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:45,339
Hey, hey, he's not a werewolf, okay!

103
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,841
He's a weasel. He's harmless.

104
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:49,252
I mean, he's not harmless,
he's killed 27 children,

105
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,547
but, you know, we got him to...
I think he's agreed to do this.

106
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:56,009
Whatever the case,
just everyone get into position to drop.

107
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:57,279
Did anyone check
on whether Weasel could swim?

108
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,075
The Weasel is dead! I repeat,

109
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:42,080
the Weasel is dead.

110
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,913
Northeast, all clear.
Approach the shore.

111
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:46,088
Over.

112
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,166
Savant, hold your position.

113
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,047
Roger that.

114
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:56,508
Amateurs.

115
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,435
Waller, we're
on the beach and dry.

116
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,176
- Blackguard. Get down, you...
- Hey, guys!

117
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,992
- There's fucking soldiers everywhere!
- Hey.

118
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,472
You can come out now, it's just me.

119
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:41,052
What the fuck is blackguard doin'?

120
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:42,763
I'm the one who contacted you.

121
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:44,581
Is this what's supposed to happen?
What the fuck?

122
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:46,125
Blackguard, get back into your position.

123
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,140
Look, look. I brought everybody, look.

124
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:49,932
They're right behind me.

125
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:52,109
Whoa. Hey.

126
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,020
Hey, guys. Whoa.

127
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,739
We got a deal, right? Uh... uh...

128
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,240
Waller, we're made.

129
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,947
I'm the one who called you.

130
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:07,499
Blackguard sold us out.

131
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:11,250
He contacted the fucking
Corto Maltese army!

132
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:13,460
Waller, we need to retreat.

133
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:15,218
Negative, Flag.

134
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:16,592
The mission is too important.

135
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:17,968
This is a tough group.

136
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:19,262
- You can make it.
- Okey-doke.

137
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:20,909
Waller, with all due respect,
we're in the middle

138
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,093
of a goddamn... Harley, wait!

139
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:23,516
\wwhoo-hoo!

140
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:05,758
Zero-two-two-seven is wide open.

141
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,269
Colonel, dispatch
the detachable kid.

142
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:10,267
T.D.K., two o'clock!

143
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:14,441
T.D.K. 1s "the detachable kid"?

144
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:35,875
What the fuck?

145
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,507
I didn't pick the damn team!

146
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:41,715
Don't worry, Flag, I got the bird.

147
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:44,760
Mongal! Don't.

148
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:49,219
Huh?

149
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,158
Strewth!

150
00:11:05,454 --> 00:11:06,534
Boomer!

151
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:38,396
Savant is off the rails.

152
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:40,482
Savant, turn back.

153
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:45,783
Savant.

154
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:50,871
Savant, I'm warning you,
this is desertion.

155
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:54,294
Savant!

156
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:56,828
This is your last chance.
Turn back around.

157
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,588
You are in violation of your agreement!

158
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,968
Oh, please! No.

159
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:09,389
Damn it.

160
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:25,824
How's team two holding up?

161
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,241
Team two, check.
Set point bravo.

162
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:35,203
All troops on the south beach
are engaged.

163
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:38,040
Team two is clear to go
on the north beach.

164
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:41,919
Congratulations, Bloodsport.

165
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,345
How'd you do it, Waller?

166
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,641
There's no soldiers out here

Here you go, champ.

199
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,327
I've been so long lonely
and it's getting me down

200
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:28,289
eExcuse me.

201
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:32,835
Who the fuck is Bloodsport?

202
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,296
Robert Dubois.

203
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:37,590
A world-class marksman.

204
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:40,430
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

205
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,060
His father was a mercenary

206
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:45,143
who trained his son to kill
from the moment he was born.

207
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:47,774
He's in prison for putting
Superman in the ICU

208
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:49,606
with a kryptonite bullet.

209
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:53,234
- Dubois?
- Same answer as the last time.

210
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:54,649
Piss off.

211
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:59,987
I'm not joining your
goddamn Suicide Squad.

212
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,201
We'll see.

213
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:03,999
You have a visitor.

214
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:20,390
They said you got in trouble.

215
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:22,601
I stole.

216
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:23,977
You stole what?

217
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,898
- A style watch.
- A star latch?

218
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:32,023
A style watch.
You can watch TV on it.

219
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:33,958
Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?

220
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,447
I don't know.

221
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:37,053
Next time you want
to Nick something,

222
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:38,157
you take a partner,

223
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:39,576
and they can be your lookout.

224
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:41,237
That's your advice?

225
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:42,707
Yeah.

226
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,331
- You're a terrible father.
- Hey,

227
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,062
I didn't ask to be a father
in the first place.

228
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:47,371
You make that perfectly clear.

229
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:48,953
Your mother sprung that one on me.

230
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:51,755
Well, she's not around anymore,
so you can lay off of her, okay?

231
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:53,082
Oh, I tried to lay off her,

232
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:54,897
but then she dragged out
the paternity test.

233
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:56,590
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

234
00:16:56,764 --> 00:17:01,014
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

235
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:02,101
Fuck you!

236
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,103
I can't believe you don't care
that I stole, only that I got caught!

237
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,709
I don't only care that you got caught,

238
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:08,893
I care that you got caught

239
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,817
for stealing something as stupid
as a fucking TV watch!

240
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:14,103
It does other things too!

241
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:16,863
But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do! It's embarrassing!

242
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:21,285
No, what's fucking embarrassing
is having you as my father.

243
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,961
Yeah, well, I told you, Tyla,

244
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:33,873
when I came here that
any goodness I ever had in me

245
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,425
had been wrung out bare by my old man.

246
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:38,836
And I also told you to go out there
and do your own thing

247
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:43,257
and stay far away
from me or anyone like me, didn't I?

248
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,593
So, why are you here
when you and I both know

249
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:48,308
I have nothing good to offer you?

250
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,350
Because my court date is coming up,

251
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,521
and Miss Waller said
maybe you could help me out.

252
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,940
To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission,

253
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:01,137
you're gonna send
my 14-year-old daughter to prison?

254
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:02,161
No.

255
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:05,704
Your daughter is 16, Dubois.

256
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,602
- You're a real father of the year.
- Fine.

257
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,104
You know what,
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

258
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:10,647
'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

259
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:12,536
So, a year in juvie, no fucking problem.

260
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:16,173
Not juvie.
Being 16 in the state of Louisiana

261
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:18,800
means that under
the right circumstances,

262
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:20,548
she could be tried as an adult.

263
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:22,181
And, if convicted,

264
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:25,224
could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

265
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,103
And in here, well, you never know
what might happen

266
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:30,433
to a frail young thing like that.

267
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:32,144
Shames me to say

268
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,649
that we have the highest mortality rate
in the entire U.S. prison system.

269
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:41,279
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

270
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,363
You're threatening my fucking daughter!

271
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:45,073
I'm protecting this country.

272
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:47,078
- Everyone stand down.
- Miss Waller, I...

273
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,157
Stand down!

274
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:55,792
I wouldn't take such extreme measures...

275
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:57,672
Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

276
00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,708
If this mission
weren't more important

277
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,168
than you could possibly imagine.

278
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:02,553
Fuck your mission.

279
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:04,403
You have the military
experience necessary,

280
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,848
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

281
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,539
you have what it takes to be a leader.

282
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:10,223
No, I'm no fucking leader!

283
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:11,762
Then I'll make you one.

284
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:18,770
Are you in or out?

285
00:19:22,993 --> 00:19:25,700
Good. Let's meet your team.

286
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:29,492
- Come on.
- Fuck me, man.

287
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:31,876
Let's go.

288
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,291
She was gonna kill his kid?

289
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:38,748
Each member
of the team is chosen

290
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:42,384
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

291
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:46,467
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

292
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:48,974
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

293
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:51,180
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

294
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:53,307
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

295
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:55,268
- Are you having a laugh?
- What?

296
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:57,170
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

297
00:19:57,194 --> 00:19:59,685
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

298
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:00,863
But better.

299
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:03,093
- I always hit my targets dead center.
- I hit them more in the center.

300
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:04,719
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

301
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:06,279
- I use smaller bullets.
- What?

302
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:08,973
They go inside your bullet holes
without even touching the side.

303
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,618
Next up is King Shark.

304
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:12,622
Holy shit.

305
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:14,454
What the fuck?

306
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:16,252
Some people claim

307
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:19,288
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

308
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:21,422
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

309
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:22,628
Does it talk?

310
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:25,385
- Book read.
- Wow.

311
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:26,658
Book's upside-down.

312
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:28,282
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

313
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:32,677
So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

314
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:33,855
Be a mite careful,

315
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:35,304
as he's developed a taste

316
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,889
- for human meat.
- Huh?

317
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:39,316
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

318
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,852
Ratcatcher 2.

319
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,653
Settle down!

320
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:44,741
Ooh.

321
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,344
What, we couldn't afford Ratcatcher 1?

322
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:48,609
- He's dead.
- This is his daughter.

323
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:50,573
Cazo, will you be joining us?

324
00:20:50,664 --> 00:20:52,655
I just woke up.

325
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,957
I don't function well
early in the morning.

326
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,417
My deepest apologies for disturbing you.

327
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:58,748
Hmm, it's all right.

328
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,830
Get your ass out here!

329
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:09,213
Millennials.

330
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:13,968
Oh, no way.

331
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:17,354
- That's not coming with us.
- She controls rats.

332
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:19,936
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

333
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,817
This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

334
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:26,776
I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

335
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,323
And finally, we have Abner Krill.

336
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:33,154
What's that 'round his neck?

337
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:36,331
A power dampener.
They call him the Polka-Dot Man.

338
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:38,534
Polka-Dot Man.

339
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:41,211
What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

340
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:43,966
He does.

341
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:46,083
He throws polka dots at people.

342
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:47,675
Hey, Polka-Dot Man,

343
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:50,258
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

344
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:52,639
You fucking pussy!

345
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:56,139
These are soldiers?

346
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:57,803
We need to debrief.

347
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:07,737
Fuck.

348
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,031
Corto Maltese

349
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:13,786
is a small island nation
off the coast of South America.

350
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:18,120
Over the past 100 years, the country
has been ruled with an iron fist

351
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,703
by the Herrera family.

352
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:24,167
But, a week ago, this guy,

353
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:27,925
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

354
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:30,211
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

355
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:33,218
took control
of the Corto Maltese government

356
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:35,758
in a violent military coup.

357
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:39,645
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

358
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:42,560
Although the United States

359
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:45,393
did not condone
the excesses of the Herrera regime,

360
00:22:45,487 --> 00:22:48,149
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

361
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:52,066
Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

362
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:53,863
So, you want us to kill Luna?

363
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:55,406
No.

364
00:22:56,164 --> 00:22:57,370
This is Jotunheim.

365
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:02,292
A scientific experimentation facility
containing something known only

366
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:04,874
as Project Starfish.

367
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:10,259
Our intelligence sources tell us that
Starfish is extraterrestrial in origin.

368
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:12,761
In the hands of the Luna regime,

369
00:23:12,931 --> 00:23:17,300
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

370
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:21,470
Your mission is to infiltrate Jotunheim

371
00:23:21,648 --> 00:23:25,311
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

372
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:26,725
How are we supposed to get in?

373
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,986
Gaius Grieves, The Thinker,

374
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:31,943
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

375
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:34,824
After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

376
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:37,953
known as La Gatita Amable.

377
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:40,910
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

378
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:43,416
and he can get you into Jotunheim.

379
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:46,002
Any questions?

380
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:48,789
What is that?

381
00:23:49,635 --> 00:23:51,796
That is an overhead projector.

382
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,301
Do you ever use it anymore?

383
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:54,803
No, not really.

384
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:56,759
So, why don't you just throw it away?

385
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:57,934
Peacemaker?

386
00:23:58,894 --> 00:24:01,636
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

387
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,553
Think there's any connection?

388
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:06,811
No.

389
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:08,688
No...

390
00:24:08,862 --> 00:24:09,862
Nanaue.

391
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,020
Connection.

392
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:12,108
Hand.

393
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:15,862
Yes, that is your hand, Nanaue,
very good.

394
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:20,370
We're all gonna die.

395
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,291
I hope so.

396
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,667
Oh, for fuck's sake.

397
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:51,317
Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

398
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:53,528
It's just a diversion, Bloodsport.

399
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:56,482
All right, we cut through the jungle
to get to Valle Del Mar.

400
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,446
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

401
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,655
That's the word.

402
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:02,408
How we getting in?
Especially with Charlie the tuna here.

403
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:03,982
How the hell am I supposed to know?

404
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:05,199
You're the leader.

405
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:06,617
You're supposed to be decisive.

406
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:09,454
And I've decided that you should eat
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

407
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:10,746
You're being facetious.

408
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:12,860
But if this whole beach
was completely covered in dicks,

409
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:14,362
and somebody said
I had to eat every dick

410
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:15,697
until the beach was clean for Liberty,

411
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:16,927
I would say no problemo.

412
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:20,006
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

413
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:22,662
- Who knows why madmen do what they do?
- Well, you know what I think?

414
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:25,098
I think Liberty is just your excuse
to do whatever you want.

415
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:29,106
Whether that's to eat
a beach full of dicks or killin' folk.

416
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,359
Oh, yeah?

417
00:25:34,197 --> 00:25:36,609
At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

418
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:38,318
Oh, here we go.

419
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:41,155
There's something wrong with your skin.

420
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:42,611
It's just a rash.

421
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:43,949
That's a rash?

422
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,679
Oh, no.

423
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:04,550
You...

424
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:07,432
Are the only one...

425
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:12,812
Fit to carry my javelin.

426
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,284
Carry it for...

427
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,175
Carry it for who?

428
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:48,810
For what? What the heck?

429
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,340
Who am I supposed to carry it for?

430
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:54,796
This is so frustratin'.

431
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,106
He just told me I have to carry
this javelin for a reason,

432
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,111
but he didn't say why!

433
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:04,944
Waller? Waller. Waller!

434
00:27:14,381 --> 00:27:16,087
All right, we'll camp here,

435
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:18,218
and tomorrow we'll go
straight through to the city

436
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,546
to get to La Gatita Amable by nightfall.

437
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,281
What?

438
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,556
How deep of a sleeper are you?

439
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,642
I was having the most wonderful dream.

440
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:59,378
If it was you about to be eaten
by King Shark, then you're psychic.

441
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:01,282
I don't believe
he would do that.

442
00:29:01,404 --> 00:29:03,486
He has very kind eyes.

443
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:09,075
Hungry.

444
00:29:09,412 --> 00:29:11,118
You bastard!

445
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,955
Uh...

446
00:29:25,971 --> 00:29:27,461
All right, calm down with the rats!

447
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,134
- What?
- I have a thing with rats.

448
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:32,219
- You have a thing with rats?
- Yes.

449
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:34,885
- And you're on a team with me?
- Not something I asked for!

450
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:38,793
What are you laughing at me for, man?
Why the fuck are you in your underwear?

451
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:40,182
Tighty-whities? Really?

452
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,879
- Now, that's just racist.
- No.

453
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:42,903
It's not racist.

454
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:45,274
- They're tighty-whities.
- Oh, come the fuck on.

455
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:47,780
Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

456
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,115
What?

457
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:51,318
You didn't tell me

458
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:53,404
you had a fear of rats, Dubois?

459
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:56,243
I'm an assassin!
Why would I share my liabilities?

460
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:58,749
For fuck's sake.

461
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:02,580
Aw. He's offering you a pretty leaf
to show you he means no harm.

462
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,077
Why the fuck would I want a leaf?

463
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:07,383
Just get the rats out of here!

464
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:16,226
- Onh, fuck's sake.
- Huh. Cool.

465
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:22,098
Hey, we gonna kill
megalodouche now, or what?

466
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:23,838
Nanaue's the strongest
member of your team.

467
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:25,898
You need him to get into Jotunheim.

468
00:30:26,072 --> 00:30:28,467
Yeah, well, we can't function as a team
if we gotta watch our back

469
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:30,857
from one of our own
eatin' our bollocks.

470
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:36,743
Nanaue, would you eat your friends?

471
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:40,037
I no friends.

472
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,494
You have no friends?

473
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:48,584
If you did, would you eat them?

474
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:50,047
Yes.

475
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:57,013
No?

476
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,978
Then, can we be your friends?

477
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,309
Come on.

478
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:03,849
He's obviously lying.

479
00:31:06,988 --> 00:31:09,479
If I die 'cause I gambled on love...

480
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:13,116
It will be a worthy death.

481
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:15,697
Friends.

482
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:25,582
You are a little idiot.

483
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:38,058
Oh, my god! Oh, my god.
I'm good at my job.

484
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:39,144
I found him.

485
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:40,597
Check it out.

486
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:43,100
Look, right here, a mile north.

487
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,269
Task Force X,

488
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,066
you have an additional
mission directive.

489
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:50,445
We've located Colonel Rick Flag.
He's been taken by the enemy.

490
00:31:50,615 --> 00:31:51,650
Rick Flag?

491
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:52,940
I know, you both served

492
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:55,734
on special forces in Qurac
that took down Avral Kaddam.

493
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:58,494
Flag was the one
who initially recommended you.

494
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:02,040
You had other operatives
in Corto Maltese and didn't tell us?

495
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:04,686
There was no tactical advantage.

496
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:06,244
Now there is.

497
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:09,165
I've uploaded the location on your mts.

498
00:32:09,342 --> 00:32:13,005
Terminate his captors
with extreme prejudice.

499
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:18,174
Kill anyone you see.
These are dangerous people.

500
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:21,935
Recover Flag
before moving on to the city.

501
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:27,724
That's where they're holding Flag.

502
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:30,063
Nothing like a bloodbath
to start the day.

503
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:32,353
They call you Peacemaker?

504
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:34,318
I cherish peace with all my heart.

505
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:37,780
I don't care how many men, women,
and children I need to kill to get it.

506
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:40,779
I thought
you were the crazy one.

507
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,622
I am.

508
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:44,248
All right.

509
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:45,666
Let's get it.

510
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:49,673
Boss.

511
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:51,383
Gracias.

512
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:06,680
No, no, no!

513
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:39,575
No, no, no!

514
00:35:04,183 --> 00:35:05,183
Hmm?

515
00:35:09,564 --> 00:35:10,564
Non-lethal.

516
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:11,815
You lose.

517
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:14,057
Exploding compression bullets.

518
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:19,400
No one likes a show-off.

519
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:22,156
Unless what they're showing off
is dope as fuck.

520
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:26,865
Fuck. That's true.

521
00:35:42,347 --> 00:35:44,178
He does throw polka dots at people.

522
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,181
I'm sorry it's so... flamboyant.

523
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:50,014
It looks cool. I think.

524
00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:53,646
I don't like to kill people, but if I
pretend they're my mom, it's easy.

525
00:35:53,816 --> 00:35:55,397
T.M.L., mate.

526
00:36:04,452 --> 00:36:05,452
Dubois?

527
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,485
Hey, Flag.

528
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:10,155
What the hell are you doing here?

529
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:13,374
Waller told us that you were...

530
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
Uh...

531
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:16,873
Are you drinkin' tea?

532
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,793
This is Sol Soria, she's the leader
of the freedom fighters,

533
00:36:19,884 --> 00:36:22,216
the resistance trying to
take down the current government.

534
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:23,923
They saved my life.

535
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:27,759
Oh, wow.

536
00:36:29,227 --> 00:36:31,809
Why did my people not alert me
of your arrival?

537
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:36,293
- We didn't see any people.
- Yeah, I didn't see anybody on the way.

538
00:36:36,317 --> 00:36:38,337
- There's no one out there.
- They were gone when we got here.

539
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:41,728
I turned them into my mother
in my head and killed them.

540
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,374
Typical Americans.
Just run in, guns blazing.

541
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:04,668
I know, it's just messed up.

542
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:07,633
- These guys, they're...
- What's this one do?

543
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:13,389
They're fucking idiots, but right now
our objectives align with yours.

544
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:17,226
If Jotunheim contains the technology
our intelligence says it does,

545
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:21,150
then it could be used on the people
of Corto Maltese as well as Americans.

546
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,318
That's why we need your help
to get into the city so we can stop 'em.

547
00:37:27,493 --> 00:37:29,700
Is that rat waving at me?

548
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,575
It appears it is.

549
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,244
Why?

550
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,663
I'm gonna guess because it's friendly.

551
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:47,130
Luna and Suarez
murdered my entire family.

552
00:37:48,723 --> 00:37:51,260
I'd make a deal with the devil
to stop them.

553
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:57,683
Your people will have our help
getting to Valle Del Mar

554
00:37:58,524 --> 00:38:02,142
to apprehend this Gaius Grieves.

555
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:18,627
Hey.

556
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:21,327
- What is this?
- You slaughtered my staff!

557
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:24,000
They were loyal to the Herreras.

558
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:26,461
Who are you loyal to, Thinker?

559
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:28,547
They call you "Thinker," yes?

560
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:32,425
All that shit in your face
is to make your brain good?

561
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,091
Yes, makes my brain good.

562
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:37,643
Are you being sarcastic with me?

563
00:38:38,898 --> 00:38:40,684
- Hey! Hey.
- I shall do to you

564
00:38:40,775 --> 00:38:42,640
- as we did to your employees.
- Hey. Mateo!

565
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,281
What is this?

566
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:54,952
Project Starfish.

567
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:57,488
It's been the primary focus
of my experiments here

568
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:00,374
for the past 30 years.

569
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:10,009
Here.
What... what is it doing here?

570
00:39:10,513 --> 00:39:12,003
On!

571
00:39:12,098 --> 00:39:14,180
It is having little babies.

572
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,341
Not progeny,

573
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:18,225
extensions of itself.

574
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:21,145
They take hosts,

575
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:24,978
and those hosts in turn
become part of the central being.

576
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:29,396
It feeds on their consciousnesses.

577
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:34,697
Grows larger, more powerful.

578
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:41,877
So...

579
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:47,462
Where is this Project Starfish now?

580
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:19,453
Marvelous idea, Presidente.

581
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:25,372
But as I've noted, I've been working
with the beast for 30 years.

582
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:30,001
And there's no one but me
capable of controlling it.

583
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:31,631
Well, then...

584
00:40:33,846 --> 00:40:35,256
Welcome to the team.

585
00:40:42,063 --> 00:40:43,063
Si, Camila.

586
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:44,834
Presidente.

587
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:51,485
You are making a big mistake

588
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:52,572
throwing me down here!

589
00:40:52,657 --> 00:40:54,022
I will be outta here soon enough

590
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,907
and I will kill every last one of you,

591
00:40:57,078 --> 00:41:00,991
Colto Maltese-tezios. Maltese-els.

592
00:41:01,165 --> 00:41:03,656
Malte-multoids. Colt-a-mults?

593
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:06,416
Whatever you Mario kart-racing
d-bags are called!

594
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:08,790
Please.

595
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:10,799
Put this on.

596
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:24,969
Oh, wow.

597
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:30,774
I'm a Princess.

598
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:54,840
Seforita Quinn,

599
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:56,467
on behalf of the entire staff

600
00:41:56,637 --> 00:42:00,175
of our honorable General
Presidente Silvio Eleuterio Luna,

601
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:01,509
it's a pleasure to serve you.

602
00:42:03,227 --> 00:42:04,262
Gracias.

603
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:10,432
My mother said to count back again.

604
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:11,974
Ten, nine,

605
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,310
eight, seven, six,

606
00:42:14,822 --> 00:42:16,733
five, four, three,

607
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:21,283
two, one. Ha!
Coronel, beat that...

608
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:28,835
Oh.

609
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:31,456
Forgive my appearance, senorita Quinn.

610
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:36,090
I have admired you from afar

611
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,880
for many years now.

612
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:40,170
Seaorita.

613
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:42,557
Me?

614
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:46,183
You're a hero to me,
as well as to my people.

615
00:42:46,353 --> 00:42:48,719
I think you might got me confused.

616
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:51,765
Harley Quinn's fire and rebellion
in the face of American oppression

617
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:53,978
is something to which
my entire country aspires.

618
00:42:54,278 --> 00:42:55,438
Oh.

619
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:56,898
I have prepared lunch.

620
00:42:58,741 --> 00:43:00,823
Would you be so kind as to join me?

621
00:43:02,453 --> 00:43:05,069
I'm so kind, sure.

You want me to what?

636
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:08,098
To marry me.

637
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:10,009
You're joshing.

638
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:12,352
Might I be frank, Harley?

639
00:44:13,107 --> 00:44:14,107
You might be.

640
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:17,816
Good, listen.

641
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:20,478
Since I took control,
the majority love me.

642
00:44:20,656 --> 00:44:23,864
But some find me to be

643
00:44:24,743 --> 00:44:26,608
an unacceptable leader.

644
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:29,661
What kinds of dicks
would find that?

645
00:44:29,915 --> 00:44:31,826
Don't they know how awesome you are?

646
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,281
Have you shown them the birdies?

647
00:44:33,305 --> 00:44:35,305
It may sound arcade,

648
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:36,629
to some of you from your part of the whole.

649
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,042
But my people, the Corto malteseans,

650
00:44:39,216 --> 00:44:42,549
- they're very old-fashioned.
- Corto malteseans, of course.

651
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,176
And I am a bachelor.

652
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,841
So they want you to get hitched?

653
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:49,223
My people say
you would make the perfect wife.

654
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:53,352
Because, you know,
you symbolize anti-American fervor.

655
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:55,763
Oh.

656
00:44:56,734 --> 00:44:58,850
But I am a romantic, Harley.

657
00:45:00,237 --> 00:45:02,694
I agreed to meet with you
just to appease them.

658
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:07,321
However, upon spending
the day with you,

659
00:45:08,412 --> 00:45:11,700
I find myself hardly able
to think straight.

660
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,288
- You are perfect in every...
- You are so freaking hot.

Harley Luna.

667
00:45:44,865 --> 00:45:46,446
I like the ring of that.

668
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:12,803
That's Jotunheim?

669
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:19,813
Nazis came here seeking asylum
after World War II.

670
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:26,483
They built Jotunheim to continue
their unorthodox experiments.

671
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:31,484
Until the Herrera family accepted
the bounty on the Nazis' heads

672
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,406
and killed them all.

673
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,580
Wowza.

674
00:46:34,707 --> 00:46:37,449
Many years ago,
the rumors began of a beast.

675
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,203
These dark rumors helped
the Herrera family maintain power.

676
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:45,839
They would send their political enemies
and their families to the fortress,

677
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,341
never to return.

678
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:51,512
I have recently learned...

679
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:54,260
These were not rumors.

680
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:56,596
They were murdering thousands

681
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:00,388
in bizarre experiments
with this creature.

682
00:47:01,734 --> 00:47:04,601
Well, it must be a big relief
to got it in your hands now, huh?

683
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:06,689
Absolutely.

684
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:11,444
Now, it is our enemies
who shall be fearful.

685
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:17,739
If anyone dares to say a negative word
about their new president today,

686
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:22,626
their parents, their children,
and anyone they ever loved

687
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:26,129
will be sent to Jotunheim
to feed the beast.

688
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:29,462
I'm sorry.

689
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:35,590
Recently, I made a promise to myself
that the next time I got a boyfriend,

690
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:38,555
I'd be on the lookout for red flags.
And if I saw any,

691
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:40,185
I would do the healthy thing

692
00:47:41,106 --> 00:47:42,437
and I would murder him.

693
00:47:45,027 --> 00:47:49,361
And killing kids?
Kind of a red flag.

694
00:47:50,991 --> 00:47:51,991
I know, I know.

695
00:47:52,076 --> 00:47:54,943
I know what you're tryin' to say.
"Harley, why not just leave?"

696
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,657
And I'd say, "why are you
screaming at me? I'm not deaf.

697
00:47:57,748 --> 00:47:59,079
I'm standing right here."

698
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,868
And then I'd say,

699
00:48:01,627 --> 00:48:05,040
"when your taste in men
is as bad as mine,

700
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:08,338
they don't just go away quietly.

701
00:48:08,509 --> 00:48:13,094
They slash your tires
and they kill your dogs and

702
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,922
tell you that the music you like
ain't real music at all."

703
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:18,469
And all the cruelty...

704
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:27,190
Tears you apart after a while.

705
00:48:39,873 --> 00:48:41,579
You were real pretty and all,

706
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:47,620
and R.I.P. to that absolutely beautiful
monster between your legs, but...

707
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:50,289
All in all...

708
00:48:52,136 --> 00:48:53,842
I think you're more pretty like this...

709
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:58,423
With all those rotten thoughts
emptied from your head.

710
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:03,184
I can't believe this thing had a bullet.

711
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:11,019
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

712
00:50:20,265 --> 00:50:22,381
Bring me the heads
of the suicide squad

713
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,305
What the hell are you doin'?

714
00:50:30,901 --> 00:50:33,483
We're tired, Colonel. We need a rest.

715
00:50:33,654 --> 00:50:35,315
Goddamn hobbyists.

716
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:36,861
We cannot stop.

717
00:50:37,032 --> 00:50:38,801
We need to hurry
if you're going to help my people.

718
00:50:38,825 --> 00:50:40,986
Hey. We're not here to help your people.

719
00:50:41,245 --> 00:50:42,985
But she's right, we gotta keep moving.

720
00:50:43,163 --> 00:50:45,370
I carry friend?

721
00:50:45,457 --> 00:50:47,698
It's okay, Nanaue.

722
00:50:50,504 --> 00:50:52,540
It's happening to his face again.

723
00:50:52,714 --> 00:50:54,204
- It's nothing, I slipped.
- Hey.

724
00:50:54,383 --> 00:50:57,375
Norman Bates, if that shit's contagious,
we need to know.

725
00:50:57,553 --> 00:50:59,418
It's not.

726
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,660
- What is it?
- It's a...

727
00:51:04,434 --> 00:51:06,470
It's an interdimensional virus.

728
00:51:08,564 --> 00:51:09,804
Fuck is that?

729
00:51:11,149 --> 00:51:13,185
My mother was a scientist
at s.T.A.R. Labs,

730
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,147
and she was obsessed with turning me
and my brothers and sisters

731
00:51:16,238 --> 00:51:17,819
into superheroes.

732
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:20,906
She infected me.

733
00:51:21,743 --> 00:51:24,576
Now, if I don't, you know,
expel the dots twice a day...

734
00:51:25,372 --> 00:51:26,612
Then what?

735
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:30,532
They'll eat me alive.

736
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,377
What happened to
your brothers and sisters?

737
00:51:36,508 --> 00:51:37,668
Some lived.

738
00:51:38,468 --> 00:51:39,468
Some...

739
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:42,847
Died.

740
00:51:43,724 --> 00:51:47,012
And your mom, where is she now?

741
00:51:51,523 --> 00:51:53,184
Everywhere.

742
00:52:00,532 --> 00:52:03,194
Okay. Let's move out.

743
00:52:03,368 --> 00:52:06,860
Come on, we must hurry,
or we'll be late to meet my contact.

Are you Milton?

751
00:53:22,864 --> 00:53:24,980
Si.

752
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:30,403
Milton will drive you through town

753
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,615
and to La Gatita Amable.

754
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,248
There are clothes in the boxes
for all of you so you can blend in.

755
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,042
That said, the walking fiburon

756
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:39,794
is gonna have to stay out of sight.

757
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:41,416
I wear disguise.

758
00:53:42,175 --> 00:53:44,962
Oh, you're going to wear a disguise.

759
00:53:45,137 --> 00:53:46,137
Si

760
00:53:46,221 --> 00:53:47,461
Hey, he's learnin' Spanish.

761
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:49,755
And what kind of disguise?

762
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:52,219
- Fake moustache.
- Oh.

763
00:53:52,394 --> 00:53:55,227
Yeah, fake moustache
isn't gonna cut it, mate.

764
00:53:59,443 --> 00:54:02,150
There's gonna be a lot of soldiers
watching Jotunheim.

765
00:54:02,988 --> 00:54:05,274
- If they discover us there...
- Let's pray they do not,

766
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:06,449
or you will all be dead.

767
00:54:06,616 --> 00:54:08,197
If they do,

768
00:54:08,368 --> 00:54:10,450
that'll leave the palace vulnerable.

769
00:54:12,122 --> 00:54:15,535
Luna and the other generals
will be left without protection.

770
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,632
You're a good man, Colonel Flag.

771
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:31,554
You still look exactly like yourself.

772
00:54:31,725 --> 00:54:33,565
That's the worst fake moustache
I've ever seen.

773
00:54:33,977 --> 00:54:35,857
And if you had fooled us,
we'd have to kill you,

774
00:54:36,021 --> 00:54:38,979
shark-shaped bloke with a moustache
creeping up on us like that.

775
00:54:39,065 --> 00:54:40,521
Fuck!

776
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:43,357
You, you.

777
00:54:47,616 --> 00:54:48,776
Aw.

778
00:54:48,867 --> 00:54:51,404
He always wants to be near you.

779
00:54:51,578 --> 00:54:53,193
I think he senses good in you.

780
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:55,202
Yeah, there's no good in me.

781
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:01,577
Damn.

782
00:55:01,755 --> 00:55:04,041
Supposed to play golf
with Senator Cray this weekend.

783
00:55:04,216 --> 00:55:06,296
I'm gonna look a fool.

784
00:55:06,426 --> 00:55:07,487
Waller, come in.

785
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:09,804
Ugh.

786
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:11,886
You missed.

787
00:55:11,973 --> 00:55:14,840
- Waller, do you copy?
- We're losing connection.

788
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:17,353
Waller.

789
00:55:19,731 --> 00:55:20,891
Fuck's sake.

790
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:22,681
Task Force X. “Waller.

791
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:23,894
You there?

792
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:25,896
The military must have put

793
00:55:26,071 --> 00:55:28,153
signal jammers around the city.

794
00:55:28,323 --> 00:55:30,939
Your comms are down,
but we can still activate the bombs,

795
00:55:31,117 --> 00:55:33,037
not to mention what will happen
to your daughter.

796
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:35,242
So, no funny business.

797
00:55:35,705 --> 00:55:36,785
Do you copy, Dubois?

798
00:55:37,374 --> 00:55:38,204
Copy.

799
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:40,115
Fuck youl!

800
00:55:41,086 --> 00:55:43,577
Hey, uh, all that stuff
about his daughter,

801
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:46,292
you wouldn't really do that, right?

802
00:55:46,466 --> 00:55:49,253
You don't know half
of what I would do, John.

803
00:56:09,698 --> 00:56:10,778
What?

804
00:56:11,741 --> 00:56:14,403
Why are you so afraid of rats?

805
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,538
Why are you so in love with them,
Ratcatcher 2?

806
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,081
You know what I think?

807
00:56:22,252 --> 00:56:24,789
I think you have a serious case
of daddy issues.

808
00:56:24,963 --> 00:56:28,421
I have no issues
with how much I loved my father.

809
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:39,383
Although he was a genius...

810
00:56:41,897 --> 00:56:45,685
We lived homeless in the streets
of Portugal 'cause of his...

811
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,935
Burdens.

812
00:56:52,532 --> 00:56:55,365
He built the machines I employ today...

813
00:56:56,786 --> 00:56:59,448
And taught me
the secrets of calling the rats.

814
00:57:03,543 --> 00:57:06,285
They brought us trinkets to live on.

815
00:57:07,255 --> 00:57:10,873
And they kept us warm at night,
when we would have frozen.

816
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:16,803
- But eventually...
- Papa.

817
00:57:16,973 --> 00:57:17,973
Papa, wake up.

818
00:57:18,058 --> 00:57:19,969
My father's burdens...

819
00:57:20,852 --> 00:57:23,059
Became too heavy to carry.

820
00:57:23,229 --> 00:57:24,594
No.

821
00:57:24,773 --> 00:57:25,603
No, papa.

822
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:29,107
- And he was gone.
- Papa, wake up.

823
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,857
I took his machinery
and came to America.

824
00:57:37,035 --> 00:57:38,650
That is the dream, right?

825
00:57:40,497 --> 00:57:41,828
But I was arrested

826
00:57:42,707 --> 00:57:45,198
for armed bank robbery,
do you believe it?

827
00:57:45,377 --> 00:57:47,789
The state considered the rats a weapon.

828
00:57:51,174 --> 00:57:52,380
What?

829
00:57:55,595 --> 00:57:57,631
You remind me of my daughter...

830
00:57:58,515 --> 00:58:00,301
The reason I'm here.

831
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,221
Why are you so afraid of rats?

832
00:58:05,146 --> 00:58:06,727
My old man.

833
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:09,480
When I was a lad,

834
00:58:09,734 --> 00:58:11,599
if I didn't finish a task right,

835
00:58:11,778 --> 00:58:13,894
he would dole out the punishment.

836
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:19,984
And one day, he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

837
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:24,363
And it was full of starvin' rats.

838
00:58:25,917 --> 00:58:28,624
As imperfect my father was...

839
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:34,456
He loved me.

840
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:39,635
I wish I could give that to you.

841
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:45,015
Don't you worry, yeah?

842
00:58:45,186 --> 00:58:47,723
I'm gonna get you out of here alive.

843
00:58:47,897 --> 00:58:50,730
I'm going to get you out of here alive.

844
00:58:58,033 --> 00:59:01,025
Seriores, this is the place.

845
00:59:25,268 --> 00:59:27,475
So, when's this Thinker guy
supposed to be here?

846
00:59:27,645 --> 00:59:29,085
Supposed to be
in the next few hours.

847
00:59:29,147 --> 00:59:30,499
Looks like we gotta find
something to do

848
00:59:30,523 --> 00:59:32,559
to pass the time. Uh, miss?

849
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,515
How about some, uh...

850
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:36,650
What do you guys drink
around here, fernet?

851
00:59:36,738 --> 00:59:38,090
How about a round of fernets
for the table.

852
00:59:38,114 --> 00:59:39,114
- Comprende?
- Si

853
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:42,236
hey, pissmaker, we're on a mission.

854
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:45,652
Easy, Inspector Gadget.
A little drink never hurt nobody.

855
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,286
Except for the thousands of people

856
00:59:47,373 --> 00:59:49,705
killed in drunk driving
accidents every year.

857
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:54,081
Come on, Dubois,
this could be our last drink.

858
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:56,250
Gracias.

859
00:59:56,424 --> 00:59:57,424
Just one.

860
00:59:57,675 --> 01:00:00,257
- You're gonna be that guy?
- I'm gonna be that guy.

861
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:02,544
Hey, chica.

862
01:00:03,598 --> 01:00:05,054
Forgot the rat.

863
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:11,970
Here's to being alive in three hours.

864
01:00:12,732 --> 01:00:15,144
I'll be alive. You speak for yourself.

865
01:00:27,497 --> 01:00:29,988
There you go, there you go.

866
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:32,532

So, smile.

877
01:02:23,488 --> 01:02:26,275
We're old mates who are gonna
take a trip to Jotunheim.

878
01:02:29,077 --> 01:02:30,077
Yup.

879
01:02:30,787 --> 01:02:34,780
Even with my help,
you think you can get into Jotunheim?

880
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,991
Well, if we can't,
I've got a great white out back

881
01:02:38,086 --> 01:02:39,246
that's looking for some chum.

882
01:02:39,295 --> 01:02:40,410
Now, come on.

883
01:02:43,091 --> 01:02:44,126
All right...

884
01:02:45,426 --> 01:02:46,916
Nice and easy.

885
01:02:52,517 --> 01:02:53,552
Oh, fuck.

886
01:03:13,538 --> 01:03:14,823
No, no, no!

887
01:03:22,505 --> 01:03:23,870
All right...

888
01:03:24,132 --> 01:03:25,526
Take him out
through the back, all right.

889
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:28,292
Find my coordinates in the pad
and meet me in half an hour.

890
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:30,460
- What?
- Hey, did you hear what I said?

891
01:03:30,638 --> 01:03:32,128
- Yes, but...
- Go.

892
01:03:33,516 --> 01:03:34,847
Let's go.

893
01:03:36,728 --> 01:03:39,561
Hey, calm down.

894
01:03:40,315 --> 01:03:42,035
There's no need to disturb
everyone's night.

895
01:03:42,191 --> 01:03:44,031
I'm right here,
I'm the one you're looking for.

896
01:03:44,068 --> 01:03:47,185
Yep, us too.
We're his American companions.

897
01:03:47,363 --> 01:03:48,398
What?

898
01:03:48,906 --> 01:03:50,692
Ow!

899
01:03:55,997 --> 01:03:59,114
- Come on. Go.

01:04:01,919 --> 01:04:03,125
Oh, god.

901
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:05,655
Move it!

902
01:04:07,342 --> 01:04:08,342
Come on!

903
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:09,801
Hey!

Your equipment manipulates
animal behavior, clever.

905
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:27,233
I'm working on something
similar with humans.

906
01:04:27,403 --> 01:04:29,109
Be quiet, please.

907
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,440
You are perceivably panicked.

908
01:04:30,615 --> 01:04:32,981
I'm guessing that you are not the alphas
of this battalion.

909
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:36,242
Do you want a dozen angry rodents
crawling up your ass?

910
01:04:37,163 --> 01:04:38,723
My answer might not be what you expect.

911
01:04:40,917 --> 01:04:42,157

But soon you will all be joining
your deranged compatriot, Harley Quinn.

916
01:05:04,565 --> 01:05:05,975
Is Harley alive?

917
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,606
Not for long.

918
01:05:07,777 --> 01:05:12,316

In Japan, it's kyusho jitsu.

In english, it's simply the death touch,

how to kill a man
with a single blow.

927
01:05:44,439 --> 01:05:48,352
Of course it's possible to kill a man
with a single blow.

928
01:05:50,236 --> 01:05:54,070
But it's a matter of chance,
and cannot be wielded with certainty.

Hola.

991
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:22,615
Um...

992
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,515
Ratatouille, what do you got?

993
01:14:45,354 --> 01:14:47,310
Third floor hallway's clear.

994
01:14:48,065 --> 01:14:49,145
Abner?

995
01:14:49,316 --> 01:14:51,932
There doesn't seem
to be any incoming traffic.

996
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,150
Bird.

997
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:57,604
Nanaue, stay off the comm.

998
01:15:01,578 --> 01:15:03,181
Colonel, I got a clean shot
on the only one in the office.

999
01:15:03,205 --> 01:15:04,695
Just give the word.

1000
01:15:13,173 --> 01:15:15,129
Fire on three,

1001
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,507
- two...
- What are you guys doing?

1002
01:15:18,554 --> 01:15:21,512
I... you.
We're here to save you.

1003
01:15:23,726 --> 01:15:26,183
You were gonna... save me?

1004
01:15:26,562 --> 01:15:28,894
It was a really good plan, too.

1005
01:15:29,356 --> 01:15:31,722
Well, I can go back inside,
and you can still do it.

1006
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,356
That's patronizing.

1007
01:15:34,236 --> 01:15:35,601
Yeah, no, it's not...

1008
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,526
Uh, what's with the javelin?

1009
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,110
I'm waitin' for god to tell me.

1010
01:15:41,326 --> 01:15:43,086
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

1011
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:45,869
Or him. Or any of them, really.

1012
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,120
Okay.

1013
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:48,990
Okay.

1014
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,730
Are you two all right, yeah?

1015
01:15:51,754 --> 01:15:53,064
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

1016
01:15:53,088 --> 01:15:53,918
Harley Quinn.

1017
01:15:54,089 --> 01:15:55,499
Bloodsport.

1018
01:16:00,429 --> 01:16:03,216
All right, who ate
all the fucking empanadas?

1019
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:05,881
Mine were very good. I had the chicken.

1020
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:08,305
All right...

1021
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:11,141
Here's the deal.
We fail the mission, you die.

1022
01:16:11,315 --> 01:16:14,523
We find out any information
you give us is false, you die.

1023
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:17,852
If we find out you have
personalized license plates, you die.

1024
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,065
What? No.

1025
01:16:19,089 --> 01:16:20,589
If you mismatch black, you die.

1026
01:16:20,613 --> 01:16:22,283
No.

1027
01:16:22,284 --> 01:16:24,070
If you cough
without covering your mouth...

1028
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:26,447
Harley. Those last three aren't things.

1029
01:16:26,622 --> 01:16:28,262
Although, probably
don't need to say this,

1030
01:16:28,373 --> 01:16:30,034
but that isn't
an open invitation for you

1031
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:31,269
to cough without covering your mouth.

1032
01:16:31,293 --> 01:16:33,146
All right, we're gonna need you
to drive the minibus,

1033
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:35,752
with all of us inside,
past the guards at the front gate.

1034
01:16:35,923 --> 01:16:38,610
Once through the gate, we'll use you
to get through the retinal scanner.

1035
01:16:38,634 --> 01:16:40,841
There are security cameras everywhere.

1036
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:42,626
They're being dealt with.

1037
01:16:53,398 --> 01:16:55,559
We'll neutralize the soldiers there
and enter.

1038
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:58,225
Once we're inside,
we separate into teams.

1039
01:16:58,403 --> 01:17:00,519
I am walking back and forth.

1040
01:17:00,697 --> 01:17:01,697
Okay.

1041
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,021
You're gonna lead me and Ratcatcher 2
to Project Starfish.

1042
01:17:04,076 --> 01:17:05,970
I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

1043
01:17:05,994 --> 01:17:07,347
No, no, no,
you're coming with me.

1044
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:09,908
Our munitions expertise are needed
to place the explosives,

1045
01:17:10,082 --> 01:17:13,540
starting at the first floor,
going all the way to the top.

1046
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,951
Once we're clear,
we blow the tits off that thing,

1047
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:17,415
and go home.

1048
01:17:18,715 --> 01:17:19,795
This is suicide.

1049
01:17:19,967 --> 01:17:21,798
Well, that's kind of our thing.

1050
01:17:22,553 --> 01:17:23,668
Yeah.

1051
01:17:30,227 --> 01:17:32,138

Okay, pokey.

You get a bomb,

1076
01:20:41,835 --> 01:20:42,835
you get a bomb.

1077

It's actually very nice.

1083
01:21:40,644 --> 01:21:42,350
Just put it against the wall.

1084
01:21:44,022 --> 01:21:45,387
It looks nothin' like me.

1085
01:21:45,565 --> 01:21:46,975
Move. Move it.

1086
01:21:49,986 --> 01:21:51,567
This way.

1087
01:22:11,758 --> 01:22:13,089
Si

1088
01:22:19,349 --> 01:22:21,635
Vamonos. Vamonos!

1089
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,095
Good god.

1090
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:06,760
If god existed,

1091
01:23:07,355 --> 01:23:09,971
wouldn't this be proof
that he wasn't good at all?

1092
01:23:10,775 --> 01:23:12,390
What the hell is this?

1093
01:23:12,569 --> 01:23:15,185
I thought you were looking
for Project Starfish.

1094
01:23:16,907 --> 01:23:19,148
You've brought us visitors,
have you, Grieves?

1095
01:23:19,326 --> 01:23:21,738
Have you come to save me
from that madman?

1096
01:23:21,912 --> 01:23:23,903
Thirty years he's kept me here.

1097
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,695
Tortured me.

1098
01:23:25,874 --> 01:23:28,866
Had his way with me.

1099
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:10,282
I call it Starro, The Conqueror.

1100
01:24:11,086 --> 01:24:12,792
That's meant to be derisive.

1101
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:14,919
Sorry, old chum.

1102
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:17,923
These two are here to kill you.
It's out of my hands.

1103
01:24:18,176 --> 01:24:19,882
We need to help these people.

1104
01:24:20,136 --> 01:24:23,503
Impossible, dear.
They're corpses below those stars.

1105
01:24:24,182 --> 01:24:25,422
Who are they?

1106
01:24:27,102 --> 01:24:29,559
The fodder of powerful men
through every age.

1107
01:24:29,729 --> 01:24:31,515
Dissidents,

1108
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:33,055
journalists,

1109
01:24:33,817 --> 01:24:35,478
political rivals,

1110
01:24:35,652 --> 01:24:38,143
and their loved ones.

1111
01:24:40,115 --> 01:24:41,730
Oh, please,

1112
01:24:41,754 --> 01:24:45,254
uncut your fucking pulse, Flag.

1113
01:24:45,328 --> 01:24:47,614
We serve the same master.

1114
01:24:47,789 --> 01:24:50,326
We were sent here to stop you.

1115
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,500
Child,

1116
01:24:51,626 --> 01:24:53,662
your government didn't send you here

1117
01:24:53,837 --> 01:24:56,624
to protect the world
from alien technology.

1118
01:24:56,798 --> 01:25:00,461
Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

1119
01:25:00,635 --> 01:25:03,001
You're a goddamn liar.

1120
01:25:03,305 --> 01:25:06,638
American goddamn astronauts
found Starro.

1121
01:25:07,183 --> 01:25:09,925
Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.

1122
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,510
Although the cold war was ended,

1123
01:25:11,688 --> 01:25:16,102
your government saw the potential
in weaponizing such a powerful beast,

1124
01:25:16,276 --> 01:25:21,270
but banish the thought of any such
experiments being held on American soil.

1125
01:25:21,823 --> 01:25:26,817
Your people have always been squeamish
about the sacrifices necessary

1126
01:25:27,454 --> 01:25:29,285
for scientific advancement.

1127
01:25:29,456 --> 01:25:30,616
So,

1128
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:34,950
the United States made a secret deal
with the Corto Maltese government

1129
01:25:35,128 --> 01:25:37,585
to conduct
their illegal experiments here

1130
01:25:37,756 --> 01:25:38,836
in Jotunheim.

1131
01:25:39,007 --> 01:25:41,168
And they hired me to oversee them.

1132
01:25:41,343 --> 01:25:45,177
And now, because of
a run-of-the-mill fucking military coup,

1133
01:25:45,347 --> 01:25:47,633
they're gonna destroy
30 years' worth of efforts.

1134
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:49,092
Yeah!

1135
01:25:49,267 --> 01:25:50,973
You're the real victim here.

1136
01:25:51,061 --> 01:25:53,998
The hell you doing here? You're supposed
to be upstairs plantin' explosives.

1137
01:25:54,022 --> 01:25:55,808
I told you I didn't trust him.

1138
01:25:56,483 --> 01:25:58,439
Your records are located
in those computers?

1139
01:26:01,488 --> 01:26:03,570
Colonel, what are you doing?

1140
01:26:04,407 --> 01:26:08,320
I joined the military to serve
my country, not to be its puppet.

1141
01:26:09,746 --> 01:26:11,327
What are you doing?

1142
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:15,949
Who are you going
to show that to?

1143
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:19,210
The press.
Goddamn people deserve to know.

1144
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:21,025
I'm tired of coverin' up
their dirty little secrets.

1145
01:26:21,049 --> 01:26:22,539
This time these sons of bitches

1146
01:26:22,634 --> 01:26:24,278
are gonna be held account...

1147
01:26:24,302 --> 01:26:25,622
I can't let you do that, Colonel.

1148
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:27,340
- Excuse me?
- I'm truly sorry.

1149
01:26:27,514 --> 01:26:30,368
Miss Waller charged me with makin' sure
those records don't leave this building.

1150
01:26:30,392 --> 01:26:32,132
Of course, I shoulda known.

1151
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:34,642
Waller's always got a backup.

1152
01:26:34,813 --> 01:26:36,553
Come on, man, this isn't personal.

1153
01:26:36,815 --> 01:26:39,181
Holdin' a gun on me
is pretty fucking personal.

1154
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,600
What is that?

1155
01:26:42,362 --> 01:26:43,818
I'm gonna need that drive, Colonel.

1156
01:26:45,573 --> 01:26:47,564
Those morons set off
the explosives too early.

1157
01:26:47,742 --> 01:26:48,777
Hand over the drive!

1158
01:26:48,952 --> 01:26:51,364
Let's go, come on!

1159
01:26:51,454 --> 01:26:52,990
They experimented on children.

1160
01:26:53,289 --> 01:26:54,950
No one is sayin'
what they did was right.

1161
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:57,247
They experimented on children!

1162
01:26:57,419 --> 01:27:00,206
That information gets out,
it causes an international incident!

1163
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,666
Keepin' the peace is worth any price,

1164
01:27:02,841 --> 01:27:04,877
including the life
of a hero like yours, sir,

1165
01:27:05,051 --> 01:27:06,211
so please...

1166
01:27:07,887 --> 01:27:09,218
Don't make me do this.

1167
01:27:48,303 --> 01:27:49,839
What have you people done?

1168
01:28:06,154 --> 01:28:07,644
Sebastian, come!

1169
01:28:41,356 --> 01:28:45,645
Okay, we gotta calm down.
Let's all just... let's talk about this.

1170
01:28:45,819 --> 01:28:47,339
I understand where you're coming from.

1171
01:28:47,487 --> 01:28:48,567
I crossed a line.

1172
01:28:48,738 --> 01:28:50,274
Okay, I crossed a line!

1173
01:28:50,448 --> 01:28:52,530
I realize that,
but I'm ready to change.

1174
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,531
I am ready to change.

1175
01:28:54,702 --> 01:28:56,567
And I didn't mean to hurt you...

1176
01:30:46,773 --> 01:30:48,638
You motherfucker.

1177
01:31:28,314 --> 01:31:29,770
Peacemaker.

1178
01:31:31,109 --> 01:31:33,145
What a joke.

1179
01:32:06,102 --> 01:32:07,102
Cleo.

1180
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:10,470
Give me back the drive.

1181
01:32:31,919 --> 01:32:34,410
I told you that information
can't get out. Fuck!

1182
01:32:34,589 --> 01:32:38,298
So, okay, okay, destroy the hard drive.
Why kill me?

1183
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:47,590
Because I'm thorough.

1184
01:32:49,812 --> 01:32:51,018
Oh, my...

1185
01:32:51,042 --> 01:32:53,023
That's why I kill.

1186
01:32:53,024 --> 01:32:54,480
No, no...

1187
01:33:04,285 --> 01:33:05,525
All right, troops are coming.

1188
01:33:05,703 --> 01:33:07,739
This floor, and then nine floors left.
Let's go!

1189
01:33:07,914 --> 01:33:09,279
Come on!

1190
01:34:30,246 --> 01:34:32,282
New dumb friends.

1191
01:34:45,428 --> 01:34:47,464
Aw, fizzle sticks. Hold on.

1192
01:35:14,457 --> 01:35:16,493
Has anyone got eyes or ears on any more?

1193
01:35:16,667 --> 01:35:17,998
They killed Milton!

1194
01:35:20,129 --> 01:35:21,869
Milton was still with us?

1195
01:35:22,048 --> 01:35:23,859
- Where'd you think he was?
- I don't know.

1196
01:35:23,883 --> 01:35:25,360
I thought he stayed back with the bus.

1197
01:35:25,384 --> 01:35:26,419
What was Milton gonna do?

1198
01:35:26,594 --> 01:35:27,834
He was helping us!

1199
01:35:29,722 --> 01:35:31,007
- Who's Milton? 
- What?

1200
01:35:31,098 --> 01:35:32,838
I don't remember any Milton.

1201
01:35:33,017 --> 01:35:36,305
Fuck! He has been with us
the whole time.

1202
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:37,844
Somebody named Milton

1203
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:40,684
- has been with us the whole time?
- Yes!

1204
01:35:40,858 --> 01:35:42,502
I don't think so.
I think I would've noticed

1205
01:35:42,526 --> 01:35:44,938
if a guy named Milton's been with us.

1206
01:35:45,112 --> 01:35:46,522
It's not a very common name.

1207
01:35:46,697 --> 01:35:49,234
I don't think
I've ever even met a Milton.

1208
01:35:49,659 --> 01:35:51,240
Are you messing around right now?

1209
01:35:51,577 --> 01:35:52,862
He was a really nice guy,

1210
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:55,403
and he sacrificed himself to help us.

1211
01:35:55,873 --> 01:35:57,238
And now look at him.

1212
01:35:57,583 --> 01:35:59,164
He's dead.

1213
01:36:01,003 --> 01:36:05,542
Oh, that guy! Milton, Milton.

1214
01:36:09,095 --> 01:36:11,586
So, when did this great love affair
with Milton start?

1215
01:36:11,764 --> 01:36:14,881
I liked him from the beginning, okay?
I just didn't say anything until...

1216
01:36:17,395 --> 01:36:19,056
No!

1217
01:38:13,677 --> 01:38:16,043
Harley! Give us a hand!

1218
01:38:25,022 --> 01:38:26,022
Hey!

1219
01:38:37,618 --> 01:38:38,903
Vamos. Vamos.

1220
01:39:22,830 --> 01:39:23,830
Oh!

1221
01:40:13,339 --> 01:40:15,671
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1222
01:40:18,302 --> 01:40:20,634
Oh, fuck off!

1223
01:40:21,388 --> 01:40:22,423
Oh.

1224
01:40:42,117 --> 01:40:43,448
Sorry, kid.

1225
01:40:43,619 --> 01:40:45,155
No, no, no.

1226
01:41:40,217 --> 01:41:41,798
How?

1227
01:41:41,969 --> 01:41:43,675
Smaller bullets.

1228
01:41:48,559 --> 01:41:50,925
He killed Colonel Flag.

1229
01:41:52,229 --> 01:41:54,140
He wanted to share this with the press.

1230
01:41:54,315 --> 01:41:56,055
It's proof the American government

1231
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:58,892
was behind Project Starfish
the whole time.

1232
01:42:33,854 --> 01:42:34,934
Whoa. Whoa.

1233
01:42:50,204 --> 01:42:51,785
I think it's trying to get out.

1234
01:42:51,955 --> 01:42:53,661
- What?
- Starro the...

1235
01:43:16,855 --> 01:43:17,855
Whoa.

1236
01:44:26,967 --> 01:44:29,128
Cover your faces!

1237
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,100
Si.

1238
01:45:18,644 --> 01:45:19,679
Si.

1239
01:45:52,594 --> 01:45:54,755
- Whoa. 
- What the fuck is that?

1240
01:45:54,847 --> 01:45:56,383
Uh... hey, guys?

1241
01:45:59,142 --> 01:46:00,723
Oh, shit, there's...

1242
01:46:19,454 --> 01:46:21,615
This city is mine.

1243
01:46:52,029 --> 01:46:55,146
Uh, Miss Waller,
I think the feed is back up.

1244
01:46:57,409 --> 01:46:59,616
Oh, my god, Miss Waller!

1245
01:46:59,786 --> 01:47:02,198
We've got a freaking kaiju
up in this shit!

1246
01:47:11,423 --> 01:47:12,901
Task Force X, come in.

1247
01:47:12,925 --> 01:47:14,381
Are you there?

1248
01:47:17,012 --> 01:47:18,377
Uh-huh.

1249
01:47:18,555 --> 01:47:19,761
Whatever signal jammers

1250
01:47:19,932 --> 01:47:21,217
were blocking our communications

1251
01:47:21,308 --> 01:47:23,202
must have been in the building
you just demolished.

1252
01:47:23,226 --> 01:47:26,184
Yeah, well, we've got a mite issue
over here, Waller.

1253
01:47:26,355 --> 01:47:28,471
It's Project Starfish, Miss Waller.

1254
01:47:28,649 --> 01:47:29,934
It's headed towards the city,

1255
01:47:30,025 --> 01:47:32,937
and I think it wants to feed
on as many people as it can.

1256
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,320
Not our problem.

1257
01:47:38,492 --> 01:47:40,824
If you've destroyed Jotunheim
and the records within,

1258
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:42,401
you've achieved the objective.

1259
01:47:42,579 --> 01:47:45,070
Corto Maltese is no longer a U.S. ally.

1260
01:47:45,248 --> 01:47:46,888
If anything,
the white house will consider

1261
01:47:46,959 --> 01:47:48,790
fomenting disruption in a hostile nation

1262
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:50,167
a positive development.

1263
01:48:23,787 --> 01:48:25,197
You heard what she said.

1264
01:48:46,435 --> 01:48:47,435
Fuck.

1265
01:48:53,108 --> 01:48:54,848
Bloodsport is off mission.

1266
01:48:55,027 --> 01:48:56,107
What the...

1267
01:48:57,195 --> 01:48:58,810
She'll kill you, you know.

1268
01:48:58,989 --> 01:49:00,195
That's her business.

1269
01:49:01,033 --> 01:49:03,866
I knew Sebastian sensed good in you
for a reason.

1270
01:49:04,036 --> 01:49:06,322
Just keep that fucking rat away from me.

1271
01:49:06,663 --> 01:49:08,244
Ratcatcher is also off mission.

1272
01:49:08,749 --> 01:49:09,989
Bloodsport, Ratcatcher,

1273
01:49:10,167 --> 01:49:12,658
- turn around.
- Where go, friends?

1274
01:49:13,378 --> 01:49:14,618
Nanaue!

1275
01:49:16,131 --> 01:49:18,622
I know what I'm carrying
the javelin for.

1276
01:49:28,894 --> 01:49:30,304
Krill, turn around now!

1277
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:32,686
Turn back now, god damn it!

1278
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,606
- Open it.
- Miss Waller...

1279
01:49:36,777 --> 01:49:37,777
Open it!

1280
01:49:39,529 --> 01:49:41,190
What are you doing, Task Force X?

1281
01:49:46,453 --> 01:49:48,034
Fuck!

1282
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:51,871
Turn around now, god damn it!

1283
01:49:52,042 --> 01:49:54,749
You dumb pieces of shit!

1284
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,205
Motherfuckers!

1285
01:49:57,756 --> 01:50:00,213
God damn it, Task Force X,
this is your last

1286
01:50:00,383 --> 01:50:02,374
motherfucking warning!

1287
01:50:06,598 --> 01:50:10,090
Oh, my god!
What the fuck did you do?

1288
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,101
All those people, John.

1289
01:50:14,022 --> 01:50:15,228
Little kids.

1290
01:50:19,903 --> 01:50:24,112
Task Force X, the creature is headed
to Calle Principal.

1291
01:50:24,282 --> 01:50:25,442
Avoid Avenida Medrano,

1292
01:50:25,617 --> 01:50:27,573
- there is a swarm of infected.
- Jesus.

1293
01:50:27,744 --> 01:50:31,328
So, your clearest path is Calle Aguero.

1294
01:50:31,498 --> 01:50:34,285
Get on the satellite, Dale,
you fucking dickhead!

1295
01:50:34,459 --> 01:50:35,869
Yes, ma'am.

1296
01:51:58,126 --> 01:51:59,411
Huh?

1297
01:52:04,674 --> 01:52:06,539
Harley, take the high ground!

1298
01:52:12,891 --> 01:52:16,600
Nanaue! Monster is nom nom!

1299
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:19,227
Monster nom nom?

1300
01:52:19,689 --> 01:52:20,689
Yes!

1301
01:52:29,491 --> 01:52:31,652
Abner, do you see who that is?

1302
01:52:31,743 --> 01:52:33,483
Huh?

1303
01:52:33,662 --> 01:52:35,198
It's your mom!

1304
01:53:08,154 --> 01:53:10,896
I'm a superhero!

1305
01:53:11,491 --> 01:53:13,652
I'm a motherfucking super...

1306
01:54:03,335 --> 01:54:04,950
God!

1307
01:54:10,592 --> 01:54:14,631
No! No!

1308
01:54:32,072 --> 01:54:33,357
Oh, no...

1309
01:54:41,373 --> 01:54:43,614
This city

1310
01:54:43,792 --> 01:54:47,376
is mine!

1311
01:54:48,088 --> 01:54:50,124
This city isn't yours.

1312
01:54:51,257 --> 01:54:53,748
This city isn't ours.

1313
01:54:54,344 --> 01:54:56,460
This city is theirs.

1314
01:55:00,475 --> 01:55:02,011
Oh, hell.

1315
01:56:21,598 --> 01:56:23,213
Why rats, papa?

1316
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:28,468
Rats are the lowliest and most despised
of all creatures, my love.

1317
01:56:29,564 --> 01:56:31,179
If they have purpose...

1318
01:56:32,817 --> 01:56:34,523
So do we all.

1319
01:58:20,633 --> 01:58:22,794
I was happy,

1320
01:58:22,969 --> 01:58:27,463
floating, staring at the stars.

1321
01:59:01,007 --> 01:59:02,526
A group of escaped convicts

1322
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:03,550
saved a city of millions

1323
01:59:03,635 --> 01:59:07,548
on the small island nation
of Corto Maltese today.

1324
01:59:07,722 --> 01:59:08,802
That's my dad.

1325
01:59:10,516 --> 01:59:11,910
Because of these people,

1326
01:59:11,934 --> 01:59:15,051
Corto Maltese will have
free Democratic elections

1327
01:59:15,146 --> 01:59:17,933
- for the first time in 90 years.
- Viva

1328
01:59:18,149 --> 01:59:25,570
Corto Maltese! Viva...

1329
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:28,231
- That's my dad.
- Corto Maltese! Viva...

1330
01:59:36,584 --> 01:59:37,824
Yeah.

1331
01:59:40,505 --> 01:59:41,505
Yeah.

1332
01:59:42,715 --> 01:59:44,831
Oh, that's just a taste
of what's on that drive.

1333
01:59:45,009 --> 01:59:47,295
I've uploaded it all to a secure server.

1334
01:59:48,262 --> 01:59:50,127
Now, if you kill any one of us,

1335
01:59:50,306 --> 01:59:52,297
or my daughter ever sees
the inside of a prison,

1336
01:59:52,475 --> 01:59:53,715
it goes public.

1337
01:59:53,893 --> 01:59:55,349
If we all go free,

1338
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:57,431
it never has to see the light of day.

1339
01:59:59,065 --> 02:00:01,602
I told you
I'd make you a leader, Dubois.

1340
02:00:02,902 --> 02:00:04,267
You got a deal.

1341
02:00:24,382 --> 02:00:25,542
Nanaue.

1342
02:00:41,482 --> 02:00:43,814
Look, I know Flag wanted
to give the drive to the press,

1343
02:00:43,985 --> 02:00:47,569
but we just saved a whole bloody city.
We can't have it all.

1344
02:00:50,491 --> 02:00:51,651
Flag was my friend.

1345
02:00:51,826 --> 02:00:53,236
Mine too.

1346
02:00:54,996 --> 02:00:56,907
And I haven't got many of those.

1347
02:00:59,208 --> 02:01:01,415
I could be your friend, Milton.

1348
02:01:01,919 --> 02:01:02,919
Not my name.

1349
02:01:03,254 --> 02:01:04,664
What?

1350
02:01:04,839 --> 02:01:07,000
What are you talkin' about?
We just had a conversation

1351
02:01:07,091 --> 02:01:09,298
for, like, three hours
about how your name is Milton.

1352
02:01:09,469 --> 02:01:10,709
Didn't.

1353
02:01:10,803 --> 02:01:12,168
Yes, we did.

1354
02:01:12,346 --> 02:01:14,382
No. Our ride's here.

1355
02:01:14,474 --> 02:01:16,260
Hmm.

1356
02:01:18,186 --> 02:01:19,426
Nom nom?

1357
02:01:19,604 --> 02:01:20,434
Really?

1358
02:01:20,605 --> 02:01:22,641
That is what you're
thinkin' about right now?

1359
02:01:22,815 --> 02:01:25,101
No. That nom nom though.

1360
02:01:25,276 --> 02:01:26,812
No, it's not nom nom.

1361
02:01:28,863 --> 02:01:30,194

Said they found him in the rubble.

1416
02:10:55,929 --> 02:10:57,729
They were shocked
his heart was still beating.

1417
02:10:57,848 --> 02:11:00,385
I wasn't certain how safe it was,
shipping him back here.

1418
02:11:00,559 --> 02:11:03,676
But, if anything,
he's shown he's resilient.

1419
02:11:03,771 --> 02:11:07,480
It'll take some surgery, but eventually
we'll get him back up to speed.

1420
02:11:09,276 --> 02:11:11,062
You realize this is revenge, right?

1421
02:11:11,236 --> 02:11:12,646
Waller knows we double-crossed her,

1422
02:11:12,821 --> 02:11:16,109
and she's getting back at us
by saddling us with this douchebag.

1423
02:11:16,283 --> 02:11:17,363
Yep.

1424
02:11:17,659 --> 02:11:19,945
I heard he was sort of a hero
down in Corto Maltese.

1425
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:22,281
Oh, is that what you heard?
Because not quite.

1426
02:11:24,333 --> 02:11:26,039
What do you guys want him for?

1427
02:11:27,086 --> 02:11:30,328
Just to save the fucking world,
that's all.
