1
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,042
Attack!

2
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,083
Attack!

3
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:10,750
- Go! Come on! Get out there!
- To the ladders!

4
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,333
Get out!

5
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:16,000
Heinrich, come on, move! Let's go!

6
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,625
To the ladders!

7
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,292
On my command!

8
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,458
- Charge!
- Hans?

9
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,042
Attack! Get out there!

10
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,458
Go! Charge!

11
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:33,667
- Hans?
- Go, Heinrich! Get out there!

12
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:35,875
Attack!

13
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,125
Keep going!

14
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,917
Keep going!

15
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,458
Faster! Go! Faster!

16
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,333
Take cover!

17
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,333
Heinrich!

18
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,667
Heinrich!

19
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:09,208
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

20
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,667
NORTHERN GERMANY
SPRING 1917

21
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,500
THIRD YEAR OF WAR

22
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,750
- Paul!
- Paul!

23
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,875
Paul. Hey.

24
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,750
Well?

25
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,375
- So, what now?
- Don't know.

26
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,375
- Does he know we're all going?
- Of course.

27
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,458
You're staying home?

28
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,042
My God, staying tied
to your mummy's apron-strings?

29
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,167
Here, I'll sign it for you.

30
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,333
- His parents have to do that.
- But they didn't. Give it here.

31
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,583
- It won't work. They'll find out.
- How?

32
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,625
How? Are they pen pals with his father?

33
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,458
- Give me your pen.
- I don't have one.

34
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,833
Ludwig.

35
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,125
You'll be in trouble.
You'll get a thrashing.

36
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,292
Got a better idea?
I won't be the only one left behind.

37
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,833
Yeah!

38
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,833
Congratulations, Private Béumer.
You're going to the front.

39
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,083
I'm a dead man.

40
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,458
You're standing here
on the threshold of existence.

41
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,375
Remember this moment.

42
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,708
It's an important moment.

43
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:58,417
In years to come, you will be judged
on what you dared to become today.

44
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,917
The Iron Youth of Germany.

45
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,458
My friends,

46
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,208
you are fortunate
to be living in great times.

47
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,750
Your deeds will be the water

48
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,125
that will nourish a strong and noble root.

49
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,625
Stand still and listen, Leinemann!

50
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,875
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

51
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,625
I am sure that I will see most of you
here at home again soon,

52
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,750
your sword returned
to its scabbard with honour.

53
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:32,125
With an Iron Cross
pinned to your proud chest.

54
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,542
But don't be fooled.

55
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:39,417
During the darkest hours out there
as you await an attack,

56
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,458
you may start to harbour doubts.

57
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,458
But this is no time for weakness of mind!

58
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,333
Any wavering, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the Fatherland!

59
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,625
Modern warfare is like a game of chess.

60
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,542
It's never about the individual.
It's always about the whole.

61
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,542
You will prove yourselves
worthy of your uniforms

62
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,167
and break through
the enemy front in Flanders.

63
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,708
And then, in just a few weeks,

64
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,958
you will finally march on Paris!

65
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,708
'Yes!
'Yes!

66
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,042
Our future,

67
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,333
the future of Germany,

68
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:24,167
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

69
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,833
My friends, that's you!

70
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:28,917
Yes!

71
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,917
So, off to battle!

72
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,083
For Kaiser, God and Fatherland!

73
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,250
Yes!

74
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,792
- Bravo!
- Yes!

75
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,167
Next.

76
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,083
Next.

77
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:51,917
Next.

78
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,333
Next.

79
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:56,542
Next.

80
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,417
Béumer, Paul. 53 Wiesengrund.

81
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,667
Born 18th November '99.

82
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,708
- Correct?
- Yes, sir.

83
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,875
Next.

84
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,125
Paul?

85
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,292
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

86
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,875
- Yes.
- Next.

87
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,875
Everything all right?

88
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,542
- Yes, I just want to get going at last.
- Next.

89
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,625
Off you go.

90
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,750
Next.

91
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,833
Excuse me.

92
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,250
This belongs to someone.

93
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:34,958
Next.

94
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,083
Yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

95
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,792
Here. Take care.

96
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,583
Thank you.

97
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,417
Blimey, as if they were tailor-made!

98
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,917
Well, Ludwig,
are you going to get all the girls now?

99
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

100
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,875
As long as you don't shoot us.

101
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,042
<i>Girl, I do love you</i>

102
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,250
<i>But I can't marry you just yet</i>

103
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,875
<i>Wait another year
Then it will...</i>

104
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,292
She won't wait, Franz.

105
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:23,958
She won't wait.

106
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:27,333
You lady killer, you.

107
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,583
<i>Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee</i>

108
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:41,917
<i>Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee</i>

109
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,792
<i>And a glass of wine</i>

110
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,042
<i>And a glass of wine</i>

111
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,292
<i>Girl, I do love you</i>

112
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,083
<i>But I can't marry you just yet</i>

113
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:01,250
<i>Wait another year
Then it will come true</i>

114
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,625
<i>Wait another year
Then it will come true...</i>

115
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:16,500
LA MALMAISON, NORTHERN FRANCE
25 KM TO THE WESTERN FRONT

116
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,042
What's your name, soldier?

117
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,250
Kropp. Albert Kropp, sir.

118
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,167
Do you like dirty girls, Kropp?

119
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,792
Do you like dirty girls?

120
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,125
No, sir.

121
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,125
Why did you sleep with one then?

122
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,708
Report for guard duty at 3 a.m.

123
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:50,833
Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in an absolute shithole.

124
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:54,208
And you'd better do it with a clean G98.

125
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,208
You'll pamper it.

126
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,917
You'll love it.

127
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,333
And damn it, you'll keep it as spotless
as the Holy Virgin's thighs.

128
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,917
- Do we understand each other?
- Yes, sir!

129
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,792
Welcome
to the 78th Infantry Reserve Regiment.

130
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,125
We're on the Western Front now.

131
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,667
Welcome to Paris!

132
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,750
Yes!

133
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,167
Damn it, what happened?

134
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,375
I have to deliver the company
to the front by 6 p.m.

135
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,583
You can, but on foot.
We need the trucks, Lieutenant.

136
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:58,458
- With all due respect, my orders...
- You can stick your orders up your arse!

137
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,875
I've got 40 men here dying in the mud.
Get out right now!

138
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,000
Everyone out!

139
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,292
Come on. Make it snappy.

140
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,958
You heard the staff surgeon.

141
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:17,250
Faster, soldiers! Don't fall asleep here!

142
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,708
Come on!

143
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,625
- Franz Mijller, right?
- Yes.

144
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,958
The commander-in-chief expects you
to survive at least six weeks.

145
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:36,500
- Do you want to be alive in six weeks?
- Yes, sir.

146
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,625
Then stop dragging your feet
and get a move on!

147
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,833
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

148
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,250
Hurry UP!

149
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,458
We're not at a tea dance!

150
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,875
Gas!

151
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,500
'Gas!
'Gas!

152
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,667
Gas!

153
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,958
Gas!

154
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,833
Gas masks on!

155
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,833
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

156
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,167
If the French could aim better,

157
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,750
they'd be scraping us off the road now
with a spoon and burying us in a mess tin.

158
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,417
But one thing is as sure as eggs is eggs.

159
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,417
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

160
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,958
Eyes front!

161
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,667
- Have you got cloth ears?
- No, sir.

162
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,417
I was just trying to put on my mask.

163
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,500
You, Paul Béumer,
will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

164
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,542
You should eat something, damn it.

165
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:01,208
Attention! Gas masks off!

166
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,333
Gas masks off!

167
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,958
Not you. You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

168
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,375
With that bonehead there.

169
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:12,625
Line up! March!

170
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,292
Stick together and get moving!

171
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,458
Come on, hurry up!

172
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:40,417
Paul! Paul, come on.
Give me your backpack.

173
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,250
You can carry mine next time.

174
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,250
Congratulations, soldiers.

175
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,250
This is your new home.

176
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,333
Helmets off!

177
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,375
I see the men have been enjoying
my absence, Steinberger.

178
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,250
There was gunfire all night.

179
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,583
Their nerves are shot.

180
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,583
Dry boots are a good remedy for that.

181
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,833
Do you want us all to drown?

182
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,458
Everyone pitches in! Bail out the trench.

183
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,250
What are you waiting for, Béumer?

184
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,667
Why are you still standing around?

185
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,833
Throw a dog a bone,

186
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,792
it will always snap it up.

187
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,083
Give a man power...

188
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,250
Man is a beast.

189
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,833
Drink.

190
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,167
Katczinsky, come over here. Lend a hand.

191
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,333
We'll get hit hard tonight.

192
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,042
Sorry.

193
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,208
Forget about it.

194
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,958
This isn't how I imagined it.

195
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,583
Shut up, Ludwig.

196
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,375
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

197
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:47,250
Stick them down your trousers.
That's what I always do.

198
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,583
You think that will make it shoot better?

199
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,583
- Did you hear that?
- What?

200
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,375
That sound. Listen.

201
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,000
There's nothing there.

202
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,833
Our first Frenchmen.

203
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,625
Calm down, Paulie.

204
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:10,667
I hear it now too.

205
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,917
Who's there?

206
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,542
Hey.

207
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:28,875
Show yourself!

208
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,333
No!

209
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:51,333
<i>|</i> Qot hit!

210
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,458
- No, Paul. No.
- What's going on there?

211
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,542
Oh, no.

212
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:03,958
What is it?

213
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,542
They shot at me from over there.

214
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,125
They saw your muzzle flash.

215
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,667
Keep your heads down.

216
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,292
Unless you want to catch the next bullet
with your teeth, move ten metres.

217
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,125
Shoot, then move.
Shoot, then move. Understood?

218
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,875
Yes.

219
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,208
Come on.

220
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,958
Take cover!

221
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,083
In here!

222
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,333
Béumer, Kropp! You two, in here. Quick!

223
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:45,042
In the bunker!

224
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,208
Get in!

225
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,458
"Watch what you eat."

226
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,958
That's what my mother said.

227
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:18,125
- We'll stick together, Paul.
- Yeah.

228
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,792
- We'll stick together.
- Yeah.

229
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:24,583
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I want to go home.

230
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:26,250
I want to go home.

231
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,750
Creeping barrage.

232
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,208
What?

233
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:57,458
Every few minutes,
the artillery barrage moves forward,

234
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,000
and directly behind it,

235
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,583
the infantry advances.

236
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,458
What does that mean?

237
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,208
They're coming.

238
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,500
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

239
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,750
The barrage is nearly over.

240
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:36,042
- No. Let me go.
- Calm down.

241
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,625
- Let me out. I want to get out of here.
- Calm down!

242
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,083
Calm down.

243
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:46,542
No!

244
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,375
Get out!

245
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:53,917
Get out!

246
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,500
Move! Get out!

247
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,750
Get out of here!

248
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,042
Everyone, get out!

249
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,500
Paul. That's Paul.

250
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,750
Albert!

251
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,667
Albert, we've found Paul!

252
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,708
We have to move that beam.

253
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:08,792
Paul.

254
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,417
Paul.

255
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:13,708
Are you okay?

256
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,000
Are you okay, Paul?

257
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,292
Come on. Paul, come on. I'll help you.

258
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,208
Come on. Up you come. Sit down.

259
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:23,833
- Are you injured?
- Keep going.

260
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,042
Paul, are you injured?

261
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,226
- Can you hear me?
- Albert Kropp, we need help!

262
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,375
- See you later, Paul.
- See you later, Paul.

263
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,667
Katczinsky, get on with it!

264
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,708
And you? Are you injured?

265
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:51,792
No.

266
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,250
Then start collecting.

267
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,417
Oh, man!

268
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,292
Hard work pays off.

269
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,667
Come on! Keep moving now!

270
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,750
We haven't got all day.

271
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,917
Albrecht, Karl. Diepholz.

272
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,625
18 MONTHS LATER

273
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:28,708
14th September 1898.

274
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,708
Blumenthal, Samuel.

275
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:40,708
Dresden, 6th November 1900.

276
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:43,417
It was his birthday yesterday.

277
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,333
Von Gallwitz, Gustav.

278
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:54,792
Osnabrijck, 20th June '99.

279
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,667
Gétz Lijttwitz...

280
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,750
That's enough.

281
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:13,542
GERMAN HIGH COMMAND
7 NOVEMBER 1918

282
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:37,625
Mr. Erzberger.

283
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,333
May God be with us.

284
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,375
Again more than 40,000 dead
in the last weeks alone.

285
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:56,250
That should convince the general staff.

286
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:00,000
I think the gentlemen know it's over.

287
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
We all know.

288
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,042
The Field Marshal.

289
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,042
CHAMPAGNE, FRANCE
OCCUPIED TERRITORY

290
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:57,792
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

291
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:14,667
If we keep up this pace, Paul,
we'll have conquered France in 180 years.

292
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,042
I worked it out.

293
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,125
Don't get caught, Kat.

294
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,625
Never.

295
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,167
Listen.

296
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,833
What do you think, Paul?
Is it worth dying for?

297
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,167
It is when you're hungry.

298
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:41,917
Kat?

299
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:45,542
Kat?

300
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:47,708
Run!

301
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,125
Hey! Dirty Kraut!

302
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:50,958
Run!

303
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:14,167
Men, you're heroes.

304
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,375
Shut the door,
or the others will smell it.

305
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,042
- Password.
- I don't know. I've forgotten everything.

306
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,958
- Use your Prussian brain.
- Here. Eyes wide, long fingers.

307
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:26,833
- Exactly.
- Mouth open, goose in.

308
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:29,875
A piece of goose from the goose.
From Franz to Franz.

309
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:30,958
I'll have a wing.

310
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:32,958
Do I have to share? I'll have the rest.

311
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,042
Well, in with it!

312
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,167
Come here, you blind hen.
Wide-mouthed frog.

313
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,708
- May we rest in peace under the barrage.
- Oh, God.

314
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,625
Oh, God.
Hey, boys, I'll never forget this.

315
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:12,583
Does it taste good?

316
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Yes.

317
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,375
- And you?
- Yes, good.

318
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,500
Good, Paul?

319
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,458
Good, Kat.

320
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:23,542
Life is short.

321
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:28,625
Where's Emil when you need him?
Emil, bring over the coffee and caviar!

322
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,083
Yes, and run a foot bath.
I need a foot bath.

323
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,375
Kat?

324
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:34,875
What is it?

325
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:39,417
<i>You stole the goose Give it back</i>

326
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,292
<i>Give it back</i>

327
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,292
<i>- Or the hunter will get you...</i>
- The <i>farmer!</i>

328
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,750
The farmer! Yes!

329
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:51,292
<i>Or the farmer will get you
With his rifle...</i>

330
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:20,917
Tjaden sits very quietly and says,
"A|| I ever hear about is crosses."

331
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,083
"My father was Captain of Nazareth."

332
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,917
"Captain of Nazareth?" asks the teacher.

333
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:30,083
"Never heard of it.
Tjaden, go home and ask again, okay?"

334
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,958
The next morning,
Tjaden rushes into the classroom and says,

335
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:37,292
"|'m so sorry,
my father wasn't Captain of Nazareth."

336
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,958
"My father had the clap in a |azaret."

337
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,375
Tjaden didn't even go to school.

338
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:51,542
Look!

339
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:16,792
Hey! Hello!

340
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,083
Come here!

341
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,208
Fresh baguette!

342
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,208
For you!

343
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,208
Lebervvurst, love!

344
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,875
Lots of love!

345
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,917
Hey, Franz, where are you going?

346
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,250
- Take me with you!
- Come on then!

347
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,208
Look!

348
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,500
Now he's making a fool of himself.

349
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:00,958
Ooh la la! You're very beautiful, my love.

350
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:03,208
Franz!

351
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:05,125
The skinny dark-haired one is mine!

352
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,583
Where's he going now?

353
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,167
Franz?

354
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,250
Goodbye!

355
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,125
Goodbye, my friends!

356
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:40,375
Damn.

357
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:45,500
If it was all over now,
you know what I'd do?

358
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,333
There's no peace. It's not over.

359
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:48,417
But if it was.

360
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:52,208
- Bloody hell, there'd be girls again.
- Yes, indeed.

361
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:55,583
I wouldn't wear any trousers for a week.

362
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:58,833
I should smack your arses
for bringing that up.

363
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,000
What about you, Paul?

364
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,083
- No idea. Can't think of anything.
- |'d stay with the Prussians.

365
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:06,417
You're crazy, Tjaden.

366
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,875
Have you ever dug peat?

367
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:09,958
Try it one day.

368
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:12,083
Can't be worse than digging trenches.

369
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:15,583
Takes longer than digging trenches.
And you can't slack off either.

370
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:19,583
In the army during peacetime,
you have no worries.

371
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,542
Food's there every morning,
or you raise a stink.

372
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,458
Then you've got your nice bed,
fresh sheets every week.

373
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:27,958
And then...

374
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,125
Then you make NCO.

375
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:35,167
Imagine that. I'll be a police ranger.

376
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,583
A cognac here, a pint there.

377
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:40,250
Everyone wants to be friends
with a ranger. Everyone.

378
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,000
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

379
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:44,417
What's that?

380
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,583
You'll never make NCO.

381
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,417
You always ask such nonsense questions.

382
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,042
It won't change anything.

383
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,000
- Kat! Kat!
- Here!

384
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,125
- Kat!
- Here!

385
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,375
IIMy.

386
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,833
"You asked for a food parcel."

387
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:23,833
"Four helpings of wurst
and lard are on their way...

388
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:28,083
a few cakes,

389
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:30,917
sauerkraut and bockwurst,

390
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:32,958
and...

391
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:34,833
Hing...

392
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,167
Hingfong essence with sugar cubes,

393
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:41,083
some eggs and a jar of plum jam."

394
00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:45,167
"Make it last because I don't want
to have to send more too soon."

395
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,958
"Better not share it with your comrades."

396
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:52,667
"My dear dumpling,
I have another question for you."

397
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,417
"How much money have you saved so far?"

398
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:58,250
"Can you maybe send some home?"

399
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:02,042
"They say that the war will be over soon,

400
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:04,833
so it would be good
to have some left over."

401
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,500
"Now you'll think,
listen to the old lady, how cheeky!"

402
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:11,792
"But no of fence."

403
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:14,667
"You know me, I can't get enough."

404
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,625
"Give me an inch and I'll take a mile."

405
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:20,667
"So don't keel over on the home stretch."

406
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:26,000
"Karl Lemmer is already
in a field hospital in the East."

407
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,333
"Something to do with his stomach.
He was hardly out there three weeks."

408
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:34,417
"Can't you get off too,
with your rheumatism?"

409
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:37,333
"You've done your bit."

410
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:42,250
If only she could see you now,
sitting here with your cigar!

411
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:47,958
"On Sunday, I'm visiting..."

412
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:57,500
"On Sunday,
I'm visiting our little boy's grave."

413
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:04,042
"|'m going to read to him.
He always liked that so much."

414
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:09,625
"Next year, we'll go together
and celebrate his tenth birthday."

415
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,042
"Well, that's all I had to say."

416
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,708
"Kisses from your wife."

417
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:18,542
"Goodbye."

418
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:25,958
I didn't know.

419
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:36,667
Oh, Paul.

420
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:43,292
What's going to happen?

421
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,583
Going home someday...

422
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,583
Going back to our old lives.

423
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:54,083
And all they'll want to know is
if we fought in close combat.

424
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,250
We'll walk around like travellers
in a landscape from the past.

425
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,625
I ask myself...

426
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:10,167
if I wouldn't just rather
sit around a campfire with you

427
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:11,958
<i>and Tfladen and Krupp</i>

428
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,042
and MUller...

429
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,250
and eat fried potatoes.

430
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:20,417
With the skin on.

431
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,125
Yeah...

432
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:40,875
I'm bored.

433
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,083
How long until we get going again?

434
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,667
How long until we get going again?

435
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,333
Franz?

436
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:11,167
Yeah?

437
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:15,875
We have to leave at six tomorrow.
To look for some kids.

438
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:17,708
What happened?

439
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:20,625
They should have arrived today.

440
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:22,500
An entire company.

441
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,500
How was it?

442
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:33,542
- Nice.
- Yeah?

443
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
Yeah.

444
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:38,667
Here.

445
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:44,958
Smell.

446
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:58,375
What's her name?

447
00:50:58,833 --> 00:50:59,833
Eloise.

448
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:03,708
Eloise.

449
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:07,250
Her skin was as white as milk.

450
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,667
And her breasts...

451
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,250
Hey.

452
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,125
I want a turn.

453
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,458
Albert.

454
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:22,333
- Kropp. Let me have it.
- Here.

455
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:24,583
- Oh, my!
- Tjaden.

456
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:27,542
A girl like that never has
dirty fingernails.

457
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:30,208
- No.
- At most, a bit of sand from the beach.

458
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:31,958
Tjaden.

459
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:35,292
- Come on, give it to me.
- |'m sure she has a bath twice a day.

460
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:38,292
Tjaden.

461
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:41,167
Please. It's mine.

462
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,958
- Tjaden!
- No, it's mine now.

463
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:47,292
That was one hell of a blast.

464
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:49,417
Trench mortar.

465
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,583
It blasted him right out of his uniform.

466
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:00,250
Is he one of those we're looking for?

467
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,583
No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

468
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:04,875
He's been up there a while.

469
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,250
Not funny.

470
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:09,458
Don't start getting soft, men.

471
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:13,042
- How many are we looking for?
- Sixty young recruits.

472
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:23,917
Turnip bread for breakfast.
Turnip bread for lunch.

473
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,583
Turnip bread all the time.
I've had enough.

474
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:30,042
Tell me when you've found them.
I'm not taking another step.

475
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:31,917
Gas.

476
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,167
There was gas here.

477
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,750
Yes.

478
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:56,792
Hello, madam.

479
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:01,292
I'm KrOPP-

480
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:06,792
And you?

481
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,083
Do you want to...

482
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:25,750
Do you want to come with me?

483
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:29,042
Not a problem.

484
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:24,333
Kat.

485
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,083
Kat!

486
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,750
Kat!

487
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,583
Shit.

488
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,667
- Bloody kids.
- Yeah.

489
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:52,917
They took their masks off too soon.

490
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,375
Soon, Germany will be empty.

491
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:19,792
COMPIEGNE, FRANCE
a NOVEMBER 191a

492
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:22,375
Sir.

493
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:26,500
Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

494
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:28,417
The French are putting the pressure on.

495
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,208
Early this morning,
our scouts intercepted orders

496
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:33,333
summoning entire divisions to Latierre.

497
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:36,083
A fleet of tanks
is still stuck in Fernancourt.

498
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:38,000
We need to prepare for an attack.

499
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:42,208
The Social Democrats will be
the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

500
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:45,875
Sir?

501
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:53,500
I just put the German delegation
on the train to Compiegne

502
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:55,083
to negotiate a ceasefire.

503
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:05,375
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling off our fatherland.

504
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:08,667
My order is war.

505
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:13,333
And as long as that's the case,
I'll fight tooth and nail.

506
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:18,000
We have to hold firm
and wait for fresh troops.

507
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:20,917
New recruits are due in a few months.

508
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:26,500
The French are trying
to force their shitty terms on us.

509
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,958
I will not surrender.

510
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:36,792
We have to strike now with all our might.

511
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:43,042
Sir.

512
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,667
For our part,

513
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:09,583
I have to insist...

514
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:12,292
we have to insist...

515
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,875
For God's sake!

516
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,458
Shit.

517
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:50,458
Sir!

518
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,125
Soldiers, pack your bags,

519
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:04,833
roll up your bedding
and wash your mess kits.

520
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,542
The entire regiment
is being sent to the front line.

521
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,875
We're taking anyone
who can stand on two legs.

522
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,833
Line up, damn it!

523
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:18,667
You think the French will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

524
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,875
Here we go again.

525
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,667
- Move it!
- Where to?

526
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,042
Where to?

527
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:24,542
Into battle.

528
01:02:59,667 --> 01:03:01,708
Monsieur le Maréchal is expecting you.

529
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:10,583
I'll be back soon.

530
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,083
Jealous?

531
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:46,542
I stand before you

532
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:50,625
in the hope that you will take
our presence as an opportunity

533
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:53,375
to suspend all hostilities.

534
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,833
In the name of humanity,

535
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:00,375
I ask you to agree
to an immediate ceasefire

536
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:02,958
for the duration of our negotiations

537
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,958
in order to spare our nations
any unnecessary losses.

538
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:12,417
Matthias Erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

539
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,667
Marshal Foch asks
what brings us gentlemen to him.

540
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,583
We look forward to your suggestions

541
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:42,458
for bringing about a permanent ceasefire
at sea, on land and in the air.

542
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:48,667
I don't have any suggestions for you.

543
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:52,792
What does he mean?

544
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,542
I think he might not like
how you phrased it.

545
01:05:58,333 --> 01:05:59,333
Yes.

546
01:05:59,792 --> 01:06:01,083
Okay, then...

547
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:05,625
Monsieur le Maréchal,

548
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:09,583
if you please,
we would like to know the conditions...

549
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:20,625
He wants you to formally ask for it.

550
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,375
Monsieur le Maréchal,

551
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:33,792
I'm asking you for an armistice.

552
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:37,958
We're asking for an armistice.

553
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:49,833
You have <i>72</i> hours to accept
our conditions. They are non-negotiable.

554
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:53,000
- 72 hours?
- The war will continue until you sign.

555
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:54,333
Monsieur le Maréchal,

556
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:58,125
in the name of God,
don't let 72 hours go by.

557
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,500
People are dying out there.

558
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:08,958
Sign then.

559
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,750
Understood.

560
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:46,458
Soldiers, march.

561
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,750
Soldiers, march.

562
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,333
March, soldiers.

563
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:57,208
Soldiers, march.

564
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,708
Let's go. Out of here!

565
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,083
March, soldiers.

566
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:04,833
March.

567
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:06,833
Soldiers, march.

568
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,958
March, soldiers. Out of here!

569
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,750
Charge!

570
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:26,875
- Faster!
- Hooray!

571
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:29,375
- Faster!
- Hooray!

572
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:31,500
Onwards, men!

573
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,083
Charge!

574
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:40,625
Hooray!

575
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:43,375
Keep ranks!

576
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:45,083
Keep going!

577
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:02,000
Go, go, go!

578
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,000
Let's go, Paul. Come on. Paul!

579
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,375
Get out!

580
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:50,292
Open fire!

581
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,333
Open fire!

582
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:36,167
Get down!

583
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,375
Get down!

584
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:39,458
Take cover!

585
01:13:57,708 --> 01:13:59,708
Get out of here! Get out!

586
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:04,833
Stay where you are and close ranks!

587
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:28,708
Hand grenades!

588
01:14:28,792 --> 01:14:31,708
Aim for the tracks when they're above us.

589
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,500
Let's go, men! Go! Franz!

590
01:14:58,583 --> 01:14:59,583
Franz!

591
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,375
Follow me!

592
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:11,500
Franz!

593
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,083
Come on! Follow me!

594
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:16,083
Franz!

595
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:17,292
Go! Come on!

596
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,375
Paul!

597
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,083
Charge!

598
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:03,583
Paul.

599
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:04,708
Paul!

600
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:21,958
Open fire!

601
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Retreat!

602
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:38,917
Retreat!

603
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:57,125
No, don't shoot! No!

604
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,583
No!

605
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:00,125
No!

606
01:18:00,792 --> 01:18:03,250
Don't! Don't shoot!

607
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:04,333
Albert.

608
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,708
- Albert.
- Come on!

609
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:15,917
Come on!

610
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:22,958
Keep going!

611
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:50,333
Where's Franz?

612
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:51,667
I've lost Franz!

613
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:02,167
Katczinsky!
Secure the machine gun and retreat!

614
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:05,583
We'll regroup in Eguisac,
two kilometres northeast of here.

615
01:19:07,792 --> 01:19:10,500
I am missing my comrades, Sergeant!

616
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,833
And I miss my mother, damn it!

617
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:15,250
Grenades! Ammunition! Let's go!

618
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:18,542
Paul, come on!

619
01:19:46,792 --> 01:19:49,375
This isn't a negotiation.
This is a diktat.

620
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:52,708
Maybe we should return to Spa
to consult with the general staff.

621
01:19:52,792 --> 01:19:54,167
And what good will that do?

622
01:19:54,792 --> 01:19:56,667
Even if we end up losing,

623
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,625
we won't be any worse off
than with this surrender.

624
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:01,667
Besides a few hundred thousand
more deaths.

625
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:05,875
Alsace-Lorraine, occupation of the Rhine,
artillery, locomotives, trains.

626
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,250
This is total capitulation!

627
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:12,458
250,000 Americans are landing
in Europe every month.

628
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:15,958
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai, all lost.

629
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:20,208
The only thing separating us
from a ceasefire is false pride.

630
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:24,292
It's time to deal with the mess
you and your generals have left us.

631
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:26,583
But if you'd rather leave now, go ahead.

632
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,208
We're staying here.

633
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:35,708
It's winter.

634
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,125
Without trains and provisions,
the Bolsheviks will overrun us.

635
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,875
The men will starve on the way home,

636
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:45,375
instead of dying with honour
on the battlefield.

637
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:47,583
Honour?

638
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:52,125
My son was killed in this war.
Where's his honour?

639
01:20:58,583 --> 01:20:59,625
Von Helldorf.

640
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:04,875
Get a few copies of the Allied demands
and telegraph them to headquarters.

641
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,917
Inform the government.

642
01:21:10,292 --> 01:21:12,625
We have <i>72</i> hours, gentlemen,

643
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:16,042
and every minute we waste talking here,
another soldier dies.

644
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,750
Let's find mercy where we can,
but for God's sake,

645
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:23,292
let's end this war.

646
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:10,250
Retreat!

647
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:17,750
They're retreating! Barrage!

648
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,667
Barrage!

649
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:20,083
Be quiet!

650
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:05,542
Shut up.

651
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:09,750
Shut up!

652
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:06,708
No!

653
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:08,208
Comrade.

654
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,042
Comrade.

655
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,250
Comrade.

656
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:14,625
I'm sorry.

657
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I'm sorry.

658
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:20,208
I'm so sorry.

659
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:16,333
House...

660
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,250
Your wife...

661
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,125
I promise.

662
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:25,083
I pro...

663
01:30:12,417 --> 01:30:14,167
When were you born, Brixdorf?

664
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:17,917
1877, in June.

665
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:21,583
A summer child.

666
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:23,792
Yes.

667
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:28,167
What does your father do?

668
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,625
My family owns a manufactory in Holstein.

669
01:30:34,667 --> 01:30:35,667
What kind?

670
01:30:37,542 --> 01:30:39,125
Riding saddles, sir.

671
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,292
Riding saddles.

672
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,250
They'll always sell.

673
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:45,458
Your future is safe.

674
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,208
I'm very lucky.

675
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:51,833
Well?

676
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:54,208
Looking forward to going home?

677
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,417
- When we're not needed here any more?
- Yes.

678
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:02,042
There's a job waiting for me
after the war.

679
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,250
I'll take over the business.

680
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:07,958
Congratulations.

681
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:09,917
What about you?

682
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:13,167
I'm a soldier.

683
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,042
My father was an officer in this regiment.

684
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:20,750
He fought in three wars under Bismarck.

685
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,667
He won all three.

686
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,583
In 1871, he marched on Paris.

687
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:28,042
He came home a hero.

688
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:34,292
I was born too late, Brixdorf.

689
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:37,625
Half a century without war.

690
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:41,292
What is a soldier without war?

691
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,917
Were you close to your father?

692
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,417
As a child, perhaps.

693
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,792
A man is born alone,

694
01:31:57,458 --> 01:31:58,458
he lives alone,

695
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:00,958
and he dies alone.

696
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:32,917
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

697
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Come in.

698
01:32:35,417 --> 01:32:37,042
Von Helldorf, what is it?

699
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:38,500
Hindenburg.

700
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:39,792
Open it then.

701
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:47,625
He urges us to sign.

702
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:52,042
It's over!

703
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:06,708
"the sin of the world,
have mercy on us."

704
01:33:06,792 --> 01:33:10,625
"Lamb of God,
you take away the sin of the world..."

705
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:18,667
Knock on the monastery door,

706
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,417
and you'll find only
thieves and scoundrels.

707
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,792
It's over. The fat pigs have realised.

708
01:33:24,875 --> 01:33:28,667
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, soldier!

709
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,833
Where's the infirmary?

710
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:45,667
- No!
- Just chloroform the man!

711
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,500
Béumer.

712
01:34:02,792 --> 01:34:03,792
Béumer.

713
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:08,583
Béumer.

714
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:12,042
- Tjaden.
- Béumer.

715
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:16,083
What happened? Where did you get hit?

716
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:17,625
Above the knee.

717
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:19,750
I think.

718
01:34:20,417 --> 01:34:21,792
I can't feel anything.

719
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,500
How far above the knee was I shot?

720
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:27,125
I can't lift my head.

721
01:34:28,667 --> 01:34:30,292
Ten centimetres at least.

722
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:36,958
- You're going home, Tjaden.
- You think so?

723
01:34:37,042 --> 01:34:38,042
Yes, of course.

724
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:45,125
How can I be a ranger like this?

725
01:34:47,167 --> 01:34:48,333
For Christ's sake!

726
01:34:49,542 --> 01:34:50,750
You still can.

727
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:54,250
You'll see.

728
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:56,792
I won't let them amputate.

729
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:00,208
I won't live as a cripple.

730
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:02,042
You won't have to.

731
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:04,167
They've patched up much worse here.

732
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:10,292
Oh, Paul.

733
01:35:11,042 --> 01:35:12,667
I'm supposed to give you something.

734
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,333
Is he dead?

735
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:52,667
You have to be brave now.

736
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:55,625
You're alive.

737
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,500
You have to be grateful for that.

738
01:35:57,583 --> 01:35:58,583
For us.

739
01:35:59,042 --> 01:36:00,792
For those who didn't make it.

740
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:01,750
Be quiet.

741
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:04,333
Listen, you can't say that. Not you.

742
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:58,500
That would really suit you.

743
01:36:58,583 --> 01:36:59,792
Not until everyone's here...

744
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:02,083
They're in the infirmary or mass graves.

745
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:04,958
- Dish it up. We can smell it's done.
- I can't.

746
01:37:05,042 --> 01:37:06,500
Why not, you vagrant?

747
01:37:06,583 --> 01:37:10,417
I've cooked for 150.
I can't serve 80 men food for 150!

748
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,917
Are you thick as pig shit?

749
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:16,083
You've received provisions
for the second company.

750
01:37:16,167 --> 01:37:18,792
- We're the second company!
- Yes!

751
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,958
So dish it out, full stop!

752
01:37:21,542 --> 01:37:22,542
Kat!

753
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:24,000
- Kat!
- Paul!

754
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:25,083
Kat!

755
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:26,708
Paul!

756
01:37:27,167 --> 01:37:28,833
- Paul!
- Kat, you're alive!

757
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:30,708
You're alive!

758
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:32,042
Paul!

759
01:37:39,958 --> 01:37:41,000
Tjaden got hit.

760
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,583
He's in the church.

761
01:37:44,083 --> 01:37:45,792
He'll get a double helping from us.

762
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:46,875
- Yes.
- Come on.

763
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:48,708
Careful.

764
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,250
And one here too.

765
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,708
Bloody hell, I thought you were dead.

766
01:37:59,542 --> 01:38:01,208
We'll all die at some point.

767
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:03,667
But not on the home stretch.

768
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:08,208
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

769
01:38:13,917 --> 01:38:14,917
Tjaden.

770
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:17,792
Tjaden.

771
01:38:23,875 --> 01:38:24,875
Kat?

772
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,083
Kat.

773
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:32,500
We brought you some soup.

774
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:34,292
Did you bring some cutlery?

775
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:36,542
Yes, we brought some cutlery too.

776
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,917
Enjoy it.

777
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:09,333
No! Tjaden, stop! Stop it, Tjaden!

778
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:11,167
Tjaden, no!

779
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:16,667
We need help here!

780
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:18,583
Why did you do that?

781
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,500
Why?

782
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:22,958
It's over, boys, it's over.

783
01:39:23,042 --> 01:39:24,417
He's bleeding out!

784
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:26,833
Quiet.

785
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:30,375
Tjaden.

786
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:36,917
Tjaden.

787
01:41:10,958 --> 01:41:11,958
What is it?

788
01:41:14,125 --> 01:41:15,125
I've lost something.

789
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:21,292
Kat, can you speak French?

790
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,542
My mother wanted me to learn French.

791
01:41:35,042 --> 01:41:36,042
And piano.

792
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:40,500
She didn't want me to go to war.

793
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:44,833
"It's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

794
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,917
I wanted to show them I could do it.

795
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:51,208
How does that help us now?

796
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,583
"|n a few weeks, we'll be in Paris."

797
01:41:59,208 --> 01:42:02,375
I can't discard two years
of hand grenades like a pair of socks.

798
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:05,125
- Paul...
- We'll never get rid of the stench.

799
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:07,125
- Enough.
- Ludwig's dead, Franz, Albert...

800
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:08,542
What's it to us now?

801
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,708
At least they're at peace. We're alive.

802
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:22,542
All of this is like a fever.

803
01:42:23,292 --> 01:42:25,708
No one actually wants it,
but suddenly it's here.

804
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:28,833
We didn't want it,
the others didn't want it.

805
01:42:28,917 --> 01:42:31,833
And yet, here we are.
And yet, half the world is here.

806
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:33,083
And God watches on

807
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:36,167
as we slaughter each other.

808
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:41,625
Well...

809
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:46,333
But what do I know?

810
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:47,958
I know nothing.

811
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:50,417
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

812
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:54,083
Get some sleep. We got lucky.

813
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:55,875
Yes.

814
01:43:13,833 --> 01:43:14,833
Kat?

815
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:20,333
What did your son die of?

816
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,958
Smallpox.

817
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,542
I'm afraid of what's to come.

818
01:43:44,167 --> 01:43:45,167
Don't be.

819
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:18,208
Henfl.

820
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:22,708
Taste it.

821
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:27,833
Are they fresh?

822
01:44:30,917 --> 01:44:32,875
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think so.

823
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:58,542
Monsieur le Maréchal.

824
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:07,208
I'm listening.

825
01:45:07,292 --> 01:45:09,042
The Kaiser has abdicated.

826
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:13,667
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

827
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:18,833
The new government will do its utmost
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

828
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:23,292
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

829
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:25,750
risks descending into famine and anarchy.

830
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:29,042
This is a disease of the defeated,
not of the victorious.

831
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:32,208
I don't fear it. I reject any compromise.

832
01:45:33,958 --> 01:45:35,750
Monsieur le Maréchal, please.

833
01:45:37,208 --> 01:45:40,500
Be fair to your enemy,
otherwise he will hate this peace.

834
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:41,583
Fair?

835
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,875
You speak of fairness?

836
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:01,750
Sign it.

837
01:47:06,458 --> 01:47:08,708
Let the minutes record

838
01:47:08,792 --> 01:47:12,958
that the armistice
will take effect in six hours

839
01:47:13,042 --> 01:47:16,792
at the 11th hour
on the 11th day of the 11th month.

840
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:20,250
Very good.

841
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:22,417
The war is over.

842
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:37,917
What will you do now?

843
01:47:40,417 --> 01:47:42,000
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

844
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,042
The plains of Latierre, sir.

845
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:47,125
Eguisac.

846
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,167
I see them too.

847
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:53,042
And German soldiers
running away like rabbits.

848
01:47:55,042 --> 01:47:57,333
The French are farting
into our posts in Latierre,

849
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:59,958
and out there is a train
full of horse fuckers,

850
01:48:00,042 --> 01:48:01,500
selling off our homeland.

851
01:48:05,542 --> 01:48:10,042
Withdraw the recruits from all posts.
Have them assemble in the courtyard.

852
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,042
We're going to sort out this shitty mess!

853
01:48:24,583 --> 01:48:27,667
<i>Any communication with the enemy
remains prohibited.</i>

854
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:33,417
<i>Firstly, hostilities
on the entire front will cease today,</i>

855
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:36,333
<i>11th November,
at 11 o'clock in the morning.</i>

856
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:43,958
<i>Secondly, troops will not cross the lines
held on this day, at this hour.</i>

857
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:46,500
<i>The lines will be accurately marked...</i>

858
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,500
What time is it?

859
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,375
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- Listen.

860
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,125
It's so quiet here.

861
01:49:05,708 --> 01:49:07,000
I think I've gone deaf.

862
01:49:13,417 --> 01:49:14,708
They've signed, Paul.

863
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:21,000
The war's over.

864
01:49:22,542 --> 01:49:23,750
It's over.

865
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:30,250
Are you hungfi'?

866
01:49:31,458 --> 01:49:32,458
I'm huHQTY-

867
01:49:37,458 --> 01:49:38,792
Where are you going?

868
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:40,792
Come on, before the bastard wakes up.

869
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:45,875
- What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
- I don't know.

870
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:47,917
I'm roasting a goose.

871
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:50,125
With red cabbage, potatoes.

872
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,917
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

873
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,208
My God, Paul. My wife, she's beautiful.

874
01:49:56,125 --> 01:49:57,042
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

875
01:49:57,125 --> 01:49:59,292
- What does she look like?
- Well...

876
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,083
Long, dark, curly hair.

877
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:04,833
And she's round and strong.

878
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:06,375
Yeah?

879
01:50:08,583 --> 01:50:09,708
Christmas.

880
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:11,667
It's all so far away.

881
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:14,250
But it isn't. It's very soon.

882
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,208
We want another child. Children, Paul.

883
01:50:21,167 --> 01:50:23,917
Because what's Christmas without children?
It's nothing.

884
01:50:27,208 --> 01:50:28,208
You know, once...

885
01:50:28,917 --> 01:50:30,583
Once we're back home, then...

886
01:50:31,292 --> 01:50:32,958
- Yeah?
- We'll do something big.

887
01:50:33,833 --> 01:50:35,375
The two of us together, okay?

888
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:36,875
Well...

889
01:50:38,792 --> 01:50:39,792
What?

890
01:50:40,458 --> 01:50:43,292
I'm a cobbler, Paul. I repair shoes.

891
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:46,958
Yeah? You can read, write.
You have your school diplomas.

892
01:50:48,125 --> 01:50:49,458
Didn't do me any good.

893
01:50:50,542 --> 01:50:51,750
What are we going to do?

894
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,917
Nail soles on shoes together?

895
01:50:54,833 --> 01:50:56,292
Are you trying to insult me?

896
01:50:57,208 --> 01:50:59,167
I can't even read a letter from my wife.

897
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:01,625
Go to college, Paul.

898
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:04,083
Or I'll shoot you right here.

899
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:07,917
My trousers are falling down.

900
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:11,458
My trousers are loose.

901
01:51:14,125 --> 01:51:15,792
You'll just have to eat a little.

902
01:51:17,125 --> 01:51:19,500
Soon we'll be home,
then we can eat what we want.

903
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,583
Whatever we want.

904
01:51:46,417 --> 01:51:47,417
It's your turn.

905
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:50,125
If the farmer catches me again,

906
01:51:50,208 --> 01:51:51,542
he'll shoot me.

907
01:51:56,583 --> 01:51:58,250
Watch out for the damn dog.

908
01:51:58,333 --> 01:51:59,333
Yeah.

909
01:53:13,208 --> 01:53:14,208
Look.

910
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:18,542
It's really good.

911
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:22,917
Want some?

912
01:53:25,333 --> 01:53:26,333
Shit.

913
01:54:17,292 --> 01:54:18,292
Hey!

914
01:54:19,167 --> 01:54:20,208
Stop!

915
01:54:29,292 --> 01:54:31,792
Kat! Run!

916
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,250
Bastard!

917
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Damn.

918
01:55:02,042 --> 01:55:03,250
Oh, crap.

919
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:04,958
Look at this.

920
01:55:05,042 --> 01:55:06,042
What is it?

921
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:08,083
- I got lucky.
- He hit the eggs?

922
01:55:09,958 --> 01:55:11,375
- Press on it.
- Okay.

923
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,458
Come on, get it all in there.

924
01:55:19,042 --> 01:55:20,042
All of it.

925
01:55:22,917 --> 01:55:24,000
We can fry them.

926
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:27,417
Nonsense. We'll eat them right now.
Like this is fine too.

927
01:55:46,375 --> 01:55:47,958
Doesn't get better than that.

928
01:55:49,208 --> 01:55:50,208
I'll be right back.

929
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:28,500
Kat?

930
01:57:33,417 --> 01:57:34,500
Kat?

931
01:57:38,958 --> 01:57:39,958
Kat!

932
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
What happened?

933
01:57:43,917 --> 01:57:44,917
Let's go.

934
01:57:46,708 --> 01:57:49,542
- Who fired the shot?
- The little shit from the farm.

935
01:57:50,625 --> 01:57:51,833
The farmer's boy.

936
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:54,875
Kat!

937
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:57,250
What a mess.

938
01:58:05,292 --> 01:58:06,292
HOW big?

939
01:58:06,833 --> 01:58:09,000
Little finger. I'll get the bullet out.

940
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:11,042
No, just give me a cigarette.

941
01:58:11,708 --> 01:58:13,458
Leave that to the medic.

942
01:58:32,333 --> 01:58:34,625
They stuck me
in a class of seven-year-olds.

943
01:58:36,083 --> 01:58:37,583
I had already started shaving.

944
01:58:39,458 --> 01:58:40,667
Find a word...

945
01:58:42,667 --> 01:58:44,208
that rhymes with trifle.

946
01:58:48,417 --> 01:58:50,583
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

947
01:58:56,917 --> 01:58:58,583
For Christ's sake!

948
01:58:59,792 --> 01:59:02,083
Did it have to happen now, of all times?

949
01:59:05,917 --> 01:59:07,417
- We have to keep going.
- Yeah.

950
01:59:08,375 --> 01:59:09,375
Keep going.

951
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:16,458
Okay? Kat?

952
01:59:18,333 --> 01:59:19,542
Rifle.

953
01:59:20,542 --> 01:59:22,167
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

954
01:59:32,583 --> 01:59:36,167
When we get home, you're going
to make me a new pair of boots.

955
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:37,792
I'm walking my feet bloody.

956
01:59:52,292 --> 01:59:53,292
Stop!

957
01:59:56,625 --> 01:59:57,625
Stop!

958
01:59:59,333 --> 02:00:00,333
Stop!

959
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:01,875
Stop!

960
02:00:03,417 --> 02:00:04,417
Stop!

961
02:00:52,292 --> 02:00:53,292
Medic!

962
02:00:55,917 --> 02:00:57,042
Medic!

963
02:01:25,833 --> 02:01:27,667
You could've saved yourself the trouble.

964
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:32,167
He's dead.

965
02:01:37,167 --> 02:01:39,500
It's... It's just a small bullet wound.

966
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:42,917
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

967
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:44,958
His organs are poisoned.

968
02:01:51,375 --> 02:01:52,417
Unconscious.

969
02:01:54,750 --> 02:01:55,792
He's dead.

970
02:01:56,458 --> 02:01:58,042
I know more about these things.

971
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
That... That's impossible. I was...

972
02:02:01,542 --> 02:02:03,292
I was just talking to him.

973
02:02:03,375 --> 02:02:04,375
He's unconscious.

974
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:07,375
He's unconscious.

975
02:02:14,792 --> 02:02:16,000
You see?

976
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:18,750
He was just unlucky.

977
02:02:19,375 --> 02:02:20,375
So close to the end.

978
02:02:56,167 --> 02:02:59,792
<i>Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee</i>

979
02:02:59,875 --> 02:03:03,292
<i>Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee</i>

980
02:03:03,375 --> 02:03:07,083
<i>And a glass of wine</i>

981
02:03:07,167 --> 02:03:09,792
<i>And a glass of wine</i>

982
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,750
<i>Girl, I do love you...</i>

983
02:03:44,542 --> 02:03:46,250
Come along, soldier!

984
02:03:46,333 --> 02:03:49,417
The General's sending us home!
We're going home!

985
02:03:50,083 --> 02:03:51,792
We're going home!

986
02:04:09,708 --> 02:04:12,083
Go on, keep going!

987
02:04:12,875 --> 02:04:14,000
Step it up a notch!

988
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:34,208
Attention!

989
02:04:40,417 --> 02:04:41,417
Soldiers,

990
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,125
we stand here as brothers

991
02:04:45,333 --> 02:04:48,917
in a world of enemies, forced to watch

992
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,708
as German social democrats render
our beloved people defenceless

993
02:04:54,208 --> 02:04:57,833
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

994
02:04:59,208 --> 02:05:00,208
Comrades,

995
02:05:01,333 --> 02:05:03,125
you will be going home soon

996
02:05:03,208 --> 02:05:05,292
to parents, wives and children.

997
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:07,583
The war is over.

998
02:05:08,375 --> 02:05:13,083
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

999
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:18,125
The reward of admiration
for everything you've achieved here.

1000
02:05:19,417 --> 02:05:20,958
But, comrades,

1001
02:05:22,458 --> 02:05:25,250
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes,

1002
02:05:27,292 --> 02:05:28,167
or as cowards

1003
02:05:28,250 --> 02:05:31,417
who chickened out
when it really came down to it?

1004
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:33,625
Soldiers,

1005
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:38,333
we're going to strike now
with all our rig our and might.

1006
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:41,708
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1007
02:05:42,667 --> 02:05:45,333
We will seize the plains before 11 a.m.

1008
02:05:45,417 --> 02:05:48,958
and end this war with a victory!

1009
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:55,042
Onwards with God who will be with us,
as He was with our fathers.

1010
02:05:56,667 --> 02:05:59,333
I'm not going back into battle. Not me!

1011
02:05:59,417 --> 02:06:00,417
Shut up!

1012
02:06:09,625 --> 02:06:10,625
Take aim!

1013
02:06:11,708 --> 02:06:13,167
- No!
- Fire!

1014
02:06:50,708 --> 02:06:52,667
Company, halt!

1015
02:06:57,458 --> 02:06:59,125
Order arms!

1016
02:06:59,667 --> 02:07:01,458
Fix bayonets!

1017
02:07:17,417 --> 02:07:18,417
What time?

1018
02:07:19,125 --> 02:07:20,333
Fifteen minutes to go.

1019
02:07:57,625 --> 02:07:58,708
Belonged to Lefévre.

1020
02:08:00,292 --> 02:08:02,708
Poor bastard. He saved it for the end.

1021
02:08:02,792 --> 02:08:05,083
- He won't need it any more.
- Thank you, sir.

1022
02:08:09,375 --> 02:08:11,042
Here's to you and to Lefévre.

1023
02:08:17,542 --> 02:08:18,542
Well, it's good.

1024
02:08:22,167 --> 02:08:23,292
The nightmare is over.

1025
02:09:23,375 --> 02:09:26,333
Enemy attack!

1026
02:09:26,417 --> 02:09:28,083
- In position!
- In position!

1027
02:09:31,167 --> 02:09:32,167
Fire!

1028
02:09:32,958 --> 02:09:34,167
Fire!

1029
02:09:41,833 --> 02:09:43,167
Fire!

1030
02:10:09,375 --> 02:10:10,750
Grenades!

1031
02:10:21,792 --> 02:10:22,958
Charge!

1032
02:11:19,208 --> 02:11:20,500
No, no! Please!

1033
02:11:25,958 --> 02:11:27,125
No! Don't! No!

1034
02:13:11,625 --> 02:13:13,333
Cease fire!

1035
02:13:13,417 --> 02:13:14,958
It's eleven o'clock!

1036
02:13:16,042 --> 02:13:19,792
Cease fire!

1037
02:13:20,292 --> 02:13:21,875
It's eleven o'clock!

1038
02:16:20,125 --> 02:16:21,500
Are you all right, soldier?

1039
02:16:22,875 --> 02:16:23,917
Yes.

1040
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Well, then...

1041
02:16:25,792 --> 02:16:27,042
Start collecting, please.

1042
02:19:48,542 --> 02:19:51,625
SHORTLY AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR
IN OCTOBER 1914,

1043
02:19:51,708 --> 02:19:54,958
THE WESTERN FRONT BECAME BOGGED DOWN
IN TRENCH WARFARE.

1044
02:19:56,625 --> 02:20:02,750
AT THE END OF THE WAR IN NOVEMBER 1918,
THE FRONT LINE HAD BARELY MOVED.

1045
02:20:04,417 --> 02:20:07,125
MORE THAN THREE MILLION SOLDIERS
DIED HERE,

1046
02:20:07,208 --> 02:20:10,792
OFTEN WHILE FIGHTING TO GAIN
ONLY A FEW HUNDRED METRES OF GROUND.

1047
02:20:12,542 --> 02:20:18,708
DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR,
ALMOST 17 MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.

1048
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:27,583
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

1049
02:26:51,375 --> 02:26:56,375
