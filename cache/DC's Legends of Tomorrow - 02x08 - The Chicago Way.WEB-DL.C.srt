1
00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:02,740
<i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:05,124
<i>and all of history is
vulnerable to attack,</i>

3
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:07,049
<i>which is why we must
travel through time</i>

4
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,852
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called time aberrations,</i>

5
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:12,321
<i>and to erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:14,891
<i>We are a team of outcasts and misfits,</i>

7
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:16,826
<i>so please don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:19,662
<i>We're something else. We're legends.</i>

9
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:22,331
<i>Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

10
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,834
You're back! I love you, Dad.

11
00:00:24,836 --> 00:00:27,003
When I last left 2016,

12
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,771
that young woman did not exist.

13
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:31,207
I do not want to lose my daughter.

14
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:33,160
<i>This amulet looks a lot like the one</i>

15
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:34,610
<i>we recovered off the Nazis.</i>

16
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:36,879
- There's gotta be a connection.
- And we know that Damien Darhk

17
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,948
and the speedster are
willing to kill for it.

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,404
Mr. Capone...

19
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:03,973
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

20
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:05,908
I cancelled tickets to the opera,

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,811
'cause I heard there
was new players in town.

22
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:11,781
No one told me it was Halloween.

23
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:14,150
Well, it's more like Christmas.

24
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:16,052
That's... I like that, it's very good.

25
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:19,055
See, my associate and I have
come with a proposition.

26
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:20,656
We've seen how you run your empire,

27
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:21,958
and we're impressed,

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,392
but there's room for improvement.

29
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:25,361
We'd like to offer our services.

30
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:27,096
I got a better idea.

31
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:32,535
How 'bout I show you how
business is done in my town?

32
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,438
You or me?

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,075
Oh, I've got...

34
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:41,077
this.

35
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,645
By now you've probably surmised

36
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,947
that my friend and I
aren't from around here.

37
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:47,116
- What do you freaks want?
- To help.

38
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,385
I thought I made...
did I not make that perfectly clear?

39
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:51,120
New enemies are coming to Chicago,

40
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:53,255
and they will endanger your enterprises.

41
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:55,825
And you're saying you
two can help me out?

42
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:59,395
Actually, there's three of us.

43
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:01,964
Pleasure to meet you.

44
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:04,667
My name is Malcolm Merlyn.

46
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:24,553
Okay.

47
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:26,055
New suit's good, but I think it needs

48
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:27,790
those modifications Cisco mentioned.

49
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,825
It's a poor hero to blame a super suit.

50
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:32,061
Eh, exoskeleton. Come on, let's do this.

51
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,330
I wanna get the kinks worked
out before our next mission.

52
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:35,865
What's the rush? I think I'm doing

53
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:37,933
a pretty good job picking up your slack.

54
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:40,169
We scientists have a
name for that phenomenon.

55
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,771
It's called beginner's luck.

56
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:43,839
Hey!

57
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:47,376
- What do you think you're doing?
- Uh, s... sparring.

58
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:49,164
Yeah, he's helping me
calibrate the new suit.

59
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,579
Last time y'all decided to spar,

60
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,648
- you wrecked my cargo bay.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,784
Hey!

62
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:56,952
Don't make me come down here again.

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,327
Don't you make me
come down here again.

64
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:06,762
I'm gonna come down here again,
I'm watching you.

65
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:10,266
Hey!

66
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:12,234
- What is going on with them?
- You don't have any brothers

67
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,603
- or sisters, do you?
- Nope.

68
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:17,506
Sibling rivalry. Nothing to
be too worried about.

69
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,844
This is why I'm glad

70
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:23,546
I'm an only child.

71
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:35,357
Oh, Jefferson, I was just, uh,
catching up on some reading.

72
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:40,062
"The Fundamentals of Motorcycle Repair"?

73
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:43,332
It's a fascinating subject.
Of course, I'm also researching

74
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:46,836
the amulet Ms. Lance last
stole from Damien Darhk.

75
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:48,437
You know, you might be
a genius when it comes

76
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,573
to nuclear physics,
but when it comes to lying,

77
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,508
you kinda suck at it, bro.

78
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:56,450
You were thinking about
her again, weren't you?

79
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:59,749
I can't help it.

80
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:02,918
Every day, I recover new memories of her,

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,421
each one a gift.

82
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:08,824
Then I find myself worrying,
"What if there's a car accident,

83
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:11,527
or... or a fire? Or she could
be struck by lightning."

84
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:13,325
Yeah, I'd be more worried
about what happens

85
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,997
when Sara finds out you have a daughter

86
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:17,600
- that's a time aberration.
- She's not an aberration.

87
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:20,536
The only reason Lily exists

88
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,171
is because you convinced
your younger self

89
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,839
to pay more attention to your wife,

90
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:26,408
and less attention to
putting on a condom.

91
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,444
You changed history,

92
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:30,780
and one of these days,
either Nate or Gideon

93
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:32,848
or anybody revealing the
historical timeline's

94
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,117
- gonna figure that out.
- Not necessarily.

95
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:37,253
According to my calculations,

96
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:40,756
if Lily's impact on history
remains small enough,

97
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:43,459
she may be able to go undetected.

98
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,596
<i>Excuse me, but
Dr. Haywood's seismograph</i>

99
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:50,599
<i>- has detected an aberration.
- You were saying?</i>

100
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:53,135
- Who installed the alarms?
- That'd be me.

101
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,237
- We should kill him.
- We got another one?

102
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,306
Yeah, and judging by these
readings, it's a major one.

103
00:04:57,308 --> 00:04:59,508
Is there really cause for all this alarm?

104
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,977
Perhaps the aberration
isn't as large as we think.

105
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,547
<i>The temporal tremors
originate from Union Station</i>

106
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:08,617
<i>in Chicago, Illinois,
October 17th in the year 1927.</i>

107
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:11,320
That's fantastic.

108
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:13,689
I-I mean, I've always
wanted to visit the roaring '20s

109
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,257
right in the middle of Prohibition.

110
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,726
That means no drinking. That's not good.

111
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:20,563
Well, actually under Capone,
Chicago was a hot bed of vice.

112
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:23,032
There was illegal drinking,
gambling, prostitution.

113
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:25,434
Well, then, let's fire up
a tub and get there.

114
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:28,671
Grab your fedoras,
we're going to the 1920s.

115
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:41,116
I can't believe we're here.

116
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:44,153
What are you so happy about?

117
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:46,522
When I was younger,
I'd read my mother's magazines,

118
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:48,824
and I'd see photos of Chicago.

119
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:51,193
I'd never thought I'd
see it with my own eyes.

120
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:53,462
Well, keep those eyes focused
on whatever's causing

121
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:55,764
those temporal tremors.

122
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,066
Copy that.

123
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,774
That's Eliot Ness.

124
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:09,511
He doesn't
look like Kevin Costner.

125
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:11,046
What if somebody tipped off Capone

126
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,249
that Ness is a future threat?

127
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,117
Then his life's in danger.

128
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,820
Don't worry, I'm on it.

129
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:18,854
You go.

130
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,094
Mr. Ness! Mr. Ness, hi.

131
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:27,897
Uh, you don't know me.
My name is Ray Palmer.

132
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:30,699
I have reason to believe that
your life may be in danger.

133
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,167
It'd be best if you came with me.

134
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,070
Mr. Ness, I'm Sergeant
Jones with Chicago PD.

135
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:37,973
We're your security detail
on the way to the bureau.

136
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:39,775
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Palmer,

137
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:41,610
but it looks like I'm in good hands.

138
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:46,649
Okay.

139
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:47,917
What just happened?

140
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,919
Well, it's the strangest thing.

141
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:55,124
Uh, two cops just escorted
Eliot Ness to the bureau.

142
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:57,092
They're not escorting him to the bureau.

143
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:59,161
They're gonna throw him in the river.

144
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:02,698
- What?
- Ray, 1920s Chicago PD

145
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,134
was the most corrupt
police force in history.

146
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:07,569
Almost all of them are
on Capone's payroll.

147
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:09,438
Did you or did you not

148
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,673
see "The Untouchables"?

149
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:12,241
Jax, Stein,

150
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:14,310
<i>I need you to intercept Eliot Ness.</i>

151
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:17,379
<i>He's being escorted by
two police officers.</i>

152
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,459
Grey! Didn't you hear Sara?

153
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,027
No.

154
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:36,765
Oh, wait, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

155
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:40,903
What the hell happened back there?

156
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:44,206
- How come you didn't stop him?
- I'm sorry, I got distracted.

157
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,408
- By what?
- Tell her, Grey.

158
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,010
It's not the professor's fault.

159
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,145
Ray let Ness walk right
into Capone's hands.

160
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:51,981
They were police officers,
and who's to say

161
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,316
they didn't take him to the
FBI like they said they would?

162
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:55,784
Gideon, pull up the Chicago Chronicle,

163
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:58,821
<i>- October 24th, 1931.
- Ah, yes,</i>

164
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:01,323
<i>the day Al Capone originally
went down for tax evasion,</i>

165
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:03,025
<i>only in this version of history,</i>

166
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:05,260
<i>he becomes something far
worse than a criminal,</i>

167
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:06,829
<i>he becomes a politician.</i>

168
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:09,331
Al Capone becomes mayor?

169
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,934
Okay, I take it back.
Ness probably is screwed.

170
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:13,335
Well, let's find out where they took him,

171
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:17,339
so we can unscrew
him before this happens.

172
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:24,847
Special agent Ness,

173
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,582
you're having a hell of a first day.

174
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:30,519
How do you know who I am?
And when I was coming to town?

175
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:33,589
Some new friends of mine,
they whispered in my ear,

176
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:35,290
so me and the boys decided
we would get you

177
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:38,394
a nice welcome present. Cement galoshes.

178
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:39,962
Very popular in Chicago these days,

179
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:42,931
and I have a feeling these
will be just your size.

180
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,501
Now, come on, try 'em on.

181
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:49,838
- Any luck finding Ness?
- By the time you find Ness,

182
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,308
he'll be swimming with the fishes.

183
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,144
Mick, you beautiful genius, that's it.

184
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:57,012
About time someone noticed.

185
00:08:57,014 --> 00:09:00,716
Gideon, set the course to
shipping harbor dock 39.

186
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:02,384
What makes you so sure he'll be there?

187
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:04,553
In the '20s, dock 39 was where Capone

188
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:06,555
brought all of his enemies
and tied cinderblocks

189
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:08,223
to their feet and tossed
them in the harbor.

190
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,926
It became known as Cadaver's Cove.

191
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:19,535
This isn't personal. I'm a businessman,

192
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:22,304
and the Feds, well,
they're bad for business.

193
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:25,707
The Bureau of Investigation
will never stop fighting,

194
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:27,409
not until the fight is done.

195
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:29,978
Poetic.

196
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,880
I hope you wrote that down somewhere.

197
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:34,183
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Ness.

198
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:40,422
All this for some booze?

199
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:43,759
I like it. Nice getups.

200
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:46,995
Seems our new friends have
got some friends of their own.

201
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:48,097
Get 'em, boys.

202
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,583
I'm going after Capone.

203
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:13,489
Let 'em go, we got Ness.

204
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:15,357
- Is he dead?
- Unconscious.

205
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:17,793
He took on a lot of water.

206
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:21,597
Merlyn was right.

207
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,599
They took the bait.

208
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:33,838
<i>Special agent Ness has
suffered severe hypoxia.</i>

209
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,974
<i>It will take some time to
reverse his brain damage.</i>

210
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,476
You can undo brain damage?

211
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:40,511
Why haven't you helped Rory out?

212
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:41,779
<i>Who says I haven't?</i>

213
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:44,448
All right, let's get serious.

214
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,785
Obviously, Capone somehow knew
that Ness would be the one

215
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,720
- to take him down.
- When we were at the docks,

216
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:51,889
Capone said something
about having new friends.

217
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:55,126
But we have a bigger problem.
I mean, another problem.

218
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,428
This week, Ness and his team
are supposed to obtain

219
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,130
Capone's ledger from his bookkeeper.

220
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:02,233
Now the IRS's case against
Capone for tax evasion

221
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,502
is completely dependent on that ledger.

222
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:06,637
Which Ness can't grab
while he's lying here

223
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,772
with brain damage.

224
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:09,740
Exactly, which means

225
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:13,043
one of us has to take his place.

226
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:15,179
- That's a stupid idea.
- It's pre-Internet.

227
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:16,814
Nobody knows what Ness looks like.

228
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,582
Nate's right, I got this.

229
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:20,317
Actually, I was thinking I got this.

230
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:21,952
Well, yeah, I mean, if the mission

231
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:23,754
was impersonating Brad Pitt,
you'd be the man,

232
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,389
but I think we can all
agree if anyone here

233
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,258
looks like a G-man here, it's me.

234
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,894
Well, we're in this situation,
because you learned history

235
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:32,563
- from a movie.
- All right, enough.

236
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,599
Ray, I'm sorry, but Nate
knows more about this area

237
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:37,034
than any of us.

238
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:38,636
- What's the plan?
- Okay.

239
00:11:38,638 --> 00:11:40,571
So if Capone's ledger is anywhere,

240
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:43,741
it's probably at his primary
speakeasy, the Chelsea Club,

241
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,543
so Ray and I will go to the Bureau,

242
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:48,746
assemble Ness's team,
lead him to bust the place up,

243
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:51,048
- grab the ledger.
- Great, take Rory with you.

244
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,617
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

245
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:56,420
Does this face look like a cop to you?

246
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:58,155
If this were a JSA mission,

247
00:11:58,157 --> 00:12:00,191
we'd probably also send
someone undercover at the club.

248
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:02,193
Well, I'm not doing that either.

249
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:03,794
I'm done playing dress-up.

250
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:05,095
Fine.

251
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:06,931
I'll go the club with Jax and Stein,

252
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:09,266
and you can stay here, drink your beers,

253
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:10,734
and watch over Ness.

254
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:11,902
What about me?

255
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:15,539
- You can watch over him.
- What?

256
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,641
Sorry.

257
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:22,079
Beer.

258
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:28,118
- There he is.
- Ah.

259
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,155
- Special agent Cole Bennett.
- Yes, and you are?

260
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:33,557
Special agent Eliot Ness.
This is my associate,

261
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,160
- Bob De Niro.
- Well, I've assembled the team

262
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:38,128
your telegram specified, Mr. Ness.

263
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,030
Well, hope they're ready for some action,

264
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,187
'cause they're gonna get it.

265
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:43,367
Tonight we're gonna take
down the Chelsea club.

266
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:45,603
Our files say Capone's got
nothing to do with that place.

267
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:48,072
Well, your files are
embarrassingly outdated.

268
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:50,007
We've learned Capone
has a stake in the club,

269
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,809
and furthermore, he hides
a sizeable amount

270
00:12:51,811 --> 00:12:53,344
of Canadian whiskey in there.

271
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,112
You fellas sure do
know an impressive amount

272
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:56,714
about Capone's organization.

273
00:12:56,716 --> 00:12:59,817
Well, let's just say we
have people on the inside.

274
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:07,658
This place is quite lively,
considering we haven't seen

275
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,094
a single bottle of alcohol.

276
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,463
Well, Nate said it was a speakeasy.

277
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:15,366
Yeah, that's why it's called a speakeasy.

278
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:17,635
You gotta know how to do
ask for the good stuff.

279
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:19,403
Ah.

280
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:24,508
Excuse me, I'd like a club soda, please.

281
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,877
One club soda coming up.

282
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,612
Here's what I wanna know.

283
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:30,614
Why would somebody from
the future be interested

284
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,249
in helping Al Capone?

285
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:34,551
Well, we're here to find out.

286
00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:39,423
This is just a club soda.

287
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,932
- You feeling all right?
- Fine.

288
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:50,100
I guess I'm just surprised
you'd rather stay here

289
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:52,736
on the ship than be out there.

290
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:56,073
1920 Chicago seemed like your kinda town.

291
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:58,075
You know, when I was younger,

292
00:13:58,077 --> 00:14:00,811
I always wanted to be a police officer.

293
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,913
I didn't care that I was a girl.
I just really wanted

294
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:05,416
- to wear a badge.
- Cute.

295
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:08,452
The bad guys have all the fun, you know.

296
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:15,759
It doesn't look like you're
having much fun right now.

297
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,435
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

298
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:33,277
Leonard.

299
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,980
- I must be losing my mind.
- Of course you are.

300
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:37,548
Why else would you still be here

301
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,551
taking orders like a well-trained puppy?

302
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:42,519
You're not right in the head, Mick.

303
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:46,757
That's why I'm here, to set you straight.

304
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:57,468
Ray, Nate, what's your status?

305
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,938
<i>Be careful, we're coming in.
Don't get caught in our net.</i>

306
00:15:03,743 --> 00:15:06,643
What are squares like you
doing in a place like this?

307
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:09,046
- You.
- Jefferson.

308
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:14,451
What the hell?

309
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:16,954
Jefferson, the speedster is here, run!

310
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:24,028
Nobody move!

311
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,063
- Federal officers.
- You're all under arrest

312
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:27,664
for violations of the Volstead Act.

313
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,900
Man!

314
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:32,102
Hey, take it easy, that's our inside guy.

315
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:34,304
Considering this club's
as dry as the Sahara,

316
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:37,041
I'd say you need a new inside guy,
special agent Ness.

317
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:39,643
Yeah.

318
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:41,378
What the hell's happening in here?

319
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,547
Damien Darhk showed
up with the speedster.

320
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,582
They took Grey and Sara.

321
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:55,232
This whole Capone
aberration was a distraction.

322
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:58,209
Darhk and his speedster pal
knew it'd attract our attention.

323
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:00,011
But why kidnap Sara and Stein?

324
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:01,646
I mean, what could he want with them?

325
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:03,047
Still trying to work that one out.

326
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,449
- You all right, Jax?
- I'm pissed.

327
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,084
Let it go, kid.

328
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:08,486
There's nothing you can
do about the speedsters.

329
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:10,955
We'll see about that.

330
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:14,292
Long story short, Rip
had a secret armory.

331
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:16,828
Me and Grey found it alongside
future Barry's message

332
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,929
about the oncoming war.

333
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,263
This speedster killed Rex

334
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,998
and kidnapped our friends.

335
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,600
We need him in the brig before dawn.

336
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:25,770
Yeah, if this weapon does
what I think it does,

337
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:27,171
we'll stop him dead in his tracks.

338
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:28,673
Yeah, well, at's all well and good,

339
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:30,508
but we still need to get
Capone's ledger back,

340
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,210
otherwise history's screwed.

341
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:34,245
Since your last plan was a total bust,

342
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,747
I suggest somebody else
do the strategic thinking.

343
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:38,316
Let me guess, that's you?

344
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:41,419
All right, so let's
hear your brilliant idea.

345
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:43,855
Well, I don't have one, but
it's gonna be better than yours.

346
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:46,157
Enough.

347
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,927
If you wanna nail
Capone and Rex's killer,

348
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:51,996
you can't do it by playing a boy scout

349
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:55,867
or an historian or a policeman.

350
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:59,237
We do this my way,

351
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,172
like a criminal.

352
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:12,810
Yes, the Ritz-Carleton
it is definitely not.

353
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:14,085
How did we get here?

354
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:16,888
It appears our speedster
friend got the better of us.

355
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,490
- And he wasn't working alone.
- Yes.

356
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:23,261
Damien Darhk, a rather
predictable bedfellow

357
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:26,264
for Al Capone.

358
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,332
And don't forget about me.

359
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:31,135
It's been a long time, Sara.

360
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,738
You look good for someone
who's come back from the dead.

361
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,874
Why am I not surprised
that you and Damien Darhk

362
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,342
would find each other?

363
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:40,244
What do you want with us?

364
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,647
You have something we need,

365
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:46,050
and while my partners think
I'm a fool for trying,

366
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:47,985
I would like to broker a deal with you.

367
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:51,889
You have in your possession an amulet.

368
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:54,158
Give it to me,

369
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,627
and I will give you nine
years of your life back.

370
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:58,296
What are you talking about?

371
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:00,631
Oh, maybe Oliver didn't tell you,

372
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:03,968
but I was the one who arranged
to blow up the Queen's Gambit.

373
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:09,774
That was the day everything
changed for you, Sara,

374
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:11,943
hundreds of dominos toppling.

375
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:17,481
Dr. Ivo, Slade Wilson,
the League of Assassins,

376
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,150
losing your sister.

377
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:21,419
And you losing your son.

378
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:23,287
We both get clean slates.

379
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:25,423
Why don't you just ask
your speedster friend

380
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:26,857
to take you back in time?

381
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:29,694
Because Malcolm's just his errand boy,

382
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:32,496
sent to retrieve the amulet.

383
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:34,332
Why is it so important?

384
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:36,534
What does it matter?

385
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:39,637
I'm giving you and your sister
a chance to live normal lives.

386
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:42,206
To go back, maybe go to college,

387
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:47,044
meet a nice boy, or a
girl, and settle down.

388
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:48,546
No thank you.

389
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:51,315
I was never meant for those things,

390
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:53,451
and I know that now.

391
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:55,253
And besides, you can't just go back

392
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,854
and change things like that.

393
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,458
Why not?

394
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,194
Because time is sacred,

395
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:05,930
and it can't be changed to
suit any one person's desire

396
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:09,800
without harming the lives
of countless others.

397
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:12,970
But you wouldn't remember
any of this, would you?

398
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:16,807
You would be blissfully
unaware of time travel,

399
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:20,578
of loss, of heartbreak.

400
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,480
You'd be happy,

401
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:25,483
and isn't that what
matters most in the end?

402
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:31,722
Hey, Malcolm.

403
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,858
I'll take a nightmare that's real

404
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,627
over a dream that's a lie.

405
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:44,402
That was remarkably selfless.

406
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:47,204
Well, I had a good teacher.

407
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:49,874
Yes, Captain Hunter.

408
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:52,610
No.

409
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,745
I was talking about you.

410
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:06,457
What the hell?

411
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:11,395
Shoot her!

412
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:21,872
Come on! Get out of here!

413
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:23,140
Get out of here!

414
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:27,945
Hi, I'm Clyde. That's Bonnie.

415
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:30,514
Get out of the truck.

416
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:32,383
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

417
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:34,251
Yes, now where's the truck headed?

418
00:20:34,253 --> 00:20:36,487
Uh, 31st and Fort Dearborn Drive.

419
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,090
Much obliged.

420
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:43,828
Hold that.

421
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,730
Aren't you forgetting something?

422
00:20:45,732 --> 00:20:47,398
Nate and Ray?

423
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,667
Those idiots have done
nothing but get in the way.

424
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:52,002
Uh, guys, we're...
We're standing right here.

425
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:55,188
Well... get in the back.

426
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,274
I can't believe Malcolm
thought I would actually

427
00:20:57,276 --> 00:21:00,077
take that deal.

428
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,780
You really weren't tempted?

429
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:05,049
Of course,

430
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:08,386
but we can't let a man
like that change history.

431
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:10,888
Imagine the havoc that it would cause.

432
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,224
Oh, yes, when it comes to time travel,

433
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:16,227
even the best of us can wreak havoc.

434
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:18,929
What do you mean?

435
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:21,432
Martin?

436
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:22,700
You have been acting weird

437
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:25,102
ever since we fought the Dominators.

438
00:21:25,104 --> 00:21:28,472
What's going on?

439
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:30,908
It was an innocent mistake...

440
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,111
I was just trying to give
myself a bit of marital advice.

441
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:36,814
Never did I imagine it
would ever have an effect.

442
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:39,750
You caused an aberration?

443
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:43,487
I have a daughter.

444
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:45,322
A what?

445
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:50,528
A full-grown human progeny

446
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,164
who I never even knew I had.

447
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,133
- This beautiful, brilliant...
- And not real.

448
00:21:56,135 --> 00:22:00,805
At first, no, but then I remembered.

449
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:04,108
I remembered the...
The countless nights I spent

450
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,743
pacing the neighborhood
with her stroller,

451
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:08,512
trying to get her to sleep. The... the...

452
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:13,150
The way my heart melted the
first time she smiled at me.

453
00:22:13,152 --> 00:22:16,821
The... the distress she caused
her kindergarten teacher

454
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:20,191
when she insisted on
singing the periodic table

455
00:22:20,193 --> 00:22:22,326
instead of the alphabet. I-I...

456
00:22:22,328 --> 00:22:24,762
I remembered all of it.

457
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:26,997
But none of that happened to you.

458
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:30,768
But the memories are real.

459
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,270
They are a part of me now.

460
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:36,907
She is a part of me now.

461
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:41,612
And I love her.

462
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:44,215
Martin, you were the
one who talked me into

463
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,317
not killing Damien Darhk,

464
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,185
into not bringing my sister back,

465
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:51,655
because of the damage that
it would do to history.

466
00:22:51,657 --> 00:22:55,960
Ugh, I'm sorry, but my ears were burning.

467
00:22:55,962 --> 00:23:00,030
I understand Malcolm tried to play nice

468
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:02,399
and offer you a deal.

469
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:03,934
Since you didn't bite,
we're gonna have to be

470
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,370
a little rougher.

471
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:08,272
Do your worst.

472
00:23:08,274 --> 00:23:10,307
Oh, you didn't think that I meant you?

473
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:14,311
Oh, I fear with your
league-training torture,

474
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:18,983
while fun, would be a waste of time.

475
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:25,856
Sara?

476
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:28,058
Whatever you do,
don't give them anything.

477
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,360
No!

478
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:32,496
Martin! Martin!

479
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:47,611
Professor Stein, am I right?

480
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:50,581
- Do I know you?
- Let's just say...

481
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:54,985
It's complicated.

482
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:58,055
I'm not gonna lie to ya.
This, um, little toy

483
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:01,458
usually leaves the subject well dead,

484
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,893
but I've adjusted it

485
00:24:02,895 --> 00:24:06,051
so that you should only
feel a little pain...

486
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:10,434
In theory.

487
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:28,218
You're not the regular driver.
What happened to Vinny?

488
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,422
Vinny, he, uh, he's hanging
out with your mother.

489
00:24:31,424 --> 00:24:33,157
- What?
- What?

490
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:38,329
- So here's the plan.
- Is for us to rescue the people

491
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:40,564
- that got caught because of you.
- She's talking about you.

492
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:41,903
Nah, I think she was talking about you.

493
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:43,000
Shut up!

494
00:24:43,002 --> 00:24:44,401
You're supposed to be partners.

495
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:46,136
Partners have each other's backs.

496
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:47,905
All right, Mick's right. We can all agree

497
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:49,206
that we need to get Capone's ledger.

498
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,242
- Fair?
- Agreed.

499
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:03,687
Sara?

500
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:10,327
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

501
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:12,096
We need to find Stein.

502
00:25:18,638 --> 00:25:20,504
You know, for a homicidal gangster,

503
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:22,373
Capone was very organized,

504
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,974
and had exquisite penmanship.

505
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:31,415
Check it out.

506
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,517
Is that it?

507
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,252
Bingo.

508
00:25:35,254 --> 00:25:36,453
Let's go.

509
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:44,895
Watch where you point that thing.

510
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:47,364
- Snart.
- You shouldn't be here, Mick.

511
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:49,333
Capone's men might be from 1927,

512
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:52,269
but their bullets work just fine.

513
00:25:52,271 --> 00:25:54,138
Do you really wanna risk your life

514
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,206
for a skirt and a geezer?

515
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,842
<i>- Any sign of the professor?
- Not yet.</i>

516
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:00,944
Aw, sounds like a sweet little angel

517
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:02,780
whispering in your ear.

518
00:26:02,782 --> 00:26:05,215
Problem is, angels always
want you do the right thing,

519
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:08,419
and doing the right
thing gets you killed.

520
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:09,953
I should know.

521
00:26:09,955 --> 00:26:13,257
You wanna stay alive,
best listen to the devil.

522
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:16,760
Get out now.

523
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:20,030
Too late.

524
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,398
Hey, you found them.

525
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,953
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

526
00:26:22,978 --> 00:26:24,735
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, good, yeah.

527
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:28,072
Oh, whoa.

528
00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:30,956
Oh, my God, you're Al Capone.

529
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:32,705
- That's Scarface.
- Yeah, I-I don't think

530
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,245
- he likes that nickname.
- No?

531
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,714
I don't like when people
try and steal what's mine.

532
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:38,015
How do you think it makes me feel

533
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:40,384
seeing all you thieves on my property?

534
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:42,720
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say not good.

535
00:26:42,722 --> 00:26:44,888
See, the doctor used
to give me these pills,

536
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,724
said they would help calm me down.

537
00:26:46,726 --> 00:26:48,726
Then one day, I realized the only thing

538
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:51,428
that makes me feel any better is killing.

539
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,796
Time for some therapy.

540
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:05,809
Whoo. Thanks, buddy.

541
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:08,178
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

542
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,480
Yeah.

543
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:28,632
How'd I do?

544
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:31,368
You totally sold it, Al.

545
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,903
Thought so.

546
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:34,471
You sure Mr. Thawne ain't gonna be mad

547
00:27:34,473 --> 00:27:35,739
'cause we let 'em go?

548
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:38,709
Oh, quite the opposite.

549
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,282
Hey, Grey, Grey,
you're safe now, it's okay.

550
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:51,617
- Grey.
- What?

551
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,919
- Grey?
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry,

552
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:55,621
I-I-I didn't hear you.
I'm... I'm... I'm little...

553
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:57,256
A little discombobulated.

554
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,991
Whoo! Well, that was close,

555
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:01,493
but a win's a win, and we
got the team back together.

556
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:03,996
Well, technically you and Rory
got the team back together.

557
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:06,265
And we got the ledger. Bro hug?

558
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,766
Do it.

559
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:09,768
Okay, I think this is
all a little premature.

560
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,737
We still don't have
an ID on the speedster.

561
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:13,372
Who's now added Malcolm Merlyn

562
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:15,274
to his team of time travelling psychos.

563
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,510
And he wanted the amulet that
I took off of Darhk in 1987.

564
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:20,346
What would someone with
the speedster's power

565
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:22,681
- want with ancient artifacts?
- Perhaps...

566
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:25,384
Perhaps I should take
a look at the amulet.

567
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:28,420
I may be able to unlock
some of its mysteries.

568
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:29,955
All right.

569
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:43,502
Ah, so you didn't get a chance

570
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:46,205
to kill your boyfriend's killer, huh?

571
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:49,308
It's not vengeance I'm after, Mick.

572
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,609
It's justice.

573
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:52,611
Right, right.

574
00:28:52,613 --> 00:28:54,880
Well, for what it's worth,
you looked good tonight.

575
00:28:54,882 --> 00:28:57,449
Being a bad guy suits you.

576
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:01,754
Thank you.

577
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,827
Um, I'm hungry.

578
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,433
What's next, Mick?

579
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:17,102
Long walks on the beach,
just the two of you?

580
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:18,771
For a figment of my imagination,

581
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,873
you're really beginning
to be a pain in my ass.

582
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,709
Look, I get it, she's easy on the eyes,

583
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:24,743
tough in the fight.

584
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:25,978
She's just a friend,

585
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,646
the one friend I have,

586
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:30,182
since my last friend blew himself up.

587
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:31,283
Care for a little advice?

588
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:33,852
From a dead guy? No.

589
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:37,322
Don't let the new girl
rope you into her death wish.

590
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:40,359
This whole sacrificing
yourself for your friends thing

591
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,662
isn't as fun as it sounds.

592
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:45,764
Trust me.

593
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:05,084
What the hell?

594
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:08,020
Sara, stay out of the library.

595
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:17,196
How you feeling?

596
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:19,231
I'm all right.

597
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,799
Look, I know you've
been through a lot,

598
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,435
but we really need to
talk about the aberration

599
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:26,405
that you caused.

600
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,307
Perhaps some other time.

601
00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:33,879
What were you doing in here, anyways?

602
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:36,615
- Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.
- I speak six languages, why...

603
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:38,317
Stein's about to kill
Sara in the library.

604
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,599
With the rope or the candlestick?

605
00:30:39,623 --> 00:30:41,286
Guys, I'm serious.

606
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:43,255
Somehow, the speedster's
disguised himself as Stein,

607
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:44,690
and he's turning over the whole ship.

608
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:46,078
- I'll suit up.
- I know how to get Sara

609
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:48,160
away from fake Stein.
What about that speedster gun?

610
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:50,095
Yeah, I'm already on it.

611
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:52,097
Martin, you've been
acting pretty different

612
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:54,433
ever since Darhk tortured you.

613
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,870
Did they offer you a
deal like they did me?

614
00:30:57,872 --> 00:31:00,405
Help us, and we won't hurt your daughter?

615
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:02,474
My daughter?

616
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:05,043
Sara, uh, Jackson and
I were just on the bridge,

617
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:06,645
and...

618
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:09,348
He wanted to talk to
you about ship stuff.

619
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,983
Ship stuff?

620
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:12,684
Yeah.

621
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:14,953
Okay.

622
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:16,855
I'm sure there's no need to rush off.

623
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:18,290
Jax can wait.

624
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,159
Since when do you call him Jax?

625
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,660
Actually, it's, uh, it's pretty urgent.

626
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:23,362
We should go now.

627
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:24,696
Okay.

628
00:31:50,357 --> 00:31:52,191
My speedster weapon.

629
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:53,759
Impressive.

630
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:58,163
Unfortunately for you,
the effects are only temporary.

631
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:00,065
What did you do with Stein?

632
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:03,168
Oh, I wouldn't waste my energy
worrying about him right now.

633
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,837
Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

634
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,806
In a rush to die, are we?

635
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:09,908
I wasn't talking to you.

636
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:18,250
He's headed towards the bridge, come on.

637
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:20,219
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

638
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:23,388
What the hell is he doing in there?

639
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,490
<i>Cloaking shield disengaged.</i>

640
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:26,491
That's not good.

641
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:28,760
<i>Cargo bay door now opening.</i>

642
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:30,662
That is definitely not good.

643
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:34,666
Tear the ship apart.

644
00:32:34,668 --> 00:32:36,835
Kill anyone you find.

645
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:47,331
The speedster just locked
himself inside the bridge.

646
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,133
Great, so we got him trapped.

647
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,868
Call me an optimist.

648
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,336
And by the sound of it,
he's letting his buddies

649
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,304
onto the ship.

650
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:08,386
Guys, could use a little help here.

651
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:10,588
Okay, Nate and I will
help Sara hold them off.

652
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,657
- I'll guard Ness.
- What about the speedster?

653
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,192
Well, he's after to amulet,
so all we have to do

654
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:16,527
is just keep him in the bridge...

655
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,365
What are you doing?

656
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,401
Capone's men are taking over the ship.

657
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:28,940
We got bigger fish to fry, honey.

658
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:30,208
Rex's killer?

659
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:35,379
He's tossing the ship.
He's looking for the amulet.

660
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,882
It's only gonna be a matter
of time before he finds it.

661
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:40,151
Then how do we stop him?

662
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:41,953
What would a criminal do?

663
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:43,020
Run.

664
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:48,492
Steel-up.

665
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:58,102
Isn't that just like a thug?

666
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,571
Brings a Tommy gun
to an ion blaster fight?

667
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,545
Ah, yeah.

668
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:11,115
Hey, I stole that fair and square.

669
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:15,586
This belongs to me.

670
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:16,587
Surprise.

671
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:34,138
The League taught you well,

672
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,340
but unless you hand over the amulet,

673
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:38,576
I'm gonna have to teach
you a few new lessons.

674
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:41,445
Those who cannot do teach.

675
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,935
I remember you.

676
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:08,906
You're here because I killed
that moronic leader of the JSA.

677
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:12,410
Mr. Rex Tyler was it?

678
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,429
Don't worry,

679
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:33,831
you'll be joining Mr. Tyler soon enough.

680
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:38,970
Lucky girl.

681
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:46,277
I gave you an out.

682
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:50,514
Not just a chance to survive,
but to live a better life.

683
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,350
I already found a better life.

684
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:53,517
One without you in it.

685
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,329
But what about your friend, Martin Stein?

686
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,897
Where is he?

687
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:11,569
My dear, that information
comes at a cost.

688
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:21,862
Don't look so glum, professor.

689
00:36:21,864 --> 00:36:24,598
You'll be in good company at
the bottom of this here river.

690
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,167
Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops,

691
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:29,937
they've all run afoul in my organization,

692
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,505
but you...

693
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:34,007
I've never had to whack a professor before.

694
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:36,477
Guess I'm moving up in
the world, hey, boys?

695
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:50,124
The speedster, how did
you manage to defeat him?

696
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,626
I didn't. I made him a counter-offer.

697
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:56,530
I gave him the amulet.

698
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:01,235
I still don't understand.
The last thing I remember

699
00:37:01,237 --> 00:37:04,138
was getting off the train.
Everything else is a blur.

700
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,873
I wouldn't worry about that, Mr. Ness.

701
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,575
After our investigation,
we concluded you were kidnapped

702
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:11,612
by an imposter, some idiot

703
00:37:11,614 --> 00:37:13,947
posing as you trying
to bring down Capone.

704
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:15,582
The gentleman who was impersonating you

705
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:17,518
was trying to do the right thing.

706
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:20,274
Luckily, he found some
useful information.

707
00:37:20,276 --> 00:37:22,143
- What's this?
- Everything you need to know

708
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:23,911
to take down Capone.

709
00:37:23,913 --> 00:37:26,080
If you look closely,
you'll find some discrepancies

710
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:27,715
in his bookkeeping.

711
00:37:27,717 --> 00:37:29,950
You expect me to believe that Al Capone

712
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:33,187
is gonna be taken down by tax evasion?

713
00:37:33,189 --> 00:37:34,922
Sounds screwy.

714
00:37:34,924 --> 00:37:37,758
Actually, it'd make a pretty
good movie one day.

715
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:44,932
You know, if this is the week
the Feds get Capone's ledger,

716
00:37:44,934 --> 00:37:47,234
why does it take four more
years for them to take him down?

717
00:37:47,236 --> 00:37:50,071
Because it's the federal government.

718
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,145
Now that's the Mick Rory I remember,

719
00:37:58,147 --> 00:38:00,448
always thinking with his stomach.

720
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,183
Shut up.

721
00:38:02,185 --> 00:38:04,185
Who are you talking to?

722
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:05,653
Nobody.

723
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:08,656
Anyway, I thought I'd find you in here.

724
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:13,094
That speedster hit you pretty hard, huh?

725
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:15,262
I got a thick head.

726
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:17,398
What's that?

727
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,067
A little present for keeping me alive,

728
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:24,038
and for helping me almost get Rex's killer.

729
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,573
Open it.

730
00:38:29,078 --> 00:38:32,746
I lifted it back at Capone's warehouse.

731
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:35,516
You stole it.

732
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:36,784
You were right.

733
00:38:36,786 --> 00:38:40,654
The bad guys really do have more fun.

734
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:44,058
Not that you're a bad guy.

735
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,528
I hope it was worth it.
All this for a kiss on the cheek

736
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,631
and a cheap bottle of booze.

737
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:53,901
That speedster could've killed you, Mick.

738
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:56,770
What then?

739
00:38:56,772 --> 00:38:58,973
I'll be dead like you.

740
00:39:04,295 --> 00:39:07,051
My evil doppelganger left quite a mess.

741
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,620
It'll take me weeks to
reorganize my notes.

742
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:11,355
Well, it's good to have you back,

743
00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:14,258
- the real you.
- Well, thanks to your efforts.

744
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:19,830
Though, I have to say I'm a bit puzzled.

745
00:39:19,832 --> 00:39:22,400
Predicting history is
our team's raison d'être,

746
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:26,003
yet you traded the amulet to our enemies,

747
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:27,772
a choice which will no doubt have

748
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:30,007
countless repercussions on history.

749
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:31,776
I'm starting to think that

750
00:39:31,778 --> 00:39:35,112
maybe some things are more
important than history.

751
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:38,749
You know, you, me, and this team...

752
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,484
We're a family,

753
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:44,355
a messed up one, but still a family.

754
00:39:44,357 --> 00:39:45,890
I might not be able to save Laurel,

755
00:39:45,892 --> 00:39:49,894
but I can protect this family,

756
00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:53,230
and that includes yours.

757
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:56,667
What's her name?

758
00:39:56,669 --> 00:39:58,502
Lily.

759
00:39:58,504 --> 00:40:00,538
Lily.

760
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,606
It's a beautiful name.

761
00:40:04,022 --> 00:40:05,655
We should leave soon.

762
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,312
You're certainly in a
hurry to get out of 1927.

763
00:40:08,314 --> 00:40:09,780
Not your concern, Malcolm,

764
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,715
particularly now that we
have what we came for.

765
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:13,451
Well, now that we have the matching set,

766
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:15,630
do you care to tell us why we
went through so much trouble?

767
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:17,755
Well, they are not a matching set.

768
00:40:17,757 --> 00:40:20,491
In fact, they are not a they.

769
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:21,792
They are an it.

770
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,461
It's an amulet in two pieces.

771
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,030
I knew that you were more than
just a pretty face, Malcolm.

772
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:35,172
Wow, it's a portable planetarium.

773
00:40:35,174 --> 00:40:36,507
It's a compass.

774
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:38,909
Compasses generally find things.

775
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:41,512
Indeed. Have either of you gentlemen

776
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:43,547
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

777
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:45,683
Yes, it was a spear
that was reportedly used

778
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:48,686
to penetrate the side of Christ
after he died on the cross.

779
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:53,224
And now it can be used
to rewrite reality itself.

780
00:40:53,226 --> 00:40:55,226
So, how do we find it?

781
00:40:55,228 --> 00:40:57,695
Well, it's complicated,
but the first step

782
00:40:57,697 --> 00:41:00,197
is with the person that
Mr. Darhk met briefly

783
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,567
in New York. You remember
Captain Rip Hunter?

784
00:41:10,543 --> 00:41:13,344
Rip Hunter, stop where you are!

785
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,348
Cut!

786
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:26,490
Yeah, I told you idiots to
move these garbage cans.

787
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:32,029
Can we try to...
To get this right, people?

788
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,999
I don't wanna be here all night.

789
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,339
Am I talking to myself? Today!

790
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:54,973
