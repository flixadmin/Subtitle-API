1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,320
<i>My name is Sara Lance.</i>

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,920
<i>Last year, a former Time Master
named Rip Hunter</i>

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,640
<i>recruited a team of heroes
and villains to save the world,</i>

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,720
<i>and we did.</i>

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,480
<i>But in the process,
we destroyed the Time Masters.</i>

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,360
<i>Now, we've taken up their mantle</i>

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,040
<i>of protecting the timeline
from time criminals.</i>

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,000
<i>We are no longer saving the world.</i>

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,960
<i>We are saving history.</i>

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,120
<i>But don't call us heroes.</i>

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,720
<i>We are legends.</i>

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,800
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,000
Heywood. Dr. Nate Heywood.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,400
I need to talk to you about
Sara Lance, Ray Palmer

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,720
and the rest of the Legends.

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,480
I think they're all in trouble.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,240
I am piloting us on a collision
course with a torpedo.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
Gideon.

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,680
<i>I'm here, Captain.</i>

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,720
Where's Captain Hunter?

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,040
<i>I would be happy to play
his final message for you all.</i>

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,600
<i>Together, you are the best crew.</i>

23
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,560
<i>The best team a captain
could ever hope for.</i>

24
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
<i>Good luck.</i>

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,280
What do you guys say
we get out of 1942?

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Not until you answer a few questions.

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,080
We're the Justice Society of America.

28
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,560
And you're coming with us.

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,920
Oh, my God.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,080
You're Commander Steel.

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,960
Who the hell are you?

32
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,520
Whoa, whoa. Just relax.

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,800
We're all friends here.

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,440
Rex Tyler told us about the JSA.

35
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,760
You guys are awesome.

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,000
Hey. The name's Jax.

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
Rex never mentioned any of you.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,560
Mind telling us what you were doing
impersonating OSS agents?

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,800
It's quite simple, actually.

40
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,920
We were protecting Albert Einstein
from Nazi agents

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,280
who were attempting to kidnap him

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,200
and force him to build an atomic bomb
in the future.

43
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,440
Time travel.
It's... it's hard to explain.

44
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,200
You can take all the time you need.

45
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,360
In custody.

46
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,400
Whoa, take it easy.
Let's talk for a minute.

47
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,840
I mean, after all, you're my...

48
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,280
Obsidian, shut off the lights!

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,880
Wow, that's pretty neat.

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,920
She's trying to kill us!

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,240
No, she's just flirting.

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
We don't want to fight!

53
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,320
You win!

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,360
{\an5}You just had to mention time travel,
didn't you?

55
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,360
{\an5}Yeah, well, at least
he didn't throw the first punch.

56
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,000
{\an5}I'm perfectly capable
of defending myself, Raymond.

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,360
{\an5}I'm pretty sure that you got
knocked out

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,360
{\an5}by a teenager
in a star-spangled leotard.

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,720
Her name's Stargirl.

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,640
{\an5}Did anybody catch her
regular-person name?

61
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,640
{\an5}I'm surprised you didn't ask
for her number.

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,240
{\an5}Oh, so it's my fault that
we got our asses handed to us?

63
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,960
Look, they're just better
coordinated than us.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
You guys,
just listen to me for two...

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
{\an5}Pretty, shut up.

66
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,160
{\an5}If I recall, you were late coming
to the party.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,760
{\an5}<i>Oh, is that right?
How did you see that?</i>

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,640
{\an5}Never laid eyes on them
before in my life.

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,360
{\an5}They seemed quite adamant
that they knew you.

70
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,560
{\an5}Believe me, if I'd met this bunch...

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,520
pretty sure I'd remember.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,040
What do you propose we do with them?

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,920
{\an5}If I may be so bold, sir...

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,640
{\an5}I say we find the darkest hole in
Leavenworth and throw away the key.

75
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,800
{\an5}I say we ship them to the boys
in Bellevue Mental Hospital.

76
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,960
I suppose before we do anything...

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
we ought to question them.

78
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,920
<i>So far up Mr. Goggle's...</i>

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,440
If we can even manage
to get a word in.

80
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,080
{\an5}I don't understand why they were
tracking us in the first place.

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,360
{\an5}Because they're the Justice Society
of America.

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
{\an5}The single greatest secret force
this country has ever known.

83
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,680
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

84
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,560
Because his Nazi handlers
have briefed him, no doubt.

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,760
Look, I'm not a Nazi.
I'm a historian.

86
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,000
Here we go with the time travel
nonsense again.

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,200
070233.

88
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
{\an5}What?

89
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,360
{\an5}Those are numbers on your dog tags.

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,080
{\an5}They're not disclosed on any
documents, military or otherwise.

91
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,120
{\an5}How do you know that?

92
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,680
{\an5}You gave these to your wife
after the birth of your son in 1955.

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,400
{\an5}The dent in the front was
from an assassin's bullet

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,480
{\an5}when you saved
President Roosevelt in 1939.

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,640
Your son passed them down
to his son...

96
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
me.

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,960
You are late, Herr Thawne.

98
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,280
{\an5}You'll find that I have an entirely
different concept of time than most.

99
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,080
{\an5}Did you locate the item?

100
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,320
{\an5}It's in Berlin.

101
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,840
{\an5}The <i>Fuehrer</i>refuses to part with it.

102
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,240
{\an5}I have something much
more valuable to offer him.

103
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,600
{\an5}The JSA are basically a group
of super-soldiers.

104
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,400
{\an5}To win,
the <i>Reich</i>will need their own.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
{\an5}This is just a taste.

106
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,360
{\an5}Enough to dose one person.

107
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,920
{\an5}Proof of concept.

108
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,680
{\an5}Give me what I want...

109
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,680
{\an5}and your <i>Fuehrer</i>will be planting his
flag on the White House lawn

110
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,720
{\an5}within a matter of months.

111
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,560
Do we have an accord?

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,960
Mr. Tyler.

113
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,640
See? Rex Tyler.

114
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Told you we knew the guy.

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,880
I don't know you.

116
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,280
Any of you.

117
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,880
Tell me what the heck is going
on here.

118
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
Well, we tried explaining...

119
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I was addressing the team leader.

120
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Uh, oh...

121
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,360
{\an5}Oh, well, simply put,

122
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,560
{\an5}we've come here as time travelers

123
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,520
to identify aberrations in history
and correct them.

124
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
We're superheroes, like you guys.

125
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
You think you're just like us?

126
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,320
What are your qualifications?

127
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,560
{\an5}Well, I used my personal fortune
to create an advanced exo-skeleton,

128
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
which is powered by dwarf star alloy.

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
And I'm nothing like you.

130
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,360
I'm a criminal.

131
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,800
Are there any other
felons on your team?

132
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,640
{\an5}- No, no...
- Yes.

133
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,600
{\an5}She's an assassin,
but never convicted, right?

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,480
We're protecting history.
It's pretty important.

135
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,120
In the future, you risk your own life
to save us, Mr. Tyler.

136
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,240
How do you know my name?

137
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,240
Because you told us your name
in 2016.

138
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,120
<i>My name is Rex Tyler.</i>

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
And I'm a member of the Justice
Society of America.

140
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,280
Never heard of them, pal.

141
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,520
That's because I'm from 1942.

142
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,480
The same year in which
all of you will...

143
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Bite the bullet?

144
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,200
So if we don't go back to 1942,
we're safe, right?

145
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,560
Not to be rude,

146
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,960
but how... how do we know you are
who you say you are?

147
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,440
You all have no idea
what you're up against.

148
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
If you return to 1942,

149
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,440
the consequences
will be catastrophic.

150
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
That was weird.

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,600
So I crashed your ship,

152
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,240
told you some bunk
about not staying in 1942

153
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,720
and then I just disappeared?

154
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,920
It was more like "fritzing" out.

155
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,960
You might've been on to something
with the Bellevue idea.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,280
Yes, Mr. President, sir?

157
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,440
FDR?

158
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,760
Oh, tell him I'm a big fan
of the New Deal.

159
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,200
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about earlier.
I just, uh...

160
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,320
I never imagined meeting you
like this.

161
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,040
I actually never imagined meeting you
at all because you're dead.

162
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,680
I mean, where I come from, you're...
you're dead.

163
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,560
My dad used to tell me
bedtime stories about you.

164
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,480
All the battles you fought.

165
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,120
You're a hero to me.

166
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm a hero to a lot of people.

167
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,160
That's the job.

168
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
Of course. All right.

169
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
You can count on us, sir.

170
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
All right, we have to move out.

171
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,960
Baron Krieger's been spotted
in Paris.

172
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
If it's permissible, sir...

173
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,520
I'll fly ahead and record
Krieger's movements.

174
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,480
Sensible, as always.

175
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,440
We could help you out with that.

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,480
Fighting Nazis is kind of our thing.

177
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,400
Yeah. Last time we tried,

178
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,720
we ended up at the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean.

179
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
We can handle Adolf's buddies.

180
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,640
I think it's best
for the 20th century if...

181
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
For us to leave it?

182
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,560
And that's why you're team leader.

183
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, I guess
we'll be on our way, then.

184
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,680
Can you believe what we just saw
with our own eyes?

185
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
The actual JSA.

186
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,440
And Hourman? That guy's amazing.

187
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,280
Aw, haircut's in love.

188
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,120
Come on.

189
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,840
Those guys were precise,
professional, in constant agreement.

190
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,200
We can't even agree on
whose turn it is to make dinner.

191
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Not it.

192
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,880
I can't argue with you, man.

193
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,320
They got some serious skills.

194
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,480
Big deal.

195
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,600
Apart from the fancy headquarters,
discipline

196
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,560
and calls from
the White House...

197
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,520
I mean, what do they have
that we don't?

198
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,880
An actual leader.

199
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
Rip's gone.

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
And who knows when
or if we'll ever find him.

201
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,360
In the meantime, we need someone
who can make the tough calls.

202
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,760
Let me guess, you're volunteering?

203
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,240
With all due respect, Raymond,

204
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,400
I think there's a reason
Mr. Tyler just naturally assumed

205
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,120
I was in charge.

206
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,280
Yeah, because Mr. Tyler is from 1942
and you're some old white dude.

207
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,560
"Old," meaning experienced.

208
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,600
- What about...
- Martin's right.

209
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,200
With Rip gone, we could use
some adult supervision.

210
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,920
Congratulations, Captain.

211
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,560
Well, then.
Thank you all for your support.

212
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,400
Now, I believe our first order
of business concerns Dr. Heywood.

213
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,120
Is that Grandpa?

214
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Yeah.

215
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,000
Pictures of him are hard to find.

216
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,480
You just got to know where to look.

217
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,400
Well, that must've been something,
getting the chance to meet him.

218
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,960
You would think so, right? But...

219
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I don't know.

220
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,640
Felt empty somehow.

221
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, meeting your idols
usually does.

222
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,960
Think of it this way.

223
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,840
You are gonna have one hell
of a story to tell your friends

224
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,240
when you get back home.

225
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,200
Back home? 2016 back home?

226
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,560
You can't cut me from the team.

227
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,200
Well, you're right,
because you're not a member of it.

228
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
And even if you were,
history can be dangerous,

229
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,440
and it's no place for a...

230
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,640
A historian? I'm more than...

231
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
that's weird.

232
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,120
It's really not so weird.

233
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,400
You don't have any superpowers.
You don't even have training...

234
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,800
Not that. My grandfather's dog tags.

235
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,560
They aren't around my neck.

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So?

237
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,720
So I haven't taken them off
since I was a kid.

238
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,640
They were here a minute ago,
and now they've...

239
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,840
Vanished.

240
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
What does that mean?

241
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,800
That history has changed.

242
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,840
What are you doing?

243
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,720
Reviewing my notes on the JSA.

244
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,680
We have to go back to 1942.

245
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,480
Nate, the JSA was pretty explicit
on us not going back to 1942.

246
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,160
That mission the JSA went on to
track down Baron Krieger in Paris?

247
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,560
They're all gonna die there tomorrow.

248
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,080
My grandfather too.

249
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,120
And this is where
the JSA's gonna die?

250
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,120
Not unless we save them,
including my grandfather.

251
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,160
Well, first we got to find them.

252
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,560
Fortunately, we know they're looking
for a Nazi named Krieger.

253
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,960
A Nazi named Krieger...

254
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,480
Can someone please help me
operate this thing?

255
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,680
Oh, God.

256
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Thank you.

257
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,800
Krieger and his men
frequent Folies-Bergère.

258
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,320
We find Krieger, we find the JSA.

259
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,200
So how do we sneak
into a Nazi nightclub?

260
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,000
I have a plan.

261
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,920
Are any of you familiar
with Max Suelzenfuss,

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,320
better known by his stage name,
Max Lorenz?

263
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,680
He was Hitler's favorite singer

264
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,320
and fortunately, bears a passing
resemblance to <i>moi.</i>

265
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,200
That's French.

266
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,000
Grey. Are you sure about this?

267
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,520
Because bluffing at a card game

268
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
isn't exactly the same
as bluffing Nazis.

269
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,120
You disapprove of my plan?

270
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
I'm just saying, we're dropping
into the middle of World War II here

271
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,320
and you're not exactly
a wartime consigliere.

272
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
- And let me guess, you are?
- I...

273
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,960
Or perhaps you would prefer
the arsonist, the assassin

274
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,960
or the incredible shrinking man?

275
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,880
I'm just saying, you're smart

276
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,480
and analytical and stuff,
and real deliberate.

277
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,840
But when bullets start flying,
analytical is not gonna cut it.

278
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,880
Well, thank you for pointing
out my inadequacies.

279
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,880
- Come on, Grey.
- It's Captain Grey, now.

280
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,440
Well, I'm glad it hasn't gone
to your head.

281
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,800
Ouch. Where'd you get that?

282
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,200
It must have happened when I fell
after my grandfather decked me.

283
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,360
Hey, that fabrication room's
pretty cool.

284
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,200
Can it really make clothes
from any era?

285
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,320
Yeah, you know,
we may not have trophies

286
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,040
or framed letters
from former presidents

287
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
but we've got a few cool toys.

288
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,640
Including ingestible translator.

289
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,800
Swallow this, you'll be able to speak

290
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,960
and understand any language
spoken to you.

291
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
That's cool.

292
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,600
But I already speak German, French,
Japanese, Italian, and Latin.

293
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
What?

294
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,120
You speak six different languages,

295
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,000
you have a tendency
to run towards danger.

296
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,480
And you're related to a member
of the JSA.

297
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,280
Why did you become a historian?

298
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
It's a long story.

299
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,400
Hey, where do I go to get a gun?

300
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,360
You ever shoot someone before?

301
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,120
I mean, I may not be trained
by the League of Assassins

302
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,920
but I can take care of myself.

303
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,640
Not out here, you can't.

304
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,080
Out here, even the strongest
and the bravest of us die.

305
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,680
Like Captain Hunter?

306
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,520
I'm just trying to make sure
you get home safe and sound.

307
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,240
So the lady does have a heart.

308
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,480
Don't tell anyone.

309
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Excuse me...

310
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
The club is closed tonight
for a private function.

311
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,040
Do you have any idea who I am?

312
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,200
I am Max Lorenz.

313
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,160
- Did you say Max Lorenz?
- Yes.

314
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,200
And I have never been treated
with such rudeness.

315
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Of course not.

316
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,080
You're more than welcome here,
Herr Max.

317
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,200
Thank you.

318
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,520
<i>No sign of Krieger or the JSA.</i>

319
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,880
<i>Canvass the area
and stay on the comms.</i>

320
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,600
Think I got something.

321
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,200
The lady with the animal powers.

322
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,360
But she looks different.

323
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,240
You mean hot.

324
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
May I?

325
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,120
What are you doing?
I'm on a covert mission.

326
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Not for long.

327
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,000
You and your team are all
24 hours away from being killed.

328
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
What are you talking about?

329
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm a time traveler, remember?

330
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,920
Something changes in the future,
and you all die.

331
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,280
But if we do, how do you know
it's not because of your team?

332
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,000
Hadn't thought of that.

333
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,080
Look who I found, and she's thrilled
we've offered our help.

334
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,880
Herr Lorenz, I must introduce you
to General Gerd von Rundstedt.

335
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
He's a huge fan.

336
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,960
Oh, lovely to meet you, General.

337
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,920
You are Max Lorenz?

338
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,280
Lorenz is well over 6ft tall.

339
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Ah.

340
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,720
My towering voice often causes people
to overestimate my height.

341
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,400
Perhaps, you will treat us to a song,
Mr. Lorenz?

342
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,240
Maxie has a concert tomorrow night
and needs to rest his pipes.

343
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,880
I insist, <i>Fraulein</i>.

344
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,520
And, please...

345
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,440
no Negro music.

346
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,040
I swa...

347
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,600
not worth it.

348
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,080
It'd be a little worth it.

349
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,040
Heads up. Baron Krieger just arrived.

350
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,640
Is this on?

351
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,400
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

352
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,200
My name is Max Lorenz,

353
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,320
and this little waltz...

354
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,760
I am about to sing for you
is an original song.

355
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,600
Uh, very popular in Austria

356
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,520
where... where the hills are alive
with the sound of music.

357
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Key of A.

358
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,600
Watch me for the changes
and try to keep up.

359
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,400
One, two, three.

360
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,800
One, two, three.

361
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,520
<i>Edelweiss</i>

362
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,560
<i>Edelweiss</i>

363
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,320
<i>Every morning</i>

364
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,520
<i>You greet me</i>

365
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,680
<i>Small and white</i>

366
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,840
<i>Clean and bright</i>

367
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,760
<i>You look happy to meet me</i>

368
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,920
No, no, Herr Krieger, please.

369
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
The Askaran Amulet is
not degenerate artwork.

370
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,600
It is a masterpiece.

371
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,280
Which you will help my men transport
to the exchange tomorrow at 01000.

372
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,240
Refusing would meet
with the <i>Fuehrer's</i>disapproval.

373
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,840
<i>Edelweiss</i>

374
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,400
I know the Baron's plan.

375
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,520
Let's get out of here.

376
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,200
- Hey.
<i>- Edelweiss</i>

377
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,000
<i>Bless my homeland</i>

378
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,280
<i>Forever</i>

379
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,280
Heil Hitler!

380
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,600
Heil Hitler!

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,880
You did not salute the <i>Fuehrer</i>.

382
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.

383
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
I'm all about saluting the <i>Fuehrer</i>.

384
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
You're lying.

385
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,920
I was watching you the entire time.

386
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,280
You know what? I... I just...
I have a little crick in my neck.

387
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,560
And it's really hard for me
to straighten my arm.

388
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,320
Heil Hitler.

389
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,960
Heil Hitler!

390
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,320
Ha...

391
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Ha...

392
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,080
Ha...

393
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,400
Ha... aw, hell.

394
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,320
Why do you get to punch him?

395
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,520
Protect Max Lorenz!

396
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,880
What the hell are you doing here?

397
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,560
We came back to...

398
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,440
to rescue you.

399
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,720
If we're meant to be impressed
by all this technology...

400
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,640
it has the opposite effect.

401
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,680
It only makes you
that much more dangerous.

402
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,440
Well, and there's evidence
to support that,

403
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,200
but I think what's important now
is for all us to stop arguing.

404
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,000
Does your team ever stop arguing?

405
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Fair point.

406
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,040
I think what Martin is trying to say

407
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,160
we're gonna help you
whether you like it or not.

408
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,800
You're going after Krieger.

409
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,200
We know where he's going next.

410
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,320
And given the laws
of temporal mechanics, if you die...

411
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,560
your grandson ceases to exist.

412
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,280
Well, I don't pretend to understand
any of this time travel bunk

413
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,320
but, these fellas do have a timeship.

414
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,480
Might come in handy.

415
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,720
And having them as our back-up

416
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,160
might be the only way
to keep them out of trouble.

417
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,920
Let's put it to a vote, then.

418
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,280
The ayes have it.

419
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,840
Did your reconnaissance at the club
yield any usable intel?

420
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,080
Only to map the area.

421
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,480
<i>Bringing one online now.</i>

422
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,480
- What was that?
- AI.

423
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,000
A talking computer.

424
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,120
What's a computer?

425
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,720
There. The Fontainebleau Forest.

426
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,160
Now, I saw a few of Krieger's
men studying a map of it.

427
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,840
That must be where Krieger's
planning on making the exchange.

428
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,240
Nate overheard Krieger talking about

429
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,280
making a trade for something
called an Askaran Amulet.

430
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,120
<i>Hitler has long amassed
ancient artifacts such as this one.</i>

431
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,320
<i>He may want the amulet because
it conveys some sort of occult power.</i>

432
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
Our objective should be
to take out the Baron

433
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,680
and stop this exchange at all costs.

434
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,680
I propose we survey all military
activity in the area

435
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,320
to learn what we're up against.

436
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
We don't have time for that.

437
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,520
I concur.

438
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,680
We should have both teams gear up

439
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,480
while Dr. Stein and I finalize
the details.

440
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,880
Be ready to go at first light.

441
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,360
How are things with your grandfather?

442
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,680
You know? I think he's avoiding me
for some reason.

443
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,880
Well, it's hard for people
to look at their future.

444
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,040
Maybe.

445
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,640
Oh, one of the Nazis
at the club had a knife.

446
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,800
Well, that should have
stopped bleeding by now.

447
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm just gonna get a new bandage.

448
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,120
To go with your bruise?

449
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,400
Well, you know how fragile
we historians can be.

450
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,120
This isn't fragility.

451
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,040
I know my cuts and bruises.

452
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,880
You're a hemophiliac.

453
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,560
Your blood doesn't clot,
wounds can't heal.

454
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,720
And if it's bad,
you can bleed to death.

455
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,120
Yeah, well, you don't have
to worry about that.

456
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,600
Too late. You could've died tonight.

457
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,560
But I didn't.
In fact, it was the opposite.

458
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,080
I never felt more alive.

459
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Look, when I was five years old,
I cut my knee

460
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,640
and my mother wouldn't let me
out of the house till I was 16.

461
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm a grown man.
I can make my own decisions.

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
- Not on this ship, you can't.
- Sara.

463
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,920
Look, I cannot let you
go out there tomorrow,

464
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,560
knowing that you could get killed.

465
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,400
I have enough deaths
on my conscience as it is.

466
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,600
Look, I know you don't think
I can add anything to this team.

467
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,960
But out there? Out there is history.

468
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,120
And nobody knows more about it
than me.

469
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,120
Well, we've been managing
just fine without you.

470
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,080
Mostly fine.

471
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,520
Your suit looks a bit cumbersome.

472
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,280
Oh, actually,
I made it to fit me perfectly.

473
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,600
It's constructed out
of a proprietary alloy

474
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
and it's been battle-tested
quite a bit.

475
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,360
I even wore it in space once.

476
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,800
Personal highlight.

477
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,800
So your superpower
is wearing the suit?

478
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
Yeah, I guess so.

479
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
It's a little more complicated
than that... but yeah.

480
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,360
You're still mad at me for punching
out that Nazi in the club, huh?

481
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,680
I'm mad because you blew my cover.

482
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,040
I'll never be able to go undercover
in Paris ever again.

483
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,640
Yeah, sorry.
I didn't think about that.

484
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,680
I imagine that's a pattern
with you and your group.

485
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,000
But I can't dwell on it.

486
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,640
Getting stuck on past mistakes

487
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,400
only takes focus off
the primary goal at hand.

488
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,720
Well, I got to admit.

489
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,160
Watching your team work
like a well-oiled machine

490
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,080
kind of makes me feel like I'm doing
this whole hero thing wrong.

491
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,320
If it's any consolation, Dr. Palmer,
you're not really a hero.

492
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,080
We better get ready.

493
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,720
We've spotted the Baron's caravan.
ETA five minutes.

494
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,800
I've got eyes on the Baron.

495
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,320
What the hell's going on down there?

496
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,120
Animal Girl and I are going
after Krieger.

497
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,040
In the field, I'm called Vixen.

498
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,600
<i>Negative, Raymond.</i>

499
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,360
Our target is the convoy.

500
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,160
<i>We've got the convoy covered.
Pursue the Baron.</i>

501
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,960
The mission is the amulet.

502
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,320
<i>Our mission is Krieger.</i>

503
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
We don't have time for this.

504
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,280
Give me a moment. I... I... I...
I need to assess the situation.

505
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,920
Krieger's getting away, man.

506
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,320
What the hell was that?

507
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,360
We're under attack.

508
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,720
<i>It's Krieger! He turned into a...</i>

509
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,920
<i>We need backup!</i>

510
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,400
Dr. Palmer? Vixen?

511
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Do you read?

512
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,160
Their comms are down.

513
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,840
Oh, my God.

514
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,840
<i>- I've got the amulet.</i>
- Good work.

515
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,800
Dr. Mid-Nite, Stargirl,
Vixen and Dr. Palmer need assistance.

516
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,520
Copy that.
But I think we have a new problem.

517
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,120
Grey, you got to get them out
of there!

518
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,520
I just need a minute.

519
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Come on, Grey! Do something!

520
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Uh...

521
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,840
Fall back. Get Obsidian.

522
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,120
Mick, lay down fire
to cover our retreat.

523
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,720
Now you're talking.

524
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,640
Mick! Come on!

525
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,880
Commander Steel,
do... do you still have the amulet?

526
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,600
<i>Yes, sir! En route to your position.</i>

527
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
What about Ray and Amaya?

528
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,800
You just can't leave them there.

529
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,560
Nor can we engage this super-Nazi.

530
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,480
Not without compiling
more information first.

531
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,200
This is not a science debate, Grey!

532
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,080
Damn it! Jefferson, I know that!

533
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,120
<i>But for now, they're on their own.</i>

534
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,080
I must admit,
it's a feat of engineering.

535
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,240
Far beyond anything
I have ever seen

536
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,440
or expected from you Americans.

537
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,880
Well, maybe you Germans should
just stick to your luxury cars.

538
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,840
Why should I fear a robot suit
when I have become<i>der Ubermensch?</i>

539
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,680
You really think a single case of
'roid rage is gonna win you the war?

540
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Yeah.

541
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,360
Once I have replicated
the super-serum

542
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,920
for the entire <i>Wehrmacht</i>.

543
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,320
But you haven't replicated the...

544
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,440
What'd you call it? Super-serum?

545
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,280
Kind of on the nose, don't you think?

546
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,880
If all this is just a preamble
to you killing us, get it over with.

547
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,760
I was hoping to torture you
a little bit first.

548
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,280
But since you're in such a rush,

549
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,800
I will be glad to accommodate you
with your schedule.

550
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,200
Wait, wait. I'm a scientist.

551
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,360
That exo-suit? I invented it.

552
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,400
I can help you with your little
supply and demand problem.

553
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,600
I'll even improve it.

554
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,040
Just don't shoot her.

555
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,560
I hope you are as smart
as you say you are...

556
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,320
for her sake.

557
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,200
You know he's gonna kill us both
even if you help him.

558
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,680
I have a plan.

559
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,600
That's what I'm afraid of.

560
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,120
We have the amulet. Now what?

561
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,080
First priority is making sure
Ray and Amaya are alive.

562
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,640
And then, getting them out
of the bunker

563
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
where the Nazis are holding them.

564
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,040
Actually, our first priority
is destroying the Baron

565
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,200
and whatever serum
is making him indestructible.

566
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,920
Perhaps we could propose a trade.

567
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,040
Their lives for the Amulet.

568
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,400
Unfortunately,
the amulet's not ours to barter with.

569
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,160
We need an extraction plan.

570
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,960
We need to eliminate the threat.

571
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,800
Now, Professor Stein,
please, tell us,

572
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,200
what is your plan of action?

573
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,640
How... how am I supposed
to come up with a plan

574
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,600
when I can't even hear myself think?

575
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,560
Would... would you please
all just leave?

576
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,400
I... I... I need a moment
to collect my thoughts.

577
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,000
What the hell, Grey?

578
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,320
I can practically feel you
going crazy inside my head.

579
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
I'm fine.

580
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,560
Jefferson, I'm trying to determine
the best course of action.

581
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,240
I wouldn't believe that even if we
didn't have a psychic connection

582
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,040
which hold on... we do.

583
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,960
I just don't know how
Rip was able to do all this.

584
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,440
So many decisions to make,

585
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,480
consequences to manage,
opinions to consider.

586
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,600
Trying to reach a consensus
with this team

587
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
is like something akin
to chaos theory.

588
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,800
That's the thing, Grey.

589
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,040
We don't need someone
to reach a consensus.

590
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,080
We just need someone
who can call the shots.

591
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Then you should have put a tactician,
not a theoretician, in charge.

592
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,040
You were right, Jefferson.

593
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm not a wartime consigliere.

594
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,480
Are they gonna be okay?

595
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
They'll live to fight another day.

596
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
It's what we do.

597
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,480
I used to fantasize
about meeting you.

598
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,680
Trading stories or having a beer.

599
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,000
Or just making eye contact.

600
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm sorry, I...

601
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,160
I guess back at headquarters...

602
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,760
I was afraid to get too close to you.

603
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,160
Why? You're my grandfather.

604
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,400
You're... you're more than that.
You're a hero to me.

605
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,200
I don't want to be anyone's hero.

606
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,200
That look you gave me
when we first met?

607
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,560
I've seen it before.

608
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,000
When people look up to me,

609
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,840
decide that they have to act
a certain way,

610
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,560
a way that's likely
to get them killed.

611
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,840
I do what I do.

612
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,200
So that others don't have to.

613
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,360
So you wouldn't have to.

614
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,840
My whole life, people have been
trying to shield me from the world,

615
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,040
your son included.

616
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,240
Meanwhile, all I ever wanted
to be was a soldier, like you.

617
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,880
It's a parent's job
to protect their child.

618
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,840
But it's a child's obligation
to themselves to live their own life.

619
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,600
You can and should do whatever
you set your mind to.

620
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,760
But you should know...

621
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,520
you don't have to be a soldier
to be a hero.

622
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,920
And we approach
from the southwest,

623
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,520
destroy the weapons lab
and the Baron in one move.

624
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,800
Except for the last time
we faced him,

625
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,040
he took out both of our teams.

626
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,920
The last time, we weren't being
backed by a squadron of B-17s.

627
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,960
Then how do we get Ray and Amaya
out before the bombs start falling?

628
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
We don't.

629
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,000
This conflict is bigger
than any one of us.

630
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,120
If it means ending the war
one day sooner,

631
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Amaya would happily make
that sacrifice.

632
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,640
But she doesn't have to.

633
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,200
Look, I know you and your team think,

634
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,360
we're a group of irresponsible
losers.

635
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,600
But I know Ray Palmer

636
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,880
and he has a plan
to get out of that bunker.

637
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,240
We just need to give him time...

638
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,080
Which means giving the Nazis time.

639
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,920
I'm calling in the strike.

640
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
I can't let you do that.

641
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,320
You don't have the authority.

642
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
Yes, she does.

643
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,400
Miss Lance speaks for all of us.

644
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,960
I have watched her become the beating
heart and steady hand of this team.

645
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,000
She is the proper person to lead us.

646
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,680
And if she says that we are
going to rescue our people...

647
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,800
that is what we are going to do.

648
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,920
This would go a lot faster
if I wasn't handcuffed.

649
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,440
I mean, what do you think,
I'm gonna escape using a microscope?

650
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,280
Are you going to
make more serum...

651
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,320
or is your friend going to die?

652
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,600
First off, it's not a serum.

653
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,160
It's a biomolecular enhancer.

654
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,440
By the way, who gave you this?

655
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,640
Because, from an engineering
standpoint, it's really rather ama...

656
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,560
Yes. I can make more.

657
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,680
Ray, don't do it.

658
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,640
Don't help him.

659
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,920
Back to work.

660
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,760
Watch them.

661
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,840
How can you do this?

662
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,120
No member of the JSA
would ever help the Nazis.

663
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,880
Neither would a Legend.

664
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,520
Damn, I really wanted to do it
with just the microscope.

665
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,040
Get the handcuff keys.

666
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,280
Alpha-stabilizer's damaged.
Suit's not gonna work.

667
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,000
They took my amulet.

668
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,800
And without it,
I'm guessing you're just...

669
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,120
A fifth-degree black belt

670
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,000
with training in edged weapons
combat.

671
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,520
Nice, but I think we'll need more
than that to get past super-Krieger.

672
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,520
What are you doing?

673
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,600
I told you I had a plan.

674
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,120
It was to get my hands on this
and enhance it, but not for them.

675
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,040
I'm not only a man in a metal suit.

676
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,720
At least not after this.

677
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,880
We are under attack.

678
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,800
Baron Krieger has ordered us
to transport you

679
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,560
to a more secure location.

680
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,520
Who's attacking you?

681
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,400
Sir, the sentries are reporting

682
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,240
a man made of fire flying
through the forest.

683
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,960
Lock down the base. Now.

684
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,960
<i>Firestorm is drawing the troops away
from the bunker.</i>

685
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,560
Copy that. We still need to find
Ray and Amaya.

686
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,760
Mick, look out!

687
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,160
Thanks, Haircut.

688
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,800
I believe this belongs to you.

689
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,960
Steel, Mid-Nite, we've recovered
the rest of the team.

690
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,520
I suggest you save
the teary reunion for later.

691
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,360
Hourman ordered
the bombers to strike.

692
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,720
They're five minutes out.

693
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,720
But, Herr Krieger is here right now!

694
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,720
Come on, you Nazi bastard.

695
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,280
- Get on!
- What are you doing here?

696
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,720
Saving you! Get on!

697
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,000
<i>Bombing run about to commence.
All points, get clear.</i>

698
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,360
Working on it!

699
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
What was that?

700
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,160
He's dead.

701
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,520
You did it. You saved us!

702
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,680
<i>I'm afraid Mr. Heywood's
vitals are dropping.</i>

703
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,960
There's got to be something on board
this tub to get him back on his feet.

704
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,520
You people are from the future,
for God's sake!

705
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,880
The bomb blast caused
massive internal bleeding.

706
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,400
And because his body lacks
the normal clotting factor,

707
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,360
there's only so much Gideon can do!

708
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,360
Were you two close?

709
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,360
No, not really.

710
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,760
But if it wasn't for Nate, I'd still
be trapped in the Cretaceous period

711
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,400
being chased by a T. Rex.

712
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm sorry.

713
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,160
This is our fight, not yours.

714
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,720
- The Nazis are not...
- Nazis.

715
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,240
Nazis.

716
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,040
You kept the serum?

717
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,520
There may be enough.

718
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
I think I can save him, with this.

719
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,640
Is that the Nazi serum that created
that hideous berserker?

720
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Are you mad?

721
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,480
I did a little tinkering
to the formula, so...

722
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,840
So, what will it do now?

723
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,800
With any luck, save his life.

724
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,480
How do we know if it's working?

725
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,640
He's not dead yet,
so that's a good sign.

726
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,920
And he's not turning
into a Nazi berserker.

727
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,400
His vitals are improving.

728
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,360
He's stabilizing.

729
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
What'd the Nazis want with
a piece of jewelry anyway?

730
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,560
No idea.

731
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,560
Hitler's known to be obsessed
with the strange.

732
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,960
We'll keep it safe, in any case.

733
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,160
I guess that's your way
of saying thanks.

734
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,960
Right. Well, I think it's time
we got out of 1942.

735
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,280
This was fun.

736
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,120
It was... unusual.

737
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,640
Hey, I wanted to apologize
for what I said.

738
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,520
About me not being a hero?

739
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,280
You're not a superhero.

740
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,880
But, what you did for Nate...

741
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,200
giving him the serum, giving up
your chance at real powers...

742
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,320
that was heroic.

743
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,120
Oh, it's about time, Sleeping Beauty.

744
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,040
I was afraid you wouldn't wake up
in time for me to say good-bye.

745
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,800
And here I was afraid
I wasn't gonna wake up at all.

746
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,520
I was afraid of that, too.

747
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,800
I'm sorry if I didn't live up to
the version of Commander Steel

748
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,480
you dreamt of meeting.

749
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,160
No, I like the real version better.

750
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,800
Well, I'll be damned.

751
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,840
Guess this means
we're both gonna make it.

752
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,000
Not bad for a historian.

753
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,680
Not bad for a hero.

754
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,320
- Hello, Rex.
- Who are you?

755
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,760
Oh, we've met before.

756
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,200
Quite a number of times, actually.

757
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,400
In fact, after our last go,
you discovered my plan

758
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,000
and then traveled
through time yourself

759
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,960
to stop the Legends from coming here.

760
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,240
They... they said I disappeared.

761
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,680
Not disappeared.

762
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
No.

763
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,680
Erased from the timeline.

764
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,240
Like this.

765
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
No.

766
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Rex?

767
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,360
Rex.

768
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,680
Rex.

769
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,640
Rex, no.

770
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,360
Time...

771
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,200
time traveler.

772
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,160
No.

773
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,080
Rex.
