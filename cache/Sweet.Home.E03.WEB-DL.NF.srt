{\an8}<i>LAST WORLD</i> FAN FESTIVAL
VIP TESTER EVENT

00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,725
{\an8}APPLY

5
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,351
YOU HAVE APPLIED AS A VIP TESTER

6
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,979
Hyun-su, how long are you
going to behave like that?

7
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,857
-What?
-Honey.

8
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,485
Dad, why are you ruining the mood?

9
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,987
Then when else would I be
able to talk to him?

10
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,655
He never leaves his room.

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,949
Why are you ruining your own life?

12
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,327
Stop it. This is a family trip.

13
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,120
Hyun-su came out to join us.

14
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,121
So what?

15
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,748
Should I be impressed?

16
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,835
Fuck.

17
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,004
What?

18
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,339
You make me sick.

19
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,593
I'm so grateful you earn money for us
just to neglect your own son.

20
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,429
-You little brat.
-Hey, what's wrong with you?

21
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,640
Shut up, Su-a.
You're ashamed of me, aren't you?

22
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,227
Are you scared you'll end up like me?
I heard you talking shit with your friend.

23
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,938
-That's…
-Hyun-su, calm down.

24
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,607
You're no different, Mom.

25
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,986
You suggested it.
Did you think I wouldn't know?

26
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,530
Hyun-su…

27
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,950
I thought you were strong enough
to overcome it.

28
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,036
I'm not! How could I?

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,871
Cha Hyun-su! You brat!

30
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,414
You should all just die.

31
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,958
Dad!

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,108
He's awake! Hyun-su's awake!

33
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,905
<i>I didn't think you'd wake up.</i>

34
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,034
How long was I unconscious?

35
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:40,952
A pretty long time.

36
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,914
<i>I had a dream…</i>

37
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,293
<i>A dream? What dream?</i>

38
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,963
<i>I can't remember it now.</i>

39
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,133
<i>I heard somebody was moving</i>
<i>into Room 1410. I guess that's you.</i>

40
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,259
-Living alone?
<i>-A loner?</i>

41
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,678
You'll just cause trouble…
Find somewhere else to die.

42
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,264
A slow speaker.

43
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,059
-I'll protect you.
-<i>Protect them?</i>

44
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,644
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

45
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,771
That's what dreams are like.

46
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,814
Uncle…

47
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,942
I want to be alone for a while.

48
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,195
All right. Call me if you need any help.

49
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,405
You should live a decent life now.

50
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,492
At least for your dead family.

51
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,581
I'm sure there's a reason
you're the only one who survived.

52
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,300
<i>Did I have an uncle?</i>

53
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,368
Isn't it cool?

54
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:07,997
It's what you wanted. You wanted
everyone in the world to disappear.

55
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,083
-<i>You should all just die.</i>
-"You should all just die."

56
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,711
I can make everyone you hate disappear.

57
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,380
And I can do even more than that.

58
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,590
I am you.
All you have to do is accept that.

59
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,763
<i>Sir, what's wrong?</i>

60
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,649
Yeong-su, pull!

61
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,362
Wake up!

62
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,407
Come on!

63
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,756
Did you hear that?

64
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,508
Yes.

65
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,260
It's pretty loud.

66
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,306
Maybe it's the guy we saw.

67
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,808
What's God's will?

68
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,146
I'm sure it isn't to be selfish
and ignore others.

69
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,905
Run!

70
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,908
Hurry!

71
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,246
Are you okay?

72
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,376
Who are…

73
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,589
The kids.

74
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,299
What about the kids?

75
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,054
You're infected, aren't you?

76
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,806
Your nose was bleeding and you fainted!

77
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,558
-You're the one who wanted to save him.
-Are you sure he won't turn?

78
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,894
I'm sure crushing his head in right now

79
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,439
is not the will of God.

80
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,784
Help me.

81
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,373
Please help me.

82
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,999
I made a promise.

83
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,586
Help me.

84
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,256
Please.

85
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,054
Su-yeong, is he not coming back?

86
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,723
Is he dead?

87
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,729
We have to go on our own.

88
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,106
But…

89
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,450
It's okay. I won't tell anyone.

90
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,953
Let's go.

91
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,378
I…

92
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,382
can't see.

93
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,809
Where are you?

94
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,529
I think I should tell you in advance.

95
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,324
They're not infected.

96
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,285
There aren't any monsters around here.

97
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,079
Let's go.

98
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,669
I can't see!

99
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,338
<i>You might meet a monster that can't see.</i>

100
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,631
His hearing is really good.

101
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,514
<i>Don't make any noise.</i>

102
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,893
<i>And don't move.</i>

103
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,104
I can't see…

104
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,536
I can't see…

105
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,940
I found you.

106
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,377
No!

107
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,391
Su-yeong, he told us

108
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,186
that it was Room 1408.

109
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,230
This is the 15th floor, though.

110
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,901
We can't go there now.

111
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,903
The monsters are fighting there.

112
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,946
Su-yeong…

113
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,533
There might be some grown-ups
who can help us.

114
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,921
Hello? Is there anyone in there?

115
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,381
Please help us!

116
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,514
Help us!

117
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,746
Close your eyes.

118
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,415
Su-yeong…

119
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,167
I said to close your eyes, Kim Yeong-su!

120
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,994
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, ASSHOLE

121
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,498
PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY STATEMENT

122
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,082
<i>My fellow citizens,</i>

123
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,421
<i>we are declaring a state of emergency.</i>

124
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,761
<i>Do not leave your homes.</i>

125
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,936
<i>The monsters are extremely dangerous.</i>

126
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,605
Don't touch the children.

127
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,777
You can do that, right?

128
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,492
<i>The government will prioritize</i>
<i>the citizens' safety…</i>

129
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,328
<i>and…</i>

130
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,708
What?

131
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>As if! Shit!</i>

132
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,760
<i>Everyone is going to die.</i>
<i>You're all fucked!</i>

133
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,352
<i>You're going to die.</i>

134
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,729
<i>Die!</i>

135
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,530
What?

136
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,992
Is the president dead?

137
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,662
Gosh. I voted for him.

138
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,498
But still, they'll come and save us.

139
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,958
Are you deaf?

140
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,501
He just said we're all fucked!

141
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,430
-What's wrong with him?
-Seung-wan, what's wrong?

142
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,140
My poor daughter…

143
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,809
No…

144
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,870
Da-eun…

145
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,464
Da-eun…

146
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,770
Da-eun…

147
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,202
No…

148
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:58,749
No!

149
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,837
Da-eun…

150
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,134
Da-eun?

151
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,698
To be honest,

152
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,118
I already knew.

153
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,211
<i>I knew…</i>

154
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,967
that my baby was gone.

155
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,067
Kids, run.

156
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,778
Hurry!

157
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,115
Come on.

158
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,922
How do we kill that thing?

159
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,276
Take the kids and run!

160
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,448
Come to Room 1408!

161
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,001
Ji-su,

162
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,129
I'll take care of this.

163
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,261
Even those great muscles…

164
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,642
can't compete with this, I guess.

165
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,229
You're lousier than I thought.

166
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,355
He'll kill you.

167
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,606
Right? You piece of meat.

168
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,277
All right, that's it.

169
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,621
Ma'am, are you okay?

170
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,404
What about the kids?

171
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,315
There's no greater love than laying down
one's life for their friends.

172
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,734
If you do as God commands, you're…

173
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,695
His friend.

174
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,549
Amen.

175
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,825
They're safe.

176
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,887
I can go by myself from here.

177
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,435
Make sure to come, okay?

178
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,689
Okay.

179
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,816
I'll see you in Room 1408.

180
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,288
Who are you?

181
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,142
Ji-su.

182
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,686
I'm glad you're okay.

183
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,146
Do you want to die that badly?

184
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,692
I get that you like God,

185
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,987
but you can go meet him later.

186
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,325
God is omnipresent.

187
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,001
-Come on!
-Okay.

188
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,222
Ji-su, wait.

189
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,640
Someone must have been here.

190
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,859
You're pretty rude sometimes.

191
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,781
You're the first one to visit my room.

192
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,701
Oh, is your room usually…

193
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,996
It's not usually this bad.

194
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,123
Okay.

195
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,517
Ji-su.

196
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,644
Aren't you going to take that?

197
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,243
NOW IT'S YOURS

198
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,768
This is yours, right?

199
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,191
Hey, you got the job!

200
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,651
Congrats…

201
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,869
This is all useless, Mom.

202
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,498
I've studied so hard for five years,

203
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,584
but the world is over now.

204
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,712
The president's death
doesn't mean it's over.

205
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,007
We don't know that.
You're jumping to conclusions.

206
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,105
<i>As if! Shit!</i>

207
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,484
<i>Everyone is going to die.</i>
<i>You're all fucked!</i>

208
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,405
-Ma'am, turn that off, will you?
-<i>You're going to die. Die!</i>

209
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,448
It's getting on my nerves.

210
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,741
Stop calling me "ma'am."

211
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,911
You're such an asshole.

212
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,622
"Asshole"? Right…

213
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,465
Have you seen my sister?

214
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,010
Eun-yu?
I haven't seen her for a while now.

215
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,469
Weren't you with her?

216
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,471
No.

217
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,808
I guess he was pretty flustered, too.

218
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,893
He doesn't even know where his sister is.

219
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,272
Bom, I promise I'll never leave your side.

220
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,121
Come and sit.

221
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,251
Okay.

222
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,802
Enjoy.

223
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,806
Let's eat.

224
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,697
Kids,

225
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,241
what are your names?

226
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,580
I'm Kim Yeong-su.

227
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,666
I'm Kim Su-yeong.

228
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,294
Kim Yeong-su and Kim Su-yeong.

229
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,590
Yeong-su and Su-yeong…

230
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,967
They're peculiar names…

231
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,185
I guess your parents
gave you similar names,

232
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,145
so you two would always stick together.

233
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,689
Yeong-su and Su-yeong. Right?

234
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,652
Dad named us…

235
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,863
Dad…

236
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,340
Thank you.

237
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,935
It's all right. I don't really drink.

238
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,072
You sure know how to drink.

239
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,868
-Here, you can have one, too.
-Oh, I'm…

240
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,579
Oh, right. You're a minor.

241
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,206
Right. There are kids here,

242
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,585
so let's not break the law. I'll buy you
a drink when you become an adult.

243
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,461
You should learn how to drink from adults.

244
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,798
Do you think…

245
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,509
that day will come?

246
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,627
ELECTRICAL ROOM

247
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,637
The electricity's back on,
but why hasn't she returned yet?

248
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,517
Isn't there a security camera
in the basement?

249
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,229
The camera's been turned like that.

250
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,862
I told her it was too dangerous.

251
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,614
Didn't I tell her, Bom?

252
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,993
Let's wait a bit longer.

253
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,436
Hey, it's your turn.

254
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,064
-What?
-It's your turn to stand watch.

255
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,162
I'm infected.

256
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,123
I know.

257
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,625
If I turn,

258
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,918
kill me.

259
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,799
Sorry.

260
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,053
What?

261
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,765
If I turn…

262
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,771
kill me and I'll do the same for you.

263
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,898
Okay?

264
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:30,860
Okay.

265
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,677
This is so selfish!

266
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,805
{\an8}GREEN SUPERMARKET

267
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,058
Hang on.

268
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,476
Seok-hyeon, it's me, Byeong-il.

269
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,730
You shouldn't do this to me!

270
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,524
I'm not running a charity here.

271
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,859
Bring money if you want something!

272
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,528
This is insane.

273
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,614
What…

274
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,244
GREEN SUPERMARKET

275
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,289
Who is he?

276
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,875
You're Room 802, right?

277
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,962
What happened to your face?
I couldn't recognize you.

278
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,547
Were you here the whole time?

279
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,926
No, I came down earlier tonight.

280
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,302
Tonight?

281
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,764
Your face looks awful.
Did something happen on the way down?

282
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,266
Oh, this?

283
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,227
I got hurt a while ago.

284
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,520
A burglar broke into my house.

285
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,230
-A burglar?
-A burglar?

286
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,773
A burglar in this building?

287
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,610
What's he doing?

288
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,407
-My goodness.
-There's food!

289
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,118
We can share.

290
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,328
Thank you so much.

291
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,664
Take this.

292
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,673
-I'm sure you'll be blessed.
-We should all help each other, right?

293
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,009
-Thank you.
-I got this, too.

294
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,095
Thank you. We're saved now.

295
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,263
Here.

296
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,477
Take this.

297
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,565
It's all right.

298
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,281
Take as much as you want.

299
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,616
Thank you.

300
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,997
Help yourself.

301
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,260
What are you doing?

302
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,597
I've been watching since dawn.

303
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,349
I think it's safe outside.

304
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,725
All the monsters are gone.

305
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,354
You're thinking of going out?

306
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,940
Do you want to die in here, then?

307
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,693
-If I can get to the car…
-Then take me, too!

308
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,238
My mom lives in Wangsimni.
Please just take me there.

309
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,989
I'll have to take a detour if--

310
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,241
Please.

311
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,284
-It's too far.
-Please. Come on.

312
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,037
Is it nice to eat free food like a beggar?

313
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,373
You could've given me some food, too.

314
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,583
Buy some with your money!

315
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,670
How can you treat me like this?

316
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,507
What's this sound?

317
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,450
Tell them to turn it off!

318
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,745
They turn it on every morning.
You used to dance to it.

319
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,582
Hey, don't you remember that monster
with the tongue?

320
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,294
It's going to hear that
and come back here!

321
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,255
Gosh, you startled me.

322
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,716
How can it hear that and come here?
That's ridiculous.

323
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,218
Do you think it only has a tongue?
It has ears, too!

324
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,680
It must have ears! It's going to hear it!
Tell them to stop that!

325
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,627
<i>Survivors in the building,</i>

326
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,090
<i>take any food, medicine, and weapons</i>
<i>you have and come to the first floor.</i>

327
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,551
<i>The first floor is quite safe for now,</i>

328
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,179
<i>and it'll be safer to stay together.</i>

329
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,352
We survivors…

330
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,938
<i>must stick together.</i>

331
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,113
Please come down.

332
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,952
<i>Please.</i>

333
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,583
