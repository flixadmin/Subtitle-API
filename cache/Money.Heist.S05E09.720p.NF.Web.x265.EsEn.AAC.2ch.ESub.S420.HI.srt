To open this fucking building.

270
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,125
They feel powerful locked up in here.

271
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,791
But there's less than ten of them
and the whole army's out there.

Once you've done that,
we will have won this war.

00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,250
In less than ten minutes,
they'll take control of the bank.

And what about you?

00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,958
You, me, and Ramiro,

about your past, you,

287

You seemed pretty involved.

00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,125
What do you mean "involved"?

289
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,041
Um, like very eager, very passionate...

290
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,875
It was too much, right?

291
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,750
I overdid it. I... I knew should've been
more delicate, but with the...

296
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,375
Well, tell me.

297
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,416
How are you feeling?

298
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,958
Well, things are clearer now.

299
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,291
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

300
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,791
Yeah,

301
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:32,416
because before having an orgasm, you...
Well, there's a lot of noise in your head.

302
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,000
But once you ejaculate,
only one of two things can happen,

303
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,500
either you want to get
the hell out of there, or...

304
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,416
or you wanna be with that person
for the rest of your life.

305
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,291
And? What do you want to do?

306
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,791
I want to stay here,

307
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,791
with you,

308
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,458
holding you for the rest of my life.

309
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,041
If you want to, of course.

310
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,375
But under one condition.

311
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

312
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,166
The next time you feel like going out,

313
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,791
don't lie to me.

314
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,583
You'll take me with you
to party until the sun rises.

315
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,125
- Or until it sets again.
- Sure.

316
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,125
Fuck, can't you knock?
What the hell's wrong with you?

317
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,750
Someone stole the gold.

318
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,708
What?

319
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,833
Absolutely not a word about this.

320
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,125

it's over, we're dead.

We have the traffic cameras.

327

There's nothing here,
not in those 15 minutes, or the next 15.

335
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,208
They took a local road.
There's no cameras on those.

336
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,750
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Any idiot knows that.</i></font>

337
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,393
- Then there's no way we can find them.
- No, we still have time.

338
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,166
All we can do
is take care of the people outside.

339
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,083
Cincinnati, my daughter, and my mom.

340
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,083
I won't give up now.
I won't throw in the towel.

341
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,625
You already did.
When you put your hands down.

342
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,000
You had weapons, men,
a strong position, and you surrendered.

343
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,125
It was a lost battle.

346

Killing 20 police officers
wouldn't have saved us.

They weren't police officers!

Lisbon was right.

357
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,625

They knew we would check
the security cameras.

360
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,833
It was the only thing we could do.

361
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,375
And that we would believe what we saw.

362
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:53,041
But maybe what we're seeing isn't real.

363

It didn't rain today, that's yesterday.

367
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500

they could've went on a local road

<font color="#00FF7F"><i>that doesn't have any cameras.</i></font>

369
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,721
Why would they go through
all that trouble?

370
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,958
Because they need to.

371
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,041
Exactly.

372
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:19,041
They're going somewhere
they can only get to on this road.

373
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,916
The M60 is a ring road.
They'd never use it to get out of Madrid.

374
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,500
Because they're not running away.

375
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,333
That means they're hiding.

376
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,541
No one's gonna leave the country
with 90 tons of gold.

377
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,416
What do you do when you have
so much money and so much gold

378
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,780
that you can't take it with you?

- What did pirates do?
- They bury it!

381
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
That's why they're using dump trucks.

382
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,916
- That's right.
- The gold is underground.

383
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,916
- Correct!
- Where do you bury that kind of treasure?

384
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,750
Wherever it is, they're burying it.

385
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,583
The hole you need to make
to bury 90 tons of gold

386
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,833
requires you to move around
so much earth and so much machinery...

547
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,541
So I recommend you start looking for

548
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,083
the deepest, darkest hole
you can use to hide

549
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,416
because we're coming for ya.

550
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,458
There's no need, Tamayo.

551
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,291
I'm turning myself in.

552

<font color="#00FF7F"><i>I don't think it's 100% clear

<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Not even to everyone in the gang.</i></font>

554
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,750
Some people think
it's because I'm a coward.

555
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,875
Because if something went wrong,

556
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,125
I'd be safe, not them.

557
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,583
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>But I promised myself
that if the gang went down...</i></font>

558
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,708
I'd go down too.

559
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,708
You've already won this game, Tamayo.

560

<font color="#00FF7F"><i>So it makes no sense

562
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:16,833

563
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,916
between gentlemen,
to accept my surrender and...

564
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
No!

00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,666
<font color="#E69138"><b>PROFESSOR</b></font>: <font color="#00FF7F"><i>And allow me to go to the bank</i></font>

566
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,958

Okay, make that 15 minutes instead of 20.

569
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,041
What do you mean you'll surrender?

570
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,166
Yeah.

571
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,875
This is Colonel Tamayo.

572
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:47,458
We're keeping the hostages in the library.
Don't let them get out of there.

573
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,125
Nobody gets out! Understood?

574
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,333
What are you trying to do?
Be a hero? Or be a martyr?

575
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,583
Listen to me.
If the gang leaves the bank, it's over.

576
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,000
Everything would be lost.

577
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,791
There'd be no turning back. But right now...

578
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,375
Right now, we still have a chance.

579
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,416
One in a million,
but we might still have it.

580
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,583
A chance to do what? A chance to do what?

581
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,458
I need you to find the gold.

582

589
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,416
Now it turns out that you and I,
a new mother and an ex-convict,

590
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,916
are in charge of delivering

If there's anyone who can do it, it's you.

594
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,791
I am a woman who just had a baby girl
and I'm breastfeeding.

I'm absolutely exhausted.
I'm tired, very tired.

596

And I don't know... I don't know
if I can deal with a war

598
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,125
- I don't know.
- All you have to do is find some robbers.

599
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,833
That's what you've been doing
your whole life. You're the best.

600
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,708
- Stop buttering me up, Sergio.
- You found me.

601
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,541
And I'm the most wanted man
in all of Spain.

602
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,583
Alicia, Interpol was
looking for me for months.

603
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,916
They looked all over the planet.

604
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,208
They didn't find me. You did.

605

In hours.

606
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:18,291
You snuck out
of a press conference full of journalists.

607
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:21,083
You ran away from Tamayo,
from the entire police force,

608
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,625
while you were nine months pregnant
and you found me!

609

Of course you're going to find that gold!

610
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,833
So take those cars and this gang...

611

00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,000
Maybe because you're
