1
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,877
Oh, great and mighty Rapu,

2
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,964
we pray to you for water and sustenance.

3
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:53,511
I pray to you, not for me,
but for my daughter.

4
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,300
I'm tired.

5
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,552
<i>You have suffered.</i>

6
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>Come to me.</i>

7
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,391
<i>Come to me.</i>

8
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,149
<i>You have suffered.</i>

9
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>Come to me.</i>

10
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,835
<i>You have suffered.</i>

11
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,212
Ah! What do we have here?

12
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,757
Look at it.

13
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,676
It's gobbling up all my fruit.

14
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,472
Rapu.

15
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,268
Bringer of Light.

16
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,645
Oh, it's one of mine.

17
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,525
I am Gorr, the last of your disciples.

18
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,611
We have lost everything, my lord.

19
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,405
The land is dry.

20
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,740
All life is lost.

21
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,992
But our faith in you never wavered

22
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,161
and now we await the promise

23
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,707
of the eternal reward.

24
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,084
Is this why you celebrate?

25
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,463
He... He thinks there's an eternal reward.

26
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,511
No. No, sorry.

27
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,888
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

28
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,351
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

29
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,521
We just vanquished the holder
of the Necrosword...

30
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,082
<i>- You have suffered.</i>
- ...before he could harm

31
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,733
any other gods with that cursed blade.

32
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,876
<i>If it's revenge you seek.</i>

33
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,111
He threatened to end my entire empire.

34
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,238
But, my lord,

35
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,324
your empire has already ended.

36
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,827
There's no one left to worship you.

37
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,413
There'll be
more followers to replace you.

38
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,789
There always are.

39
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,750
We have suffered...

40
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,045
and we have starved.

41
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,883
My daughter died...

42
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,762
- in your name.
- And well you should.

43
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,890
Suffering for your gods
is your only purpose.

44
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,267
There's nothing for you after death.

45
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,810
Except death.

46
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,272
You are no god.

47
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,530
I renounce you.

48
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,707
Now your meaningless life
finally does have a purpose.

49
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,378
To sacrifice yourself to me.

50
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,883
<i>If it's revenge you seek...</i>

51
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,094
<i>...kill all the gods.</i>

52
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,096
<i>Go to Eternity.</i>

53
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,224
<i>If it's revenge you seek...</i>

54
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,477
<i>summon the Bifrost.</i>

55
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,770
<i>Go to Eternity.</i>

56
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,146
<i>Kill all the gods.</i>

57
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,981
<i>Summon the Bifrost.</i>

58
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,150
<i>- Go to Eternity.
- Kill all the gods.</i>

59
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,569
<i>Kill all the gods. Kill all the gods.</i>

60
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,793
The sword chose you.

61
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,587
You are now cursed!

62
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,839
Funny.

63
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,091
It doesn't feel like a curse.

64
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,346
Feels like a promise.

65
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,433
So, this is my vow.

66
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,521
All gods will die.

67
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,319
Come, come, gather round.

68
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,697
And listen to the legend
of the Space Viking.

69
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:33,495
AKA the God of Thunder. AKA Thor Odinson.

70
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,212
<i>Raised in the way of the warrior,</i>

71
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,798
<i>Thor was taught to help win battles,</i>

72
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,007
<i>fighting the good fight</i>

73
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,343
<i>for those who can't fight good.</i>

74
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,432
<i>He grew and he grew and he grew.</i>

75
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,352
<i>He was sensitive, like a smile.</i>

76
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,730
<i>And his loving nature
did not discriminate.</i>

77
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,900
<i>He once loved a swashbuckling Passionista.</i>

78
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,903
<i>Another time, he loved a Wolf Woman</i>

79
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,571
<i>on a Woman Wolf.</i>

80
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,493
<i>But Thor's one true love
was an Earth woman</i>

81
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,245
<i>named Jane Fonda.</i>

82
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,831
<i>Oh, wait. No. Jane Foster.</i>

83
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,459
<i>But sadly, in the battle
for love, Thor lost.</i>

84
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,544
<i>Ooh.</i>

85
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,423
<i>In fact, he lost a lot
of people in those days.</i>

86
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,716
<i>His mum.</i>

87
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,092
<i>His dad.</i>

88
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,552
<i>And that guy.</i>

89
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,678
<i>And that guy.</i>

90
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,971
<i>And whoever that is.</i>

91
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,264
<i>And Heimdall.</i>

92
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,182
<i>And his brother.</i>

93
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,934
<i>And his brother, again.</i>

94
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,019
<i>And again.</i>

95
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,314
<i>Poor Thor had to watch his planet explode.</i>

96
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,234
<i>And then he said, "What have I done?"</i>

97
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,236
<i>It seemed that everything</i>

98
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,238
<i>and everyone he loved, he lost.</i>

99
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,283
<i>And so he hid his heart
behind a big, fleshy bod,</i>

100
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,910
<i>so it could never be broken again.</i>

101
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,246
<i>But just because he was done loving,</i>

102
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,956
<i>didn't mean he was done fighting.</i>

103
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,710
<i>He teamed up with
the Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

104
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,296
<i>and set off on some
classic Thor adventures.</i>

105
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,340
<i>He got in shape.</i>

106
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,300
<i>Putting in the hard yards.</i>

107
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,471
<i>Turning pains into gains,
and never skipping leg day.</i>

108
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,933
<i>He went from Dad Bod to God Bod.</i>

109
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,270
<i>But beneath his God Bod,
there was still a Sad Bod</i>

110
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,521
<i>just trying to get out.</i>

111
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,275
<i>Because all of the bods</i>

112
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,444
<i>that Thor had worn over the years</i>

113
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,737
<i>couldn't hide the pain</i>

114
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,739
<i>that he was feeling on the inside.</i>

115
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,493
<i>So he gave up his search for love,</i>

116
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,330
<i>accepting that he was
only good for one thing...</i>

117
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,793
<i>Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say,</i>

118
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,505
<i>"Thor, we need your help
to win this battle."</i>

119
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,359
Thor.

120
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,385
We need your help to win this battle.

121
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,719
Let's go.

122
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,888
Okay. Come on, Storm breaker.

123
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,640
Back to work.

124
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,601
We must hurry, okay?

125
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,020
People are dying.

126
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,230
See you down there.

127
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,277
Hurry up!

128
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,998
Give me those. You're gonna break 'em.

129
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,376
I am Groot!

130
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,169
Ah, you got sap all over it.

131
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,881
Hello, everybody.

132
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,633
Well, well, look who it is.

133
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,301
How are we doing, guys?

134
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,594
Terrible!

135
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,638
We're all about to die.

136
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,182
You said this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

137
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,144
I said it was going to be,
"Like a relaxing holiday."

138
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,104
But look at that resplendent skyscape.

139
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,480
Three suns of Saturn.

140
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,190
What could be more relaxing than that?

141
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,234
An actual holiday!

142
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,445
Die, Booskan scum!

143
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,699
God of Thunder.

144
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,117
King Yakan.

145
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,786
You have finally joined our fight.

146
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,079
Well, as they say,

147
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,765
"Better late than not at all."

148
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,374
Yes, it's very nice.

149
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,586
As you know, we used to live
in a peaceful oasis.

150
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,671
But then our gods were murdered.

151
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:12,756
Murdered?

152
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,842
And now our sacred temple
has been left unguarded,

153
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,762
and Habooska's hordes
took control of its power.

154
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,349
It is our most sacred shrine
and he desecrates it.

155
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,433
Not for long.

156
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,685
Ah!

157
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,105
King Yakan, tell them
what happened here today.

158
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,566
Tell of the time that Thor,

159
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:36,404
and his ragtag, motley crew
of misfit desperados,

160
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,448
turned the tide of the battle,

161
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,700
and etched their names in history.

162
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,744
For the odds may be against us,

163
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,187
but I'll tell you this for free...

164
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,372
Here it comes.

165
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,917
This ends here and now!

166
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,922
Oh!

167
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,326
He's not going to go
into the temple, is he? No.

168
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,705
Oh.

169
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,339
Well done, everybody.

170
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,216
We can collectively take credit for that

171
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,717
because we worked as a team.

172
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,928
We used our hearts and our minds

173
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,346
to defeat the enemy

174
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,139
with minimal loss or damage.

175
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,941
What a classic Thor adventure!

176
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,359
Hurrah!

177
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,384
Good book?

178
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,593
Yeah.

179
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,470
I wrote it.

180
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,057
Wait. You're Dr. Jane Foster?

181
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,392
I am.

182
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,227
- Uh... Hi.
- Hi.

183
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,937
How's the, uh, Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

184
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,480
It's tough.

185
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,857
- Yeah.
- Really tough.

186
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,775
It's... You need a 3D model.

187
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,402
You ever see <i>Event Horizon?</i>

188
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,820
No.

189
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,239
<i>- Interstellar?</i>
- No.

190
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,206
That movie explains everything
really clearly.

191
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,744
Um, all right. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge

192
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,497
folds space, so that point A and point B

193
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,459
coexist in space and time.

194
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,085
Like that.

195
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,297
You just ruined your own book.

196
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,132
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

197
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:27,886
Watch those movies.

198
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,387
- Okay.
- Okay.

199
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,806
Saw the Hot Cheetos, had to get it.

200
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,066
So, how's, uh... how's it going?

201
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,486
It's going amazing.

202
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,535
Have you told anyone else besides me?

203
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,413
When people find out,
they start acting weird.

204
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,540
They're just different.

205
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,126
I don't need that in my life right now.

206
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,920
Anyway, it's not that serious.

207
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,588
Jane, it's Stage Four.

208
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,924
Out of, like, how many stages?

209
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,676
Four.

210
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,010
That we know about.

211
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,642
Oh, you have somewhere else
you gotta be right now

212
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,435
that's more important than chemo?

213
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:18,853
No.

214
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,130
You're trying to get back
to the lab, aren't you?

215
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,906
I have a few ideas I'm trying.

216
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,866
Okay, no, time out.

217
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,911
I know you think your lab work
is something you have to do,

218
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,622
otherwise you're letting down
all of civilization,

219
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,390
but you're not getting what the universe

220
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,960
is actually trying to tell you,

221
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,503
so let me translate.

222
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,089
Slow down.

223
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,216
You need your energy to fight this thing.

224
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,845
I'll fight it my way, okay?

225
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,346
Well, FYI,

226
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:57,183
"my way" does not have
to equal "alone in a lab."

227
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,188
Maybe it's time to play
the Space Viking card.

228
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,357
- It's not a card.
- Yes, it is.

229
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,942
- There's no card.
- There's a card.

230
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,486
It's tall, it's blond, and it's gorgeous.

231
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,030
It's a handsome card.

232
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,948
- Jane, are you sure?
- Look, Darcy...

233
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,243
I will figure this out by myself.

234
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,962
<i>Results are
still coming back the same.</i>

235
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,465
<i>I'm afraid the chemo
has very little effect.</i>

236
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,218
<i>I'm so sorry, Jane.</i>

237
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,804
<i>If there's anything I can do,</i>

238
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,848
<i>or if you just wanna talk, call me.</i>

239
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,614
Smell like a king, because you're worthy.

240
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,157
Old Spice.

241
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,120
Cut!

242
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,691
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

243
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,026
Home.

244
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,360
Yes, home, Father.

245
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,529
We're here to take you home.

246
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,449
Yes. To planet Asgard.

247
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,993
Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

248
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,829
It is people. It is you!

249
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,873
And now, it is time

250
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,584
for me to pass on to the spirit realm.

251
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,047
I will take my place

252
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,091
in the great banqueting hall of Valhalla,

253
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,594
the resting place of the gods.

254
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,721
Oh, one more thing.

255
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,890
You have a sister.

256
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,811
And so now, I turn into godly stardust,

257
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,022
and say farewell.

258
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,690
Oh, look.

259
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,193
Do you see? It's happening.

260
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,612
I'm disappearing.

261
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,701
No!

262
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,827
Father!

263
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,414
But wait! Brother!

264
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,086
An ominous portal hath appeared behind us.

265
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,754
Transform!

266
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,266
I am Hela, Goddess of Death.

267
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,602
Now, I return to Asgard

268
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,397
to stake my claim
as the rightful heir to the throne,

269
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,399
and no one will stop me!

270
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,483
Join me or die!

271
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,859
We will never join you, witch!

272
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,944
Mjolnir!

273
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,075
Impossible!

274
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,495
I broke your hammer!

275
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,080
Time to die!

276
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,540
Bifrost!

277
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,846
You can almost feel the power

278
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,807
of these magnificent and immovable stones.

279
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,685
Okay. Let's head back to the village

280
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,771
where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

281
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,523
Come on.

282
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,060
God of Disaster,

283
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,479
we thank you.

284
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,481
We feared we would be at war forever

285
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,358
without the protection of our gods,

286
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,527
but now, peace shall reign.

287
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,448
In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

288
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,327
As is tradition,
the protectors of our world

289
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,496
are bestowed with great beasts.

290
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,124
Giant goats!

291
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,251
Oh, look at those! They are wonderful.

292
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,213
Korg, look at that.
Those things are beautiful.

293
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,632
King Yakan, thank you so much.

294
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,634
Listen, um, about the temple...

295
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:23,903
I don't wanna talk about the temple.

296
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,071
I know, but if we were to talk about it,

297
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,405
- I think it's important...
- It's making me sad.

298
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,490
...to life and material objects...

299
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,866
- And mad.
- Okay, I'll stop talking.

300
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,642
Don't forget the goats.

301
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,103
Which you accepted,
and now must take with you.

302
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,396
No backsies.

303
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,233
- Aw. They are beautiful.
- Yes, they are beautiful.

304
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,944
They also scream quite a lot.

305
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,028
They'll be fine.

306
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,072
I am Groot.

307
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,257
We need to find the damn remote

308
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,950
so we can download the distress signal!

309
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,136
Retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

310
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,520
One of your goats probably ate it!

311
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,390
Goats didn't eat the remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

312
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,891
Well, I ain't digging through their crap.

313
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,625
I love them!

314
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:56,769
They should live with us forever!

315
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:57,919
Found the remote!

316
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,129
I'm putting them down.

317
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,356
- Me too.
- Is it working or not?

318
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,732
No, it's not workin'. It's not charged.

319
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:02,817
Well, maybe you need to find a charger...

320
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:03,943
Get out of my way!

321
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,486
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

322
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,012
Whew.

323
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,888
- Korg, you okay?
- Yeah, bro. All good.

324
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,241
All right. Everybody, just relax.

325
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,433
The goats are gonna be fine.

326
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,226
If not, we can just use them for meat...

327
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,771
...ting people. Meeting people.

328
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,290
They're a great conversation starter.

329
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,315
And I've been told

330
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,835
you can summon them with a special whistle

331
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,503
that goes something like this...

332
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,380
No, that's not it.
No, that's not it.

333
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,822
No, that's not it. You have a go.

334
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,323
No, that's not it.

335
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,034
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Kraglin!

336
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,469
No, that's not it.

337
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,554
You been here this whole time?

338
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,058
Yeah, you said to stay with the ship.

339
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,206
This is Glenda. We're married.

340
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,334
I am Groot.

341
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,418
What did we tell you

342
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,003
about jumpin' into new relationships?

343
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,421
That I shouldn't be doing that.

344
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,589
Yeah, you can't get married

345
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,174
on every single planet we land on.

346
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,800
I am Groot.

347
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,802
Finally!

348
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,763
All right, here we go. Distress calls.

349
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:53,141
<i>Please help us!
The God Butcher has found us!</i>

350
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,434
God Butcher?

351
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,357
<i>He left them
hanging as a warning.</i>

352
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,146
Look at all of these gods, murdered.

353
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,106
<i>Our greatest champions,</i>

354
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,941
<i>now laid to waste.</i>

355
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,276
The horror.

356
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,043
Who could have done something like this?

357
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,030
<i>Thor, where are you?</i>

358
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,753
Wait, wait, wait. What was that? Go back.

359
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,201
Play that one.

360
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,287
<i>- Thor, where are you?</i>
- Sif?

361
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,663
<i>We need you here.</i>

362
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,053
My friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

363
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,793
Start the ship, my friends.

364
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,878
I don't know, maybe we should split up.

365
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:22,962
So many people to save,

366
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,048
I mean, look at all of these distress...

367
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,633
...calls.

368
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,012
Thor.

369
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,514
You gonna be okay?

370
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,200
I admire your commitment to each other.

371
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,392
It's a beautiful thing.

372
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,268
Alas, it's something I'll never have.

373
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,812
Buddy, if I may...

374
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:40,397
You may.

375
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,209
After thousands of years of living,

376
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,953
you don't seem to know
who the hell you are.

377
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,903
I've been lost before.

378
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,614
But then I found meaning, I found love.

379
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,009
And yeah, it got taken from me,

380
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,159
and god, that hurts.

381
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,747
But that shitty feeling
is better than feeling empty.

382
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,250
My hope for you is that

383
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,877
one day, you will find something

384
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,547
to make you feel this shitty.

385
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,425
I have loved before. It didn't work out.

386
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,677
They either die a grismal death

387
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,440
or they dump you
with a handwritten letter.

388
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:13,572
I don't know which is worse,

389
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,765
but it's why I keep everyone
at arm's length.

390
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:19,767
You've grown too attached.

391
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:20,997
Damn it, I knew this would happen.

392
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,221
You must go. I'll find Sif.

393
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:24,858
You answer the other calls.

394
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,317
The galaxy needs its Guardians.

395
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,461
Cool, yeah. We were just leaving...

396
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,903
Shh. I know it hurts.

397
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,910
But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

398
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,408
To ease the pain, why don't you, uh,

399
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,911
take this ship here
as a parting farewell gift?

400
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,872
Oh, you're giving me my ship?

401
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,373
Yes, she's yours.

402
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,209
May you make as many memories
with her as I have.

403
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,878
She's a temperamental old lass.

404
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,339
Will serve you well in a tight pickle.

405
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:48,774
- I'll start the ship.
- Thank you.

406
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,091
Goodbye, old friend.

407
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,011
A human handshake

408
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,971
to the Asgardian shake.

409
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,599
Into the snake that you cannot trust.

410
00:25:58,767 --> 00:25:59,994
You're really dragging this out.

411
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,854
And finish with the classic
Asgardian high one.

412
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,002
Let's go.

413
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,110
Take care of my crew.

414
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,434
This is gonna be hard for them.

415
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:11,571
Hurry up!

416
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:12,739
Not her.

417
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,157
Remember what I told you.

418
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,576
You ever feel lost,

419
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,704
just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

420
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,123
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

421
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,504
All right. Bye.

422
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,468
For what it's worth,
let's cling to the good memories.

423
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,351
We Asgardians say,

424
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,972
"May you travel with the speed
of Odin's ravens."

425
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,599
"I'll see you in Valhalla"

426
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,559
"where we shall drink mead and..."

427
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,730
- They're gone.
- Alone again. Just me and you.

428
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:47,065
Storm breaker!

429
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,984
Watch out, you frickin' crazy axe!

430
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:54,864
So what do we do now, bro?

431
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,408
Let's go get Sif!

432
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,717
Who or what is that?

433
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:17,012
Falligar, God of the Falligarians.

434
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,514
One of the nicest gods you'll ever meet.

435
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,267
Oh, no.

436
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,986
Sif, it's me, Thor.

437
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,571
Odinson?

438
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,156
You're missing an arm.

439
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,490
I'm gonna get you home.

440
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,576
No! Leave me here.

441
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,703
I want to die a warrior's death.

442
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,913
On the battlefield. In battle.

443
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,958
And then I can claim my place in Valhalla.

444
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,419
Oh, I hate to break it to you,

445
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,146
but for a warrior to get into Valhalla,

446
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,589
you have to die in the battle.

447
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,300
- You survived.
- Oh, shit.

448
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,677
Maybe your arm is in Valhalla.

449
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,555
What happened here?

450
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,640
I've been hunting a madman.

451
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,893
I followed him here, but it was a trap.

452
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,061
Who is this madman?

453
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,855
The God Butcher is coming.

454
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,358
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

455
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,276
Asgard is next.

456
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:04,804
Look, it's Thor!

457
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,931
- Thor!
- Take Sif to the infirmary.

458
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,183
Hey!

459
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,476
Who'd you piss off now?

460
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,120
This is not my fault.
I've never even seen these things,

461
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,204
whatever the hell they are.

462
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,396
Welcome back.

463
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,006
Who's the new guy?

464
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,884
That guy? You're gonna love that guy.

465
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:59,609
Mjol... Mjolnir! Mjolnir!

466
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:00,819
It's me, Thor.

467
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,195
Have you seen my hammer?

468
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,780
Mjolnir, here, boy.

469
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,325
Mjolnir?

470
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:12,622
Mjolnir.

471
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,879
You're back!

472
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:24,467
Mjolnir!

473
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,329
Excuse me.

474
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,290
Hello. That's my hammer you've got there.

475
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,084
And that's my look.

476
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:06,885
Hey!

477
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,388
Enough tomfoolery.

478
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,724
Why don't you take off
that mask and reveal yourself?

479
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:13,892
Come on.

480
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,811
Hey.

481
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,605
Jane?

482
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,155
<i>Let me tell you
the legend of Thor and Jane.</i>

483
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:32,911
<i>He was a God of Thunder
and she, a woman of science.</i>

484
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:36,581
<i>And although they were
from different worlds,</i>

485
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,043
<i>somehow, it just made sense.</i>

486
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,336
Whoo! Ha-ha!

487
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:42,879
<i>And together they embarked</i>

488
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,881
<i>on a journey of love.</i>

489
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,931
<i>Thor taught Jane the way of the warrior...</i>

490
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:58,103
<i>And Jane taught Thor
the way of the people.</i>

491
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:00,939
<i>And as time passed,</i>

492
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:03,650
<i>their love grew deeper and deeper.</i>

493
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,780
She's incredible, isn't she, Mjolnir?

494
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,744
I need you to promise me
you'll always protect her.

495
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,373
I love you too, buddy.

496
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:23,545
<i>And love that deep
has a way of becoming magical.</i>

497
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,342
<i>Thor set his sights toward a future</i>

498
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,553
<i>and all it might hold.</i>

499
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:37,892
<i>But the more he pondered a life with Jane,</i>

500
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,978
<i>the more he feared losing that life.</i>

501
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:42,814
<i>And although Jane didn't want to admit it,</i>

502
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,316
<i>she was scared of loss as well.</i>

503
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,072
<i>And so, they built walls between them.</i>

504
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,992
<i>Thor got busy saving humanity.</i>

505
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:55,785
Heimdall!

506
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,456
<i>And Jane got busy doing the same.</i>

507
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,750
<i>Real busy.</i>

508
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:04,753
<i>And eventually, the space
between them grew and grew</i>

509
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:06,921
<i>until it became too wide to bear.</i>

510
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,262
<i>Something had to give.</i>

511
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,016
I have to stay up all night
to go through this data. Okay?

512
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,285
And I have to stay up all night

513
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,478
- and clean all of this up.
- There's two plates!

514
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:22,761
It's two plates and two forks!

515
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:28,943
<i>And then, one night, it did give.</i>

516
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,155
<i>Jane wrote a note.</i>

517
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,408
<i>And Thor read that note.</i>

518
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,829
<i>And their legend suddenly became myth.</i>

519
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,291
<i>Or so they thought.</i>

520
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,879
You okay?

521
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,882
Yeah...
it's a little, uh, hot in...

522
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:53,009
Startin' to feel...

523
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,054
It's claustrophobic with the helmet.

524
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,351
How?

525
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,959
Uh...

526
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,730
Can we talk about this later?

527
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,273
Yeah, sure.

528
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,650
Great seeing you.

529
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,528
What?

530
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,161
<i>Kill all the gods.</i>

531
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:00,618
Hey. Is that the Necrosword?

532
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,079
That's cool. I've only ever
read about it in stories.

533
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:06,166
Then you know this is going to hurt.

534
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,917
Pain.

535
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,462
What is pain but a construct
invented by the weak?

536
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:11,880
Okay, that's very sharp!

537
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,182
Ready?

538
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,102
Don't touch my things.

539
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,881
Yeah, you better run, you coward.

540
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:16,444
The children. They're taking the children!

541
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,154
Mommy!

542
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,449
Mom!

543
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:47,684
Shadow monsters. Disgusting.

544
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:53,606
Flew around the world twice. Nothing.

545
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,526
- Cowards must have run away.
- We'll find them.

546
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,531
- Quite a reunion, huh?
- Eh, you're telling me.

547
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,533
What's it been? Like, three, four years?

548
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:05,994
Eight years, seven months, and six days.

549
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,370
I haven't forgotten

550
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:08,705
the last time I saw you,

551
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,628
or didn't see you, because you left.

552
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:12,417
It's kind of an oversimplification

553
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,626
to say that I left.

554
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,920
Ah, no, you left. You did.

555
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,922
You wrote me a beautiful
handwritten letter.

556
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:20,050
I should know, I was there.

557
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,333
- You weren't there...
- I was.

558
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:22,761
...actually, hence the note.

559
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,324
And if you weren't
there to see me leave,

560
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:28,099
then maybe it was you that left.

561
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,810
- Fair point. Hmm.
- Uh...

562
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:32,354
Not that it matters.

563
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:33,622
Like, who's keeping track, right?

564
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,106
No, yeah.

565
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,609
I suppose we both left
and both got left.

566
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:38,818
Now you're leaving again.

567
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:42,155
Miek, we need detailed accounts

568
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,323
from all the witnesses.

569
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:44,526
Darryl, get me all the names

570
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:45,974
of the children who have been lost.

571
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:47,762
Your Majesty, my daughter has been taken,

572
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:48,846
and I don't know where she is.

573
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,288
And she'll be found.

574
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,790
Guys, they're bleeding.

575
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:53,291
Get them to the infirmary. Now!

576
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,376
Darryl!

577
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,336
Majesty, should we start working

578
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:58,338
on a performance of this entire debacle?

579
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,006
The people need entertainment.

580
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:01,883
Particularly now, in times of crisis.

581
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,510
Particularly.

582
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:06,805
I did not hear a, "No."

583
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,473
Nor did I.

584
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,766
- Asgard. Night.
- Yes!

585
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,293
We open on some sleeping children.

586
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,440
So, that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

587
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:19,150
The old ex-girlfriend.

588
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:20,360
Jodie Foster.

589
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:21,569
Jane Foster.

590
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,904
The one that got away.

591
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,572
The one that got away.

592
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:25,740
That means escaped.

593
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:27,492
Yeah. Yeah... Yeah.

594
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,786
Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend

595
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,454
and your ex-hammer hangin' out,

596
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:32,956
and getting on so well.

597
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:38,420
What you up to, bro?

598
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:40,463
Come on.

599
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,298
Come to daddy.

600
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,301
Come on. Mjolnir.

601
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,681
Hey! There you are.

602
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:50,765
Hey.

603
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:51,993
Do you know
what I think we should do?

604
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,786
- I was just calling you.
- Start an army!

605
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,687
With what? Half our soldiers are dead!

606
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,355
Half our soldiers are always dead!

607
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:59,519
- Where are the children?
- Everyone, please go home.

608
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:00,751
I promise you we'll have news soon.

609
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,335
Someone needs to tell us what happened.

610
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,737
We shall find them.

611
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,133
- I just don't understand.
- You know what?

612
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,450
This is all our fault.

613
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:09,802
Stop it!

614
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:10,910
Asgard!

615
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,797
My friends, we must not quarrel.

616
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:26,217
In times like this, we need
to unite, come together.

617
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:28,803
I see what's happening here.

618
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,681
You're afraid. Hmm?

619
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:33,350
Scared.

620
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:35,685
Afraid.

621
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:36,978
Anxious.

622
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:39,874
If we are to find the children,

623
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,650
we must first look within ourselves.

624
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,903
I'm sorry. Miek, it's very hard

625
00:40:44,986 --> 00:40:46,279
to give a rousing speech

626
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:47,631
with the noise.

627
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,133
- What are you doing?
- She's taking minutes.

628
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,551
Oh, precious minutes we don't have.

629
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:52,619
You want the kids back?

630
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:55,372
I'll be back in a minute.

631
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:57,656
You can write that down, Miek.

632
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:01,670
No!

633
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,070
Storm breaker, what are you doing?

634
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,431
Is this about Mjolnir?

635
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,225
Everyone, out!

636
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:18,937
Didn't find them.

637
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,180
Oh, bae, your cape's on fire.

638
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,310
It's fine. It'll grow back.

639
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,774
I'm invoicing you for this.

640
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:23,858
Listen.

641
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:25,182
What do we know about this guy?

642
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:26,486
He travels through shadows.

643
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:27,987
And he creates monsters with them.

644
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:29,698
Absolutely freaky monsters.

645
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,825
He also wields the Necrosword.
How do I know that?

646
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:33,427
Because he almost speared me
in the face with it.

647
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,494
What's a Necrosword?

648
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:35,930
It's an ancient weapon that's been passed

649
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:37,497
through hands since the dawn of time.

650
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,791
It has the ability to slay gods,

651
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:41,418
but it slowly corrupts and kills

652
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:43,044
whoever wields it, which means...

653
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:44,587
Oh, so, it infected him.

654
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,172
It's infecting him. Yes. It must be.

655
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:48,967
So basically,
we're up against a cursed,

656
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,844
shadow-zombie kidnapper.

657
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:52,637
Awesome. When do we leave?

658
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:54,180
Thor.

659
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:55,640
Can you see me?

660
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:56,975
Uh, floating head alert.

661
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:58,977
It's Astrid. Heimdall's son.

662
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:00,770
Astrid, are you okay?

663
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:02,939
I no longer go by the name Astrid.

664
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:05,066
I'm now known as Axl.

665
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:07,444
He's a singer from a popular band
I heard on Earth.

666
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:08,778
- G N' R.
- Astrid,

667
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,864
your father gave you
a very tough Viking name

668
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:12,449
and I intend to honor his wishes.

669
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:13,700
- Axl.
- Astrid.

670
00:42:13,783 --> 00:42:14,993
- I said Axl.
- Astrid.

671
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:16,202
- Axl!
- It's asshole.

672
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:17,287
Now listen to him!

673
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,956
All right, fine, Axl. Where are you?

674
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:23,335
I'm not sure. I don't know
how to use my magic eyes yet.

675
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,937
Your father taught me
and I'm gonna teach you.

676
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:27,505
I need you to focus
and hold out your hand.

677
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,091
Okay, good. Now focus.

678
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:31,384
Close your eyes.

679
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,433
Thor!

680
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:41,686
Hey, how's it going, kids?

681
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:43,688
"How's it going"? Look where we are.

682
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:45,774
We're in a cage made of spikes.

683
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,068
Yes, right. Not good. Yeah.

684
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,319
Are you gonna do something?

685
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:50,987
Yes. Yes, I am, but just not right now.

686
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:53,156
I'm the vision ghost. Look.

687
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:56,242
- See?
- What will happen to us?

688
00:42:56,534 --> 00:42:57,827
Who can tell?

689
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,954
I mean, this is a very,
very bad situation.

690
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:02,540
You know, the good news
is you're Asgardians.

691
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:04,751
So, if you die, you'll end up in Valhalla.

692
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,086
Oh, my God. Go away.

693
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:07,962
Wait, wait. Listen.

694
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:10,882
Okay. It's all right, children.

695
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:12,384
Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

696
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,927
Listen, I've got a plan, okay?

697
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,890
I'm putting together
a really, really good team.

698
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,641
We've got, um, Uncle Korg,
uh, King Valkyrie,

699
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:21,893
um, my ex-girlfriend, Jane,

700
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,216
which is a whole other story
I won't bore you with, okay?

701
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:26,398
But it is a top-notch team,

702
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:28,441
and we're gonna have you home
before you know it.

703
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:29,734
Yeah.

704
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:38,201
I know where you are.

705
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:42,580
I'm gonna get you out of here.

706
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:43,915
I'm scared.

707
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:46,042
We all are.

708
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,420
Thor! Thor! Save us.

709
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,359
Get me out of here. You take care, okay?

710
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:55,218
Take care. I'll see you soon. All right?

711
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,511
Axl, get me out of here!

712
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,216
They're in the Shadow Realm.

713
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:00,306
How do you know?

714
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:03,018
The heavy atmosphere there
has a darkness like no other.

715
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,184
It's as if color fears to tread.
It's unmistakable.

716
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:07,605
Well then, if it's color we need,

717
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:09,566
let's bring the rainbow.

718
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:13,587
"Bring the rainbow"?
Is that a catchphrase or something?

719
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:15,196
She's only been a Thor for a minute.

720
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:16,716
I mean, saving lives, she's quite good at.

721
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,925
But the rest of it, she needs work.

722
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:19,010
How many catchphrases have there been?

723
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:20,035
A lot.

724
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,580
Yep. Jumped the gun.

725
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:24,998
Hang on, he moves through shadows

726
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,350
and he's going to the Shadow Realm,

727
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:27,414
it seems like that's where

728
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:28,519
he's going to be the most powerful.

729
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,603
You're right. We can't just go

730
00:44:29,627 --> 00:44:30,730
marching in there. It could be a trap.

731
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:31,856
We'd be endangering the children.

732
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,149
- Mm.
- We need reinforcements.

733
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:34,174
We must raise an army.

734
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:35,651
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

735
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:37,028
- I'm thinking it.
- What are we thinking?

736
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:38,487
- Thinking what?
- I'm thinking it too.

737
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:40,805
- Omnipotence City.
- Hmm!

738
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,599
What's Omnipotence City?

739
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:44,966
It's the home of the most
powerful gods in the universe.

740
00:44:45,101 --> 00:44:46,936
We could pull together
the greatest team ever.

741
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:49,272
We could recruit Ra, Hercules,

742
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:50,523
Tūmatauenga.

743
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,108
Quetzalcoatl, maybe.

744
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,361
And Zeus, the oldest
and wisest of them all.

745
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:56,529
- Did you say Zeus?
- Yeah, Zeus.

746
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,156
Like, the Zeus. Zeus-Zeus?

747
00:44:58,323 --> 00:44:59,717
I'm not sure if he has a second name.

748
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:01,010
Do you think my god will be there,

749
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:02,035
Ninny of the Nonny?

750
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:03,119
Oh, you never know, Korg.

751
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,263
But if they are,
we'll ask them to join our team.

752
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:05,288
Yes.

753
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,123
Storm breaker.

754
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,007
All right. Calm down. Relax.

755
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:10,436
No, no, no, mate, we are not traveling

756
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,003
in Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

757
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:13,088
Look what just happened.

758
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:14,732
We can't exactly go in your tiny, little,

759
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,556
flying portal horse, can we?
We won't all fit.

760
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:18,110
What are you talking about?
Warsong's awesome.

761
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:19,344
Stormbreaker's awesome too.

762
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:20,827
Storm breaker just needs a conduit.

763
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:22,407
Anything that can handle space travel.

764
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:23,682
I love it when she talks shop.

765
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:25,085
It has the power to get us there,

766
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:26,786
it just needs something
to focus that energy

767
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,770
so it's not so unpredictable.

768
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,897
You know, if we had a ship,
we could harness it

769
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,580
and use Storm breaker as a power source.

770
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,401
- Oh, like an engine.
- Like an engine.

771
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:35,735
You need a ship?

772
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:37,404
I've got a ship.

773
00:45:41,866 --> 00:45:43,186
Get rid of all those seats.

774
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:45,328
And you guys,
go tie those goats to the front.

775
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:46,746
We leave in 15 minutes.

776
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:48,748
Essentials only, everyone.

777
00:45:48,915 --> 00:45:50,792
That's essential. Mm-hmm.

778
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:52,186
Fifteen minutes to departure!

779
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,504
Well, you moved on quick,
didn't you?

780
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,132
You're some piece of work.

781
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:00,468
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

782
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,220
Just catching up with an old friend.

783
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:03,304
Yeah.

784
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:05,140
I've been meaning to apologize.

785
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,034
Sorta acting a little weird before.

786
00:46:07,058 --> 00:46:08,698
I just haven't really been myself lately.

787
00:46:08,768 --> 00:46:10,228
You know, kind of...

788
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:11,604
Trying to figure out who I am,

789
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:13,356
and, uh, just felt a little bit lost.

790
00:46:13,523 --> 00:46:16,109
And then, all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me

791
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:17,652
and it was kind of...

792
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,195
It's a lot for me, too.

793
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:22,532
So, how did you guys get together?
How did this happen?

794
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:26,202
I swear I heard Mjolnir call to me.

795
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:27,871
Ah! Did it?

796
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:29,706
And so I came here to investigate,

797
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:32,584
and its pieces started glowing
and swirling,

798
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:33,835
- and then...
- Crazy.

799
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,420
- ...Thor.
- Ah.

800
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:36,755
Well, you know what,

801
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:39,007
it looks good on you, it works, so...

802
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:43,011
Whew.

803
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:44,095
Just checking.

804
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:49,201
See you later.

805
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:51,436
Five minutes to departure!

806
00:46:55,523 --> 00:46:56,691
What?

807
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,526
We were just talking.

808
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:11,998
<i>Mommy, don't leave me.</i>

809
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:14,000
Don't be afraid.

810
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:17,087
<i>Even when I'm gone, honey...</i>

811
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,674
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

812
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,387
<i>And whatever happens...</i>

813
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:28,973
<i>never stop fighting.</i>

814
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:31,351
<i>Never stop fighting.</i>

815
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:47,200
Hey. You all right?

816
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,077
- Great.
- Mm.

817
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:51,496
The sink would say otherwise.

818
00:47:53,331 --> 00:47:54,916
You think I really should be coming?

819
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,501
I'm not getting any better.

820
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,378
You're a Thor. Of course, you should come.

821
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:00,235
Besides, what else are you gonna do?

822
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:01,589
You're a Viking now.

823
00:48:01,756 --> 00:48:03,883
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle,

824
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,136
and it needs to be devastatingly painful.

825
00:48:06,302 --> 00:48:07,862
Otherwise, you don't get into Valhalla.

826
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:09,431
That's my plan.

827
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:11,766
What about, you know, kinging and stuff?

828
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:14,519
I love being king. I love my people,

829
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,146
but it's all meetings and raven-mail,

830
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:17,909
and meetings
that could've been raven-mail.

831
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:19,190
I miss fighting.

832
00:48:19,357 --> 00:48:20,442
I miss my sisters.

833
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:22,528
Which is why you need to come,
'cause I need one.

834
00:48:23,653 --> 00:48:24,654
Okay, we should go.

835
00:48:24,904 --> 00:48:26,104
You packed?

836
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:27,615
Are you packed?

837
00:48:29,492 --> 00:48:30,493
Yes!

838
00:48:32,912 --> 00:48:33,955
A hand grenade?

839
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:35,919
No. It's a portable speaker.

840
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,465
Let's go.

841
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:47,927
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps?

842
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:49,387
I got you.

843
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:53,808
My fellow Asgardians...

844
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:56,102
Wish us well, for we shall travel

845
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,313
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

846
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:01,149
We will return with children.

847
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,277
Many children.

848
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,130
And then we shall feast!

849
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:07,914
Not on the children.

850
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:09,699
We do not do that anymore.

851
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:12,369
Those were dark times. Shameful times.

852
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,454
Okay, we should go.

853
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,752
So, you still rollerblading?

854
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,671
No. No. You?

855
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:06,006
Oh, yeah. Every weekend.

856
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:08,008
Once you blade, you never fade.
Right, Korg?

857
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:09,151
Skate mates for life!

858
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:10,635
Hey, can I run something by you?

859
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:12,220
- Yeah.
- So, I was thinking,

860
00:50:12,303 --> 00:50:13,680
when we get to the bad guy,

861
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:15,849
what about if I had, like,
a cool catchphrase?

862
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:18,476
Like, "Eat this hammer!" Bang!

863
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,728
Or, like,

864
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:21,813
"Check out my hammer." Boom!

865
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:23,565
Like, what about, um...

866
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,608
No... I'm work shopping it.

867
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:28,111
No, they are all really good. Mine is, uh,

868
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:30,030
"This ends here and now."

869
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:31,364
Oh, that's such a good one.

870
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:32,842
Took me a long time to perfect it.

871
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,260
You'll get there.
You just need to practice.

872
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:35,702
Just my first bad guy.

873
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,162
You never forget your first.

874
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,541
Yeah.

875
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,460
So, you got a girlfriend?

876
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,670
Oh... No, no.

877
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:47,630
Too busy, don't have time, you know?

878
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:50,091
Just the work and everything.

879
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:52,260
Cool. Gonna check this place out.

880
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:56,723
Oh, wow.

881
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:57,807
So cool.

882
00:50:57,974 --> 00:50:58,975
- Who's so cool?
- Huh?

883
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:00,602
The buildings are cool.

884
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:02,520
- What's happening there?
- Where?

885
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:05,148
Am I, uh, sensing feelings?

886
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:06,232
Feelings?

887
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:07,525
- What, for Jane?
- Mm-hmm.

888
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:09,069
No, don't be ridiculous. Feelings.

889
00:51:09,235 --> 00:51:10,987
The last time we had feelings were

890
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:12,871
long time ago.
Long, long gone. I think you...

891
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:14,366
- Maybe you have feelings.
- Right.

892
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:16,159
Oh... Mate, relax.

893
00:51:16,242 --> 00:51:17,553
- I don't know.
- We're on the same team.

894
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:19,954
Know exactly what team we're on, okay?

895
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:21,498
Team Jane.

896
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,376
Um...

897
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:28,254
<i>Thing about Thor is that
he always bounces back.</i>

898
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:30,483
- Yeah.
- Like when Hela stole his hammer,

899
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:31,776
he went and built an axe which was forged

900
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,259
in the heart of a dying star.

901
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:39,057
And the same axe was used
to cut off Thanos' head.

902
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:42,185
That's a good one.

903
00:51:45,563 --> 00:51:47,816
What a neat story!

904
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:52,946
Ah, with all this talk
about chopping off heads,

905
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:54,447
I wanna have a go.

906
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:56,700
What's this?

907
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:57,784
Oh.

908
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:01,538
Aw!

909
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:04,165
This is Octy. Hello, Octy.

910
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:06,376
How are you?

911
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:08,420
You know what Octy loves?

912
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:10,880
Having his head ripped off!

913
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:17,470
What? You liked it a second ago.

914
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,324
All right, all right, all right.

915
00:52:20,348 --> 00:52:21,349
Octy's gone.

916
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:27,105
Come on.

917
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:28,356
I'm scared.

918
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,191
Aw, look at you.

919
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:34,362
I knew a little girl just like you.

920
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:38,533
And she was brave, and she was smart...

921
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:43,830
and funny and she liked to draw.

922
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:48,293
Let me ask you a question

923
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:51,087
about gods.

924
00:52:51,629 --> 00:52:53,673
They're meant to protect you, right?

925
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:55,675
Well, where are they?

926
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:58,553
- Thor is on his way.
- Yeah!

927
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,389
Yes. I'm counting on that.

928
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:04,184
That's why you're here.

929
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:08,664
It's invitation only,

930
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,583
so we're gonna have to keep
a low profile and blend in.

931
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:13,193
Luckily, disguises are my specialty.

932
00:53:13,943 --> 00:53:14,986
Greek philosopher?

933
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:16,613
Got us these.

934
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,198
What are those?

935
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,366
Actual disguises.

936
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:22,243
They're the cloaks of the emotion gods.

937
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:26,081
Every color signifies a different emotion.

938
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:27,957
Where are the emotion gods?

939
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,584
Mm. Don't ask.

940
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:34,130
Holy shit.

941
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,141
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

942
00:53:45,308 --> 00:53:47,352
This is where
the most powerful creator gods

943
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:48,520
in the universe hang out.

944
00:53:51,439 --> 00:53:53,942
There's the god of magic,

945
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:55,276
the god of dreams,

946
00:53:55,443 --> 00:53:56,444
the god of carpentry.

947
00:53:56,528 --> 00:53:57,904
Look at that one.

948
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,614
Oh, yes. That's Bao, god of dumplings.

949
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:01,908
- Psst. Hey, Bao!
- Bao.

950
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:03,076
Look up there, guys!

951
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:05,036
That's the Kronan god, Ninny of the Nonny.

952
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,330
Hey, Ninny Nonny!

953
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:20,385
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

954
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:23,138
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

955
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,807
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

956
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,101
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

957
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:32,731
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

958
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:35,233
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

959
00:54:35,316 --> 00:54:37,485
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

960
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:39,654
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

961
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,740
Zeus! Zeus!

962
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:50,957
Yes.

963
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:53,585
I am Zeus!

964
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:55,962
<i>Yassas!</i>

965
00:54:58,131 --> 00:54:59,341
Oh, there he is!

966
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:01,426
The man, the myth, the legend.

967
00:55:01,509 --> 00:55:02,862
Oh, I don't know if you know this,

968
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:05,055
but I base a lot of what I do on this guy.

969
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:06,991
He's the god of lightning,
I'm the god of thunder.

970
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:09,142
- Huge source of inspiration.
- That's really good.

971
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:11,728
You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

972
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:13,730
- Ah.
- Um, how do we get up there?

973
00:55:13,813 --> 00:55:15,315
Do we just, like, fly?

974
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:16,959
No, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of an entrance.

975
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:18,610
He's famous for his entrances.

976
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:20,570
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt!

977
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:23,281
Yes!

978
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,284
Zeus!

979
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:37,712
Yes! Thunderbolt!

980
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,471
Order.

981
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:48,139
Order!

982
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:52,435
Silence! Silence!

983
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,525
I hereby open

984
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:02,404
this holy council of the god.

985
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:05,907
Where we have many, many serious matter

986
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,367
to be talk about.

987
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:08,910
Such as,

988
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:11,996
where are we going to hold
this year's orgy?

989
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,124
Is this guy for real?

990
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:15,375
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

991
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,002
Yeah, I'm sure he has a point, okay?

992
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:18,712
Sorry.

993
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:20,189
So now we're going to announce the winner

994
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:23,091
of the, "Most human souls"

995
00:56:23,174 --> 00:56:25,301
"sacrificed in the name of a god."

996
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:27,053
Okay, maybe he's not that great.

997
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:28,471
Oh, no, not good.

998
00:56:28,638 --> 00:56:30,491
No, I don't think it's gonna
get any better than this.

999
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:31,933
Look, these gods aren't gonna help.

1000
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,101
But that thunderbolt,

1001
00:56:33,184 --> 00:56:34,620
I think that might be of use.

1002
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:36,646
Jane, you go right. Thor, you go left.

1003
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,873
We bum-rush him,

1004
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:39,190
take the bolt, ding-dong.

1005
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:40,354
All right, let's go get it!

1006
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,568
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

1007
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:43,403
There's no ding-donging or bum-rushing.

1008
00:56:43,486 --> 00:56:44,946
Especially not Zeus' bum.

1009
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:46,632
When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

1010
00:56:46,656 --> 00:56:47,699
The time is right now.

1011
00:56:47,782 --> 00:56:48,783
Time is not right now.

1012
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:50,160
Who is talking?

1013
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:51,411
Who is talking?

1014
00:56:51,494 --> 00:56:52,912
- These guys.
- Korg, shut up.

1015
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:55,415
Do you have something to say to the group?

1016
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:56,791
Sorry.

1017
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:59,669
I'm bashing heads in 60 seconds,
so speak fast.

1018
00:56:59,836 --> 00:57:01,296
Literally, heads will roll.

1019
00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:03,381
Who are you two?

1020
00:57:04,257 --> 00:57:05,675
Hello.

1021
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,177
Uh, let me be the first to say

1022
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,487
it is an honor and a privilege to be...

1023
00:57:08,511 --> 00:57:09,679
No, I can't hear you.

1024
00:57:09,846 --> 00:57:11,181
Why don't you take the stage?

1025
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:13,224
The stage down there?

1026
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:15,268
Well, yes. You see the area

1027
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:17,645
that looks very much like a stage?

1028
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,190
Got ya.

1029
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,782
Coming through.

1030
00:57:29,574 --> 00:57:30,825
Oops. Sorry.

1031
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:31,993
Good luck, bro.

1032
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,086
Mighty Zeus!

1033
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:42,796
Wow!

1034
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,964
Gods of the universe,

1035
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,384
I come here to ask for your help,

1036
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:48,718
to raise an army.

1037
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,762
There's a maniac called the God Butcher

1038
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:52,013
who seeks to end us all.

1039
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,682
His destruction is everywhere.

1040
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:55,850
Entire planets, realms

1041
00:57:56,017 --> 00:57:57,560
have been left completely unprotected.

1042
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:59,771
He's left nothing but chaos in his wake.

1043
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:01,731
But I know where he is,

1044
00:58:01,898 --> 00:58:03,149
and with your help,

1045
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:06,027
we can crush him
before he kills anyone else.

1046
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:07,862
That guy,

1047
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:10,907
he killed a couple of low-level god.

1048
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,242
Eh. Boo-hoo.

1049
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:13,743
If that's all,

1050
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:15,070
pretty boy...

1051
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,955
...you go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

1052
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:18,915
Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you not hear

1053
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:20,125
any of what I just said?

1054
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,252
He's... He's murdering en masse.

1055
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,504
I tell you one time,

1056
00:58:24,587 --> 00:58:25,672
now, you shut up.

1057
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:26,840
You be quiet.

1058
00:58:26,923 --> 00:58:29,634
Because you are this close to
being uninvited to the orgy.

1059
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:32,095
Zeus, we must do something.

1060
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,055
You cannot come to the orgy!

1061
00:58:34,222 --> 00:58:36,141
- You have to listen to us!
- That's it!

1062
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:37,684
Shackle!

1063
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:41,914
Your Highness,
whenever you're ready, you just tell me.

1064
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:43,189
- We go on my signal.
- Mm-hmm.

1065
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:44,274
What is the signal?

1066
00:58:44,357 --> 00:58:45,817
- It'll be, "Go."
- Hmm.

1067
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:50,905
Let's see who you are.

1068
00:58:51,072 --> 00:58:52,657
I take off your disguise.

1069
00:58:52,782 --> 00:58:53,783
And flick!

1070
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,626
You flicked too hard, damn it!

1071
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,423
Should we help him?

1072
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,924
I mean, eventually.

1073
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:11,092
Grape?

1074
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:12,969
Mm, looks like a shy courgette.

1075
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,888
And what about the others?

1076
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,198
We take off their disguise too.

1077
00:59:16,222 --> 00:59:17,557
Oh, no. No. Don't flick us.

1078
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,725
It's cool.

1079
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:20,310
Uh... Disguise gone!

1080
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:21,394
Disguise off. Cool?

1081
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:22,771
Asgardians.

1082
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:25,732
I thought we'd seen the last
of you when Odin died.

1083
00:59:27,233 --> 00:59:29,527
You are Thor,

1084
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,529
the God of Thunder.

1085
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:35,492
But is not thunder
just the sound of lightning?

1086
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:38,995
Good one, Dad.

1087
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:40,514
Zeus, this is bigger than us.

1088
00:59:40,538 --> 00:59:42,540
He's taken Asgardian children.

1089
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:45,960
Who do you think we are? The god police?

1090
00:59:46,836 --> 00:59:49,798
Every god watches over their own peoples.

1091
00:59:50,298 --> 00:59:52,842
Nothing more, nothing less.

1092
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:54,678
Asgardian problems

1093
00:59:55,595 --> 00:59:58,306
are Asgardian problems. Hmm?

1094
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,392
How the mighty have fallen.

1095
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:02,727
My hero, Zeus,

1096
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:03,895
afraid.

1097
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:18,034
Couple of thing.

1098
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:21,121
One, yes, I am scared.

1099
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:23,998
Gorr has the Necrosword,

1100
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:26,292
which means he could kill us.

1101
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:28,211
Not good. Two,

1102
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:30,296
I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

1103
01:00:30,463 --> 01:00:31,631
I understand.

1104
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:34,009
But all you do is cause a panic.

1105
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:36,136
Panic is not good.

1106
01:00:36,302 --> 01:00:37,804
We are safe here.

1107
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,348
You, my friend, you are safe here.

1108
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,559
So, chill, baby cake.

1109
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,270
Have some wine, have some grape.

1110
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:46,896
Anything goes here

1111
01:00:47,063 --> 01:00:49,315
in Omnipotence City. Hmm.

1112
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:52,527
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

1113
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:55,030
I flicked too hard.
I put your clothes back on.

1114
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:58,175
Now I put your clothes back on!

1115
01:00:58,199 --> 01:00:59,200
Flick, flick.

1116
01:00:59,367 --> 01:01:00,744
For this is the Golden Temple

1117
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:02,120
of the god.

1118
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,748
It's not a rudie-nudie festival.

1119
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,308
If you're not gonna help us,

1120
01:01:06,332 --> 01:01:07,834
then at least let us use your weapon.

1121
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:09,461
We need your lightning bolt.

1122
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:12,339
My lightning bolt is called Thunderbolt.

1123
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:15,717
So, I think, to use somebody's
secret weapon like this,

1124
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:18,428
that you should at least get
the name right when you ask.

1125
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,764
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

1126
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,766
Thunderbolt!

1127
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:50,543
No!

1128
01:01:54,172 --> 01:01:55,882
Do not worry.

1129
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:58,259
The God Butcher,

1130
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:00,845
he will not reach Eternity.

1131
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:02,222
Eternity?

1132
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:04,099
What does he mean, reach Eternity?

1133
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:09,312
Oh, shit.

1134
01:02:11,856 --> 01:02:14,776
Eternity is a very powerful being

1135
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:16,319
at the center of the universe.

1136
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:18,154
It will grant the desire

1137
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:20,073
of the first person who reaches it.

1138
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,075
So, it's like a wishing well?

1139
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:26,347
What do you think a guy
called the God Butcher

1140
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:27,414
would wish for?

1141
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:28,766
If he seeks the Altar of Eternity,

1142
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,417
that means he could wipe us out at once.

1143
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:32,168
Zeus, we must act now.

1144
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:34,087
He's not going to make it.

1145
01:02:34,254 --> 01:02:35,547
He doesn't have the key.

1146
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:37,882
Is this the purpose of the gods?

1147
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:40,719
To hide away in a golden
palace like cowards?

1148
01:02:40,885 --> 01:02:42,846
Maybe we have lost our way.

1149
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:44,931
You know what? We'll stop him ourselves.

1150
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:47,267
I am afraid I cannot allow that.

1151
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:49,978
This is a secret place

1152
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:51,938
known only to the gods.

1153
01:02:52,313 --> 01:02:54,024
You know where we are.

1154
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:57,819
The God Butcher could use you to find us.

1155
01:02:58,570 --> 01:02:59,904
This is no good.

1156
01:03:01,072 --> 01:03:02,073
So now,

1157
01:03:03,324 --> 01:03:04,826
you must stay.

1158
01:03:06,202 --> 01:03:07,203
Guards!

1159
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:10,874
Hey.

1160
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:12,042
Can we do my plan now?

1161
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:13,960
Yes. Rush his bum.

1162
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:15,128
Hell, yeah!

1163
01:03:17,922 --> 01:03:19,549
Oh, you didn't say, "Go."

1164
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,513
Coming, guys!

1165
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:36,775
Thor, catch!

1166
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:40,945
Korg!

1167
01:04:00,423 --> 01:04:01,549
Val, duck!

1168
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:08,014
Korg!

1169
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:11,226
Thor.

1170
01:04:12,268 --> 01:04:14,813
Oh, no. No. Korg!

1171
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,900
Thor, I'm... I'm perishing!

1172
01:04:23,738 --> 01:04:24,864
Zeus!

1173
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,410
You're next, Odinson!

1174
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:38,420
That's the sound of lightning.

1175
01:04:45,635 --> 01:04:46,803
No!

1176
01:04:47,345 --> 01:04:48,346
Korgi.

1177
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:49,556
Korgi!

1178
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:50,724
Thor.

1179
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,308
- Korgi?
- I'm down here.

1180
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:53,518
Where? Where are you?

1181
01:04:53,601 --> 01:04:54,870
I'm gonna get you out. It's okay.

1182
01:04:54,894 --> 01:04:56,187
- Korg. Korgi!
- Here I am!

1183
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,272
I didn't die!

1184
01:04:57,355 --> 01:04:59,482
Oh, my God. Yes! You're alive!

1185
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:01,293
Turns out the only part
of a Kronan that's alive

1186
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:02,318
is his mouth.

1187
01:05:02,652 --> 01:05:04,696
Korgi, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

1188
01:05:04,779 --> 01:05:05,780
I'll do my best.

1189
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:07,198
Guard him with your life.

1190
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:09,284
I will. Ready to go for a ride?

1191
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:14,914
Now you've got my six.

1192
01:05:15,498 --> 01:05:16,624
Eight o'clock, Val.

1193
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,626
7:48.

1194
01:05:20,045 --> 01:05:22,047
I can do this, damn it.

1195
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,482
No, that's not it.
No, that's not it.

1196
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:24,591
Nope.

1197
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:27,260
Come on, Korg, purse those lips.

1198
01:05:40,982 --> 01:05:41,983
I did it!

1199
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:22,065
And then the goat boat came in,
rescued us,

1200
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:23,566
and we flew out the window.

1201
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,835
The end.

1202
01:06:24,859 --> 01:06:26,403
Another classic Thor adventure.

1203
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:28,613
I can't believe you killed Zeus.

1204
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,658
Well, you know what they say,
never meet your heroes.

1205
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,411
But what's important

1206
01:06:34,494 --> 01:06:36,014
is we are on our way to you right now.

1207
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:37,789
How are you guys doing? Are you okay?

1208
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:39,541
We're all right. A little scared.

1209
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,793
Well, listen, I know
what it's like to be scared.

1210
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,545
And I'll tell you, when I was your age,

1211
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:45,481
I don't think I would have
been as brave as you.

1212
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:46,506
Really?

1213
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:47,674
In fact, might just be

1214
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:49,509
the bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.

1215
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:50,945
All of you.

1216
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:52,887
So I need you to
keep being brave, all right?

1217
01:06:53,054 --> 01:06:55,223
And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

1218
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,766
Team Kids in a Cage.

1219
01:06:58,435 --> 01:06:59,477
Can you do that?

1220
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:02,230
Yeah. I think we can do that.

1221
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:03,982
I know you can.

1222
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:06,526
<i>That's the way I gotta have it</i>

1223
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:08,528
Right?

1224
01:07:08,945 --> 01:07:10,113
- Thor?
- Yeah.

1225
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:11,948
I'm glad I met my hero.

1226
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:13,783
Oh, thanks, buddy.

1227
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:15,910
<i>I bet you want the goodies</i>

1228
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:19,372
How are the children?

1229
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:20,599
As you can imagine,
they're a little bit scared

1230
01:07:20,623 --> 01:07:21,624
because they're kids,

1231
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,102
but I told them that
everything is going to plan.

1232
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:25,086
- Oh, so you lied to them?
- We still have a plan?

1233
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,439
- Yes, there's a plan.
- There's no plan.

1234
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:28,590
- There is a plan.
- No. There's no plan.

1235
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:30,800
We failed to raise a god army,

1236
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:31,968
Korg is dead.

1237
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:33,362
- He's not dead.
- I'm not dead.

1238
01:07:33,386 --> 01:07:34,846
Well, he's a head. And you,

1239
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:36,389
you got properly humiliated.

1240
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:38,850
No, I got properly naked,
which I am okay with.

1241
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:40,602
- Jane?
- I was okay with it.

1242
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:41,895
- Korg?
- I loved it.

1243
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:43,942
The point is, we are going
into the Shadow Realm

1244
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:45,315
weaker than we were before.

1245
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:46,775
I mean, we're gonna die.

1246
01:07:46,858 --> 01:07:48,401
- No one's gonna die, okay?
- Really?

1247
01:07:48,568 --> 01:07:50,820
Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

1248
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:52,906
- We killed Zeus!
- You killed Zeus.

1249
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:54,550
I mean, that may
or may not be catastrophic

1250
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:55,992
for the whole universe,

1251
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:58,119
and, sure, the entire
god kingdom is probably going

1252
01:07:58,203 --> 01:07:59,722
to hunt us down for the rest of our days,

1253
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:02,248
but listen,
you stole this beautiful weapon.

1254
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:04,292
All right? This is the army right here.

1255
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:05,919
It's sleek, it's slender,

1256
01:08:06,002 --> 01:08:07,462
it's powerful, it's beautiful...

1257
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:11,383
Ah, for you. I love it for you, Valkyrie.

1258
01:08:11,549 --> 01:08:13,134
I mean, it's not really what I'm into

1259
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,095
'cause I've got my weapon out there.

1260
01:08:15,261 --> 01:08:16,888
Can I borrow that for a second?

1261
01:08:19,891 --> 01:08:22,185
Ah, there you are, old friend.

1262
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:24,938
That was quite an entrance back there.

1263
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:32,028
Listen, uh,

1264
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:33,446
are we good?

1265
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:34,781
Yeah?

1266
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:35,925
I mean, I know it's a little weird

1267
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:37,325
having my ex-weapon around,

1268
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:39,994
but come on, Mjolnir, in the past.

1269
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:41,746
It's you and me now, buddy.

1270
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:43,331
You know what?

1271
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:45,834
I think it's time for your first beer.
What do you say?

1272
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:53,008
Delicious.

1273
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:55,385
Hmm. I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

1274
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:04,436
Hey.

1275
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:05,854
Oh, hey.

1276
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:10,942
It's quite the view, huh?

1277
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,110
Yeah. Beautiful.

1278
01:09:12,193 --> 01:09:14,320
I just want to say
that was very, very impressive

1279
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:15,864
what you did back there.

1280
01:09:16,573 --> 01:09:18,408
You and Mjolnir, you know.

1281
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:22,037
Yeah.

1282
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:26,458
- Space dolphins.
- What?

1283
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:28,793
You should see
some space dolphins...

1284
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:30,503
What?

1285
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:32,255
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

1286
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:34,591
Beautiful. Wow.

1287
01:09:34,674 --> 01:09:36,134
So beautiful. So rare.

1288
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:37,344
Very loyal creatures.

1289
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,263
They mate for life, in packs of six.

1290
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,182
Just love.

1291
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:43,784
<i>With a hey ninny-nonny</i>

1292
01:09:43,808 --> 01:09:45,310
<i>And a fair finny-fonny</i>

1293
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:48,730
<i>Ooh, brother man, you look so hot</i>

1294
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:51,733
<i>I wanna get in your rocks</i>

1295
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:55,278
<i>When we get together
We're gonna get it on</i>

1296
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:59,908
<i>And we're all gonna make some babies, uh</i>

1297
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:02,160
That is the song that my dad sang

1298
01:10:02,243 --> 01:10:03,870
to my other dad when they were courting.

1299
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:05,497
When two Kronans wanna make a baby,

1300
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,020
they get together inside a mountain,

1301
01:10:07,123 --> 01:10:08,875
and they go down to a little lava pool,

1302
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:10,585
and they hold hands over the hot lava,

1303
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:13,004
and then, after a month,
they pull their hands apart

1304
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:14,231
and they find they've created

1305
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:16,174
a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1306
01:10:16,257 --> 01:10:18,802
Mm, fascinating. And hot.

1307
01:10:18,885 --> 01:10:20,154
Did you ever have a special someone?

1308
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:23,056
I've had
so many special someones.

1309
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:25,433
But I don't know...

1310
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:27,787
I don't know if I want that again.

1311
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,372
Is that because you lost
your girlfriend in battle

1312
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:30,522
and never forgave yourself?

1313
01:10:30,605 --> 01:10:31,731
And now, you're just trying

1314
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,334
to find answers in the bottom of a bottle,

1315
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:34,859
or some meaningless dalliance,

1316
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:36,303
which only serves to numb the pain

1317
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:37,445
instead of bringing you

1318
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:38,988
real happiness or satisfaction?

1319
01:10:39,155 --> 01:10:42,450
- Yeah. Something like that.
- Hmm.

1320
01:10:44,285 --> 01:10:47,163
Beautiful. Beautiful things.

1321
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,460
Jane.

1322
01:10:52,919 --> 01:10:53,920
Thor.

1323
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:55,338
I wanna feel shitty about you.

1324
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:56,506
What?

1325
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:02,721
I wanna feel shitty about something

1326
01:11:02,804 --> 01:11:04,222
and I think that's you.

1327
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:05,491
Not really getting any better.

1328
01:11:05,515 --> 01:11:07,100
It's not, is it? Damn it.

1329
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,643
I wanna...

1330
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:11,396
My friend, he told me that
it's better to feel shitty

1331
01:11:12,647 --> 01:11:14,625
from losing love than it is
to never experience love

1332
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,210
and to feel nothing at all, to feel empty,

1333
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:17,360
and I think he was right,

1334
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:20,697
which is how I've been feeling
for a long time.

1335
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:23,158
I've pushed people away,
kept them at a distance

1336
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:24,617
because of the fear of that loss,

1337
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:25,886
but I don't wanna do that anymore.

1338
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:26,971
I don't wanna live like that.

1339
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:28,764
Better to close off your heart
than feel the pain.

1340
01:11:28,788 --> 01:11:30,957
That's what I did, yes.
I closed off my heart

1341
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,917
and... and I meditated. Did you meditate?

1342
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:34,252
No. It's so boring.

1343
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:36,546
It actually made me more angry.

1344
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:39,674
But I'm tired of giving myself
over to the idea of fate

1345
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,052
and trying to figure out what
the universe wants from me.

1346
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:43,279
I wanna live in the moment,

1347
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:44,739
I wanna live like there's no tomorrow,

1348
01:11:44,763 --> 01:11:46,073
throw caution to the wind. I want...

1349
01:11:46,097 --> 01:11:48,058
- I wanna be with you, Jane.
- Ah.

1350
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:50,185
What do you say?

1351
01:11:50,685 --> 01:11:52,354
I have cancer.

1352
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:55,774
I'm sorry, what?

1353
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:57,400
I'm sick.

1354
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:59,194
- Wait. What's happening?
- Bye.

1355
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:01,630
- Uh...
- No, no, no. Jane, Jane, Jane.

1356
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:02,923
- Wait, wait, wait. Jane.
- What did I say?

1357
01:12:02,947 --> 01:12:04,949
I didn't mean that. Just kidding.

1358
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,034
I...

1359
01:12:06,576 --> 01:12:08,203
don't have cancer.

1360
01:12:08,286 --> 01:12:09,704
Let's go smash something.

1361
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:11,498
Jane, I'm so sorry.

1362
01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:13,625
Don't be sorry for me.

1363
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,711
When did you find out?

1364
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:18,838
Um...

1365
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:20,715
Like six months ago.

1366
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:22,967
I was just feeling tired, and then

1367
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,678
they told me I have Stage Four.

1368
01:12:24,844 --> 01:12:26,554
Get my affairs in order.

1369
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:29,724
And then I heard Mjolnir calling me,

1370
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,977
so I thought maybe,
if science isn't working,

1371
01:12:33,895 --> 01:12:37,273
maybe Viking space magic.

1372
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:38,858
That's why you came to New Asgard.

1373
01:12:39,025 --> 01:12:41,861
Yeah, I thought the hammer
maybe could cure me,

1374
01:12:42,028 --> 01:12:44,948
and I think it's getting better.

1375
01:12:45,615 --> 01:12:47,075
Maybe not.

1376
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:50,328
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

1377
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:52,747
We don't know what tomorrow holds.

1378
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:53,915
And Mjolnir...

1379
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:55,542
Mjolnir chose you.

1380
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:58,336
And it chose you because you're worthy.

1381
01:12:58,503 --> 01:12:59,754
And that's something.

1382
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:01,047
When I first met you,

1383
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:02,716
I was unworthy.

1384
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:04,342
I was unable to pick up that hammer.

1385
01:13:05,218 --> 01:13:06,386
But you taught me

1386
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:09,514
there is no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

1387
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:12,350
You made me worthy.

1388
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,979
So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

1389
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:19,149
Okay.

1390
01:13:19,315 --> 01:13:21,067
Now what do you wanna do?

1391
01:13:22,193 --> 01:13:24,863
I wanna get those children
back to their families.

1392
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,281
I wanna finish that mission.

1393
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,117
- Spoken like a true Thor.
- Hmm.

1394
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:32,037
How do you feel now?

1395
01:13:33,246 --> 01:13:34,372
So scared.

1396
01:13:35,665 --> 01:13:36,666
How are you feeling?

1397
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:38,001
Shitty.

1398
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:39,085
How shitty?

1399
01:13:39,252 --> 01:13:40,879
- Really shitty.
- Well, then...

1400
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:54,055
I wonder what those two
are talking about out there.

1401
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:57,228
- Yeah, they're not talking.
- Oh!

1402
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,160
Do you think those two
will ever hold hands

1403
01:14:00,231 --> 01:14:02,984
over a hot lava pool and make a Thor baby?

1404
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,946
It's unlikely, sadly.

1405
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,740
Mm, that's too bad.

1406
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:10,263
I think Thor would make a great dad.

1407
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:14,871
Hey. We're here.

1408
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:25,423
Where did all the color go?

1409
01:14:58,873 --> 01:15:00,125
They're not here.

1410
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,673
Where are they?

1411
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,652
What the hell is this place?

1412
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:58,016
Bifrost is the key?

1413
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,651
It's a trap!

1414
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:27,313
You wanna tell me
why you just threw

1415
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:28,505
Storm breaker out the window?

1416
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:30,799
He needs it to open the Gates of Eternity.

1417
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:03,724
We really have to stop meeting like this.

1418
01:17:03,748 --> 01:17:04,791
Call the axe.

1419
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:06,602
I'll call the axe
when you call the dentist.

1420
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:09,254
Call the axe.

1421
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,506
Tell me where the children are
or I'm gonna kill you.

1422
01:17:18,596 --> 01:17:20,015
Call the axe.

1423
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:29,065
Some god you are.

1424
01:17:29,941 --> 01:17:33,319
You know nothing of being a god.

1425
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:40,368
You went to the gods for help,
and they did nothing.

1426
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:43,204
We're alike in that sense.

1427
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,081
He's nothing like you.

1428
01:17:45,248 --> 01:17:46,750
What was that?

1429
01:17:49,919 --> 01:17:51,713
I said he's nothing like you.

1430
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,256
That's right.

1431
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:57,886
I'm not a hypocrite.
I'm truly creating peace.

1432
01:17:57,969 --> 01:17:59,804
Peace? You're murdering innocent gods.

1433
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:00,930
Innocent?

1434
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:03,058
Are you a Valkyrie?

1435
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,184
Yes.

1436
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:06,936
How exciting!

1437
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:11,024
Oh, the gods failed you, too,

1438
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:15,070
when your sisterhood was led to slaughter.

1439
01:18:15,236 --> 01:18:16,516
Don't you dare speak...

1440
01:18:17,113 --> 01:18:19,157
Did you pray to the gods

1441
01:18:19,324 --> 01:18:23,536
when the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

1442
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:27,582
Did you beg them for help

1443
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:30,293
as your family was massacred?

1444
01:18:33,254 --> 01:18:34,255
Good chat.

1445
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:39,177
This one.

1446
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:41,429
You're interesting.

1447
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:44,099
You're different.

1448
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:46,017
Yes.

1449
01:18:48,853 --> 01:18:50,689
Aw.

1450
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:55,610
You're dying.

1451
01:18:57,445 --> 01:18:58,655
I'm sorry.

1452
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:01,616
We're on the same path.

1453
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:07,288
Just as the sword empowered me,

1454
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:10,083
the hammer empowered you.

1455
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:13,753
But it did nothing to change your fate.

1456
01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:17,882
The gods will use you,

1457
01:19:18,758 --> 01:19:21,469
but they will not help you.

1458
01:19:21,928 --> 01:19:27,058
There is no eternal reward for us.

1459
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,191
She'll be gone soon.

1460
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:38,695
And you know who won't help her?

1461
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:40,572
I'll give you one guess.

1462
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:53,209
I know your pain.

1463
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:55,378
Love is pain.

1464
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:02,427
I had a daughter once.

1465
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:05,221
I put my faith in a higher power

1466
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:08,099
hoping it would save her,

1467
01:20:08,266 --> 01:20:09,934
and she...

1468
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:12,854
died.

1469
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,985
Now I understand.

1470
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:21,404
My daughter is the lucky one.

1471
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:27,243
She does not have to grow up
in a world of suffering

1472
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:28,912
and pain

1473
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:33,333
run by wicked gods.

1474
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:37,379
Choose love.

1475
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:41,966
Call the axe.

1476
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:52,686
Call

1477
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:54,437
the axe.

1478
01:21:30,765 --> 01:21:32,017
You okay?

1479
01:21:32,183 --> 01:21:33,268
Yeah.

1480
01:21:35,854 --> 01:21:37,272
Mm, I wanna kill this guy.

1481
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:39,899
So do I, but we have to take him alive.

1482
01:21:40,066 --> 01:21:42,068
He's our only link
to finding those children.

1483
01:22:56,017 --> 01:22:57,811
Oh! Thank you, Mr. Goat.

1484
01:23:29,634 --> 01:23:31,594
Val!

1485
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:44,107
We gotta get her out of here!

1486
01:23:53,908 --> 01:23:55,160
Hey. I got you.

1487
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,256
Hey, guys, we're here. Come on, let's go.

1488
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,258
Storm breaker, take us home.

1489
01:25:05,897 --> 01:25:08,149
...at a rate that
none of us have seen before.

1490
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:09,734
Look, there are other more

1491
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:11,486
aggressive forms of treatment we can try,

1492
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:12,862
but something's affecting

1493
01:25:12,946 --> 01:25:14,823
her body's ability to fight the cancer.

1494
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:17,367
I'm sorry, Thor.

1495
01:25:31,381 --> 01:25:33,091
Oh, there you are. Okay.

1496
01:25:33,174 --> 01:25:34,360
What's goin' on out there?

1497
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:36,344
Oh, some moron made
a fridge without a door.

1498
01:25:36,428 --> 01:25:37,488
Can you believe it?

1499
01:25:37,512 --> 01:25:38,555
Not to worry. Got it open

1500
01:25:38,638 --> 01:25:40,473
and got you all sorts of goodies.

1501
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,641
How's Val?

1502
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:44,269
Oh, she's in a lot of pain,
uh, but she is stable.

1503
01:25:44,352 --> 01:25:45,353
Okay, good.

1504
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:48,231
Now you just gotta get this out of my...

1505
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:50,001
Oh, no, no, no.
That's gotta stay in there.

1506
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:52,027
That's all the magic potions and elixirs

1507
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:53,278
doing their thing, so...

1508
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:55,006
I'm just gonna pop out for a moment,

1509
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,698
pick up the kids, kill the bad guy,

1510
01:25:56,781 --> 01:25:58,101
and then I'll come straight back.

1511
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:00,702
You're going without me?

1512
01:26:01,369 --> 01:26:02,454
Uh, yeah.

1513
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,581
What happened to, like,
doing everything together?

1514
01:26:04,748 --> 01:26:06,666
He's gonna use those kids to distract you.

1515
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:07,751
You need me.

1516
01:26:07,834 --> 01:26:10,295
I do need you, Jane. I need you alive.

1517
01:26:10,462 --> 01:26:11,981
It'd be great to have you
on the battlefield,

1518
01:26:12,005 --> 01:26:13,465
fighting Gorr side by side,

1519
01:26:13,631 --> 01:26:15,425
but that hammer is killing you.

1520
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,011
Every time you use it,

1521
01:26:18,094 --> 01:26:19,774
it's draining all of your mortal strength,

1522
01:26:19,929 --> 01:26:22,098
leaving your body
unable to fight the cancer.

1523
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:24,851
What happened to,
"Live like there's no tomorrow"?

1524
01:26:24,976 --> 01:26:26,936
Well, that's before I knew
you might not have one.

1525
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,396
Why not have one more adventure?

1526
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:30,765
Jane, if there's a chance to live,
you have to take it.

1527
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:33,693
Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

1528
01:26:37,238 --> 01:26:39,866
I know I seem like
some cool astrophysicist

1529
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:41,201
from New Mexico,

1530
01:26:41,284 --> 01:26:43,953
just living the dream, but look at me.

1531
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,791
I wanna keep fighting.
I'm the Mighty Thor.

1532
01:26:47,957 --> 01:26:49,197
And you want me not to do that?

1533
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:51,920
What's the point of more time of this?

1534
01:26:52,962 --> 01:26:54,506
Because I love you.

1535
01:26:56,883 --> 01:26:58,760
I've always loved you.

1536
01:26:59,844 --> 01:27:01,888
And this is a chance for us.

1537
01:27:02,597 --> 01:27:04,474
But if you pick up that damn hammer again,

1538
01:27:04,557 --> 01:27:06,101
then that chance is gone.

1539
01:27:18,196 --> 01:27:19,614
It's your choice, Jane.

1540
01:27:20,782 --> 01:27:22,409
But I'd regret it every single day

1541
01:27:22,492 --> 01:27:23,678
if I didn't ask you to stay here

1542
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,578
so we could try and figure
this out together.

1543
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,750
You better come back to me.

1544
01:27:31,626 --> 01:27:33,586
I'm coming back as soon as I can.

1545
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:38,550
- Break a leg.
- I'll break all his legs.

1546
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:53,374
Remember that the Gate to Eternity

1547
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:54,399
is at the literal center

1548
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:55,543
- of the universe.
- Universe. Yes.

1549
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:56,961
If you go past the cluster of comets...

1550
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:58,170
Yes, yes, I know. We've been over this.

1551
01:27:58,194 --> 01:27:59,279
I'm not gonna get lost.

1552
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:02,240
So how you feeling
with the old stab wound?

1553
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:03,533
I think I lost my kidney.

1554
01:28:03,616 --> 01:28:05,076
- Gone completely? Ugh.
- Mm.

1555
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,244
I wish I could join you,

1556
01:28:06,327 --> 01:28:07,662
but I'd probably die,

1557
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:09,056
and that won't help get the kids back,

1558
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,498
so you'll have to go alone.

1559
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:13,668
All you have to do is destroy that sword.

1560
01:28:13,835 --> 01:28:15,086
It's his source of power.

1561
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:16,490
He won't survive long without it.

1562
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:20,425
Hey. Don't die.

1563
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,968
Yeah, I know.

1564
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:17,732
Eternity.

1565
01:29:20,026 --> 01:29:21,444
Finally.

1566
01:29:36,209 --> 01:29:37,460
Come on.

1567
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:04,320
Hey, kids.

1568
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:08,199
I knew he'd come.

1569
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:09,951
Go!

1570
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:11,119
Go, kids!

1571
01:30:20,211 --> 01:30:22,964
Everyone okay? All right,
gather round. Gather round.

1572
01:30:23,423 --> 01:30:26,176
Good to see you in person, buddy.
Good to see you.

1573
01:30:37,062 --> 01:30:38,539
All right, listen up. Here's the plan.

1574
01:30:38,563 --> 01:30:40,690
We're gonna sneak our way
towards Storm breaker,

1575
01:30:40,857 --> 01:30:42,609
being very careful not to bump

1576
01:30:42,692 --> 01:30:44,778
into any of those big shadow monsters.

1577
01:30:46,529 --> 01:30:47,769
They're behind me, aren't they?

1578
01:30:53,411 --> 01:30:54,972
Does anyone here have battle experience?

1579
01:30:54,996 --> 01:30:56,164
Battle experience?

1580
01:30:56,247 --> 01:30:58,208
Well, no time to learn like the present.

1581
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:00,752
We're not strong like you.
We're just kids.

1582
01:31:00,835 --> 01:31:02,921
Hey, don't forget you're Asgardian kids.

1583
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,048
I'm not. I'm just a Lycan kid.

1584
01:31:05,131 --> 01:31:06,383
And I'm a Midassian kid.

1585
01:31:06,466 --> 01:31:07,818
- I'm Falligarian.
- Okay, okay.

1586
01:31:07,842 --> 01:31:10,303
But today, you're Asgardians.

1587
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,680
Now collect your weapons.

1588
01:31:11,763 --> 01:31:12,764
What?

1589
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:14,933
Go and find anything you can pick up.

1590
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,101
Bring it back here.

1591
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:17,852
Hurry, hurry!

1592
01:31:17,936 --> 01:31:19,696
Okay, cool. Come on!

1593
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:22,440
They're getting closer. Hurry up!

1594
01:31:22,607 --> 01:31:23,608
Come on!

1595
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:28,822
Today is a day
that will go down in history.

1596
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:31,408
Today is the day they will talk about

1597
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:32,992
for generations to come.

1598
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:35,537
Today, we are Space Vikings!

1599
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:38,248
Present arms!

1600
01:31:43,586 --> 01:31:46,297
Whosoever holds these weapons,
and believes in getting home,

1601
01:31:46,464 --> 01:31:49,300
if they be true of heart
is therefore worthy,

1602
01:31:49,467 --> 01:31:50,927
and shall possess,

1603
01:31:51,928 --> 01:31:53,471
for limited time only,

1604
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:57,726
the power of Thor!

1605
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:08,236
General Axl...

1606
01:32:09,946 --> 01:32:11,740
...lead your army to that axe.

1607
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:13,908
We shall do our worst.

1608
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:16,703
For Asgard.

1609
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:14,154
Yeah!

1610
01:34:16,614 --> 01:34:17,615
No.

1611
01:34:31,963 --> 01:34:33,381
Jane.

1612
01:34:50,398 --> 01:34:51,983
We destroy that sword and he's dead.

1613
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:54,350
The gateway's almost open.
You gotta stop Storm breaker.

1614
01:34:54,986 --> 01:34:56,321
It's okay. I got him.

1615
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:05,872
Storm breaker, stop this!

1616
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:08,309
Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing!

1617
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,751
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1618
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:11,544
Come on.

1619
01:35:11,628 --> 01:35:13,505
Come on, buddy.

1620
01:35:18,218 --> 01:35:21,638
Let go of my friend.

1621
01:35:25,809 --> 01:35:27,310
You've lost, Lady Thor.

1622
01:35:34,734 --> 01:35:35,735
First off,

1623
01:35:36,152 --> 01:35:38,780
the name is Mighty Thor.

1624
01:35:40,281 --> 01:35:41,658
And secondly,

1625
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:44,369
if you can't say Mighty Thor,

1626
01:35:44,828 --> 01:35:48,456
I'll accept Doctor Jane Foster.

1627
01:35:52,419 --> 01:35:53,628
And thirdly,

1628
01:35:54,337 --> 01:35:57,215
eat my hammer!

1629
01:36:05,515 --> 01:36:07,851
Storm breaker!

1630
01:36:12,188 --> 01:36:13,440
I knew you could do it.

1631
01:36:14,566 --> 01:36:16,526
Axl! Get them home!

1632
01:38:05,552 --> 01:38:06,678
Jane?

1633
01:38:07,178 --> 01:38:08,179
I'm okay.

1634
01:38:08,555 --> 01:38:09,848
You have to stop him.

1635
01:38:40,128 --> 01:38:41,504
Gorr! Stop!

1636
01:38:46,176 --> 01:38:48,303
What kind of father would I be

1637
01:38:48,887 --> 01:38:50,472
if I stopped?

1638
01:38:54,392 --> 01:38:57,604
I know your pain, but this isn't the way.

1639
01:38:59,564 --> 01:39:02,484
It's not death or revenge that you seek.

1640
01:39:05,236 --> 01:39:07,572
What do I seek?

1641
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:22,295
You seek love.

1642
01:39:25,674 --> 01:39:26,966
Love?

1643
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:30,011
Why should I seek love?

1644
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,555
Because it's all any of us want.

1645
01:39:35,016 --> 01:39:36,184
How

1646
01:39:36,351 --> 01:39:40,063
dare you turn your back on me?

1647
01:39:41,606 --> 01:39:43,400
You've won, Gorr.

1648
01:39:43,566 --> 01:39:45,402
Why would I spend my last moments with you

1649
01:39:45,485 --> 01:39:46,945
when I can be with her?

1650
01:39:48,321 --> 01:39:49,823
I choose love.

1651
01:39:50,031 --> 01:39:52,867
You can, too. You can bring her back.

1652
01:39:56,788 --> 01:39:58,498
Make your wish.

1653
01:40:29,696 --> 01:40:31,072
I'm dying.

1654
01:40:32,532 --> 01:40:34,159
She would have no one.

1655
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:37,203
She would be alone.

1656
01:40:44,502 --> 01:40:46,504
She won't be alone.

1657
01:41:50,902 --> 01:41:52,070
Oh.

1658
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:58,118
My love.

1659
01:42:08,169 --> 01:42:10,088
I've missed you so much.

1660
01:42:12,966 --> 01:42:14,592
I missed you too.

1661
01:42:18,138 --> 01:42:19,389
I'm so sorry.

1662
01:42:19,472 --> 01:42:20,557
It's okay.

1663
01:42:22,642 --> 01:42:25,061
Ever since I picked up that hammer,

1664
01:42:26,896 --> 01:42:28,231
it's like

1665
01:42:28,982 --> 01:42:30,442
I've gotten an extra life.

1666
01:42:31,901 --> 01:42:33,820
And it was...

1667
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:37,032
Magical.

1668
01:42:39,909 --> 01:42:41,953
Not too bad for a human.

1669
01:42:43,621 --> 01:42:45,165
Not too bad for a god.

1670
01:42:46,124 --> 01:42:50,045
Hey. I think I figured out my catchphrase.

1671
01:42:50,462 --> 01:42:52,047
- Oh, yeah? What is it?
- Come close...

1672
01:42:57,385 --> 01:42:59,179
It's perfect.

1673
01:42:59,346 --> 01:43:00,638
It's the best one yet.

1674
01:43:00,805 --> 01:43:02,015
Thanks.

1675
01:43:10,106 --> 01:43:12,359
Keep your heart open.

1676
01:43:17,864 --> 01:43:19,366
I love you.

1677
01:43:20,533 --> 01:43:22,035
I love you, too.

1678
01:44:07,706 --> 01:44:09,207
Protect her.

1679
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:12,085
Protect my love.

1680
01:44:46,077 --> 01:44:49,914
<i>Let me tell you the legend
of the Space Viking,</i>

1681
01:44:50,707 --> 01:44:55,879
<i>AKA the Mighty Thor, AKA Dr. Jane Foster.</i>

1682
01:44:58,131 --> 01:45:00,592
<i>Her sacrifice saved the universe</i>

1683
01:45:00,759 --> 01:45:04,387
<i>and taught us all
what it means to be worthy.</i>

1684
01:45:04,929 --> 01:45:06,848
<i>She helped the children of the gods</i>

1685
01:45:07,015 --> 01:45:09,309
<i>who laser-beamed their way back home</i>

1686
01:45:09,476 --> 01:45:11,394
<i>to their dozy little fishing village</i>

1687
01:45:11,478 --> 01:45:13,396
<i>turned tourist destination.</i>

1688
01:45:13,605 --> 01:45:15,648
Axl!

1689
01:45:15,732 --> 01:45:17,192
I missed you.

1690
01:45:17,567 --> 01:45:18,961
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1691
01:45:18,985 --> 01:45:20,111
- Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

1692
01:45:20,278 --> 01:45:21,839
<i>The kids were safe to be kids again.</i>

1693
01:45:21,863 --> 01:45:23,239
Louder, three!

1694
01:45:24,824 --> 01:45:25,825
Widen your stance.

1695
01:45:25,909 --> 01:45:28,036
<i>Especially after
their king made them all go</i>

1696
01:45:28,119 --> 01:45:29,454
<i>to self-defense classes.</i>

1697
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:31,498
<i>Look at all those budding Space Vikings.</i>

1698
01:45:31,581 --> 01:45:32,707
And the most important part.

1699
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:34,501
The war cry!

1700
01:45:36,002 --> 01:45:37,337
<i>Even Heimdall's son,</i>

1701
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:39,089
<i>Axl Heimdall son,</i>

1702
01:45:39,255 --> 01:45:41,466
<i>who could now do
his dad's freaky eye magic,</i>

1703
01:45:41,633 --> 01:45:43,468
<i>was becoming quite the warrior.</i>

1704
01:45:43,927 --> 01:45:46,096
<i>The future of Asgard was secure.</i>

1705
01:45:47,889 --> 01:45:50,850
<i>Speaking of futures,
I was forging one of my own,</i>

1706
01:45:51,017 --> 01:45:52,477
<i>now that my body's grown back,</i>

1707
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:55,563
<i>with a dude I met called Dwayne.</i>

1708
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:58,817
<i>And what about Thor, you ask?</i>

1709
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:01,528
<i>He embarked on a new journey</i>

1710
01:46:01,695 --> 01:46:03,822
<i>because he had found
something to live for,</i>

1711
01:46:03,905 --> 01:46:06,074
<i>something to love for.</i>

1712
01:46:06,241 --> 01:46:08,118
<i>A little someone who turned him</i>

1713
01:46:08,201 --> 01:46:10,745
<i>from Sad God into Dad God.</i>

1714
01:46:10,912 --> 01:46:13,498
Breakfast is served.
Bon appétit.

1715
01:46:13,581 --> 01:46:15,542
Hello. There you go.

1716
01:46:15,709 --> 01:46:17,669
Hey. Breakfast.

1717
01:46:18,086 --> 01:46:20,588
Excuse me. What is that?

1718
01:46:20,755 --> 01:46:22,590
They're pan-flaps. From Earth.

1719
01:46:22,757 --> 01:46:24,592
I don't think I like pan-flaps.

1720
01:46:24,759 --> 01:46:25,820
- You love them.
- No, I don't.

1721
01:46:25,844 --> 01:46:26,845
Yes, you do.

1722
01:46:26,928 --> 01:46:27,989
I've never had that in my life.

1723
01:46:28,013 --> 01:46:29,615
Come on. Eat up. We have to go.
We're gonna be late.

1724
01:46:29,639 --> 01:46:30,640
Now where are your boots?

1725
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:32,851
I'm wearing them.

1726
01:46:33,184 --> 01:46:34,352
You're not wearing those.

1727
01:46:34,519 --> 01:46:36,187
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1728
01:46:36,271 --> 01:46:37,439
Yes, I am.

1729
01:46:37,605 --> 01:46:38,648
No. You're not.

1730
01:46:38,815 --> 01:46:40,215
Go to hell, demon!

1731
01:46:41,901 --> 01:46:43,153
Wow!

1732
01:46:43,236 --> 01:46:45,905
Brand new, now destroyed.
Thank you very much.

1733
01:46:46,072 --> 01:46:47,907
You know what? You wear what you want.

1734
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:49,093
Don't come complaining to me

1735
01:46:49,117 --> 01:46:50,177
when your feet get sore, all right?

1736
01:46:50,201 --> 01:46:51,953
You'll get no sympathy here from me.

1737
01:46:52,037 --> 01:46:54,205
Fine, I'll wear the boots.

1738
01:46:54,289 --> 01:46:55,290
Thank you.

1739
01:46:55,457 --> 01:46:57,208
Remember what my mother used to tell me.

1740
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:58,376
Listen to the grown-ups,

1741
01:46:58,543 --> 01:47:00,587
and if you see anyone scared
or being picked on,

1742
01:47:00,754 --> 01:47:02,154
- you look after them, okay?
- Okay.

1743
01:47:02,255 --> 01:47:03,631
And most of all, have fun.

1744
01:47:03,798 --> 01:47:05,342
- Gotcha.
- Gotcha.

1745
01:47:05,508 --> 01:47:07,510
Now where is Mjolnir? Where did I put him?

1746
01:47:07,677 --> 01:47:08,957
Over there. Sleeping in the bed.

1747
01:47:09,012 --> 01:47:10,180
In the bed.

1748
01:47:11,765 --> 01:47:12,766
Oh, wow.

1749
01:47:15,226 --> 01:47:17,020
That is not coming off.

1750
01:47:17,771 --> 01:47:19,189
What did you do?

1751
01:47:19,314 --> 01:47:21,274
Eh, she looked boring before.

1752
01:47:22,359 --> 01:47:23,860
Yeah. Suppose it did.

1753
01:47:24,027 --> 01:47:25,278
I love it.

1754
01:47:25,362 --> 01:47:26,571
Very creative.

1755
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:31,701
Okay.

1756
01:47:32,369 --> 01:47:33,721
Now, you see the aliens down there?

1757
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:35,121
The stripy ones?

1758
01:47:35,205 --> 01:47:36,790
- They look nice.
- Yeah, they are nice.

1759
01:47:36,873 --> 01:47:38,059
That's why we have to look after them.

1760
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:39,918
Got it. Protect the nice ones.

1761
01:47:41,044 --> 01:47:42,045
I love you, sweetie.

1762
01:47:42,212 --> 01:47:43,421
Love you, Uncle Thor.

1763
01:47:46,466 --> 01:47:48,051
<i>They will always be there for us.</i>

1764
01:47:48,134 --> 01:47:51,388
<i>The Space Viking and his girl,
born from Eternity.</i>

1765
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:53,807
<i>With the powers of a god.</i>

1766
01:47:56,267 --> 01:47:57,894
<i>Two warriors</i>

1767
01:47:58,061 --> 01:47:59,479
<i>fighting the good fight</i>

1768
01:47:59,562 --> 01:48:01,189
<i>for those who can't fight good.</i>

1769
01:48:06,861 --> 01:48:08,488
<i>They have traveled far,</i>

1770
01:48:08,571 --> 01:48:10,490
<i>and have been given many names.</i>

1771
01:48:11,157 --> 01:48:13,576
<i>But to those who know them best,</i>

1772
01:48:13,743 --> 01:48:15,412
<i>they are simply known</i>

1773
01:48:15,578 --> 01:48:17,580
<i>as Love and Thunder.</i>

1774
01:50:05,438 --> 01:50:07,774
It used to be that being a god,

1775
01:50:07,857 --> 01:50:09,442
it meant something.

1776
01:50:11,236 --> 01:50:13,279
People would whisper your name

1777
01:50:13,863 --> 01:50:17,784
before sharing their deepest
hopes and dreams.

1778
01:50:18,868 --> 01:50:21,204
They begged you for mercy

1779
01:50:21,871 --> 01:50:24,624
without ever knowing if
you were actually listening.

1780
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:27,961
Now,

1781
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:30,588
you know, they look to the sky,

1782
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:33,633
they don't ask us for lightning.

1783
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:36,636
They don't ask us for rain.

1784
01:50:37,345 --> 01:50:41,683
They just want to see one of
their so-called superheroes.

1785
01:50:44,978 --> 01:50:47,355
When did we become the joke?

1786
01:50:50,442 --> 01:50:51,693
No.

1787
01:50:52,652 --> 01:50:54,112
No more.

1788
01:50:55,655 --> 01:50:58,241
They will fear us again

1789
01:50:58,742 --> 01:51:01,703
when Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

1790
01:51:04,956 --> 01:51:07,834
Do you understand me, Hercules?

1791
01:51:08,335 --> 01:51:10,754
Do you understand me, my son?

1792
01:51:11,046 --> 01:51:12,464
Yes, Father.

1793
01:57:54,741 --> 01:57:55,742
Huh?

1794
01:57:59,954 --> 01:58:00,955
What?

1795
01:58:01,998 --> 01:58:03,667
Oh. Hey.

1796
01:58:05,043 --> 01:58:06,544
Jane Foster.

1797
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:08,963
Heimdall.

1798
01:58:09,422 --> 01:58:10,799
I see you're dead now.

1799
01:58:11,007 --> 01:58:12,801
Yeah.

1800
01:58:13,426 --> 01:58:15,428
Thank you for looking after my son.

1801
01:58:16,179 --> 01:58:18,807
You are very welcome here,
to the land of the gods.

1802
01:58:23,561 --> 01:58:25,313
Welcome to Valhalla.
