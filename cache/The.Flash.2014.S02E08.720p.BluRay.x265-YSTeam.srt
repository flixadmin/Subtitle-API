BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,185
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:13,101
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,274
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:18,684
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,780
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,359
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,986
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,655
Previously on The Flash and Arrow...

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,993
The person who broke into my facility
last night was Harrison Wells.

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,128
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon,
meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

12
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,460
I came hereto help you, Barry.

13
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,713
He may not be
Harrison Wells from your Earth.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,837
He has just as many secrets
as the one you knew.

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,639
I get these feelings sometimes.
These vibes.

16
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:51,058
I'm not sure what triggers it.
And sometimes itjust happens.

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,353
(TIRES SCREECHING)

18
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,639
OLIVER: You can always talk to me.

19
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,561
- Partners?
- Partners.

20
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,854
This is a million dollars.

21
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:03,064
That money is yours, once you tell Oliver
that you've lost the baby.

22
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,859
BARRY: I've been running a lot lately,

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,198
trying to go faster than
I've ever gone before,

24
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,701
because there's someone out there
who's better,

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,829
faster and stronger than I am.

26
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:17,911
And I need to be ready.

27
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,882
But no matter how much I try,
or how hard I push myself,

28
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,379
I keep running into the same problem.

29
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,379
He just hit 1,375.

30
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,427
What's the fastest Barry's run?

31
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,265
Little over Mach 2,
when he ran back in time.

32
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,229
That's not good.

33
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,728
That's good, Barry.

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,397
We have our work cut out for us.

35
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,442
I'm not getting faster, am I?

36
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,694
- Well...
- No. You're not.

37
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,242
All right. Well, let's fix this, right?

38
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,740
I mean, I can't beat Zoom at this speed.

39
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,537
It felt like I was standing still
next to him.

40
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,789
Oh, that's because you practically were.

41
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,127
Zoom is at least three,
four times faster than you at this point.

42
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,629
How is he so much faster than Barry is,
and Jay was?

43
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,293
Physiology, form, strength.

44
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,043
Could be a number of things.
Attitude, diet...

45
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,052
Okay. Well, there's gotta be
something we can do about it.

46
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:13,099
- So, let'sjust figure it out. Fast. Okay?
- (PHONE BUZZING)

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,974
All right, I gotta go. I'm meeting Patty.
I'll see you. Thank you.

48
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,640
So how are we gonna help Barry?

49
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,895
I'm out of ideas, and we've tried
everything you suggested.

50
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,820
Well, not everything.

51
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,831
(RATTLING)

52
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,379
POLICE CHIEF: Welcome home.

53
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,677
Any trouble?

54
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,424
Nah. But believe it or not,
we got ourselves a stowaway.

55
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,721
POLICE CHIEF: Give you his name?

56
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,218
Didn't say.
Sat in the brig silent for three weeks.

57
00:02:57,426 --> 00:03:00,145
He was all decked out in this
when we found him.

58
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,348
POLICE CHIEF: Jeez. How many are there?

59
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:06,106
Thirty-two. And I will polish them all
in blood before long.

60
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,656
I've waited a long time for this hunt,

61
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:13,200
and you have brought me
very close to my prey.

62
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,703
Mister, you're not gonna do
any hunting in those handcuffs.

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,493
Oh, but, Captain,
you're wearing the cuffs.

64
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:27,752
(GRUNTS)

65
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,340
Who taught you that? Houdini?

66
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,304
Actually, I taught him.

67
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:34,965

00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,147

69
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,662
Soon, another sacrifice will be made.

70
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,165
I feel you out there.

71
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,889
Man, this was a bloodbath.

72
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,687
Done by one person.

73
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,096
One person did all this?

74
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,981
Oh, yeah. You can see
from the blood pattern.

75
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,278
This guy was shot first,
then the Police Chief,

76
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,108
then these three were stabbed,
before finishing off the Captain.

77
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,908
Wow! Do you think a meta-human did it?

78
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:38,870
I don't know, but I found this
in all of the stab victims' wounds.

79
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:40,788
It's some type of cryptocrystalline.

80
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:44,288
Flint, most likely. Probably broke off
the blade during the fight.

81
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,665
I'll run it to make sure.

82
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,167
Let's see what stores
sell those kind of flint knives.

83
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,170
Will do. And I'll call you later.

84
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,259
- Okay.
- Okay.

85
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,182
It's so cute. You guys are trying
not to be affectionate in front of me.

86
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,134
No. We're just showing
some professionalism.

87
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,894
Yeah.

88
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,353

00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,906
Ah! A lot's gone down in this place.

91
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:22,954
Nice.

92
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,367
So what's up?
I thought we were gonna go to dinner.

93
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,959
Whoa. What's going on here?

94
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,050
I couldn't decide
which restaurant to go to,

95
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,050
so I thought we would create our own.

96
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:41,843
Voila'! Short rib,
Yukon gold puree and asparagus.

97
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,141
Gotta have a vegetable.

98
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,560
This is nice.

99
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,358
I like to cook. I didn't know if you like
red or white, so I got you both.

100
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,731
Ooh! Two bottles.
That's kind of dangerous, don't you think?

101
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,612
You're not gonna run away
all of a sudden, are you?

102
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,317
Trust me, I'm staying by your side
as long as possible.

103
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,117
Good.

104
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,702
You know, it's been really great
hanging out these last few weeks.

105
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:10,083
And it's helped make the move
a lot easier, so thanks.

106
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:11,625
You're very welcome.

Sorry. How did you get in here?

00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,009
Hey, man, this place is closed.

110
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:25,310
You are just as beautiful in this life
as any other, Priestess Chay-Ara.

111
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:26,601
Priestess?

112
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,555
Uh, you gonna have to go, dude.

113
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:32,562
Not without her, dude.

114
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:35,485
Oh, my God! Cisco.

115
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,314
I don't understand. What do you want?

116
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:39,444
I believe I was clear.

Kendra's not going anywhere with you,

00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:54,002
Oh, is that your name now?
Kendra? Quite boring.

120
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,293
I believe it allowed you
to blend in for a while.

121
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,720
Now, give her to me
and I'll make your death fast.

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,264
It ain't gonna happen.

123
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,307
You are done here, pal.

124
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,266
So is he.

Thank God, Barry.

Dude. Come on.

129
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:36,081
I can't believe you're the Flash.
And that you work with the Flash.

130
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,173
(CHUCKLING)
Yeah. Let's keep that on the DL.

131
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,552
This is the same knife that was used
to kill the men at the docks.

132
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:41,802
The residue's a perfect match.

133
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,053
So it is the same guy.

134
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:47,384
Definitely. But the thing is,
these blades are old. Centuries old.

135
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,677
Do you have any idea why this guy
would be after you?

136
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,308
No. I've never seen him before in my life.

137
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,228
Well, he was certainly
acting like he knew you.

138
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,605
He kept calling her Priestess Chay-Ara.

139
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,856
That's Coptic.

140
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,812
- You mean Egyptian?
- That's right.

141
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,906
Well, I grew up in Wisconsin
and I've never even left the States, so...

142
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,487
This guy, he's clearly
incredibly dangerous.

143
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,040
So I need you to at least
let us try to protect you.

144
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,331
I can put a detail on her.

145
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,625
You didn't see this guy, Joe.

146
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,336
No offense, but I don't think
a cop is gonna be able to protect her.

147
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:18,798
No, but we do have a few friends
who can lend a hand.

148
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,757
But we're gonna need
to leave Central City.

149
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,293
And go where?

150
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,213
You really wanna go to Star City?

151
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,264
Come on! We don't need
Team Arr0w's help.

152
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:28,682
Yeah, I think we do, man.

153
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:32,136
Man, you fought meta-humans with abilities
a lot worse than "knife-throwing."

154
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,604
I don't think this guy's a meta-human.

155
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:38,402
There's something different about him.
Something mystical.

156
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,735
Mystical, really?

157
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,063
We stop meta-humans
because we're scientists.

158
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,615
We can figure out
what their weaknesses are.

159
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,489
But we don't have any experience
when it comes to guys like this.

- With magic. They do.
- Mmm!

161
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,911
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Zoom, would it?

162
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,538
No. I'm just trying to keep Kendra safe.

163
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:55,835
This is the best way to do that.

164
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,504
Right. Okay. I'm with you.

165
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,082
But how do we even know Oliver and them
even have time to help us?

166
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:03,174
How busy can they be?

Oh, gosh, that's fun.
I really could do this all day.

169
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,604
Open it up.

170
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,566
They could have at least tried
to hide this chemical bomb.

171
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,441
Serves them right it's getting stolen
and used against them.

You brought arrows to a gun fight.

174
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,451
What guns?

175
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,202
DARH KI Oh!

176
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,626
That was actually pretty clever.
Kill them.

OLIVER: Felicity? Honey?

181
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:59,519
It's a little hard to fight with you
doing that in my ear.

Oh, I totally forgot that
this was an open line.

Thank you. But I don't think that
you ran all the way here to protect us.

No, not to protect you.

00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,884
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

229
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,466
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

230
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,346
What's does this guy even look like?

231
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,851
Uh... Hold on.

00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:49,730
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay. This is him.

233
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,437
Yeah. See, that's something
I would never think of.

Hmm, kinda rockin'
that Dothraki look. Hot.

can find a match.

(BEEPING)

237
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,332
That's him.

238
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:07,495
Yeah, strange.
This picture's from 1975.

239
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,331
Which would make him about
80 years old right now.

240
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,041
Okay, what else can you tell us?

241
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,636
He said we've known each other for ages,
but I've never met the man before.

242
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,509
But there has to be
some kind of a connection.

243
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,427
Not one I can think of.

244
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,725
I just moved to Central City,
six months ago.

245
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,427
Why'd you move there?

246
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:26,139
I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.

247
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:28,895
Kendra, there is a reason
this guy's after you. Think.

248
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,818
Look, man, we just came out here
to hide out for a bit

249
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,523
until we figure things out, so you can
just take it down just a little.

250
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,325
You came here because you need our help.
This is what my help looks like.

251
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:38,822
Oliver, I just saved you guys

252
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,120
from whatever the hell Flock of Seagulls
was about to do.

253
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,413
The least you can do is just...

254
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,240
Barry, none of us have superpowers.

255
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,621
You brought Kendra into our world
without knowing who she is

256
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:49,081
or what this dude
that is after her is looking for.

257
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,631
You made all of us unsafe.
So maybe you ask the questions.

258
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:53,836
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

259
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,379
- We're all friends here, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

260
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,431
Why don't we go back to our place
and have some drinks,

261
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,756
and we can talk.

262
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,143
Cool.

263
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,561
What you working on?

264
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,101
This is a formula meant to increase

265
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,150
a speedster's velocity
that I've been developing

266
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,571
since Zoom showed up on my Earth.

267
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,899
Ironically, this was meant
to help out Jay Garrick.

268
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:20,235
You want to give Barry a drug
to make him run faster?

269
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,037
Temporarily enhance the Speed Force
in his system, yes.

270
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,456
So you're trying to make
nitrous oxide for speedsters.

271
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:26,748
Good analogy. Yes, I tried.

272
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:28,576
Five times I've tried,
five times I've failed.

273
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,585
That's what you get when your background
is technology and not biochemistry.

274
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,167
- Well, then you are lucky I am here.
- What does that mean?

275
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:36,962
You've been thinking of this
as a mechanical problem,

276
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,465
not a biomechanical one.

277
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:39,760
And what does that mean?

278
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,850
When a speedster runs, they consume
an extraordinary amount of oxygen.

279
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,936
So we just need something to give
an extra boost of oxygen during that time.

280
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,138
- Like an oxygen generator.
- Exactly!

281
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,937
So we just need
a chemical that's rich in oxygen,

282
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:56,232
that would release it as a nearly pure gas
as it decomposes.

283
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,865
- Something like sodium chlorate.
- Sodium chlorate.

284
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,567
Then, all we need is heat
to release the oxygen.

285
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:05,120
Which a speedster generates naturally
in the form of lightning.

286
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,164
I think something like this
just might work.

287
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,580
You think you can help me figure it out?

288
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,000
I can certainly try.

289
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:15,798
I'm not changing my nickname.
I like Speedy.

290
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,375
CISCO: Are you familiar
with my body of work?

291
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:19,460
If you are, then you know I can come up

292
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,716
with something so much
better than "Speedy."

293
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:26,092
Why don't you get a haircut,
and then maybe we can talk about it.

294
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,019
I think you just mad 'cause
my conditioner game is on point.

295
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,937
So, the CEO of Palmer Technologies
is living with Oliver Queen.

296
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,360
It's insane how much
life can change in six months, huh?

297
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,985
Which you would know better than anyone,
considering that there's another Flash,

298
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:43,489
- another Dr. Wells, from another Earth?
- Mmm-hmm.

299
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,321
- I mean...
- Yeah. I know. It's been trippy lately.

300
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:51,283
I wonder what Oliver's doppelganger
would look like. Bald. Pot-bellied.

301
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,376
- Uh-huh.
- Agreeable.

304

- I am, actually.
- Good.

305
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,341
Patty is her name. She is amazing.

306
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,673
- You deserve someone amazing.
- Thanks.

My pigs in a blanket.

309
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:14,642
Hey, Ollie. Look, I'm sorry
that I laid all of this on you.

310
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,567
- I know that it wasn't fair.
- (SIGHS) That's okay.

311
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,394
- I'm sorry if earlier I was a little...
- Snippy?

312
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,529
- I have been called worse.
- (CHUCKLES)

313
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,825
No, but I'm glad that you're here.
I'm glad you reached out.

314
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,403
It shows a real maturity. And I would know
that because I've never been that mature.

315
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,741
(LAUGHS)

316
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,284
I'm always here for you.

317
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:32,120
Thank you.

318
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,203
I gotta say, I mean, this isn't the same
Arrow team I'm used to seeing.

319
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,254
Or the same Oliver Queen.
You seem really...

320
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:40,256
- Happy?
- Hapr>y. Yeah.

321
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,173
I am happy. I finally have everything
that I've ever wanted.

322
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:47,802
Being with Felicity has given me
a real sense of peace.

323
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,600
It's something that I haven't had
in a long time.

324
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52,640
Didn't you tell me that guys like us
don't get the girl?

325
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,014
Yep. I was wrong.

326
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,149
(LAUGHS)

327
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,559
I would like to propose a toast.

328
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,655
I wish it wasn't just the dark times
bringing us together.

329
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,529
But it is friends like you
that make those dark times worth having.

330
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,243
(CHUCKLES) What a guy!
Steals my drink, steals my words.

331
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,371
As I was saying,
it's good to see everyone.

332
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,709
- Yes.
- Cheers.

333
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,287
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

334
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,291
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Mmm.

335
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,339
Look, don't worry, all right?
We're gonna keep her safe. I promise.

336
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,969
Yeah. I know.
Look, there's something I never told you.

337
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,976
The first time I kissed Kendra,
I got a vibe.

338
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,853
No, not like that kind of vibe.

339
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,726
- Like I vibed-vibed.
- Oh!

340
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:38,266
Remember the man with wings?
It wasn't a man.

341
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:39,941
It was Kendra.

342
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,065
And she was, like, a bird.

343
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,271
You think that she's a meta-human?

344

(MUMBLING UNCERTAINTY)

345
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:47,490
Wait, why didn't you say anything
about this sooner?

346
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,319
Well, I didn't think it was related,
but I guess, now, it has to be.

347
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,243
Look, I don't, I don't want her
to know about my powers.

348
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,336
I have this great thing going with her.

349
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,665
And she laughs at myjokes,
and she loves movies, and...

350
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,127
I just...
I've never felt like this before,

351
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,962
and I don't want to sabotage it.

352
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,140
I get the feeling.

353
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,933
Look!

354
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,934
I will always find you, Chay-Ara.

355
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,480
Don't move!

356
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,941
Then how will I kill you all?

What did you do?

363
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,419
I ended it.

364
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,590
This is why we ask questions!

00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,601
- Where did he go? Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,193
Okay. Thanks.

368
00:19:55,318 --> 00:20:00,119
All right. Lance is gonna call if he gets
any information on whoever that is.

369
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,207
I know where we can get some info.

370
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,461
Kendra, I have powers.

371
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:17,092
I get these vibes from people,
they're visions of meta-humans.

372
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,432
And I had one of you.

373
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:25,813
So, A, you're saying you're a meta-human,
and B, she's a meta-human?

374
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,730
I don't know. In these visions,
you could fly.

375
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,824
It was like you were a bird of some sort.

376
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,067
- A bird?
- Yeah.

377
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,325
(STUTTERS) What else did you see?

378
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,825
That's it. Just you with wings.

379
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,789
Oh! I did not see that one coming.

you didn't see coming.

Great. More surprises.

386
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,269
I think I did it.

387
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,987
What do you know, Snow.
I think you did do it.

388
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,365
- Velocity-Six?
- Ah!

389
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,999
This is what was so urgent, Harrison?

390
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,702
You get me to come here
so I can take your speed drug?

391
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,204
- That's right.
- You knew about this?

392
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,877
- Of course she did. She figured it out.
- Uh...

393
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,218
I thought this was to help Barry.

394
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,337
It is to help Barry. Which is why we need
to do test runs on subjects

395
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,719
who once had the Speed Force
in their system.

396
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,517
Speed Force doesn't work like that.

397
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,060
It's not something
you can create in a lab.

398
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,055
How do you think you became
the Flash, Garrick?

399
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:50,853
By me and a lab. Science is what
did this to you, to Barry, to Zoom.

400
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,983
And science is what we need to stop Zoom,
and this is our only option.

401
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,067
Find another one! Speed Force
can't be replicated or enhanced.

402
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,239
It's a living thing.
It's a gift that was given to me.

403
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,738
That drug, you have no idea
what it's gonna do.

404
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,536
I'm not letting another one of your
experiments mess with me again.

405
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,037

to be your guinea pig.

Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry.

408
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,545
- Where are you going?
- To pick up what we need.

409
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,922
Wait! Jayjust said
we shouldn't give it to Barry.

410
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,090
We're gonna do what we need.

411
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,934
The man you're looking for
is Vandal Savage.

412
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,637
- Vandal Savage? Never heard of him.
- Well, who is he?

413
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,769
Some say he was the most trusted adviser
to Genghis Khan.

414
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,396
Others say he guided Julius Caesar
through the Gallic Wars.

415
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,947
But one thing the League knows for sure,
he was there for all of it.

416
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:39,740
So what are you saying?
He's like a vampire or something?

417
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,115
Not a vampire. An Immortal.

418
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,624
Okay, we've officially stepped
into crazy town. Immortality?

419
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,076
But wait, no, no, no. This makes sense.

420
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,834
This explains why he looks the same
as he did in 1975.

421
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,167
This can't be possible.

There's nothing you can do
to save her now.

Kendra, do not listen to him.

424
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,638
I just need some air.

to keep Kendra safe.

I just interviewed a weapons expert
about the flint knife our attacker used.

- You gonna be all right?
- This is a lot to take in right now.

433
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,666
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about me before.

434
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,878
I didn't want things to be
different between us.

It's not that, Cisco.

00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,385
If what everyone's saying is true,

437
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,890
and it's beginning to seem like it is,
my whole life just changed.

438
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,020
And I am so not ready for that.

439
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,939
I hear what you're saying. I do.

When I first learned about my powers,

441
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,740
I remember feeling
that exact same feeling.

442
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,864
And sometimes, I still feel that way.

443
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,365
And all I can say is,

444
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:11,538
every day gets a little bit more normal.

445
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:14,749
I promise you.

446
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,546
Thank you.

447
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,799
You're so welcome.

00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,951
The man who is hunting you. Vandal Savage.

465
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,488
I got 'em! 57th Street tower.

466
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,080
ARROW: I'm right near there.

467
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,124
Always a pleasure
watching you work, Smoak.

468
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,576
- Yeah!
- Mmm!

469
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,875
- Ah!
- That was pitiful.

470
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:38,294
I know this is a lot to take in,

471
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:40,417
but you sort ofjust
kinda have to trust me on this.

472
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:45,760
I... (EXHALES) Just one second.
Stay right there.

473
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:55,353
ARROW: I got eyes on 'em.

474
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,240
Give me the girl!

475
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,739
Not gonna do that, Robin Hood.

476
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:15,825
- You're making a big mistake.
- I'll take my chances.

477
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,497
(GRUNTING)

478
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:19,744
Barry! Change of venue.

479
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,797
Birdman and Oliver are at
54th and Motor now. Hurry!

480
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,170
On my way!

481
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,967
(GRUNTING)

482
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,065
(GASPING)

483
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,362
We need to expose his wings.

484
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,738
I'm open to suggestions.

485
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:51,990
What, now you're listening to me?

486
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,199
It's your city, Oliver.

487
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,739
All right.

488
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,133
(GROANING)

489
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:36,822
- (SCREAMING)
- (GRUNTING)

490
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,372
(PANTING)

491
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,577
- That's new.
- (CHUCKLES)

492
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,791
Yeah. Comes in handy.

493
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,337
We can't use that serum on Barry.

494
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,597
That's up to him, isn't it?

495
00:27:55,214 --> 00:27:59,265
If Barry wants to stop Zoom,
this is what he needs.

496
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,642
Jay said it could hurt Barry.

497
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:01,938
Well, Jay's a coward.

498
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,808
Jay's a scientist
who knows a lot about speedsters.

499
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,064
You're a scientist, Snow.

500
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,320
You've been watching Barry, you know
he's nowhere near fast as he needs to be.

501
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,773
This other mentor,
this other Harrison Wells,

502
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,404
did not want him to reach
his full potential. ldo.

503
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,532
You know, you're really starting
to sound a lot like him.

504
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,741
PATTY: Put your hands in the air.

505
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,420
- Who are you?
- You're under arrest.

506
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:28,048
Dr. McGee was right. She did see you.

507
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:32,465
- Christina McGee?
- At Mercury Labs. You're Harrison Wells.

508
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,837
Yes, I'm Harrison Wells.
I'm not the Harrison Wells...

509
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,298
Stop! You move closer and I'll shoot!

510
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,632
Give me that...

511
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:48,605
(GASPS)

512
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,645
Oh, my God! What have you done?

513
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,737
Harrison! Harrison Wells, stay with me.

514
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:02,078
Harrison. Harrison, stay with me.
Stay with me, Harrison Wells. Come on.

515
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,371
Why did you shoot him?

516
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:05,285
I thought that was a gun.
I'm sorry. I'll call 911.

517
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,586
- No! Don't!
- Why?

518
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,788
Because this...
Didn't Joe West explain this to you?

519
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,464
- No.
- Just call Joe!

520
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,758
Okay.

521
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,473
(GRUNTING)

522
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:28,316
Where is she?

523
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,984
- What's your name?
- You're putting her in danger

524
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:31,903
and I'm the only one
capable of saving her.

525
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,449
A very interesting perspective
on what the word "saving" means.

526
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:37,153
She's the love of my lifetimes,
sweetheart.

527
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,326
I was not gonna hurt her.

528
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,404
You need to let me go!

529
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,460
Chay-Ara...

530
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,421
My name is Kendra Saunders.

531
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,039
In this life.

532
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:55,252
And I am, was Carter Hall.
But that is not who we are.

533
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,052
What does that mean?

534
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:59,839
You're Priestess Chay-Ara,
I'm Prince Khufu.

535
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,675
And we're lovers, soul mates.

536
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,261
We've been partners
for 4,000 years.

537
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,188
We're drawn to each other in each life,
and after we die,

538
00:30:07,346 --> 00:30:10,351
we reincarnate to find each other again,
and again, and again.

539
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,936
And now that I've found you,
we should really get out of here.

540
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,192
Okay, Romeo,
why don't you pump the brakes?

541
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,532
These people cannot protect you
from Savage any longer.

542
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,406
D0 you know who Vandal Savage is?

543
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:25,662
In every lifetime,
he hunts us down and kills us.

544
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,997
He's done it 206 times.

545
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,874
And I'm not planning to make it 207.

546
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:31,579
Why does he kill you?

547
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:33,582
His life force is tethered to ours.

548
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,589
Every time he kills us,
he becomes more powerful. You do the math.

549
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,215
You're 0 for 206,

550
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,719
and you still think
you're her best bet, hmm?

551
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,096
Okay, so what we need to do
is just find Savage and get rid of him.

552
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,605
(SCOFFS) Well,
you can't get rid of him, my friend.

553
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,561
Oh, yeah? Watch us.

554
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,230
It might be harder than you think.

555
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,903
(STUTTERS) ls that the only way
this guy knows how to enter a room?

556
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,153
My associates tell me
Savage left Star City a few hours ago.

557
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,404
For where?

558
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,694
We're not quite sure. But I assume
after his run in with you,

559
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,781
he realized he needed something
more powerful to complete his mission.

560
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,202
(SCOFFS) Well...

561
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,534
We think he's trying to locate
the Staff of Horus.

562
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:11,586
Sorry, what is that?

563
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,211
It's a relic from our past.
An ancient and powerful weapon.

564
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,636
If Savage gets his hands on it, it's gonna
be nearly impossible to stop him.

565
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,720
Since when did our lives suddenly become
an Indiana Jones movie?

566
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,009
- Felicity? Think you can find it?
- Yeah.

567
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,685
Yes. It's probably at some
museum somewhere.

568
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:30,605
I'll work my magic.
See what I can find.

569
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:33,942
We're running out of time.

570
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,942
You need to emerge, now. Come on.

571
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:40,273
What is it going to take for you
to believe me? You saw my wings.

572
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:42,483
I know you know this is true.

573
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,074
Please, just let me show you how.

574
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,372
- How's he doing?
- He's losing oxygen.

575
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,256
- I need you to leave.
- Joe, I...

576
00:31:56,455 --> 00:31:57,673
Patty, go.

577
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,634
There's a bullet in a branch
of his pulmonary artery

578
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,430
that's blocking off most of the blood flow
from the left lung.

579
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,798
Are we able to get the bullet out?

580
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,679
Not without causing too much damage.

581
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,259
I need Jay's help.

582
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,614
So,

583
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:25,527
you just want me to jump?

584
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,832
Fall, jump, swan dive,
whatever suits you. Just, do it.

585
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,871
Okay. This isn't the X Games.

586
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,917
OLIVER: And this is how she emerges?

587
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,338
She just falls towards her death?

588
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:40,133
Yep. 4,000 years of experience
says that's exactly how.

589
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,505
Just watch and learn.

590
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,680
No, I'm sorry. What are we doing?
Why are we listening to this guy?

591
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,849
Come on, Oliver. You're supposed to be
the one who asks questions.

592
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:51,222
Okay, but after what we saw,
after what Cisco said,

593
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,055
I cannot believe I'm gonna say this,

594
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,057
but it kinda makes sense.

595
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,651
Hey, hey, hey.

596
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,527
I need to try.

597
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,782
Are you serious?

598
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,660
- Yes, she is.
- (GASPS)

599
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,951
(SCREAMING)

600
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,919
What the hell was that?

601
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,251
Saving her life. You should have emerged.
Something is blocking you.

602
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,961
Well, we should just try again
and see...

603
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,637
- No!
- Yeah, no! No, no, no.

604
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,015
No. We're not doing that again.
Kendra, you don't have to do this.

605
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,676
Oliver, we can stop Savage, okay?

606
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,516
- Barry!
- What?

607
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,560
Can I talk to you for a second?

608
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:39,900
Okay.

609
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,397
Keep an eye on him.

610
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,990
What is going on with you?

611
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,238
I'm trying to keep her alive.

612
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,569
- Then I think we let herjump.
- Are you kidding?

613
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,576
Barry, I get that you're desperate to help
and you want to be the hero,

614
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,077
and you wanna save her yourself.

615
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:56,159
But I think she has to have
a part in it, too.

616
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,039
(SCOFFS)

617
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,289
- What?
- Lt'sjust the rules keep changing.

618
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,920
One day, I have to run through time,

619
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,000
the next,
I'm fighting a telepathic gorilla.

620
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,553
(STUTTERING) And now, we're what?

621
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,630
We're, we're chasing down
an immortal madman

622
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,717
on a rampage against
a reincarnated warrior Priestess?

623
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:13,135
(BOTH SIGH)

624
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,266
I Just never thought I'd have superpowers

625
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,724
and feel more powerless
than I ever have in my entire life.

626
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:22,527
That part, I understand.
But you have already helped Kendra.

627
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:24,525
You have kept her alive.

628
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,237
So now, let's help her get her wings,

629
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:28,817
and then she can give you
a lift back to Central City.

630
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,206
- Central City.
- What?

631
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,951
We need to check Central City
for the staff.

632
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,126
- Kendra, you said you were drawn there?
- Yeah.

633
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:41,795
I think you're drawn to things
that destroy you,

634
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,465
the same way the two of you
are drawn to each other.

635
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,666
That's why it wasn't in any museum
or private collection,

636
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,594
because it was consecrated eight months
ago at St. Mark's in Central City.

637
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,342
We've gotta get it before Savage does.

638
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,507
Carter, stay here.

639
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,849
I'm not going anywhere.

640
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,057
Call Thea and Dig and we'll have them hold
down the fort in case Savage shows up.

641
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:59,563
Kendra, last year, I lost my powers.

642
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,978
The only way I could get them back is

643
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:03,275
if I just forgot about everything
happening around me,

644
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,398
and focused on who I was.

645
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,652
Just believe in yourself,
and your true selfwill emerge.

646
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,365
Thanks.

647
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,902
Hey. Are you sure that
you want to do this?

648
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:17,202
If this guy's immortal and Merlyn's right
about how powerful this staff is...

649
00:35:19,074 --> 00:35:21,293
We'll be fine. Kiss her.

650
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,708
We'll be fine.

651
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,384
- Careful.
- Let's go.

652
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,813
Now what?

653
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,940
His systolic pressure's dropping.
He's gonna code.

654
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,065
How bad is it?

655
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,067
There's a bullet in his pulmonary artery.

656
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,407
- Can you close the wound if I get it?
- Yes.

657
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,079
How are you gonna do that?

658
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,119
- What is that?
- Lt's a serum, called Velocity-Six.

659
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,704
It could give Jay temporary speed.

660
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,130
He can phase through Dr. Wells' chest,
and remove the bullet.

661
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,666
Yeah. But I told you, I've no idea
what's gonna happen if I use that.

662
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,967
It's our only option.

663
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,090
If you don't do this,
Dr. Wells will die.

664
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,925
(GRUNTS)

665
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:21,811
(GROANING)

666
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,027
It's working.

667
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,771
(GRUNTING)

668
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,108
(GASPING)

669
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,786
BP and oxygenation is rising.
Blood flow's returning to his lungs.

670
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:46,871
Thank you.

671
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,255
I was just thinking,

672
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,306
all the moments in my life
when I felt different,

673
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,759
like something was wrong with me,

674
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,474
now I know why.

675
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,021
It's gonna be all right, okay?

676
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:13,983
Look, I know what it's like to have
your life suddenly change like this.

677
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,280
I can help you get through this.

678
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,987
I don't know if you can.

679
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,829
Cisco, there is a whole
other life inside me.

680
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:28,289
Hundreds of lives
that I need to know about.

681
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,300
I think I need to do it by myself.

682
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,221
I have to embrace my destiny.

683
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,594
I have to believe.

684
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,684
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

685
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,139
You don't have to do this.

686
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:53,692
What's going on?

687
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,525
Nothing. I just like to speed
into rooms, usually.

688
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,451
ARROW: Uh-huh. And where do you think
we find this thing?

689
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,204
I haven't been in
one of these places in a while.

690
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,829
We're too late.

691
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,833
Something you're not used to
saying very often, I'd imagine.

692
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:13,675
You tried those arrows
once before, remember?

693
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,297
They didn't quite finish the job,
now did they?

694
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,175
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

695
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:19,630
You're gonna leave Kendra alone.

696
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,842
I can't do that.
While my destiny is to live forever,

697
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,894
Chay-Ara's is to die, as is yours now.

698
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,362
- Any ideas?
- Oh, now you'll listen to me?

699
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,913
It's your city.

700
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:51,503
- Let's just try to get the staff.
- All right.

701
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,418
- On my mark.
- All right.

702
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,054
Carter was right.
Something's holding me back.

703
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,257
Maybe it's Central City, or you.

704
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,932
Or what I thought my life was going to be.

705
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:06,601
But I'm never gonna become
who I really am unless I let go.

706
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:08,644
I have to do this.

707
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,317
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

708
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:20,909
(CHUCKLES) In all my countless years,
I've never encountered

709
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,704
anybody with your capabilities.
Astonishing!

710
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,157
No!

711
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,170

(CHUCKLING) on, my God!

(EXCLAIMING)

714
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:47,719
I used to enjoy slow deaths.
Now, I Just find them boring.

715
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,606
(EXHALES) Thanks.

716
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:01,565
Yeah. Any chance he blew
himself up in there?

717
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:02,820
Not likely.

718
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,657
So that's like a tie, right?

719
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,737
- I guess.
- I will take it.

Hey,. are you okay?

722
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,679
I'm gonna have to learn
how to use these things.

723

(CHUCKLES)

724
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,061
You'll get the hang of it, Hawkgirl.

725
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,235
Dr. Wells, you're gonna be okay.

726
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,485
That's good news.

727
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,706
You will probably be very sore
for a little while, though.

728
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,744
Sore's better than dead.

729
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,208
Yes, it is.

730
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:01,000
How you doing, Garrick?

731
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,753
Your serum's out of my system.

732
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:06,259
And I will never take it again.

733
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,137
Jay.

734
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,063
Thank you.

735
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:22,192
You can thank me by keeping
that Velocity-Six away from Barry.

736
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:34,534
That was Oliver.
Savage has the Staff of Horus.

737
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,369
He wants us all in Central City
as soon as possible.

738
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,501
Okay, well, Laurel's already
there visiting her mom,

739
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,708
so I'll call her and let her know
we're coming by.

740
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,090
If Savage is in Central City,
then why are we going back there?

741
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:46,385
So we can end this.

742
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:49,260
And if anybody's gonna take down Savage,
it's gonna be Barry and Oliver.

743
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,592
Plus, you've emerged.
It's gonna be much harder for him now.

744
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,144
And together, all of us,
we can take him down once and for all.

745
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:57,063
Okay. So how are we gonna get there?

746
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:01,231
Did I mention I'm the CEO
of a big company with a private jet?

747
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,702
Since when is that a thing?

748
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,909
About eight months.

749
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,960
Maybe if you save Star City,
you might get one, too.

750
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,503
By the way, we still need to get Savage.

751
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,125
We'll get him.
