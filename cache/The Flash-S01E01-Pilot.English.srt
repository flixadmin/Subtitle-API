00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:27,119
It's healed. In three hours.

How is that even possible?

343
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:31,831
We don't know. Yet.

344
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:34,167
You really need to learn how to stop.

What happened out there today?

346
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:40,298
You were moving pretty well and then
something caused you to lose focus.

347
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:44,344
I started remembering something.

348
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:50,600
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

349
00:22:55,897 --> 00:22:57,357
It was late.

350
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:00,359
The sound woke me up.

351
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:04,196
I came downstairs...

352
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,865
...and I saw what looked
like a ball of lightning.

353
00:23:09,116 --> 00:23:10,368
Inside the lightning...

354
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:13,037

They arrested my dad.

357
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:23,548
He's still sitting in Iron Heights
for her murder.

358
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,887
Everyone, the cops, the shrinks,
they all told me what I saw was impossible.

359
00:23:33,224 --> 00:23:36,853
But what if the man who killed my mom
was like me?

360
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:41,399
Well, I think I can say unequivocally,
you are one of a kind.

361
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,824
Can I help you, detective?

362
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:53,411
You can stop acting like you can't stand me
when your dad's around.

...Eddie covered my father's shifts
so we could both be with you.

I know who did this.

00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:37,359
It's Clyde Mardon.
I know, everybody thinks he died...

389
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:40,821
...in a plane crash after
the S.T.A.R. Labs explosion, but he's alive.

You want to do this now? Out here?
Fine. Mardon is dead.

00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:12,310
There is no controlling the weather.

for once in your life see things as they are.

407
00:27:49,305 --> 00:27:50,723

I'd say that's Clyde Mardon.

Well, the accelerator went active.

We all felt like heroes, and then...

417
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,052
...it all went wrong.
The dimensional barrier ruptured...

-Those are all theoretical.
-And how theoretical are you?

...from the storm cloud.

It's heat and abrasive resistant to withstand
your moving at high-velocity speeds.

496
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:43,769
The aerodynamic design
should help you maintain control.

How do we find Mardon?

500
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:55,405
I retasked S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite
to track meteorological abnormalities.
