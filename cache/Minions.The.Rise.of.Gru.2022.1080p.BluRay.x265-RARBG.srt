Oh, please. We're villains.

73

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,661
He's stinking up the house.

192
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,413
I thought you were
cooking cabbage.

193
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,665
He's my new guru.

194
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,542
Blah!

195
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,419
Blah! (Babbling)

196
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,921
Tell your weird buddies

197
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,590
they'd better start pulling
their weight around here,

198
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,883
or I'm kicking them out.

199
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,636
They are killing
my mellow vibes.

200
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,513
(Mimics complaining)

201
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,390
Gru's mom: Hey! I heard that!

202
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,024
Come on. Let's go tell the
troops the good news.

203
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,611
Gentlemen, to the basement,

204
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,197
aka our new evil lair.

205
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,700
(Exclaims)

206
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,702
This is fantastic!

207
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,788
Oh, construction
looks great, guys.

208
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,341
(Minions chanting)

209
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,353
My first evil lair.

210
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,729
Goose bumps!

211
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:33,814
(Explosion)

212
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,607
(Speaking minionese)

213
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,735
Well, you've got to break a
few eggs to make an omelet.

214
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,987
Am I right?

215
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,489
Oh, great job, Ryan. What?

216
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,907
I said great job!

217
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,826
What? Never mind.

218
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,037
Adrien, mack, looking good.

219
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,706
(Speaking minionese)

220
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,710
(Sighs in relief)

221
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,794
(Crying)

222
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,587
Joe, how's the family?

223
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,297
Hey. Good, good.

224
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,676
Okay, everybody, get over here.

225
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,764
Now, listen up.
Buckle your overalls.

226
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,808
Hold on to your goggles.

227
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,978
The vicious6 wants to meet me.

228
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,146
Tomorrow.

229
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,772
(Laughs) (All cheering)

230
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,275
Minions: Mini-boss!

231
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,901
Mini-boss! Mini-boss!

232
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,945
All right, all right.
I'm not mini.

233
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,238
Please stop calling me that.

234
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,116
And also, they haven't
accepted me yet.

235
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,036
(All groan) (Speaking minionese)

236
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,121
Hello, Otto. What is it?

237
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,831
(Speaking minionese)

238
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,584
(Sighs) Blah, blah, blah.

239
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,919
Uh-huh. Well, that...

240
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,213
Yes, I... (Speaking minionese)

241
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:43,884
I... okay.

242
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,554
You know what would be fun?
Let's play the quiet game.

243
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,264
The quiet game! Si, si!

244
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,810
Anyway, thanks for the
hard work today, everyone.

245
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,270
I got to go get some rest.

246
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,231
Tomorrow is the biggest day
of my life.

247
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,316
(All cheering)

248
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,985
Watch out, world.
Here comes gru!

249
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,906
Mini-boss! Mini-boss! I'm not...

250
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,699
(Sighs) Mini-boss! Mini-boss!

251
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,205
(Exclaims)

252
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:21,963
(Gru sighs)

253
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,007
These guys are the best.

254
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,550
I can't believe it.

255
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,347
Uh... mini-boss?

256
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,516
(Speaking minionese)

257
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,476
Yeah, I get it,

258
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,770
but I need a good night's
sleep, so get out.

259
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,107
Oh. (Speaking minionese)

260
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,526
Okay, fine, fine.

261
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,944
Because you had a nightmare.

262
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,237
Butjust tonight.

263
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,607
(Speaks minionese excitedly)

264
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,701
I'm not buying
the nightmare story, though.

265
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,790
Kevin: Excuse-a.

266
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,875
(Speaking minionese)

267
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,836
Oh, really? You, too?
Kevin: Mmm-hmm

268
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,920
get in.

269
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,466
Good night. Good night.

270
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,135
Yes, yes, yes. Good night.

271
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,804
Good night! (Gru exclaims)

272
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,597
(Sighs)

273
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,433
I just want to get some sleep.

274
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,271
(Chorus singing) Vnc

275
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,647
breaking news.

276
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,860
The vicious6 is ready to
rewrite the rules of villainy.

277
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,736
Villains of the world,

278
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,157
in three days, when the
clock strikes midnight

279
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,576
and the Chinese new year begins,

280
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,496
this bad boy's power
is gonna be unleashed.

281
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,040
With the power of the zodiac,

282
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,294
we're gonna take out
the anti-villain league.

283
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,214
And the viciouss will be

284
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:49,301
the most powerful villains
on the planet.

285
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,429
Can you dig it?

286
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,640
Do I dig it? Do I dig it?

287
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,976
I don't dig it.
There's nothing to dig.

288
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,270
They thought they could
leave me for dead, huh?

289
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,856
Kick me to the curb
like a piece of old meat?

290
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,442
Oh, they got no idea
what's coming.

291
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:06,735
Ha-ha!

292
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,737
Oh, I'm gonna make them suffer

293
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,381
for what they've done to me.
Mr. Knuckles?

294
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,115
Oh, boy. Hey, Mr. Knuckles.

295
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,200
What?

296
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,369
We just wanted to make sure
we'd be getting paid this week.

297
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,038
What a mouth on you.

298
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,706
I'm paying you with knowledge.

299
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,541
You are? (Exclaims)

300
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,794
Lesson one, always be prepared.

301
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,508
Lesson two, the Belgian
eyeball nose pick.

302
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:34,888
And lesson three,
the Lithuanian haircut.

303
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,598
(Screams)

304
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,980
(Laughs) That's worth
all the money in the world.

305
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,650
Hey, guys, forget about it.
You're gonna get paid.

306
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,486
But first, we got to
get my stone back.

307
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,198
I see a bad gru a-rising

308
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,578
I see a villain on his way

309
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,121
yee-haw!

310
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm gonna interview
with my heroes

311
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,964
they're going to love me
'cause I'm the best

312
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,842
don't mess up tonight

313
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,554
you're going to join
the vicious6, yeah

314
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,307
there is a bad gru on the rise

315
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,392
guys!

316
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,977
(Speaking minionese)

317
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,729
Oh, you want to come.

318
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,231
(Speaking minionese)
Stuart: Yeah.

319
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,067
Right, right. Okay.

320
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,235
(Sighs)

321
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:35,532
When you guys tracked me down
and responded to my "help wanted" ad...

322
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,370
I was like, "who are
these tiny tater tots?

323
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,414
"And where did they get
so much denim?"

324
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,254
(Minions shivering)

325
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,424
G ru: And you
just wouldn't quit.

326
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,680
(Minions shivering) (Sneezes)

327
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,607
(Sighs) All right,
I surrender. Come on in.

328
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,568
(Speaking minionese)
(Minions cheer)

329
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,826
We've had some
great times since then,

330
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,954
but the thing is, the vicious6,

331
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,456
they're the big leagues,

332
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:29,544
and you guys are great,

333
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,673
and so, the job you did
on the lair...

334
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,967
A-plus.

335
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,887
It's just...
What I was thinking is that

336
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,057
there are a lot of
other villains in the world.

337
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,141
You know?

338
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,145
(Speaking minionese)

339
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,564
(Groans) Never mind.

340
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,984
Look, I think I just need
to fly solo on this.

341
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,445
See you later, alligators.

342
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,576
Kevin? Kevin!
Oh... (Speaks minionese)

343
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,579
(Speaks minionese at Kevin)

344
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,747
(Sighs in exasperation)

345
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,544
Otto. Otto.

346
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,422
Hide and seek.

347
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,674
Hide and seek? Hide and seek.

348
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,135
(Speaks minionese excitedly)

349
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,520
Go, go, go!

350
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,610
Hey, I'm walking here!

351
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,571
Whoa!

352
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,450
Ooh.

353
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,535
Here we go.

354
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,453
(Driver exclaims)

355
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,376
That I love ya, ineed ya

356
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,670
I want ya
got to have you, child...

357
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,214
Excuse me. Sir?

358
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,298
(Growls)

359
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:01,678
I was just wondering
ifyou're no good.

360
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,096
(Growls)

361
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,265
Oh, you're good. My mistake.

362
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,308
(Exclaims)

363
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,687
Oh, oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

364
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,399
I was just trying out
this new invention of mine.

365
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,402
I call it sticky fingers.

366
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,404
Or smart goo.

367
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,198
I haven't quite landed
on the name yet.

368
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:23,825
Come here.

369
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:31,416
I overheard you were looking
for something... special.

370
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,751
Uh, yes. I was hoping...

371
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,629
You're no good.

372
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,423
(Laughs)

373
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:43,761
I think you'll enjoy
listening in booth three.

374
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,724
Right this way.

375
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,017
(Exclaims)

376
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,188
(Speaking minionese)

377
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,400
(Overlapping music playing)

378
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,402
Cat scratch fever...

379
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,573
This is it. Mum's the word.
Keep it down. Good luck.

380
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,991
Let 'em have it, son.

381
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,953
Thanks, mister... nefario.

382
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,081
That's Dr. Nefario.

383
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,000
Here, take this.

384
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:18,087
If you ever get famous, remember
who gave you your first gadget.

385
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,340
Okay.

386
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,097
Wouldn't blame him
if he said to me

387
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,058
you're no good you're no good

388
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,535
you're no good...
(Knocking at door)

389
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,811
Try backwards.

390
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,653
Distored voice:
Welcome to the vicious6.

391
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,532
That is pretty... whoa!

392
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,951
(Elevator bell rings)
(Gru grunts)

393
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,293
Hello.

394
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,927
Everybody here
for the interview?

395
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,346
Me, too.

396
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,350
So, what do you guys got going
on later? Are you up to no good?

397
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,019
You gonna get into
some mischief?

398
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,399
Okay.

399
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,985
Belle: Send the first one in.

400
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,195
They're ready to
see you, Mr. Gru.

401
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,322
Oh, good.

402
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,407
Great.

403
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,816
Distinguished villains,

404
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,110
my name is gr...

405
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:09,741
I feel like I'm talking too
loud even though our proximity

406
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:13,328
doesn't require
this kind of volume.

407
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,121
(Gru's voice echoing)

408
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:17,832
(Clears throat)

409
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,251
If you told me when I was ten

410
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,754
that I would have the chance
to fill the shoes

411
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,922
of my favorite villain ever,

412
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,383
wild knuckles, I would say,

413
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,469
"you got rocks in your head."

414
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,013
But now that I'm 11
and three quarters,

415
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,223
it makes a lot more sense.

416
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,934
All right, who let the kid in?

417
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:39,145
I thought he was a tiny man.

418
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,397
What's wrong with you?

419
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:46,653
You seriously think a puny
little child can be a villain?

420
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:50,448
Um, yes. I am pretty despicable.

421
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,367
You don't want to cross me.

422
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,620
Evil is for adults

423
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,582
who steal powerful ancient
stones and wreak havoc.

424
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,792
(Gasps)

425
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,586
And not for tubby little punks

426
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,173
who should be
at school, learning,

427
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,175
taking a recess,

428
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,802
sucking his thumb.

429
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,762
(All laughing) "Sucking his..."

430
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,642
Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

431
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,602
Who's next?

432
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:25,358
I am wing man, the next
member of the viciouso.

433
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,820
Behold, the power of flight!

434
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:31,906
(Exclaims)

435
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,783
All right, joke's over.

436
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,159
Showtime.

437
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,331
This is a big one. (Grunts)

438
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,503
Yeah, yeah. To the left.
That's right.

439
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,217
Bring him in,
bring him in, boys.

440
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,399
Everybody pile on!

441
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,194
(Gasps) He took the stone!

442
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,863
I'll get him!

443
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:14,907
(Gru exclaims)

444
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,162
Lock down the building.

445
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,167
(Gasps)

446
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,753
(Customers mumbling) What?

447
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:29,964
(Stammers)

448
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,591
Nothing to see here.

449
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:32,967
Look at you.

450
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,179
Frampton comes alive!
Nice choice. (Gasps)

451
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,185
Just keep walking.

452
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,571
Who the heck is that? A kid?

453
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,114
(Exclaims)

454
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,409
Oh, guys. Bello.

455
00:26:58,493 --> 00:26:59,577
Mini-boss!

456
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,454
What are you doing here?

457
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,080
(Speaking minionese)

458
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,624
Okay, just get on.

459
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,877
Which way did he go?
There's that little thief!

460
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,212
Go! Go, go, go!

461
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,047
Split up!

462
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,523
Knock, knock. Delivery.

463
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:29,649
(Grunts)

464
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,443
(Speaking minionese)

465
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,079
That demon child! (Yells)

466
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,790
Otto, take the stone back
to the lair. I'll distract them.

467
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,500
Go! Go, go, go!

468
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,302
Gru: Ugh, not now.

469
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,304
Come on, come on!
(Minion screaming)

470
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,607
(Yelling in slow motion)

471
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,445
(Screams)

472
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,658
Yeah, baby.

473
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,496
I'll handle this.

474
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,291
(Laughs)

475
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,463
Hope you enjoy
the rest of your short life.

476
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,758
Please work.
Come on, come on, come on!

477
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,346
(Yelling)

478
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,482
We're coming for you, tiny man.

479
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:55,985
Yeah! Yeah!

480
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,445
(All cheering)

481
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,492
(Minions cheering)
Josh, pump it up.

482
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,619
Up, up, up!

483
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,913
All the young dudes

484
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,372
hey, dudes!

485
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,166
Carry the news...

486
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,045
They all said the kid couldn't
be a real villain.

487
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,504
Well...

488
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,382
This kid just stole something

489
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,802
from the worst villains
in the world.

490
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,016
When I bring it back to them,
they are going to say,

491
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:31,228
(gasps) "We have made
a terrible mistake.

492
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,731
"Pleasejoin us. Please, gru."

493
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,192
And I will say, "yes!

494
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,488
"I will be the newest member
of the vicious6."

495
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,616
Now all I need is Otto.

496
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,992
Where is Otto?

497
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,452
Otto le come-ay.

498
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,037
No, not "Otto le come-ay."

499
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,830
He needs to "come-ay" now.

500
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,290
(Muffled yelling)

501
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,504
Otto! Mini-boss!

502
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,631
There you are.

503
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,967
Oh, you got it?

504
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,177
(Speaking minionese)

505
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:08,432
Is this... are you pulling
on my legs right now?

506
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,643
Otto, where is the stone?

507
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:18,025
(Otto speaks minionese)

508
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,248
Over there.

509
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,668
(Yells)

510
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,253
Oh, no!

511
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,255
(Speaking minionese)

512
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,601
(All cheering)

513
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:01,723
(Otto speaks minionese lovingly)

514
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:09,660
I love you.

515
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,631
(Speaking minionese)

516
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,513
Did you just trade my future

517
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,515
for a pet rock?

518
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:33,809
Si?

519
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:38,022
Oh... okay. Otto, where was
this birthday party?

520
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,441
(Speaking minionese)

521
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,071
This is unacceptable.
Unacceptable!

522
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:48,866
I told you guys that you
weren't ready for the big leagues,

523
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,576
and you have proven me correct.

524
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,286
(Otto speaks minionese)

525
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,830
All you do
is mess everything up.

526
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,249
Up? Pump it up!

527
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,876
Do a little dance
make a little love

528
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,586
(groans in frustration)

529
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,092
My mom was right.

530
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,135
You do not belong here.

531
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,096
You're fired!

532
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,850
I'm going to find that stone.

533
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,436
When I get home,
you all better be gone.

534
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,800
Mini-boss...
(Speaking minionese)

535
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,440
And, Otto, close your yapper!

536
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:25,986
Josh.

537
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,488
Si, si.

538
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,534
(Song playing)
I'll say goodbye to love

539
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:35,913
no one ever cared
if I should live or die

540
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,499
gru. (Speaking minionese)
Por favor. Por favor.

541
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,543
Time and time again

542
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:41,877
Kevin, no.

543
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,130
I will be better off on my own.

544
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:49,093
And all I know of love is
how to live without it

545
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:53,055
I just can't seem to find it

546
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:56,475
so I've made my mind up

547
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,770
I must live my life alone

548
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:05,693
and though it's not the easy
way I guess I've always known

549
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:09,655
I'd say goodbye to love

550
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:16,036
there are no tomorrows
for this heart of mine

551
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,290
surely time will lose
these bitter memories

552
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:20,708
(screaming)

553
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,751
And I'll find that there is

554
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:27,256
someone to believe in
and to live for

555
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,133
mini-boss!

556
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,553
Oh, no.

557
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,350
I'm sorry. I thought
you'd be impressed.

558
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,769
Could I just speak
to belle bottom? She'll...

559
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,195
Wild knuckles! (Exclaims)

560
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,322
You're alive?

561
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:55,492
Wow, my favorite villain
is also my kidnapper?

562
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:59,038
This could be a great
opportunity if you don't kill me.

563
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,873
Shut up and give me the stone.

564
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,667
Oh, yes, the stone.

565
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:06,003
Here's the thing about that.

566
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,421
Kind of a funny story.

567
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,714
Give it to him!

568
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,638
And it's all going to go south

569
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,015
very quickly.

570
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,269
What the heck is this?

571
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,113
(Gru screams)

572
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,245
Where is it, boy?

573
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,747
I don't have it!
I don't have it!

574
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,249
I know you're
hiding it somewhere.

575
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,959
I'm not. I'm not. I swear.

576
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,670
Cross my heart and hope to
die, stick a needle in my eye.

577
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,088
Don't actually do that, though.

578
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,756
Somebody bring me a phone.

579
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,261
Call home.

580
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,679
It's ransom time.

581
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:00,474
No, no, no. My mom will
probably pay you to keep me!

582
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,642
(Laughs)

583
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,686
Good one. Call!

584
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:23,372

585
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,581

Bello. La casa de mini-boss.

Who is this? Kevin.

592
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:41,932
Kevin, le Minion.

593
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,350
"Kevin ie" what?

594
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,227
Le Minion. You kidding me?

595
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,770
You got henchmen? (Chuckles)

596
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,024
Well, that's the end of that.
Mini-boss?

597
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:53,235
Listen, you, bring the stone
to me in San Francisco.

598
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,155
6830 green street. Got it?

599
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,366
Now, you got two days,
or you are never going to see

600
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,327
your little boss again.

601
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,536

Okay. Go, go, go.

618
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,460
They're going through
a tight wind

619
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,879
the kids are losing their minds

620
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:55,506
the blitzkrieg bop

621
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,842

(Speaking minionese)

623
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,722

Oh!

Let's rock and roll.

00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,925
Time to get our stone back.

643
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,720
We're coming for you, Mr. Gru.

644
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,555

No problemo.

Oh, great.

You know, if you have any hair
balls, we can upgrade you to first class.

Woman: Get out.

659
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,701
Man: So there I was. We
lost thrust in both engines,

660
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,745
and I had to turn back
at laguardia.

661
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,996
(All laughing)

662
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,790
Ooh-ia-la.

Hey, Sally. Hey.

You got real moxie, kid,
stealing from the viciouso.

I got moxie, really? (Gasps)

698
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,164
Did I just receive a
compliment from wild knuckles?

699
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,459
Oh, all my dreams
are coming true right now!

Your minions better get here
by sundown tomorrow,

because if 48 hours of disco
don't kill you...

00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:14,986
Hey, hey. Look-a.

737
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,201
Come-ay! Come-ay!

738
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,670
More, more, more

739
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:32,879
Kevin: Mini-boss.

740
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:34,840
(All grunting)

741
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:38,718
(Yells)

742
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:40,762
Stuart.

743
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,849
Mini-boss. No, no, no.

744
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,600
Okay, okay.

745
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:08,039
Okay. Go, go, go.

746
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,880
Hey. Go, go, go.

747
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:21,720
Hey, wait a minute.

748
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:23,889
Bello.

749
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,390
Oh, no! Bob! (Stuart growling)

750
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,768
(Minions shouting)

751
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:29,936
(Yells)

752
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,732
Trespassers! Get 'em!

753
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,150
Hey, you. Come back here!

754
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:39,321
Go, go!

755
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,249
Kevin! Oh, okay. (Laughs)

756
00:45:58,924 --> 00:45:59,925
(Speaking minionese)

757
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,728
Get your little butts back here!

758
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:22,197
Okay, now, you might feel
a little pinch.

759
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,205
Got you now.

760
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:33,625
Time to break some bones.

761
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,876
(Yells)

762
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:38,755
(Muffled exclaiming)

763
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,300
Any plans for the weekend?

764
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:47,639
(Sighs)

765
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,184
Take five deep breaths.

766
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,727
I'll be right back.

767
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,730
(Minions grunting) Hey!

768
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:58,316
You like picking on
little guys, huh?

769
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,818
Go take a nap, old lady.

770
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:00,902
(All laughing)

771
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,320
Old lady?

772
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:09,703
Hi-ya! (Groans)

773
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:15,583
I am a master of the ancient
Shaolin art of kung fu.

774
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:16,710
(Gasps)

775
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:22,590
(Henchmen grunting)

776
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,515
Huh? (Grunts)

777
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,439
Ha! (Grunts)

778
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:45,071
(Exclaims)

779
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,325
Get lost!

780
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,912
(Minions laughing)

781
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,875
If you come back to our place,
you're dead.

782
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,627
Come-ay. (Speaking minionese)

783
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,049
Pank you.

784
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,133
Pank you...

785
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:09,721
Shh, shh, shh. You can
thank me by going away.

786
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,056
I'm working.

787
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:13,641
(Speaking minionese) Kung fu...

788
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:16,061
You want to learn kung fu?

789
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:18,396
Ah, Kevin.

790
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:20,940
Bello, chica.

791
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:23,526
(Speaking minionese)
Kung fu por smoochie, smoochie?

792
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,445
Hmm, hmm?

793
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:29,824
(Exclaims)

794
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:32,619
My teaching days are over.

795
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,996
This is my life now.

796
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:40,001
(Speaking minionese)

797
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:43,088
Kung fu para...
Para save-a le mini-boss.

798
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:44,964
Por favor.

799
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:51,137
(Minions whimpering)

800
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:54,682
Ay-ya. Fine.

801
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,267
I will teach you.

802
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:58,103
(Minions cheering)

803
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:04,234
Those are not for you.
Excuse-a, excuse-a.

804
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:07,320
The name of the game is sell,
sell, sell!

805
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:11,950
(Speaking minionese)

806
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,535
(Tupperware makes fart sounds)

807
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,912
(Minions laughing)
(Fart sounds continue)

808
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,331
(Minions singing in tune
with fart sounds)

809
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:19,791
(All exclaiming)

810
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:22,710
What?

811
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,051
(Villains yelling)

812
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,305
Where's gru?

813
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,890
Ah, how should I know?

814
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,267
What's with the costumes?

815
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,145
Halloween was four months ago.
You look stupid.

816
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,063
Buzz off. Shoo!

817
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,732
I'm getting my meat tenderizer.

818
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,609
Let me help you
with that, dearie.

819
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,654
Gru's mom: Don't touch me.
Now, where's the boy?

820
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,823
(Speaking minionese)

821
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,159
Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.

822
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:57,036
Don't worry.
We're not mad at him.

823
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,580
We just want to...

824
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,582
Hire him.

825
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,168
(Speaking minionese)

826
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,669
Where is he?

827
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,297
Wild knuckles, San pan-pisco.

828
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,007
Wild knuckles is alive?

829
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,801
And working with the kid. Hmm.

830
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,262
We're going to San Francisco.

831
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:15,972
(All laughing) Let's hit it.

832
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:24,522
You had better be paying
for my roof.

833
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,274
Minions: Ay-yi-yi.

834
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,613
Pretty groovy, huh?
(Minions exclaiming)

835
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:39,162
We begin with a basic kick.

836
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,623
(Yells) Now you.

837
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:43,499
(Minions yell)

838
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,295
Okay.

839
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,379
No kicking.

840
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:51,299
This is a melon hammer.
It's a weapon.

841
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,968
This is Fred. He is a dummy.

842
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,804
Never underestimate a dummy.

843
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,182
Ha. Dummy. Bello, Fred.

844
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,266
Now attack!

845
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,810
(Yelling)

846
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:11,319
(Minion cheering)
Stuart! Stuart! Woo-hoo!

847
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:20,745
(Mutters)

848
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:22,789
Fred.

849
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:26,668
Doubt tells me I cannot break
this wood.

850
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,463
But doubt exists only
in the mind.

851
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,882
You know what I say to my mind?

852
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:34,717
(Exclaims)

853
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,011
Now you.

854
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:42,642
(Exclaims)

855
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,144
(Yells)

856
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:46,396
(Groans)

857
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,148
(Sighs) Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

858
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:54,737
(Minions exclaiming)

859
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:01,327
(Speaking minionese)

860
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,461
Okay. Clearly, we are not
ready for philosophy.

861
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:11,921
Let's just train.

862
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:15,758
(Minions exclaiming)

863
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,033
(Funky music playing
from boombox)

864
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:26,269
A-won't you take me to funkytown

865
00:52:26,436 --> 00:52:27,478
(music from boombox ends)

866
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,188
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay, okay.

867
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:33,568
Ya... ya... ya...

868
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,753
(Music from boombox resumes)
Yeah!

869
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,321
Town won't you take me to

870
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,447
yeah!

871
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,906
(Minions grunting)

872
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,329
(Minions screaming)

873
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:45,997
(Music from boombox ends)

874
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,667
Rest up.

875
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:53,046
Tomorrow's going to be
even worse.

876
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:55,733
Wild knuckles: What,
you're quitting?

877
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:59,510
I told you, when I get that stone,
we're gonna be unstoppable.

878
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,262
I have had enough!

879
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:03,848
There's nothing sadder
than an aging villain.

880
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,683
So long, old man!

881
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:08,186
Guys, come on. We're a team.

882
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:09,312
(Door slams)

883
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:13,483
(Muffled disco music playing)

884
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,985
More, more, more

885
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:17,070
how do you like...

886
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:18,154
(Disco music ends)

887
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,447
(Sings) How do you like it?

888
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,531
How do you like...

889
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,201
Is this heaven?

890
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,161
I just had to fire my henchmen.

891
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:28,456
You know why? 'Cause they
weren't getting the job done.

892
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:31,876
Okay, I'm just gonna untie you
now because I...

893
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,962
I need you to do some stuff
for me around the house.

894
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:38,508
And it might be, you know,
kind of nice to have

895
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,009
a little company around here.

896
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:44,972
Oh, yeah. Two villains just
doing some chores.

897
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:47,558
Who knows what kind of trouble
we could get into?

898
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,352
(Chuckles, grunts)

899
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,896
What's that?
That's your evil chuckle?

900
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,607
Obviously. Well, it stinks.

901
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,943
You sound like a clown
who swallowed a kazoo.

902
00:53:57,026 --> 00:54:01,280
Really? Well, you look like a wizard
going through an end-of—life crisis.

903
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:04,117
(Grunts)
Easy there, Don rickles.

904
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,868
Gru: Who's Don rickles?

905
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:10,540
Otto: Stone-a.

906
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:13,626
Stone-a.

907
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,256
Stone-a!

908
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,386
Stone-a...

909
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:30,059
Dude. (Laughs)

910
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,019
I thought we lost you
there for a minute.

911
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,647
(Speaking minionese)
Hey, chi”, chi”, chi”...

912
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:37,942
Hey, you want to try this on,
little dude?

913
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,736
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

914
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:42,613
La stone-a!

915
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,908
Hey, hey, hey, soul brother,
where you jettin' off to?

916
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,910
(Speaking minionese)
San pan-pisco.

917
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,912
Frisco disco!

918
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,915
It's your lucky day, kid.
I'm headed up the coast.

919
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,542
I could drop you off on the way.

920
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:58,129
Yee-haw! (Cheers)

921
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:04,760
(Speaking minionese)

922
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,137
Ia stone-a!

923
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,638
Oh, look-a!

924
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:15,688
(Speaking minionese) Hey.

925
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:17,064
(Laughs)

926
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,781
Hey, yo, hermano!

927
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,200
(Horn blares)

928
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,286
(Mimics horn blaring)

929
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:33,664
(Laughs)

930
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,965
Start with the pool.

931
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,717
This place has got to be
spick-and-span.

932
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,801
What are you doing?

933
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:49,388
You look like the overcooked Turkey
my mom makes on Thanksgiving.

934
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,517
(Screams) Oh, god.

935
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,019
Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention,

936
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:58,272
the pool is filled
with my pet crocodiles.

937
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:03,277
Yeah, well, well,
doesn't scare me.

938
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:08,282
Be careful. I can't have you
lose an arm,

939
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:11,035
because I need you to change
some light bulbs after this.

940
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,871
Here, let me show you
how it's done.

941
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,750
Betsy, knock it off.

942
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,921
(Grunts) Oh, no.

943
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,176
Marvin, no, no. Stop that.

944
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,886
(Wild knuckles yelling)

945
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,721
(Exclaims) Help! Oh, no.

946
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,265
The net!

947
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,060
I got you! Lgotyou!

948
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,688
I don't got you.

949
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,401
Take my hand.

950
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:47,363
I got you!

951
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:49,949
(Both grunt)

952
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,123
Vvhoa.vvhoa. (Gru panting)

953
00:56:57,665 --> 00:57:00,710
You could've run, but you,
but you didn't.

954
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:04,714
I told you, you are my
favorite villain in the world.

955
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:08,050
I could not let you
get eaten by crocodiles.

956
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:11,012
Even though that would've been
kind of cool to watch.

957
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,266
So... so you want to be
a great villain, huh?

958
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,436
(Gasps) That's all
I ever wanted.

959
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:20,605
You want... I don't know, you
want me...

960
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,608
You want me to teach you
a thing or two?

961
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,318
Mmm-hmm!

962
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:29,655
Master chow: Many fighters
have asked me,

963
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:33,242
how did I become a great master?

964
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:34,577
Hey, look-a!

965
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:49,133
Even the smallest of us
are capable of great things.

966
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,469
You just dig down deep,

967
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:54,472
find your inner beast, and...

968
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:56,182
(Roars)

969
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:01,854
Gesundheit?

970
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,898
Now you try.

971
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:07,860
(Roars)

972
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:09,153
(Coughs)

973
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:10,905
(Blows raspberry)

974
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:14,367
(Roars weakly)

975
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,160
(Sighs)

976
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:22,166
Find your inner beast!

977
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,503
Stop this kick.

978
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,421
(Grunts)

979
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,006
(Yells)

980
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:35,096
We have a lot more work to do.

981
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:39,016
(All exclaiming)

982
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,694
(Speaking minionese)

983
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,130
(Laughs, yells)

984
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,983
(Speaking minionese)

985
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:39,493
(Exclaims)

986
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,830
(Minions exclaiming)

987
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:48,377
Kevin, Stuart and Bob,
you are ready.

988
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,963
(Minions cheering)

989
00:59:52,173 --> 00:59:53,632
No, no, no, no, no!

990
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:56,927
Ready for yourjunior kung fu
achievement badges.

991
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:58,387
(Sighs)

992
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,805
They're dead.

993
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,105
First rule of heists,
always stay in character.

994
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:09,940
Got it, grandpa.

995
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:15,362
Say, do you mind if we
use thejohn?

996
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:18,699
Poindexter here can't
hold it in till we get home.

997
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:35,466
Gru: The bank of evil.

998
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,270
It's showtime, kid.

999
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:50,731
Follow my lead, and don't
forget your cue.

1000
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,069
Hello. I... I just need
to cash this.

1001
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:58,113
Wowie zowie! What a big bank.

1002
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,825
How many security guards
are in here?

1003
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,159
Who's this little guy?

1004
01:01:02,243 --> 01:01:05,246
Well, that's my grandson,
who still has not learned

1005
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:08,165
that children should be seen
and not heard.

1006
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,042
(Laughs) Kids.

1007
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,086
I actually have a son of my own.

1008
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,463
Ugh. He looks weird.

1009
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:16,382
Oh, ho-ho! Don't listen to him.

1010
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:19,385
Your son is very, uh... cute.

1011
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,973
(Yells) Oh, no!

1012
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:28,519
Oh, help! I'm seeing
a white light.

1013
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:31,647
Helen, I'm coming for ya!

1014
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,819
Helen, I'm coming for ya.

1015

Oh. Help!

1016
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:41,115
(G roans) Help my pop-pop!

1017
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,367
Somebody help him!

1018
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,287
My grandpa!

1019
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,538
Man: We need a doctor!

1020
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:49,790
This is the big one.

1021
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:51,834
(Groans, yells)

1022
01:01:53,586 --> 01:01:55,045
Wild knuckles: You hear that?

1023
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:57,298
It's the sweet sound of angels.

1024
01:01:58,757 --> 01:01:59,842
Help!

1025
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,886
Do something!

1026
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:04,305
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

1027
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,194
No, no, no. The other way.

1028
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:20,321
The other way.

1029
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:24,074
(Exclaims)

1030
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,493
All right, everyone stand back.

1031
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:28,329
Uh-oh.

1032
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:29,955
Clear! No, wait a minute. Wait.

1033
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,917
(Exclaims painfully)

1034
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,919
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

1035
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:36,712
No, no, no, I'm feeling better.

1036
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:37,880
Clear!

1037
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:39,340
(Exclaims painfully)

1038
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,383
Maximum charge.

1039
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:43,177
Clear! Thank you.

1040
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,304
You saved my grandpa.

1041
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:48,641
Did we... did we do the heist?

1042
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,977
Grandpas say
the darndest things.

1043
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,021
You dropped these.

1044
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,357
(Wild knuckles groans)

1045
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,069
Look what I got!

1046
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:02,112
Hey.notbad.

1047
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:03,364
Not bad at all.

1048
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:04,990
We make a good team.

1049
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,283
We do?

1050
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,994
Oh, yeah. Hey,
we got to keep at it.

1051
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,847
Wait till you see
what I'm gonna teach you next.

1052
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,082
I cannot wait.

1053
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,167
Wild knuckles: Oh,
this is gonna be fun.

1054
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,134
(Mimic martial arts noises)

1055
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:30,140
(Speaking minionese)

1056
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,485
(Yells)

1057
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,698
Hoo! Mini-boss!

1058
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:46,907
Okay, Stuart...

1059
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:48,071
Bob... (Speaking minionese)

1060
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:50,244
Time to strike!

1061
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,291
Mini-boss! (Speaking minionese)

1062
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,471
(Mechanical laughter)

1063
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:13,392
(Yells)

1064
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,485
(Yells) They're not here.

1065
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:25,195
Fan out and find them.

1066
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,498
(Speaking minionese)

1067
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:43,881
Something big's
going down in frisco.

1068
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:45,507
Oh! Look-a.

1069
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:48,677
(Fireworks exploding)

1070
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:55,350
Biker: Whoo, there it is.

1071
01:04:55,476 --> 01:04:57,311
(Speaking minionese)

1072
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:01,315
It's been one heck of a ride,
little man.

1073
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,691
Oh, dude.

1074
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:05,569
You know, I'm gonna miss you.

1075
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,362
(Speaking minionese)

1076
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,698
Hey, soul brother, good luck!

1077
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:15,913
(Funky music playing)

1078
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:24,296
(Speaking minionese)

1079
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:28,967
Ooh.

1080
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:32,763
(Stammers, yells)

1081
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,350
My friend, you're now gonna
learn from the old school.

1082
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,977
(Both gasp)

1083
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,191
Oh, no.

1084
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:04,044
I can't believe they
did this to me!

1085
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,339
I taught them everything
they know!

1086
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,133
We were a team!

1087
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:12,553
(Sighs) I give up.

1088
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:18,517
Hey, you are a great bad guy,

1089
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:20,853
and they are stupid idiots.

1090
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,607
Only dream I ever had was
doing bad stuff with my buddies.

1091
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:29,486
Now look at me. Old, alone.

1092
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,656
Well, you are old,

1093
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,408
but you're not alone.

1094
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,410
(Groans)

1095
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,495
All right.

1096
01:06:38,871 --> 01:06:40,289
Listen up, buster.

1097
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:43,167
We are starting a new team,

1098
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,211
and it's going to be called
the terrible twos.

1099
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:48,951
We can find a better name later,

1100
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:52,551
but right now
we're going to find that stone

1101
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,470
and show everybody that you
still got it.

1102
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,473
Come on.
You're just a little kid.

1103
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:01,018
It's over. Go home.

1104
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:03,312
But you said we... gohome!

1105
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,560
(Crowd clamoring)

1106
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:45,187
Come on, come on. Let's go!

1107
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,731
(Otto exclaiming,
speaking minionese)

1108
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,567
Vvhoa, hey!

1109
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:52,444
Otto?

1110
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:58,408
Otto!

1111
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,744
Yee-haw! (Laughs) Otto!

1112
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,376
Otto! It's mini-boss!

1113
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:09,086
(Exclaims) Mini-boss!

1114
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:11,546
(Laughs triumphantly)

1115
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,590
Mini-boss! Otto!

1116
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:16,927
Otto: Look-a! Look-a!

1117
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:19,054
(Speaking minionese) Stone-a.

1118
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:21,223
You found the stone.

1119
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,225
Otto, I'm so proud of you.

1120
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:24,810
(Stammers)

1121
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:27,020
All right, we don't have
much time.

1122
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,744
We got to get this to
wild knuckles. Okay.

1123
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:30,232
Okay. (Gasps)

1124
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:31,483
Get him!

1125
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:36,238
(Nun-Chuck exclaims)

1126
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:38,865
(Gru and Otto scream)
Go, go, go!

1127
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:41,785
(Yells)

1128
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:44,621
Long time, no see, punk.

1129
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:48,875
I'll take that.

1130
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:51,044
(Laughs)

1131
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:54,298
Yes!

1132
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:56,925
Don't move!

1133
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,635
Right there! Freeze!

1134
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,053
Anti-villain league.

1135
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:01,972
You are under arrest.

1136
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:04,683
Oh, phew. (Speaking minionese)

1137
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,396
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody.

1138
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,773
Did you forget what time it is?

1139
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:13,984
(Bell rings)

1140
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:27,664
Happy new year!

1141
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,916
(Laughs maniacally)

1142
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,212
Fire!

1143
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:39,676
(Roars)

1144
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:45,098
(Laughs evilly)

1145
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:49,686
(Laughs and roars)

1146
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,481
(Groans)

1147
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:55,317
(Speaking minionese)

1148
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:57,110
Stand your ground.

1149
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:00,614
Look out!

1150
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,619
(Growls) (Screams)

1151
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:07,704
(All screaming)

1152
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:10,582
(Laughs)

1153
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:13,627
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1154
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,045
no, no, no, no, no! (Screaming)

1155
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,673
Where do you think
you're going? Hmm?

1156
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:22,677
You stole from us,
and now you're gonna pay!

1157
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,137
(Yells)

1158
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:31,728
Enjoy being torn apart.

1159
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:34,022
Hey! (Speaking minionese)
Mini-boss!

1160
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:35,190
Guys!

1161
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:38,944
Oh. Why don't we
make this a fair fight?

1162
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:40,821
(Laughs)

1163
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,949
(Minions laughing)

1164

(Crows)

1166
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,499
Oh, you thought I was serious.
(Laughs)

1167
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,084
Run!

1168
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:56,044
(Minions exclaiming)

1169
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,798
No! (Yells)

1170
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:04,678
Hello, traitors.

1171
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:05,846
(Gasps)

1172
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,889
Remember me?

1173
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:10,767
You.

1174
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:14,396
You can leave me for dead,
you can destroy everything I own,

1175
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:17,441
but I will not let you
hurt that kid!

1176
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,818
So you're gonna save the kid?

1177
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,112
(Laughs) Yeah,
you and what army?

1178
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,948
(Minions yelling) This army!

1179
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,033
Okay. This army.

1180
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,541
(Grimaces)

1181
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,426

(Yells)

1188
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,680
Master chow: Dig down deep.

1189
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:33,308
Find your inner beast.

1190
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,685
(Roars)

1191
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:52,244

(Groans)

1194
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:02,462
(Groaning)

1195
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:04,839
(Hisses)

1196
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:11,137
(Cheeping)

1197

(Gru yelling)

1200
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:30,615
(Yells in pain)

1201
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:32,742
(Wild knuckles yells)

1202
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,509
(Groans)

1203
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:52,596
Otto!

1204
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:55,307
Hurry! Faster!

1205
01:13:57,684 --> 01:13:59,936
(Roars)

1206
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:03,648

(Yells)

1208
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:08,612
Got you.

1209
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,284
Go, go, go!

1210
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:21,541
(Gasps)

1211
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,211
Ha-ha!

1212
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,547
(Exclaims) No.

1213
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:34,012
(Wild knuckles grunts)

1214
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:38,892
Get away from him!

1215
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,477
Destroy the kid.

1216
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,940
(Minions roaring)

1217
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,655
Oh!

1218
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,202
(Laughs triumphantly)

1219
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:07,128
Hey, hey. How does it feel to
be beaten by a tubby little punk?

1220
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:08,546
(Laughs)

1221
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,927
You guys were amazing!

1222
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,680
The kung fu...
Where did that come from?

1223
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:19,265
Obviously, you guys are rehired.

1224
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:24,604
Stuart! (Speaking minionese)

1225
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:29,025
(All laughing)

1226
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:41,329
(Chittering)

1227
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,333
Man: It's all yours, sir.

1228
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:46,960
Woman: Where do you want it?

1229
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,837
Woman: Can you feel this, sir?
Right here.

1230
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:52,924
Oh, no. Wild knuckles.

1231
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:56,010
(Coughs)

1232
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,595
Hey.

1233
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,639
You're gonna be okay, right?

1234
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:01,433
Don't worry about me, kid.

1235
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,226
I'll be fine.

1236
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:04,936
Finally.

1237
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:08,398
You're going away for a long,
long time.

1238
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,276
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't bet on it.

1239
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:15,739
See you soon, kiddo.

1240
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:40,680
(Minions singing softly)

1241
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:51,024
(Clears throat)

1242
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,611
Wild knuckles
was my favorite villain.

1243
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:59,073
We didn't have
much time together,

1244
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:00,950
but the time we did have,

1245
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:03,369
I'm so grateful for.

1246
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:07,457
I've been thinking about
how you won't see me grow up

1247
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:11,878
or be there for all the terrible
things that I'm going to do.

1248
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:16,090
And believe me, there are gonna
be some awful things. (Crying)

1249
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:25,767
Ahem.

1250
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,311
But I'm going to make you proud.

1251
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:33,107
I'm going to be the best
villain ever because of you.

1252
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:37,028
Because you taught me
what matters.

1253
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,656
You can't do anything alone.

1254
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:42,992
Find yourtribe,

1255
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:46,996
and never, ever let them go.

1256
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,123
Otto?

1257
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:57,006
(Singing)

1258
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:06,724
(Minions clamoring)

1259
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:24,158
(Continues singing)

1260
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:29,956
(Minions singing)

1261
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,046
You better
stay out of trouble, kid.

1262
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:41,467
I will lead
a good and honest life.

1263
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:42,844
(Chuckles)

1264
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:45,388
(Gasps) You're alive?

1265
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:46,931
Oh!

1266
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:50,602
You just blew my mind.

1267
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:52,729
How did you do that? (Laughs)

1268
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:57,400
I cannot wait to fake my own
death to avoid the authorities.

1269
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:59,152
Shoot for the moon, kid.

1270
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,486
Shoot for the moon.

1271
01:19:01,905 --> 01:19:04,782
(Chuckles)
See you later, suckers!

1272
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:06,618
(All cheering)

1273
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:10,371
You can't always get
what you want

1274
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:14,167
you can't always get
what you want

1275
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:19,297
you can't always get
what you want

1276
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:22,425
but if you try sometime

1277
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:25,386
you just might find
you just might find

1278
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,889
you get what you need

1279
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:29,849
ah, yeah

1280
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,309
ah, yeah

1281
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:38,066
Sorry, we're closed.

1282
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,567
Oh!

1283
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,487
I just wanted
to thank you for this.

1284
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,405
Worked like a charm.

1285
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,532
All right, let me
out to the chase here.

1286
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:48,826
I need a genius mad scientist.

1287
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,328
You want to come work for me?

1288
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,538
No, I am done with villainy.

1289
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:54,874
Off to happier horizons.

1290
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:57,126
Goodbye, little chap.

1291
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,170
Por favor.

1292
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:05,426
(Minions whimpering)

1293
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:09,639
(Cheeps)

1294
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:12,225
Oh, all right, all right.

1295
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,394
Fine. Stop with the face.

1296
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:15,561
I'm in.

1297
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:18,272
Want to see something cool?

1298
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:27,782
Oh, are you kidding me?

1299
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,081
(Gru laughing)

1300
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,418
Minions: Big boss! Big boss!
Big boss! Big boss!

1301
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,503
Gru: "Big boss." I like that.

1302
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,592
(Song playing)
We can make it further

1303
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:49,262
we running and don't look back

1304
01:20:49,387 --> 01:20:51,389
it's a light at the end
of the tunnel

1305
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,891
if you stay on track

1306
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:57,186
but I know any minute when
your fingers turn it up like snap

1307
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:59,313
so hard to lose like that

1308
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:00,815
hey, let's do it

1309
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:04,235
all around the world

1310
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,279
we gotta turn up the sunshine

1311
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:08,614
we gotta turn up the sunshine

1312
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,824
think about it

1313
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,869
all the boys and girls

1314
01:21:12,994 --> 01:21:15,163
you gotta turn up the sunshine

1315
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:17,373
you gotta turn up the sunshine

1316
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:21,753
said it's been a
long night, long night

1317
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:25,590
waiting for the light
waiting for the light

1318
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:27,133
let's do it

1319
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:30,386
all around the world

1320
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,430
we gotta turn up the sunshine

1321
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:34,182
we gotta turn it up

1322
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:36,309
make it hard to lose like that

1323
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:39,520
if this weather makes you frown

1324
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:43,024
and some people get you down

1325
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:44,484
remember

1326
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:48,362
love, like sound

1327
01:21:48,488 --> 01:21:52,325
it's better when it's loud

1328
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:57,330
and if there's no song inside

1329
01:21:57,455 --> 01:22:01,876
we can bring the light together

1330
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:06,005
day or night

1331
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:10,301
we 're shining from inside

1332
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,845
turn up the, turn it up

1333
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,014

1334
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:17,266

Gotta make a move to a town
that's right for me

1353
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:16,075
time to keep me movin'

1354

Feeling better

now that we 're through

1379
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:25,579
feeling better
'cause I'm over you

1380
01:25:25,705 --> 01:25:30,418
I learned my lesson
and it left a scar

1381
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:34,380
now I see how you really are

1382
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:36,507
you're no good you're no good

1383
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,009
you're no good

1384
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:41,012
baby, you're no good

1385
01:25:41,137 --> 01:25:43,472
I'm gonna say it again

you're no good you're no good

1387
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,226
you're no good

1388
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:50,354
baby, you're no good

1389
01:25:53,357 --> 01:25:57,486
I broke a heart
that's gentle and true

1390
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:02,033
well, I broke a heart
over someone like you

1391
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:07,038
I'll beg his forgiveness
on bended knee

1392
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:10,958
I wouldn't blame him
if he said to me

1393
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,252
you're no good you're no good

1394
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:14,712
you're no good

baby, you're no good

1400
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:50,081
I'm turning you down, baby
and I'm going my way

1401
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:54,585
forget about you, baby
'cause I'm leaving to stay

01:27:10,101 --> 01:27:12,561
oh, oh, no

01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:15,106
you're no good you're no good

1411
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:16,524
you're no good

1412
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:20,111
baby, you're no good
