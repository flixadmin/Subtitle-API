475
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,799
I've been going over the data. I don't know
why the containment system failed.

476
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,926
I must have missed something.

477
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,347
-I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault, Cisco.

478
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,517
But if you both feel a need
to apologize for something...

479
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,854
...you might start with not telling me
that Ronnie is still alive.

480
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,816
I asked Cisco not to say anything.

481
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:57,238
Once I saw what Ronnie had become,
I needed...

482
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,576
I needed time to see
if I could make him whole again.

483
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,121
-I'm sorry. I know you're mad.
-No.

484
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,833
I don't know what I would have
done differently in your situation.

485
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,922
I know I've made you a lot of promises.

486
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,758
I know I've not been able to keep them all.

487
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,762
But on my life, I promise you this:

488
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,182
We will bring Ronnie home.

489
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,357
JOE:
Hey, Bar.

490
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,821
You know, my mom traveled
around the world twice.

491
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,700
She spent a semester abroad in Spain.

492
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:46,413
She loved it so much
that after she graduated she went to Europe.

493
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,834
Didn't stop till she'd been
to a few dozen other cities.

494
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,297
She always wanted to go back,
but she never got a chance.

495
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,301
I offered to send you abroad
when you were in college.

496
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,639
Yeah, I know, I remember.

497
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,559
I couldn't take off.

498
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,312
I mean, the truth is...

499
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,107
...I'm stuck here...

500
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,526
...in Central City.

501
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:22,240
Fear has kept me in that living room
for 14 years.

502

[SIGHS]

503
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,413
Joe, I'm...

504
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,833
I was mad at you for being scared.

505
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,377
But...

506
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,882
...I mean, the truth is,
I was the one that was scared.

507
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:44,262
I've been afraid of the man in yellow for...

508
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,306
...my whole life.

509
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,350
That's why I lost.

510
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,648
When you first moved in with us,
I thought it was gonna be too much.

511
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,943
I'm already a single dad...

512
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,822
...finances were tough, and you were
a little boy who just lost his mother.

513
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,658
[CHUCKLING]
But, man, was I wrong.

514
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,912
Within two weeks you had changed
the dynamic of the house.

515
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,664
Suddenly the house was filled with this...

516
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,875
...light...

517
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,294
...this energy.

518
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,380
I mean, you brightened up everything.

519
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,926
You'd seen more darkness
than any man will in a lifetime...

520
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,303
...and you never let it dim your soul.

521
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:32,435
So there I was thinking that
I'm changing your life by taking you in...

522
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,687
...but the truth is...

523
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,442
...you changed mine.

524
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,487
So don't lose that light now, Bar.

525
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,824
The world may need the Flash...

526
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,831
...but I need my Barry Allen.

527
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,300
-Let's go home.
-Yeah.

528

-What are you guys doing here?
-I invited them.

530
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,027
Where's Dr. Wells?

CAITLIN: Uh, he wasn't feeling up
to a social gathering...

532
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,949
...but he appreciated the invitation.

533
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,743
-Eggnog?
JOE: Yes.

534
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,624
-Merry Christmas, Barry.
-You too, Eddie.

535
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,168
Hey, I...

536
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,506
I just wanted to say...

537
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,676
...I heard you're moving in together...

538
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:50,138
...and I'm really happy for you.

JOE:
Mm.

542
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,361
A day like today, Grandma Esther's eggnog
seems a little light on the bourbon.

543
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,200
-Hey, Joe.
-Mm?

544
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,579
-I saw something weird tonight.
-Yeah, Cisco, I saw it too.

545
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,789
No, I mean...

546
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,793
...when the Flash and the man in yellow
were going bumper cars on each other...

547
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,463
...I was watching the electricity
coming off of them.

548
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,548
Yellow and red electricity.

549
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:26,925
When Barry was a kid...

550
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,553
...he saw red and yellow lightning
in his house the night his mother died.

551
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,682
There were two of them.

552
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,187
The man in yellow
may have killed Barry's mother...

553
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,482
...but there was another speedster there
that night.
