Where's Alma?

00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,520
I left her here a minute ago,
but she's gone.

This is really odd.

18
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,840
Maybe she went back home.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,480
No. No way she'd do that.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,000
-No.
-She was pretty wasted.

HIYA...

{\an8}ARE YOU OKAY, ALMA???
ANSWER ME!!!

Alma!

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,840
Greta,

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,640
call her parents.

30
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,920
She might have gone home.

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,920
And if she didn't,

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
tell them the truth.

<i>Why?</i>

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,840
<i>Well, when you called me, I lied.</i>

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,520
<i>Alma and I went to a party.</i>

<i>-Where is Alma?
-I have no idea.</i>

<i>I've been looking for her for three hours,
and I can't find her anywhere.</i>

40
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,560
<i>I don't know.</i>

{\an8}VERO:
ALMA IS HERE. SHE'S FINE

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,840
{\an8}CAN I TALK TO HER?

Well, here's the party animal.

Embarrassing, Almita, right?

49
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,240
-Where did you get this?
-It's doing the rounds.

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,320
You're on a streak, girl.

51
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
We heard you got lost later.
What happened?

52
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,760
Did you go with the DJ or the whole group?

53
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,640
Good morning.

54
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,320
Let's sit down.

55
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,520
You're a great fucking friend.

56
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,480
Just like you two.

57
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,240
Get your books out, please.

58
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,800
What about you? Your favorite book or not?

Alma.

65
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,800
Open up. I know you're in there.

66
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,560
-You should have told me.
-We only had two tickets.

67
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,880
I don't care about your shitty party.

68
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,720
My parents wouldn't have let me go anyway.

69
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,080
So why are you so pissed?

70
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,600
'Cause you both ghosted me.

71
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,000
You're worse. You saw me every day
and didn't say anything.

72
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
-I decided at the last minute, okay?
-That's a shitty excuse.

73
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,280
I'm not having a great day,
so let's drop it.

74
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,240
Tell me something.

75
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
What am I to you?

76
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,600
You're my friend.

77
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,560
That word doesn't mean much this morning.

78
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,480
It sure doesn't.

79
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,440
You use me so you're not alone
and messed up at school,

80
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,480
and outside you forget about me.

81
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,000
You're with Alberto all day.
What are you on about?

82
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't bullshit me.

83
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,880
I found out about the party

84
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,920
'cause your mom called
to ask where you were,

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,520
and I didn't even have to lie.

86
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,360
Do you know how sad that is?

87
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,280
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,320
In the relationship between Greta,
you, and me, I'm the odd one out.

89
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,760
Dammit, it stinks.

90
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,960
All you need is to get caught smoking.

91
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,960
I know you've known Greta for ages,

92
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,320
but it bugs me that I'm always...

93
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,280
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,360
I mean it.

95
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,080
You don't know how much.

96
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
I wish you'd been there.

97
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,360
-ASS ON THE FLOOR, BRO!
-SHE DRANK THE TOWN DRY!

98
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,400
YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.

99
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,760
-Good choice.
-What?

100
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,160
Good choice.

101
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,280
Right, it's just...

102
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,560
I've only got this. I'm living on rations.

103
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,960
Then these are the best.

104
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,800
A 100% artificial product.

105
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,120
I don't know.
I've tried them, but I'm not so sure.

106
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,600
They're perfect for rationing.

107
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,480
A sugar blast and saturated fats
straight to your arteries.

108
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,400
Okay.

109
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, sold.
I'll give them a second chance.

110
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,320
I'm a fan of second chances too.

111
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,720
Look, another 100% artificial product.

112
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,000
That's 6,80.

113
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,840
See you.

114
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,800
Ciao.

115
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,160
This, please.

116
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,720
-Did you hurt yourself?
-I'm fine. Just a zit.

117
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Let's see.

118
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,360
I know we've been hard on you,
but you left us no choice.

119
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,360
I said I'm sorry.

120
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,480
What did you expect?
That we wouldn't catch you?

121
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
We wouldn't care you'd left?

122
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,440
I don't know. I didn't think.

123
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,680
I just wanted to go to the party.

124
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,440
We have to think about
the consequences of what we do.

125
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,400
We can make a deal.

126
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,080
What type of deal?

127
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,640
I'll test you every week.

128
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,080
If you're negative, you focus on school
and you help around the house,

129
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,560
you'll get your phone and allowance back,
and you'll soon be going out on weekends.

130
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,840
-Is that okay with Dad?
-I don't care what he thinks.

131
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,320
Deal.

132
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,080
The only ones left.

133
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,640
Okay.

134
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,800
Come on, Cooper.

135
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,480
Off you go.

136
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
I found your message.

137
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,080
How are you?

138
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,120
Grounded until I'm 30.

139
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,120
You gave me such a fright.

140
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,520
Where the fuck did you go?

141
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,840
Alma?

142
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,520
Are you okay?

143
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,160
Yeah, it's...

144
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
I think I still have a hangover.

145
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,440
Or maybe the Molly
is still hanging around.

146
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,960
What happened?

147
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,200
I was gone for a second,
and then you were gone.

148
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,440
I started walking, and I got lost.

149
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,560
I looked for you everywhere.
Where did you get to?

150
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,560
I don't know. Around.

151
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,080
And

152
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,360
I caught a bus,
and I fell asleep until the last stop.

153
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,520
Then I had to catch another one home.

154
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,360
Why didn't you call?

155
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,000
I had no battery.

156
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,160
Hey.

157
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,680
Hi.

158
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,400
Any news of Alma?

159
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,480
Yeah, she's fine.

160
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,600
Grounded like hell, but fine.

161
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,320
Did she tell you what happened?

162
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,040
She says she went for a walk and got lost,

163
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,560
and then she got on a bus and fell asleep.

164
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,160
-What?
-I don't believe a word of it.

165
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,960
It's complete bullshit.

166
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,000
Why would she lie to you?

167
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,320
I don't know.

168
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,200
Don't sweat it.

169
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,480
Okay.

170
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,840
{\an8}DID YOU SEE THIS GIRL AFTER 4 A.M.?

171
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,840
{\an8}HI THERE!

172
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,720
{\an8}DO YOU HAVE MORE PHOTOS OF THIS MOMENT?

173
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,800
-From last night.
-Thanks, son.

174
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,640
You shouldn't have taken your sister
and Alma to that party.

175
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,080
I know. I'm sorry.

176
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,000
It wasn't his fault.

177
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,720
I asked him.

178
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,360
I thought you were old enough
to know the risk we're taking.

179
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,080
We know, Mom.

180
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,280
Your sister should stay out of this.

181
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,160
Right, but I've never been out of it.

182
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,480
Not one day in the last four years.

183
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,360
Greta.

184
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,920
We don't like having a weed plantation
in the basement.

185
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,960
We allowed it
so we wouldn't lose the house,

186
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,400
but there are nights when we think
it's the worst decision we made.

187
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,880
We just want to protect you.

188
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,760
I know.

189
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,200
I'm just saying
that I've suffered the consequences too.

190
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,360
-Sure.
-Right.

191
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
It's been hard on us all.

192
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,760
But things may change soon.

193
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,440
I have a job interview.

194
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,000
-What?
-Yes.

195
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,440
We weren't going to say anything,
but this time I have a hunch.

196
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,160
They want someone with a sales profile
that has my name on it.

197
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,920
-It's what you wanted, right?
-Right, it's what I wanted.

198
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,920
And the salary is pretty decent, so...

199
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,120
Dad...

200
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,200
It's great.

201
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,360
It'll all go back to normal.

202
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,520
Sure, Dad.

203
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,000
<i>They can't change your school.</i>

204
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,080
<i>My parents can't afford it, Alma.</i>

205
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,840
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

206
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,200
<i>Seriously. I'm not deserting you.</i>

207
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,480
You'd do that for me?

208
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,480
For me.

209
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,880
I refuse to live without you.

210
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,120
Your parents won't let you.

211
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,080
I don't want to be alone.

212
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
Don't be silly. You won't be alone.

213
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,560
Wherever you go, I'll be there.

214
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,760
And wherever I go, you'll come too.

215
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,480
Always.

216
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,520
I love you.

217
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Forever.

218
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,160
And you don't consult me
before talking to her.

219
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,080
Terrific.

220
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,400
We'd better not talk about
how we both react.

221
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,320
I don't know what happened.

222
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,120
I apologized to you.

223
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,040
Right, Pablo, but it's not me
you should apologize to.

224
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,720
You're wrong.
It's not a question of pride, Vero.

225
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,680
I'm scared to think where she might end up
unless we get serious.

226
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,360
Aren't you?

227
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,520
By locking her up,
we'll only make her run off again.

228
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,080
That's how we'll lose her.

229
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,240
She'll let us down again.

230
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
She can do it over and over
if in the end she trusts me.

231
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,520
...convening and establishment of Congress.

232
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,720
Right, bye.

233
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,520
Alma.

234
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,120
Alma! Want to go for a smoke?

235
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,600
Alma.

236
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,400
How are the makeups going?

237
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,840
-I'm studying.
-Right.

238
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,840
You still have time to pass the year,
and I know you can do it.

239
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,120
-I'm not so sure.
-You left it a bit late.

240
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,720
It won't be easy.

241
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,440
You have to get down to it.

242
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,200
I will.

243
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,960
-Right.
-Ciao.

244
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,360
We're going to have dinner
in a super romantic restaurant,

245
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,720
one of those
with big wine glasses, you know?

246
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,600
Then we're going to a hotel
with a Jacuzzi in the room.

247
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,520
You're not listening.

248
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,200
No. Yeah, I am. Yeah.

249
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,960
You're going to a Jacuzzi
to fuck like rabbits.

250
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,400
You're an asshole.

251
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,760
What's that meant to be? A dog?

252
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,360
A dog?

253
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,760
It's meant to be a bird, but anyway...

254
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,040
What were you thinking about?

255
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,800
Nothing.

256
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,720
You've been weird since the party.

257
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,000
You can tell me.

258
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,400
We're friends.
I swear I won't tell anyone.

259
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,240
-Have you spoken to Greta?
-No.

260
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,360
But I'm sure she's noticed too.

261
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,880
-Bye.
<i>-I jumped on David.</i>

262
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,680
<i>He gave me the pull-back.</i>

263
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,000
<i>What an asshole.</i>

264
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,200
<i>No, it was my fault.</i>

265
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,760
<i>I don't know
what wires I got crossed, but...</i>

266
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,560
<i>I've never been so embarrassed.</i>

267
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,000
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT
SEXUAL ASSAULT?

268
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,600
<i>And you bounced, right?</i>

269
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,800
First, I got totally fucking wasted
and started walking.

270
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,040
I didn't know how to get back.

271
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,960
Is that it?

272
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
<i>You have to be sure.</i>

273
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,560
It's no easy step for a woman to report

274
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,760
or even talk about an assault
to those closest to her.

275
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,120
To finish off the night, my dad whacked me

276
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,560
and grounded me without my phone
till I pass a shitty exam.

277
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
I can't do it.

278
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
Come here.

279
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
<i>You have to understand them.</i>

280
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,040
You have to put yourself in their place.

281
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,280
A woman can feel ashamed,

282
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,920
<i>be afraid of not being believed
or of being blamed.</i>

283
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,080
{\an8}<i>She can even blame herself.</i>

284
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,440
If you want, I can give you my notes

285
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,720
and talk to my study group
so you can come.

286
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,960
Thanks.

287
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,320
That's what friends are for.

288
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,840
COVERED UP, THE WAY YOU LIKE THEM

289
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,720
I MISS YOU, SISTER

290
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,440
Hello.

291
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,600
-Hello.
-Hello.

292
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,160
Hello.

293
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,520
Hello.

294
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,800
I've gone upmarket on junk pastries.

295
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,520
Good.

296
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
You have to treat yourself now and then.

297
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,960
-Waiting for someone...
-Come here...

298
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,840
No, I'm getting the bus.

299
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,520
I've got the car here.
I can give you a lift.

300
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,680
My name's Mercedes.

301
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,120
Mer.

302
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,240
Greta.

303
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,120
Do you smoke weed?

304
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,840
Sorry.

305
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,760
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

306
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,240
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

307
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,000
I smoke a bit on weekends.

308
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,360
A bit more lately though.

309
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,160
Well,

310
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,400
I smoke now and then too.

311
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,560
Listen, if I wanted to get some...

312
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,360
I don't like what I've got lately.

313
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Sure. In fact,
I know someone who's very good.

314
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,280
Could you get me some to try?

315
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,680
Sure. It's a bit more expensive
than the usual, but it's worth it.

316
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,600
Okay.

317
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,200
Saturday good for you?

318
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,840
Yes, perfect.

319
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
{\an8}FEBRUARY 14

320
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,800
{\an8}VALENTINE'S DAY, BITCHES!
LET'S PIMP OURSELVES UP

321
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,840
{\an8}I LOVE YOU, BABY.
READY! ALL THIS FOR YOU @ALBRTMFKR

322
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,880
Wow.

323
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
You look gorgeous.

324
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,080
I got you something.

325
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,120
Don't get mad, okay?

326
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,480
What's wrong?

327
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,000
The hotel I wanted to take you to

328
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,840
tripled the price. I can't afford it.

329
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,600
-I'm sorry.
-So?

330
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,520
So I found a solution.

331
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,200
Christian's letting us
have a room at his place.

332
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,480
You're kidding me.

333
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,240
No, but we have a big bed.

334
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,160
We can stay as long as we want.

335
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,040
We'll be fine. You'll see.

336
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,920
And it's got piped music.

337
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,360
{\an8}NO WAY.

338
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,400
{\an8}NO IDEA.

339
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
DOESN'T RING A BELL.

340
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,320
I DIDN'T SEE HER.

341
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,960
{\an8}-NOPE.
-DON'T BE SO NOSY, GIRL.

342
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,640
{\an8}THERE WAS A GIRL LIKE HER AT MY STOP.

343
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,640
{\an8}I SAW SOMEONE LIKE HER ON A BUS.

344
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,200
{\an8}SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP.

345
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,920
IS THIS HER?

346
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,120
{\an8}MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE FOUND.

347
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,000
You have a visitor.

348
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,320
-Hiya.
-What are you doing here?

349
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,360
I found out you got grounded,
so I brought supplies.

350
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,520
Thanks.

351
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,200
So, how is it going?

352
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,720
Somewhere between badly
and "I'm going to kill myself."

353
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,200
You're not wearing it again.

354
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,520
Jeez, Berta, you're stressing me out.

355
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,680
-I'll give it back if you like.
-No.

356
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Sorry. I'm very intense,
and this always happens to me.

357
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,600
A cigarette?

358
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,200
Now I can't give you what I brought.

359
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,560
What was it?

360
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,800
A chip like dogs have, or what?

361
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,040
See? You're so clever.

362
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,800
You crack me up.

363
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,560
My psychologist told me
not to question my decisions,

364
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,680
so...

365
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,040
Here.

366
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,840
When we watched <i>Monsters Inc.</i>

367
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
on my birthday.

368
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,920
Jeez, you printed it out and everything.

369
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,920
A bit creepy, huh?

370
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,040
Well, good thing everyone in art school
is as crazy as I am.

371
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,200
It's the same at my school.

372
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,600
But they're more like psychopathic robots.

373
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,040
Yes, mine are more like bipolar, schizo...

374
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,200
They're too...

375
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,920
They're too into their thing.
It fits my mood.

376
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,680
So, you go to a psychologist?

377
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,040
Yes.

378
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,480
Since...

379
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,600
Well, since I snapped.

380
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,920
I'm sure you remember.

381
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Berta?

382
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,800
Are you there?

383
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,560
Go away! Stop fucking with me!

384
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,400
-But are you all right?
-Go away!

385
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,240
<i>I'm sure that</i>

386
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,200
at some point, I went too far with you.

387
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,360
I was totally fucked up.

388
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,360
I'm sorry.

389
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,160
We all snap sometimes, right?

390
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,080
Yeah.

391
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,720
Yes, but I don't know. I...

392
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,200
I...

393
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,400
I really lost it.

394
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,880
And

395
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,480
my parents were even crazier
with their divorce,

396
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,640
so I had no one to turn to.

397
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,800
I'm sorry.

398
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,520
I had no idea you were in such a bad way.

399
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,720
It's okay, really.

400
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,920
What doesn't kill you makes you fatter.

401
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,960
Goddammit.

402
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,520
You're the best, Berta.

403
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,160
I know.

404
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,840
Slow down, babe!

405
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,280
Take it easy.

406
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,760
Whose room is this?

407
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,400
The maid's.

408
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,840
It was great, right?

409
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,600
Seriously?

410
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,080
They said they were ordering pizza,
then going out for a drink.

411
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,200
But Christian's parents
are getting back later,

412
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,320
so maybe it's better
if we stay here a bit.

413
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,360
I'll wait for you outside.

414
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,720
You're all so lame. Shut the fuck up.

415
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Shut it.

416
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,720
Happy Valentine's Day, everyone.

417
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,480
Wait, Nata.

418
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,840
-It's really good, huh?
-I told you.

419
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,440
Much better than mine.

420
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,400
-Sign me up as a customer.
-Sure. I'd be glad to.

421
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,720
Well...

422
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,240
Catch you next time.

423
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,800
Want a lift somewhere?

424
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,960
No. It's fine. Anyway, I have plans later.

425
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,320
Doesn't your generation
celebrate Valentine's?

426
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,800
What generation do you think I am?

427
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Z.

428
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,040
Z?

429
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,360
I look that young to you?

430
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,600
I'm sorry.

431
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,560
Do you guys celebrate Valentine's Day?

432
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,720
Sure.

433
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,720
We invented it.

434
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,360
At the same time
as electricity and penicillin.

435
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,320
Can I have your phone?

436
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,600
Sure.

437
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,160
That's it. Connected.

438
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,080
Great.

439
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,040
Next time, we can meet at my house.

440
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,680
At your house? Okay.

441
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,200
Better in private.
We're out in the open here.

442
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,320
Right. So you'll call me?

443
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,600
-Right.
-Sweet.

444
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,480
Well, bye.

445
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,400
Ciao.

446
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
4 NEW MESSAGES

447
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,400
{\an8}DO NOT RAPE, SIR

448
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,200
NO MEANS NO

449
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,360
<i>To my first and best friend.</i>

450
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,840
<i>Today I was thinking about us
crying all that summer</i>

451
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,400
<i>when they changed my school.</i>

452
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,840
<i>I felt like an arm was cut off
and I had to live without it.</i>

453
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,080
<i>I know it sounds totally crazy,
but that's the way it is.</i>

454
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,600
<i>The worst part of being separated
was knowing if anything happened to you...</i>

455
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,120
Come on, Cooper.

456
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,720
<i>...I wouldn't be there with you.</i>

457
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,640
<i>And I'd much rather be hurt
than for you to be hurt.</i>

458
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,760
<i>I mean it.</i>

459
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,120
<i>You're like a sister to me.</i>

460
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,680
<i>And even if you don't realize it,
I'm always keeping an eye on you</i>

461
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,880
<i>because I need to know you're okay.</i>

462
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,840
<i>Even now that you've become a total queen
and don't need anyone to protect you.</i>

463
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,120
<i>Though we all need someone
to support us and listen to us.</i>

464
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,440
<i>Even the total queens.</i>

465
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,520
<i>Alma, you're the best person I know.
And you deserve to always be happy.</i>

466
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,800
<i>But if you're not,</i>

467
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,840
<i>if something bad happened to you
and you want to tell me about it,</i>

468
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,320
<i>I'm here.</i>

469
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
<i>You're not alone.</i>

470
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,160
<i>But if you don't want to tell me,
it's okay. I'll love you just the same.</i>

471
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
<i>I suppose some things are hard to share,</i>

472
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,440
<i>even to your first and best friend.</i>

473
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,280
<i>I love you forever.</i>

474
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,320
Mom.

475
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,160
Can I have my phone?

476
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,920
Are you okay?

477
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,160
Yeah, it's my allergy.

478
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,920
I just want to text Greta.

479
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,800
Thanks.

480
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,080
{\an8}COVERED UP, THE WAY YOU LIKE THEM.

481
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,240
YOU'RE A SLUT.
