1
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,579
Just packed up a real money load,
and it's coming your way.

2
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,833
Look for "Rodgers" on the truck's side.
Don't forget my share of the deal.

3
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,421
Shit!

4
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:43,174
-Tuna on white, no crust, right?
-I don't know. How is it?

5
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:48,179
Every day, for the last three weeks,
you've come here, asking how the tuna is.

6
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:52,016
Now, it was crappy yesterday.
It was crappy the day before.

7
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,894
And guess what? It hasn't changed.

8
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,396
-I'll have the tuna.
-No crust?

9
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,606
No crust.

10
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:23,923
Thank you.

11
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:13,389
Talk to me, Jesse.
This ain't working, brother.

12
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:16,100
It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.

13
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:19,270
-That's why you're unloading in third.
-Told you.

14
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:24,483
I lengthen the injector pulse a millisecond.
Just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.

15
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,952
What's up with this fool?
Is he sandwich-crazy?

16
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:39,665
-No. He ain't here for the food, dog.
-Chill out. He's slinging parts for Harry.

17
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:43,252
-I know what he's slinging.
-He's trying to get in Mia's pants, dog.

18
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,546
-What's up, guys?
-How you doing, Mia?

19
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,798
-How you living, girl?
-Hey!

20
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,801
Hey, Dom. You want something to drink?

21
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,940
-He's beautiful.
-I like his haircut.

22
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,694
Vince!

23
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:11,948
-What?
-Can I get you anything?

24
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:14,992
You look good.

25
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,874
-Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow.
-Sure.

26
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,754
-Tomorrow?
-I love this part.

27
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:36,138
Try Fatburger from now on. Get yourself a
Double Cheese with fries for $2.95, faggot.

28
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,725
-I like the tuna here.
-Bullshit. No one likes the tuna here.

29
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,227
Yeah, well, I do.

30
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,243
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out
there? I'm sick of this shit.

31
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:59,662
I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!

32
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,544
-What did you put in that sandwich?
-That's funny.

33
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,879
-Dom!
-All right.

34
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:30,276
-Hey, man. He was in my face.
-I'm in your face.

35
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:34,822
Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!

36
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:38,743
Get over there!

37
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,079
Jesse, give me the wallet.

38
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,294
"Brian Earl Spilner."
Sounds like a serial killer name.

39
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,254
-Is that what you are?
-No, man.

40
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:52,298
Don't come around here again.

41
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:56,594
Hey, man. This is bullshit.

42
00:08:57,678 --> 00:09:00,681
-You work for Harry, right?
-Yeah. I just started.

43
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,433
You were just fired.

44
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:18,449
Hey, Dominic.
I appreciate what you did, in a big way.

45
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,493
Dominic, I owe you.

46
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:26,958
Brian, you're messing with my business.
When Dominic drives, he's golden.

47
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:31,712
Kids pour in. They want everything he has.
Every performance part. They pay cash!

48
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:35,007
-What did Dominic say?
-You don't want to know.

49
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,219
-What did Dominic say?
-He wants you out of here.

50
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:40,763
-He wants me out of here?
-Yes.

51
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,100
-And what did you say to Dom?
-What do you think I said?

52
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,894
I told him, "Good help is hard to find."

53
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,107
Relax.

54
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,070
I need NOS.

55
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:58,823
-I need NOS.
-No.

56
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,784
My car topped out at 140 miles per hour,
this morning.

57
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:06,247
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. I've
seen how you drive. You've a heavy foot.

58
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:10,167
-You'll blow yourself to pieces.
-I need one of these.

59
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,796
One of the big ones.
Actually, let's make it two.

60
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,465
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

61
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,540
Hold up, hold up.
Look at this snowman right here, man.

62
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,756
Sweet ride.
What you running under there, man?

63
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,387
-Going to make me find out the hard way?
-Hell, yeah.

64
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,348
You brave. You brave.
They call me Hector.

65
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,768
I got a last name, too,
but I can't pronounce it.

66
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:53,312
-Brian Spilner.
-Typical white-boy name.

67
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,523
Know what I'm saying?

68
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:02,697
See that over there? That's mine.
My baby. I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

69
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,782
-Why not?
-I'm going legit, homey.

70
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:07,576
Trying to get on the NIRA circuit.
Heard about that?

71
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,663
-Hell, yeah.
-So, what's up with you, man?

72
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:15,042
-I'm just waiting for Toretto.
-Shit. Better get in line. This yours?

73
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,671
-I'm standing next to it.
-That's funny.

74
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,507
You know,
Edwin happens to know a few things.

75
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,886
And one of the things Edwin knows is:
It's not how you stand by your car...

76
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:29,223
...it's how you race your car.
You better learn that.

77
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,107
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

78
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,291
-Dom.
-Marvin.

79
00:12:57,001 --> 00:13:00,588
-Hey, Dom. How you doing?
-Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?

80
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,887
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

81
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:12,725
I smell skanks.

82
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:17,313
Why don't you girls pack it up,
before I leave tread marks on your face?

83
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:18,356
Okay.

84
00:13:18,606 --> 00:13:21,275
-Letty, I was just talking.
-Yeah. Whatever.

85
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:24,695
-Okay, Hector.
-Yeah? What's up, man?

86
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,948
-Yo. What's up?
-Edwin.

87
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:30,409
-How we doing this tonight?
-One race.

88
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,039
$2,000 buy-in. Winner takes all.
Hector, you're going to hold the cash.

89
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:38,542
-Why Hector?
-Too slow to make away with the money.

90
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:43,673
-Okay. Good luck, guys.
-Hey, wait. Hold up.

91
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:48,010
I don't have any cash.
But I do have the pink slip to my car.

92
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:52,348
You just can't climb in the ring with Ali,
'cause you think you box.

93
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:55,810
He knows I can box. Check it out.
It's like this.

94
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:59,897
I lose, the winner takes my car.
Clean and clear.

95
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:03,693
But if I win, I take the cash,
and I take the respect.

96
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,361
Respect.

97
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:10,116
To some people, that's more important.

98
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:13,577
That your car?

99
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:22,169
I see a cool air intake. It's got a NOS
fogger system and a T4 turbo, Dominic.

100
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:27,341
I see an AIC controller.
It has direct port nitrous injection.

101
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:30,386
Yeah. And a stand-alone
fuel management system.

102
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,431
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

103
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,935
You see that shit?

104
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,064
He's got enough NOS in there
to blow himself up. Period.

105
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:46,193
-So, what do you say? Am I worthy?
-We don't know yet.

106
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,696
But you're in. Let's go.

107
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:51,115
-All right.
-Let's go!

108
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,392
-What the hell is going on around here?
-Street's closed, pizza boy.

109
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,812
-Find another way home.
-Goddamn street racers.

110
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:07,858
Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high.
They've blocked the street.

111
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,406
Edwin.

112
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,910
This is yours, whether you win or lose.

113
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,414
But if you win, you get her, too.

114
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:14,467
You're going to win.

115
00:17:15,843 --> 00:17:17,428
I'm going to win.

116
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:04,684
We had a reported homicide.
187, at Barabian Liquors.

117
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:09,146
I've got a 187 in Glendale.
Cops are all over it. We're good to roll.

118
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,273
-All right.
-Let's race!

119
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,358
Right.

120
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:22,910
Go!

121
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,175
Hell, yeah!

122
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:55,901
Damn, that guy's fast.

123
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,203
Let's go! Ménage!

124
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,067
No! Monica!

125
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:53,292
Shut up!

126
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,515
Well done, baby!

127
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:00,776
Come on. Come on. Back up.

128
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,947
Here's what you won, right here.
There you go.

129
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,908
You were racing a bunch of skateboards.
Know what I mean?

130
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:11,996
My sister holds the money. Count it.

131
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,625
And you're my trophy.

132
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,799
-Hey, Monica. What's up, baby?
-What's your problem? You didn't win.

133
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:28,054
Fuck you then!

134
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,652
Was that fun?

135
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,779
Got a problem there, buddy?

136
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:54,789
-What are you smiling about?
-Dude. I almost had you.

137
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,418
You almost had me?

138
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,546
You never had me.
You never had your car.

139
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:09,011
Granny-shifting.
Not double-clutching, like you should.

140
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,100
You're lucky that 100-shot of NOS
didn't blow the welds on the intake.

141
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:19,730
-Almost had me?
-You tell him, Dominic. Get out of here.

142
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:24,193
Now, me and the mad scientist
got to rip apart the block...

143
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,821
...and replace the piston rings you fried.

144
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,664
Ask any racer. Any real racer.

145
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:41,877
It don't matter if you win by an inch
or a mile. Winning's winning.

146
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:43,504
Yeah!

147
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:52,179
All available units,
we have street-racing along Hawthorne....

148
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:54,140
Oh, shit! We got cops. Cops!

149
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,725
Go!

150
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:09,238
Cops! Get in the car! Go!

151
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:35,700
Toretto, stop right there!

152
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,494
Toretto!

153
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:54,719
Get in!

154
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:44,602
You're the last person in the world
I expected to show up.

155
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,690
I thought if I got in your good graces,
you might let me keep my car.

156
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,277
You are in my good graces,
but you ain't keeping your car.

157
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:57,156
You drive like you've done this before.
Are you a wheelman?

158
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,617
-No.
-You boost cars?

159
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:04,163
-No. Never.
-Ever done time?

160
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,874
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

161
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,670
What about the two years
in juvie for boosting cars?

162
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,174
Tucson, right?

163
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:18,969
I had Jesse run a profile on you,
Brian Earl Spilner.

164
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:23,683
He'll find anything on the Web.
Anything about anybody.

165
00:26:24,392 --> 00:26:25,810
So, why bullshit?

166
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,021
So, what about you?

167
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:32,984
Two years in Lompoc.

168
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,822
I'll die before I go back.

169
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:45,913
-Oh, great.
-What?

170
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:51,252
It's going to be a long-ass night.
That's what.

171
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:56,924
Follow us.

172
00:27:47,642 --> 00:27:51,854
I thought we had an agreement.
You stay away. I stay away.

173
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,899
Everybody stays happy.

174
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:57,318
We got lost.
What do you want me to tell you?

175
00:27:57,443 --> 00:28:00,363
-Who's "we"?
-My new mechanic.

176
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:02,531
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

177
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:05,701
The guy in the snakeskin pants.
That's his cousin. Lance.

178
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:09,455
So, when are you going to give me a shot
at that Honda 2000 of yours?

179
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,957
-This your ride?
-It was. It's his now.

180
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,877
No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

181
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:20,758
Then, it's nobody's car.
But somebody put in the wrench time.

182
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:27,431
-What do you think, Lance?
-It's an amazing machine.

183
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,600
Yes, indeed.

184
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,229
Let's go.

185
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:39,777
I'll see you in the desert next month.
Be ready to have your ass handed to you.

186
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:43,906
-You'll need more than that crotch rocket.
-I got something for you.

187
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:01,340
-What the hell was that all about?
-Long story. I'll tell you later.

188
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:03,092
Let's get out of here.

189
00:29:30,494 --> 00:29:31,579
NOS!

190
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,219
-So, what the hell was that all about?
-It's a long story.

191
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:49,972
Well, we got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

192
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:53,142
A business deal that went sour.

193
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:57,188
Plus, I made the mistake
of sleeping with his sister.

194
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:24,632
Take care.

195
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,263
Yo, Spilner.

196
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:34,892
-You want a beer?
-Yeah, sure.

197
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:37,144
Oh, shit.

198
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,171
We were all there, right? Falling behind.

199
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:06,716
-With all that nitrous.
-Yeah.

200
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:17,018
Yo, Dom. We were just about to go
looking for you, brother.

201
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:24,233
Where were you?

202
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:28,612
There were mass cops there. They came in
from every direction. It was orchestrated.

203
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:31,073
-This your beer?
-Yeah, that's my beer.

204
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,620
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

205
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,874
You can't detail a car with the cover on.

206
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:43,586
-Can't even get that right.
-You all right?

207
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:48,632
-Am I all right?
-It was just a question.

208
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:53,637
Yo, Dom.

209
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:58,017
-Why did you bring the buster here?
-'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!

210
00:31:58,267 --> 00:32:02,104
He didn't just run back to the fort!
The buster brought me back.

211
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:11,739
You can have any brew you want,
as long as it's a Corona.

212
00:32:12,406 --> 00:32:15,034
-Thanks, man.
-That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.

213
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,287
You.

214
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:29,507
-Hey, bro. You got a bathroom?
-Upstairs. First door on the right.

215
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:49,151
He's got no call being up in here.
You don't know that fool for shit.

216
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:52,738
-He's right, Dom.
-There was a time when I didn't know you.

217
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:54,782
That was in the third grade!

218
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:01,539
-Yeah. So, what girls are here?
-You name it. You want mine?

219
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:04,000
-You need to shut the....
-You want two?

220
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,919
-You don't have anything?
-You look a bit tired.

221
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:09,797
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

222
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,217
-Look at all our guests.
-How about you give me a massage?

223
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,055
Crazy lady.

224
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,399
You know you owe me
a 10-second car, right?

225
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:34,280
Oh, shit.

226
00:33:40,077 --> 00:33:41,704
Did you wipe the seat?

227
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:48,294
Jesus Christ! Would you cut this shit?
Come on!

228
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:54,258
-Come on. Let's go get me a drink.
-We were just about to get along.

229
00:34:02,516 --> 00:34:05,686
-So, what do you want?
-Anything, as long as it's cold.

230
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:10,900
You know, my brother likes you.
He usually doesn't like anybody.

231
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:14,236
-He's a complicated guy.
-Yeah? What about you?

232
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:19,742
-I'm simpler.
-You're a shitty liar.

233
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:23,788
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

234
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:28,167
-But there's a problem.
-What's that?

235
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,461
You need to get some sleep.

236
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:34,965
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

237
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:38,260
Come on. I'll take you home.

238
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:02,994
Show me your hands.
Very good. Now open the door.

239
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:06,580
Put your hands on your head.
Behind your head.

240
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:10,751
Face the front of the vehicle,
walk backwards towards the rear.

241
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,296
Take two steps to your right.
Stop right there.

242
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:21,303
-What did I do?
-Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

243
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:34,400
Damn!
Muse, will you take these things off?

244
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:37,445
-Shit. You put them on so tight.
-I like realism.

245
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,364
You never know who's watching, Brian.

246
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:48,456
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer
than the last place you confiscated.

247
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:52,793
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house
for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

248
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,880
You see, even the cops
are Hollywood in Hollywood.

249
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:02,970
Okay, here he is,
fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

250
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:05,348
That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer.

251
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:07,683
-You told him what happened?
-He knows.

252
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:11,687
-Send the bill to Johnny Tran.
-The kid's giving me attitude?

253
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:14,523
It doesn't speak well
for police FBI relations, Tanner.

254
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:18,194
-I walk in the door and the guy's already--
-All right, all right.

255
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:20,529
We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

256
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:23,866
Muse, why don't you make us
four iced cappuccinos, please?

257
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:26,285
-Come on.
-Regular or decaf, Sarge?

258
00:36:27,912 --> 00:36:29,330
Decaf, I think.

259
00:36:29,664 --> 00:36:32,375
Four hijackings in two months,
and we have nothing.

260
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:35,544
The DVD players and digital cameras
are worth $1.2 million...

261
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:38,422
...which brings the grand total
to $6 million plus.

262
00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:41,342
We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.

263
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:43,886
That's why you're undercover.

264
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:47,932
You want that detective badge fast, kid.
And you want to know something?

265
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:51,143
The FBI can help,
if you come through for us.

266
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:54,146
What does the truckdriver say?

267
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,733
He gave us the same M.O.:
Three Honda Civics, precision driving...

268
00:36:57,858 --> 00:37:00,820
...the same green neon glow
from under the chassis.

269
00:37:00,903 --> 00:37:05,366
Lab says the skidmarks came back
the same: Mashamoto ZX tires.

270
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:08,160
So, we know it's somebody
in the street-racing world.

271
00:37:08,244 --> 00:37:12,707
If we don't make this case, the truckers
will take matters into their own hands.

272
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,500
I tell them we're close.

273
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,586
Are you going to make me a liar?

274
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:19,255
Look, what do we know?

275
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,799
We know this world
revolves around Toretto, right?

276
00:37:21,924 --> 00:37:25,011
I'm not saying that he's the one
that's popping these trucks...

277
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:29,390
...but I can guarantee he knows who is.
It's just a matter of time until I win--

278
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:33,436
You want time, buy the magazine.
We don't have time.

279
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:37,314
Just get me something I can use.

280
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:40,818
Is Harry cooperating?

281
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:44,530
Like a guy that'll do time
for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

282
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:46,741
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

283
00:37:46,824 --> 00:37:49,910
He's scared of him,
but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks.

284
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:52,413
-He's too controlled for that.
-Wait.

285
00:37:52,496 --> 00:37:55,583
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character...

286
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:59,211
...but Toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death.

287
00:37:59,337 --> 00:38:02,423
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain.

288
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:04,425
Do not turn your back on him.

289
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:06,427
Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.

290
00:38:11,974 --> 00:38:14,352
-What about parts and service?
-Hold off on it.

291
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:16,771
Dom, I don't know what to do with it.

292
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:23,736
All right, what the hell is this?
What do you got there?

293
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:27,865
-This is your car.
-My car?

294
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:31,494
I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.

295
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:35,414
You could push this across the finish line,
or tow it.

296
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:39,627
You couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

297
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:41,545
No faith.

298
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:44,048
I have faith in you,
but this isn't a junkyard.

299
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:46,384
-This is a garage.
-Pop the hood.

300
00:38:46,717 --> 00:38:47,968
-Pop the hood?
-Pop the hood.

301
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:54,767
-2JZ engine. No shit.
-And what did I tell you?

302
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,603
-I retract my previous statement.
-You know what?

303
00:38:57,687 --> 00:39:02,233
This will decimate all
after you put about $15,000 in it.

304
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:06,112
Or more,
if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

305
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,281
-We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.
-Yes!

306
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:13,452
I gotta get you racing again
so I can make some money off your ass.

307
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:16,747
There's a show down in the desert
called Race Wars.

308
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:19,125
That's where you'll do it.

309
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,837
When you're not working at Harry's,
you're working here.

310
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:26,841
If you can't find the right tool
in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

311
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:29,427
...you don't belong near a car.

312
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:34,390
He owns you now.

313
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:03,502
Tell me what you think about this.
Koni adjustables.

314
00:40:04,337 --> 00:40:06,547
Gonna save us about 2 pounds.

315
00:40:06,756 --> 00:40:10,092
And they're gonna give us
better traction for the hole shot.

316
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:11,427
All right?

317
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:14,305
This is your basic layout of the car.

318
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:18,267
And that's pretty much
what it could look like when it's finished.

319
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:20,394
Red, green.

320
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,523
-You should be going to MIT or something.
-Yeah, right.

321
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:28,069
No, I got that.... What's it called?

322
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:31,280
That attention disorder--

323
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:35,076
-ADD?
-Yes, that shit. Yeah.

324
00:40:36,243 --> 00:40:40,164
You know, I was good in algebra
and like math and shit.

325
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:44,752
Everything else I failed.
Dropped out of school.

326
00:40:45,628 --> 00:40:48,714
I don't know.
It's just something about engines...

327
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:51,926
...that calms me down, you know.

328
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:15,282
-I'm outta here.
-Come on, dog.

329
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:18,577
-Yo, Dom.
-Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

330
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:21,580
Looks like you got
all the help you need, brother.

331
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:38,347
-Mia! The chicken's dry.
-All right. I'm coming out already.

332
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:45,229
Here you go.

333
00:41:47,148 --> 00:41:48,566
Hey, hold up.

334
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:54,280
Because you were the first to reach in
to get the chicken, you say grace.

335
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:03,039
-Dear heavenly....
-Spirit.

336
00:42:04,707 --> 00:42:06,334
Spirit. Thank you.

337
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:12,131
Thank you for providing us
with a direct port nitrous injection...

338
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:16,927
...four core intercoolers
and ball-bearing turbos...

339
00:42:17,094 --> 00:42:19,555
...and titanium valve springs.

340
00:42:20,348 --> 00:42:21,974
-Thank you.
-Amen.

341
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,061
-Not bad.
-Amen.

342
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:27,355
He was praying to the car gods, man.

343
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:30,274
He's not the best.

344
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:32,485
-What do you want?
-Practice.

345
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,944
Thank you, girl.

346
00:42:34,028 --> 00:42:37,615
Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us."

347
00:42:37,698 --> 00:42:40,451
I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.

348
00:42:40,618 --> 00:42:43,579
-You know, I gotta eat.
-He's always hungry.

349
00:42:43,663 --> 00:42:45,706
All right, sit down.

350
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:54,965
How you doing, Mia?

351
00:42:58,177 --> 00:42:59,804
Here you go.

352
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:09,021
-Jesse, hand me that chicken.
-Let's eat some grub, man.

353
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:12,191
-Want some of that chicken?
-What, you rent a movie or something?

354
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:21,200
Need a hand with anything else?

355
00:43:21,325 --> 00:43:24,745
No, I'm good. You can go join the boys
and watch the movie.

356
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:28,958
-The cook doesn't clean where I come from.
-I'd like to go there.

357
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,342
-I think we should go out sometime.
-No, I don't date my brother's friends.

358
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:40,553
That sucks.

359
00:43:40,636 --> 00:43:43,973
-I'll have to kick his ass then.
-I'd love to see that one.

360
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:47,309
I would pay to see that one, actually.

361
00:44:01,282 --> 00:44:02,992
Wash my car when you get done.

362
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:06,746
-What was that?
-No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.

363
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,041
Wear your favorite dress,
'cause when you're done...

364
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:13,377
...I'm putting you on the street
where you belong, cutie.

365
00:44:16,714 --> 00:44:20,384
Is this thing broken?
What's wrong with this thing?

366
00:44:21,677 --> 00:44:25,681
What was that Cuban restaurant
you wanted to take me to?

367
00:44:25,848 --> 00:44:27,808
The one with the picadillo and--

368
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:31,687
-With red candles, wooden tables--
-The plantain, food all over the place.

369
00:44:31,812 --> 00:44:33,689
-What it's called?
-Cha Cha Cha.

370
00:44:33,773 --> 00:44:35,733
-Yeah, that's it.
-Yeah.

371
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:38,861
Well, you can take me there.

372
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:41,655
Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?

373
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:44,325
-Yeah, it's perfect.
-Good.

374
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:54,669
-There's no popcorn.
-Make your own goddamn popcorn!

375
00:45:08,683 --> 00:45:11,227
All right. Now that's valet parking.

376
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:17,483
-Harry. What's up, dog?
-Nice to see you.

377
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:19,360
Excellent. Come on in, man.

378
00:45:19,485 --> 00:45:22,571
-Check it. It's yours.
-Damn. What do we got here?

379
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:26,200
-Hired some new help?
-Don't even think about it.

380
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:28,786
-What's up?
-What's up, Brian? How you feeling?

381
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:31,789
-Pretty good. What do you need?
-What's up, man?

382
00:45:31,872 --> 00:45:35,376
I need you to hook me up.
Three of everything. I made a list.

383
00:45:37,044 --> 00:45:39,005
Why don't you look that over?

384
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:42,466
-When do you need this stuff by?
-Tomorrow, today, now.

385
00:45:42,883 --> 00:45:45,094
-Right.
-White boys work fast, don't they?

386
00:45:48,389 --> 00:45:49,724
That's right.

387
00:45:52,601 --> 00:45:56,105
-You said you need three of each?
-Yeah, three of everything.

388
00:45:56,897 --> 00:45:59,567
What do you think about that?
Check this out.

389
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:09,238
He moans like a cop.

390
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:22,710
Brian, this is one of those times
you need to be clear about what you say.

391
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:25,421
Nod if you understand me.

392
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:26,797
Nod!

393
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:30,092
Sit up.

394
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:39,018
Tell me what the hell you're doing
down here.

395
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,771
Shit. What I'm doing?

396
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:45,733
Dom.

397
00:48:47,985 --> 00:48:50,696
I owe you a 10-second car.

398
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:55,242
And what this is about,
this is about Race Wars.

399
00:48:58,454 --> 00:49:02,291
I just went in there,
and Hector is gonna be running...

400
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:05,336
...three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.

401
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:08,297
And on top of that,
he just came into Harry's...

402
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:12,635
...and he ordered three T66 turbos,
with NOS...

403
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:16,305
...and a MoTeC system exhaust.

404
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,560
So, what are you saying?

405
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:27,316
You're gonna check everybody's shit out,
one garage after another?

406
00:49:30,194 --> 00:49:31,654
Yeah.

407
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:38,411
Because, Dom, you know I can't lose again.

408
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:41,789
He's a cop.

409
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,209
He's a cop!

410
00:49:48,546 --> 00:49:49,880
You a cop?

411
00:49:56,387 --> 00:49:58,180
Let's go for a little ride.

412
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:02,601
Walk!

413
00:50:21,996 --> 00:50:23,706
Okay. You stand watch.

414
00:50:54,445 --> 00:50:56,072
Yo, Dominic.

415
00:50:57,865 --> 00:50:59,492
There's no engines.

416
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:03,412
What are they planning on racing with,
hopes and dreams?

417
00:51:03,496 --> 00:51:05,873
I don't know, but they're sneaky as shit...

418
00:51:05,998 --> 00:51:08,834
...and they've got enough money
to buy anything.

419
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:14,924
What?

420
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,434
We got a wolf pack.

421
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:29,605
It's Johnny Tran,
and he's coming your way really fast.

422
00:51:30,064 --> 00:51:32,692
All right, we got company. Spilner.

423
00:51:58,676 --> 00:52:00,970
Come on. Move!

424
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,264
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

425
00:52:04,765 --> 00:52:07,935
-Do you see anything wrong here?
-No.

426
00:52:11,856 --> 00:52:14,233
-We got no engines, do we?
-No.

427
00:52:14,358 --> 00:52:15,609
-Do we?
-No.

428
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:21,282
A couple of Nissan SR20 motors
will pull a premium...

429
00:52:21,407 --> 00:52:24,410
-...one week before Race Wars, huh?
-Yeah, probably.

430
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:27,830
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

431
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:31,208
What are you feeling, Lance?

432
00:52:32,752 --> 00:52:34,295
40-weight?

433
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:36,589
50-weight?

434
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:38,966
A 40-weight sounds nice.

435
00:52:54,565 --> 00:52:56,108
Where are they, Ted?

436
00:52:56,275 --> 00:52:58,069
-Where are they?
-Enough!

437
00:52:58,277 --> 00:53:00,738
-Where are they?
-They're in a warehouse.

438
00:53:01,322 --> 00:53:03,199
They're in a warehouse, man!

439
00:53:19,507 --> 00:53:20,758
Ted.

440
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:22,510
Kiss my shoes?

441
00:53:34,814 --> 00:53:36,691
Let's go get our engines.

442
00:53:37,566 --> 00:53:40,361
My superiors are flying in from D.C.,
in two days.

443
00:53:40,444 --> 00:53:42,071
I want something to show.

444
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:44,615
We've got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth...

445
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:48,327
...automatic weapons,
priors on every one of these Asian punks...

446
00:53:48,452 --> 00:53:51,789
...a garage full of DVD players
and generally psychotic behavior.

447
00:53:51,872 --> 00:53:55,209
Tell me why we shouldn't move
on Tran now and figure it out later?

448
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:57,044
Because all we have is behavior.

449
00:53:57,169 --> 00:54:00,256
Let me get hard evidence,
because what we have now is just--

450
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:02,299
What we have is probable cause.

451
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:06,262
And truckers arming themselves for some
good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.

452
00:54:06,387 --> 00:54:10,474
-Tell us about Hector, Brian.
-Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

453
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:14,311
Hector's still working on the engines,
but the tires don't match.

454
00:54:14,395 --> 00:54:16,188
Will somebody give me a cigarette?

455
00:54:16,272 --> 00:54:18,399
-Get him a cigarette.
-Don't give him one.

456
00:54:18,649 --> 00:54:21,110
-I thought you quit.
-I did. Just give me one.

457
00:54:21,193 --> 00:54:22,903
-Get him a cigarette.
-No!

458
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:26,866
Tell me about Toretto.

459
00:54:27,116 --> 00:54:29,910
I told you,
I think he's too controlled for this.

460
00:54:29,994 --> 00:54:34,623
Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way.
Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it.

461
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:38,669
-I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.
-What did you say?

462
00:54:38,753 --> 00:54:42,339
I don't blame you.
I'd get off on her surveillance photos, too.

463
00:54:45,134 --> 00:54:46,385
Knock it off!

464
00:54:47,553 --> 00:54:50,097
What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

465
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:56,979
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

466
00:54:57,271 --> 00:54:59,565
-Yeah. I memorized that file.
-Read it again.

467
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,068
No, better still, take a look at these.

468
00:55:03,903 --> 00:55:07,239
Remember I told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death?

469
00:55:07,698 --> 00:55:10,951
Toretto did this
with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.

470
00:55:11,494 --> 00:55:13,454
He's a model of self-control.

471
00:55:16,374 --> 00:55:18,084
I need a few more days.

472
00:55:20,836 --> 00:55:22,004
I need a few more days.

473
00:55:24,965 --> 00:55:26,550
Got a TR7 here,
with a ball-bearing upgrade.

474
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:31,764
What it's going to do is,
it's going to spool up really quick.

475
00:55:31,972 --> 00:55:34,433
-I got this set up for 24 psi.
-Got it.

476
00:55:37,978 --> 00:55:39,772
You got big plans tonight?

477
00:55:41,899 --> 00:55:44,026
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

478
00:55:45,653 --> 00:55:48,197
You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

479
00:55:48,864 --> 00:55:50,366
That's not gonna happen.

480
00:55:55,538 --> 00:55:57,331
I want to show you something.

481
00:56:11,637 --> 00:56:13,347
Me and my dad built her.

482
00:56:14,223 --> 00:56:16,600
Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle.

483
00:56:17,893 --> 00:56:19,145
It's a beast.

484
00:56:19,729 --> 00:56:22,606
-You know what she ran in Palmdale?
-No. What?

485
00:56:22,773 --> 00:56:24,233
Nine seconds flat.

486
00:56:25,735 --> 00:56:27,862
-God.
-My dad was driving.

487
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:32,616
So much torque,
the chassis twisted coming off the line.

488
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:35,661
Barely kept her on the track.

489
00:56:36,412 --> 00:56:39,331
-So, what's your best time?
-I've never driven her.

490
00:56:39,415 --> 00:56:40,499
Why not?

491
00:56:43,252 --> 00:56:45,212
It scares the shit out of me.

492
00:56:47,631 --> 00:56:48,883
That's my dad.

493
00:56:50,384 --> 00:56:53,095
He was coming up
in the pro stock-car circuit.

494
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:55,222
Last race of the season.

495
00:56:56,348 --> 00:57:00,561
A guy named Kenny Linder
came up from inside, in the final turn.

496
00:57:01,395 --> 00:57:04,899
He clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120.

497
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:10,446
I watched my dad burn to death.

498
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:15,034
I remembered hearing him scream.

499
00:57:18,245 --> 00:57:22,792
But the people that were there
said he had died before the tanks blew.

500
00:57:29,173 --> 00:57:31,550
They said it was me who was screaming.

501
00:57:35,096 --> 00:57:37,473
I saw Linder about a week later.

502
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:42,311
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

503
00:57:42,645 --> 00:57:47,358
And I didn't intend to keep hitting him,
but when I finished, I couldn't lift my arm.

504
00:57:52,738 --> 00:57:55,032
He's a janitor at a high school.

505
00:57:56,158 --> 00:57:58,703
He has to take the bus to work every day.

506
00:57:59,912 --> 00:58:02,623
And they banned me
from the tracks for life.

507
00:58:08,254 --> 00:58:10,715
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

508
00:58:12,591 --> 00:58:15,386
Nothing else matters.
Not the mortgage, not the store...

509
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:17,930
...not my team and all their bullshit.

510
00:58:19,682 --> 00:58:22,059
For those 10 seconds or less...

511
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:25,187
...I'm free.

512
00:58:45,708 --> 00:58:48,961
So, how is it, anyways,
that the gang came to be?

513
00:58:49,211 --> 00:58:50,296
-What?
-The gang.

514
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:52,798
The gang?
No, they don't call themselves a gang.

515
00:58:52,923 --> 00:58:55,217
-What do they call themselves?
-They're a team.

516
00:58:55,342 --> 00:58:59,346
-They call themselves a team.
-All right. How did the team come to be?

517
00:58:59,805 --> 00:59:02,099
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

518
00:59:03,517 --> 00:59:07,188
-I've got time.
-Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.

519
00:59:08,189 --> 00:59:11,275
Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up,
as you can tell.

520
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,361
But they were friends as kids.

521
00:59:13,611 --> 00:59:16,155
And Letty, she just lived down the street.

522
00:59:16,364 --> 00:59:19,617
Always into cars, though.
Ever since she was, like, 10 years old.

523
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:23,287
So, naturally, you know,
my brother always had her attention.

524
00:59:23,954 --> 00:59:27,625
-And then she turned 16--
-And then she had Dom's attention.

525
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:30,836
Yeah. It's funny how that works, isn't it?

526
00:59:31,587 --> 00:59:32,838
Yeah.

527
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:38,594
How does Jesse fit into the whole thing?

528
00:59:38,761 --> 00:59:43,724
Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of
showed up one night and never, ever left.

529
00:59:44,558 --> 00:59:47,812
It's just the way my brother is, you know.
Dom's like....

530
00:59:49,397 --> 00:59:51,357
He's like gravity.

531
00:59:52,483 --> 00:59:54,694
Everything just gets pulled to him.

532
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,697
Even you.

533
00:59:59,907 --> 01:00:01,283
No.

534
01:00:01,409 --> 01:00:02,785
No.

535
01:00:03,244 --> 01:00:06,080
The only thing that pulled me in was you.

536
01:00:06,163 --> 01:00:08,999
Being friends with your brother
is just a bonus.

537
01:00:11,752 --> 01:00:13,295
That's good.

538
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:18,634
That's good. It's nice to come first
every once in a while.

539
01:00:22,304 --> 01:00:23,305
Want to go for a drive?

540
01:01:02,053 --> 01:01:04,263
-Yeah?
-The hijackers have hit again.

541
01:01:04,388 --> 01:01:09,435
Bilkins has decided that we're gonna move
on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00.

542
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,437
Unless you say otherwise.

543
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,397
If you agree, just say yes.

544
01:01:14,023 --> 01:01:15,983
-Yeah.
-Who is that?

545
01:01:18,277 --> 01:01:19,987
qt's just a wrong number.

546
01:04:12,243 --> 01:04:14,370
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but--

547
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:17,289
Yeah. Yes, sir.

548
01:04:17,498 --> 01:04:18,916
Yeah. I got it.

549
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,339
The DVD players were purchased legally.

550
01:04:25,423 --> 01:04:28,676
All we've got are a couple
of low-rent weapons charges...

551
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:31,053
...and some outstanding speeding tickets.

552
01:04:31,137 --> 01:04:32,763
-So, they're out.
-Yeah.

553
01:04:33,013 --> 01:04:34,598
Father bailed them out.

554
01:04:35,725 --> 01:04:39,478
Is this the kind of intelligence
I can expect from you, O'Conner?

555
01:04:44,316 --> 01:04:47,486
-You're gonna put this on me?
-I can put it on whoever I want to.

556
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:50,281
-Perks of the job.
-No, you can't put this on me--

557
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:52,241
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.

558
01:04:52,324 --> 01:04:56,537
I don't care if you have to aim at someone
and blow your cover to smithereens.

559
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:59,165
You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard...

560
01:04:59,248 --> 01:05:02,334
...or you might want to think
about another career.

561
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:16,807
It's Toretto, Brian.
It always has been Toretto.

562
01:05:18,184 --> 01:05:20,061
Tran and Hector are....

563
01:05:20,478 --> 01:05:22,271
They're just fumes.

564
01:05:25,524 --> 01:05:28,235
I know you've been lying to me.
My question is this:

565
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,989
Have you been lying to yourself
because you can't see past Mia?

566
01:05:34,617 --> 01:05:36,577
He won't go back to prison.

567
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:40,456
Well, that's a choice
he's going to have to make.

568
01:05:44,543 --> 01:05:46,921
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

569
01:05:48,381 --> 01:05:51,175
And that's a choice
you're gonna have to make.

570
01:06:09,193 --> 01:06:11,153
You ready for this?

571
01:06:37,596 --> 01:06:40,433
Nice car.
What's the retail on one of those?

572
01:06:41,058 --> 01:06:43,602
More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

573
01:06:49,817 --> 01:06:51,318
Smoke him.

574
01:07:46,248 --> 01:07:48,042
So, what's wrong, Brian?

575
01:07:49,001 --> 01:07:50,711
Nothing, man, I'm fine.

576
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:54,423
Come on. Obviously something's off.

577
01:07:54,965 --> 01:07:58,636
Look, I have my good days and bad days
just like anybody else.

578
01:07:59,345 --> 01:08:02,932
Brian, don't lose that cool of yours.
That's your meal ticket.

579
01:08:04,892 --> 01:08:07,728
My meal ticket?
I can't pay for my own shrimp?

580
01:08:07,895 --> 01:08:09,355
I got the shrimp.

581
01:08:09,772 --> 01:08:12,316
No, that's one thing about me
you don't understand.

582
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:16,112
I don't take handouts.
I earn my way, every step.

583
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:19,407
I need something extra on the side,
like you.

584
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,450
What do you mean, like me?

585
01:08:21,742 --> 01:08:24,620
-What's that supposed to mean?
-That's what I mean.

586
01:08:24,704 --> 01:08:27,415
-What does that mean, like me?
-Don't try--

587
01:08:27,707 --> 01:08:29,583
I'm not stupid, all right?

588
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,088
I know that there's no way you paid
for all that shit you got under the hood--

589
01:08:34,171 --> 01:08:37,508
There's no way you paid for
what's under the hood of those cars...

590
01:08:37,633 --> 01:08:40,386
...by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.

591
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:44,223
Whatever it is you're in on,
I want in on it, too.

592
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:09,123
-Well, what is this?
-Read it.

593
01:09:09,957 --> 01:09:12,251
-What is this for?
-It's directions.

594
01:09:14,253 --> 01:09:15,963
To Race Wars.

595
01:09:16,464 --> 01:09:18,257
We'll see how you go.

596
01:09:19,258 --> 01:09:20,885
Then we'll talk.

597
01:10:07,181 --> 01:10:08,808
-How's it going?
-What's up?

598
01:10:08,891 --> 01:10:11,560
-Welcome to Race Wars.
-Great. Thanks a lot.

599
01:10:34,959 --> 01:10:36,669
Baby. Hey, baby.

600
01:10:37,837 --> 01:10:39,630
You should watch from the side.

601
01:10:39,755 --> 01:10:42,216
I wouldn't want to get exhaust
on that pretty face.

602
01:10:42,299 --> 01:10:46,387
-Put your money where your mouth is.
-I'll race you for that sweet little ass.

603
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,931
You want ass,
why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?

604
01:10:49,014 --> 01:10:52,101
You want an adrenaline rush,
it'll be two large.

605
01:10:52,184 --> 01:10:55,187
Right here. Right now.
What's it gonna be?

606
01:10:57,857 --> 01:10:59,275
You got it.

607
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,338
"Another one bites the dust"

608
01:11:24,633 --> 01:11:26,510
Come on. What you got?

609
01:11:27,261 --> 01:11:28,721
See ya.

610
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:07,676
-What's up?
-Hey, what's up, Jesse?

611
01:12:08,135 --> 01:12:09,387
What's in your hand?

612
01:12:09,512 --> 01:12:11,889
Throwing down the pink slip, just like you.

613
01:12:11,972 --> 01:12:14,600
-The pink slip to what? The Jetta?
-Yeah.

614
01:12:15,017 --> 01:12:17,561
-You can't bet your dad's car.
-It's all right.

615
01:12:17,645 --> 01:12:18,896
I ain't losing.

616
01:12:19,021 --> 01:12:22,525
This fool is running a Honda 2000.
I'll win.

617
01:12:22,691 --> 01:12:27,238
That way, me and my dad can roll
when he gets out of prison. It's all good.

618
01:12:27,321 --> 01:12:30,908
They're gonna throw him right back
in prison after he kills you.

619
01:12:38,582 --> 01:12:40,543
You visualize the win.

620
01:12:40,626 --> 01:12:44,296
Visualize the win, Jesse. I'm serious.
You got to listen to me, man.

621
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,923
Who are you racing?

622
01:12:50,302 --> 01:12:52,513
Jesse, don't do it.

623
01:12:52,638 --> 01:12:56,308
I bet you he's got more than $100,000
under the hood of that car.

624
01:13:19,457 --> 01:13:21,042
Too soon, junior.

625
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:25,504
No!

626
01:13:28,674 --> 01:13:29,842
Shit!

627
01:13:30,509 --> 01:13:31,677
Oh, God!

628
01:13:42,104 --> 01:13:44,774
Yo! Heads up, bro. We got problems.

629
01:13:44,857 --> 01:13:46,567
-What?
-Jesse.

630
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,154
Where's Jesse going?

631
01:13:50,321 --> 01:13:53,824
-He just raced Tran for slips.
-Oh, shit.

632
01:14:05,503 --> 01:14:08,589
-Where's he going?
-He went to the car wash.

633
01:14:08,839 --> 01:14:10,800
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

634
01:14:11,384 --> 01:14:13,010
Go fetch your car?

635
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:15,596
We're not on your block.

636
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:18,349
You better watch who you talk to like that.

637
01:14:18,891 --> 01:14:19,975
Toretto!

638
01:14:23,312 --> 01:14:25,189
SWAT came into my house...

639
01:14:26,148 --> 01:14:30,403
...disrespected my whole family,
because somebody narked me out.

640
01:14:31,112 --> 01:14:33,572
And you know what? It was you!

641
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:59,974
Get off of him, man.

642
01:15:09,316 --> 01:15:11,110
Dom, chill out, man. Come on!

643
01:15:11,193 --> 01:15:12,987
I never narked on nobody!

644
01:15:13,112 --> 01:15:15,573
I never narked on nobody!

645
01:15:54,612 --> 01:15:55,696
Mia.

646
01:16:00,451 --> 01:16:02,828
I have respected you
and I haven't said shit.

647
01:16:02,912 --> 01:16:04,622
Now I am asking you not to go.

648
01:16:04,747 --> 01:16:07,625
-I'm doing this for both of us.
-Don't give me that crap.

649
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:09,168
You're doing this for you.

650
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:13,381
Why are you insisting on doing this?
Dom, please, just don't.

651
01:16:25,351 --> 01:16:27,812
-Mia, what's going on?
-What?

652
01:16:27,937 --> 01:16:30,398
-You know what I'm talking about.
-No, I don't.

653
01:16:30,523 --> 01:16:33,776
You always have tears in your eyes
when Dom drives away?

654
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:35,444
What's the matter with you?

655
01:16:35,528 --> 01:16:38,072
What's he racing off
in the middle of the night for?

656
01:16:38,197 --> 01:16:41,367
-You know about the trucks?
-No, Brian! What trucks?

657
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:45,287
-Jesus Christ. What?
-Listen to me.

658
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,040
Mia, I'm a cop.

659
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:52,253
What are you talking about, Brian?
What is this?

660
01:16:52,336 --> 01:16:55,756
Ever since the first time I met you,
I've been undercover.

661
01:16:57,049 --> 01:16:58,217
I'm a cop.

662
01:17:03,305 --> 01:17:04,932
Oh, you bastard.

663
01:17:07,768 --> 01:17:09,019
You bastard.

664
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:13,232
-Mia.
-Get off of me, Brian!

665
01:17:13,357 --> 01:17:15,067
Mia! Listen to me!

666
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,904
Everything I ever said
I felt about you was real.

667
01:17:19,029 --> 01:17:21,657
I swear to God.
You have to believe me, Mia.

668
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:25,327
But this isn't about you and me.
Your brother's out there to pull a job.

669
01:17:25,453 --> 01:17:28,873
We're running out of time. Those truckers
aren't laying down anymore.

670
01:17:28,998 --> 01:17:32,752
Maybe they'll make it through tonight,
but every law enforcement agency...

671
01:17:32,835 --> 01:17:34,545
...is coming down on them.

672
01:17:34,628 --> 01:17:37,548
If you don't want anything to happen
to them...

673
01:17:37,631 --> 01:17:40,718
...you have to get in that car
with me right now and help me.

674
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:45,598
Mia, you are the only person
that can help me right now.

675
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:49,727
Please, Mia. Please help me.

676
01:18:01,655 --> 01:18:04,492
Civics are stashed somewhere
outside of Thermal.

677
01:18:04,575 --> 01:18:07,828
They wouldn't double back,
and Highway 10 is too well patrolled.

678
01:18:07,953 --> 01:18:10,915
-So, what does that leave us with?
-All this.

679
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,718
-Nextel.
-This is Officer Brian O'Conner.

680
01:18:22,885 --> 01:18:27,264
Serial number 34762.
I need a cell phone trace.

681
01:18:27,473 --> 01:18:30,476
-Okay. What's the cell number?
-Mia, what is it?

682
01:18:32,645 --> 01:18:35,815
Come on, Mia.
She needs Dom's cell phone number now.

683
01:18:39,151 --> 01:18:43,864
323-555-6439.

684
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:47,493
Thank you. Yeah, you get that?

685
01:19:13,728 --> 01:19:17,565
All right, we're one man short.
Letty, I need you on the left side.

686
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:23,195
Your sister's right about this one.
This don't feel good.

687
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:27,450
-Don't do that.
-Something's wrong.

688
01:19:27,533 --> 01:19:30,369
-Stop.
-We shouldn't be doing this without Jesse.

689
01:19:31,495 --> 01:19:34,457
This is the mother lode.
We've been on this for three months.

690
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:37,001
After this, it's a long vacation for everyone.

691
01:19:37,126 --> 01:19:39,086
-Let's go.
-I hope so.

692
01:19:42,631 --> 01:19:45,718
Listen, the other night I had a dream...

693
01:19:46,218 --> 01:19:48,929
...that you and I were
on the beach in Mexico.

694
01:19:49,305 --> 01:19:51,348
-Really?
-Really.

695
01:19:54,518 --> 01:19:56,645
Come on. Let's make this happen.

696
01:19:59,774 --> 01:20:04,236
-Leon, keep on those scanners.
-Copy that.

697
01:20:07,823 --> 01:20:09,867
All right, let's go.

698
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:23,547
Okay, we traced the number
to the northbound 86.

699
01:20:23,631 --> 01:20:28,094
Mile 114, outside Coachella.
We'll keep the trace open, Officer.

700
01:20:28,469 --> 01:20:29,887
Let me see this.

701
01:20:34,683 --> 01:20:36,894
I think we're about 40 miles away.

702
01:20:37,353 --> 01:20:38,979
What are you gonna do?

703
01:20:40,272 --> 01:20:42,233
What are you gonna do?

704
01:21:14,557 --> 01:21:16,600
Okay! Go time!

705
01:21:32,324 --> 01:21:34,785
We're all good.
I got nothing on the scanners.

706
01:21:34,869 --> 01:21:36,120
Keep going.

707
01:21:50,718 --> 01:21:51,886
Vince!

708
01:21:52,553 --> 01:21:54,597
Vince, don't! Get back in!

709
01:21:56,223 --> 01:21:57,308
Vince!

710
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,690
He's got a damn shotgun! Leon!

711
01:22:04,774 --> 01:22:07,068
Back off! Get him off of there!

712
01:22:09,737 --> 01:22:10,988
Oh, shit!

713
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:24,752
Get me off this thing! Pull up!

714
01:22:25,878 --> 01:22:29,215
Unhook yourself. Do it!

715
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:31,550
-Do it!
-I can't get--

716
01:22:31,675 --> 01:22:33,052
You can do it!

717
01:22:34,095 --> 01:22:35,554
Come on, Vince!

718
01:22:43,062 --> 01:22:45,606
Dom! I'm pulling up to distract him!

719
01:22:53,114 --> 01:22:54,573
Come on, boy!

720
01:22:55,783 --> 01:22:57,910
Shot doesn't get better than this.

721
01:23:02,957 --> 01:23:04,208
Son of a bitch!

722
01:23:09,088 --> 01:23:11,382
Take me off here,
or I'll have to unhook the wire!

723
01:23:11,507 --> 01:23:15,761
Try it again. One, two, three!

724
01:23:27,773 --> 01:23:29,358
Unhook yourself!

725
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:32,987
I can't get my arm free!

726
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,281
-Vince, grab my hand!
-My arm!

727
01:23:35,406 --> 01:23:37,199
Listen, give me your hand.

728
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:39,827
I'm gonna pull you off the rig!

729
01:23:42,997 --> 01:23:44,623
Vince!

730
01:23:44,707 --> 01:23:46,667
Hold on!

731
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:48,919
Give me your hand! Listen to me!

732
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,761
Dominic!

733
01:23:56,844 --> 01:23:58,012
Shit!

734
01:24:01,599 --> 01:24:03,726
-Dominic!
-Hang on!

735
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:07,229
Dom! Move out of the way.
I'm coming to get him.

736
01:24:32,338 --> 01:24:33,672
Letty!

737
01:24:34,465 --> 01:24:35,466
Leon!

738
01:24:35,591 --> 01:24:36,675
Pull back for Letty.

739
01:24:36,759 --> 01:24:38,010
Get her out of there!

740
01:24:38,135 --> 01:24:39,553
I'm on it! Go!

741
01:24:48,729 --> 01:24:51,399
I've got her! You get Vince off that truck.

742
01:24:56,737 --> 01:24:58,948
Letty! Come on, baby.

743
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,117
You okay?

744
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,577
Oh, shit. Come on, girl, you all right?

745
01:25:03,702 --> 01:25:07,289
Come on, let me look at you.
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

746
01:25:21,095 --> 01:25:22,596
Vince!

747
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:52,042
Take the wheel.

748
01:25:52,126 --> 01:25:54,837
-What do you mean?
-Put your foot on the gas!

749
01:25:55,588 --> 01:25:57,882
I'm gonna get him.
Put your foot on the gas!

750
01:25:57,965 --> 01:25:59,216
Okay!

751
01:26:02,595 --> 01:26:05,681
-Come on. Keep it steady.
-I got it!

752
01:26:07,224 --> 01:26:09,185
All right, hold on, Vince.

753
01:26:09,977 --> 01:26:12,897
He's having a hard time holding on.
Get me a little closer.

754
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,231
All right.

755
01:26:15,107 --> 01:26:17,234
-Closer.
-I'm moving in.

756
01:26:17,651 --> 01:26:19,236
Hold it right there!

757
01:26:20,071 --> 01:26:21,155
Go!

758
01:26:23,324 --> 01:26:25,868
You got to hang in here with me now!

759
01:26:25,993 --> 01:26:28,120
We'll get you off. Give me your arm!

760
01:26:28,245 --> 01:26:30,372
Vince, look at me! Don't let go!

761
01:26:34,376 --> 01:26:36,921
Come on, Vince!
Throw this arm around me!

762
01:26:37,755 --> 01:26:40,049
Vince, don't let go!

763
01:26:44,303 --> 01:26:46,347
Come on, Mia. Get closer!

764
01:26:51,936 --> 01:26:53,646
Mia, get closer! Come on.

765
01:26:53,729 --> 01:26:55,606
Come on, Vince. Here we go!

766
01:27:23,676 --> 01:27:24,927
Shit.

767
01:27:28,597 --> 01:27:32,101
It's gonna be okay, Letty. I love you.

768
01:27:35,396 --> 01:27:37,022
-Watch her.
-I got her.

769
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:40,484
Come on, Vince! Hang in there! Come on!

770
01:27:44,655 --> 01:27:47,825
If he doesn't get to an ambulance
in 10 minutes, he's dead.

771
01:27:47,908 --> 01:27:50,369
-Hold the pressure. Hold his arm up.
-I got it.

772
01:27:56,292 --> 01:27:59,253
Yeah. Yeah, this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

773
01:27:59,462 --> 01:28:01,922
I'm off-duty MAPD.

774
01:28:02,047 --> 01:28:04,842
I need a life flight roll out right away.

775
01:28:05,968 --> 01:28:10,264
My 20 is Highway 86, mile marker 147.

776
01:28:10,806 --> 01:28:13,809
I got one trauma victim,
about 24 years of age.

777
01:28:13,934 --> 01:28:16,479
Six-foot, maybe 200 pounds.

778
01:28:16,687 --> 01:28:20,441
He's got a deep laceration to his right arm
with arterial bleeding.

779
01:28:20,524 --> 01:28:24,904
And he's got a shotgun wound
close range to his left flank.

780
01:28:26,822 --> 01:28:28,699
Yeah, he's going into shock!

781
01:30:08,799 --> 01:30:10,676
Dom, put the gun down now!

782
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:15,097
-Move your car.
-No bullshit!

783
01:30:15,222 --> 01:30:17,683
Put it down now! No more running!

784
01:30:17,808 --> 01:30:19,351
I'm not running!

785
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,857
-Where's Leon and Letty?
-They're long gone!

786
01:30:24,982 --> 01:30:27,985
Then it's over.
I didn't call the police, but don't push me!

787
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:31,030
-Put the gun down. I swear to God!
-You are the cop!

788
01:30:31,113 --> 01:30:32,531
You're a cop!

789
01:30:34,116 --> 01:30:37,453
Brian, I got to find Jesse before they do.

790
01:30:37,578 --> 01:30:40,456
-I'm all the kid's got.
-I'll call in the plates.

791
01:30:40,539 --> 01:30:44,210
PD will pick him up way before
Johnny even gets near him.

792
01:30:44,418 --> 01:30:47,838
-Move your car.
-Dom, stop it! It's over. Please.

793
01:30:48,005 --> 01:30:49,715
Mia, stay out of it!

794
01:30:55,262 --> 01:30:58,432
Dominic, I am so sorry.

795
01:30:58,849 --> 01:31:01,060
I don't know what I'm doing, Dom.

796
01:31:01,143 --> 01:31:05,397
I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what's going on.

797
01:31:05,481 --> 01:31:08,234
What were you thinking, man?

798
01:31:08,317 --> 01:31:10,778
I don't know! I panicked! I'm sorry.

799
01:31:10,903 --> 01:31:12,780
I'm scared!

800
01:31:12,905 --> 01:31:15,991
I don't know what I'm doing!
Will you please help me?

801
01:31:20,538 --> 01:31:22,039
Dom!

802
01:31:40,891 --> 01:31:42,226
Jesse!

803
01:31:42,309 --> 01:31:43,811
No, Jesse!

804
01:31:58,534 --> 01:32:00,161
No, Dom, no!

805
01:34:55,044 --> 01:34:58,380
Call 911. You call 911!

806
01:35:33,249 --> 01:35:36,001
I used to drag here back in high school.

807
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:40,881
That railroad crossing up there
is exactly a quarter mile away from here.

808
01:35:42,049 --> 01:35:44,677
On green, I'm going for it.

809
01:38:19,248 --> 01:38:21,459
That's not what I had in mind.

810
01:39:08,047 --> 01:39:09,924
You know what you're doing?

811
01:39:10,424 --> 01:39:12,468
I owe you a 10-second car.

812
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,029
I live my life a quarter mile at a time.

813
01:46:30,656 --> 01:46:32,283
Nothing else matters.

814
01:46:33,242 --> 01:46:35,953
For those 10 seconds or less...

815
01:46:37,413 --> 01:46:38,664
...I'm free.
