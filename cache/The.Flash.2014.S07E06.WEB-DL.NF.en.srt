Yeah, of course.

You have no idea how much
that would mean to me.

Really.

808
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,680

Thank you.

I just liked the look,

820
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,743
so I decided to swing
by a thrift store.

821

Picked up these bad boys too.

- This new state liaison
that's auditing CCPD,

825
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,881
her name's Kristen Kramer,

826
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,633
I just found out
that she's here to catch

827
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,010
a dangerous
fugitive meta-human.

- She's here for Killer Frost.

829
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:19,644
- That's not who I am anymore.
- I know.

830
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,730
I just got to find a way
to make her see that.

831
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,317
In the meantime,
you need to lay low.

- Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.

Army Intelligence, Frost.

Xena, Warrior Princess.

I am finally free
to live my own life,

and no one is gonna take that
away from me.

So if this Kristen Kramer
wants to come after me,

then I say bring it on.
