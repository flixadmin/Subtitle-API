1
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,246
Gandía was an animal.

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,958
He could've taken shelter in his den
after hurting two of his prey,

3
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,791
but that would've gone
against his nature.

4
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,211
He was a predator.

5
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,211
And he wasn't going to stop
until he'd finished off the whole flock.

6
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,245
Nairobi.

7
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,671
Fuck!

8
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,036
Rio, Denver, come with me, now.

9
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,538
This links to the bathroom below.

10
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,995
Denver, are you up to crawling in there?

11
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,293
- Sure.
- I'll go too.

12
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,205
Go kill that son of a bitch.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,080
Let's go.

14
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,001
Don't move or I'll kill her!

15
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,455
- Stay still all of you!
- Where did he shoot you?

16
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,581
In my hand.

17
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,666
The next one goes in her head!

18
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,251
- Merry Christmas!
- Why Merry Christmas?

19
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,713
This feels a bit like Christmas, right?

20
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,421
Here we are, setting the table...

21
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,463
the family is coming...

22
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,671
Family? It's the support team.
Manila, the foundry workers...

23
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,420
- But it's good to get to know one another.
- Yeah.

24
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,630
They're like distant cousins.

25
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,210
Know why I came back for this heist?

26
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,915
Before you scattered us
all across the globe,

27
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,128
this gang
was the closest thing to a family

28
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,708
I've ever had.

29
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,383
I've never had a Christmas
like the ones you see in commercials

30
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,288
with the grandma
and the turrón and all that.

31
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,665
- With Axel's dad, didn't you celebrate...
- No.

32
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,043
You know? I...

33
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,503
I had already given up on...

34
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,000
having a family. Completely.

35
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,293
But now I think
there's another way of doing things.

36
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,875
I really want to be a mother.

37
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,830
Do it differently than before,
and have a bunch of kids

38
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,876
and a dog and whatever else.

39
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,498
What you're saying is beautiful, Nairobi.

40
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,286
Would you...?

41
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,788
Would you be the father of my child?

42
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,003
- Look.
- Sorry?

43
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,918
Genetics are very important.

44
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,575
I see you in class,

45
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,171
and I think...

46
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,498
What a brilliant man.

47
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,331
He's so honorable.

48
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,043
So sensitive. So handsome.

49
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,541
And he has principles.

50
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,128
I believe in what you want to do.

51
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,293
That's very flattering.

52
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,326
And as for honorable...
well, that's one way of seeing it.

53
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,286
But you're asking the impossible.

54
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,035
Why? Robbing the Bank of Spain
is impossible.

55
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,455
I'm not asking you to act like a dad,
unless you want to.

56
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,881
I'm asking you for a donation

57
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,381
so I can do things differently.

58
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,500
- No strings attached.
- Nairobi.

59
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:11,173
Look, I set up the Royal Mint heist

60
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,750
in my father's memory.

61
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:18,673
I've set up this one in my brother's.
I'm not the type to let go of attachments.

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'd never be able to stop thinking

63
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,213
that I have a child out there,
somewhere in the world.

64
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,665
- OK.
- I'm sorry.

65
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,786
You set this family up,
and you taught us

66
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,625
to do anything for each other.

67
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,538
- But what you're asking...
- What I'm asking you is the same.

68
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,915
Family members help each other,
no questions asked.

69
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,418
Because it makes you happy
and your life depends on it.

70
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,418
You have your plan, I know.

71
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,630
Well, I have one too.

72
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,246
You've taught me that we help each other.

73
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,793
That's who we are.

74
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,576
Ágata.

75
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:19,785
- I've asked more difficult things of you.
- Well, a bit more, yeah.

76
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:24,958
And I've entered the lion's den,
no questions asked.

77
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,671
I know. I've asked you to do
some very risky things.

78
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,421
Very risky.

79
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,748
Riskier than what you're asking.

80
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,080
Is that a yes?

81
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,916
That's a yes.

82
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,583
Oh, my God!

83
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,753
Come here.

84
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,128
Thank you.

85
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,793
I swear, you'll never regret it.

86
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,998
We'll find the best IVF clinic
in the world.

87
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,793
Or we can do it the natural way.

88
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,665
- The natural way is out of the question.
- Fine.

89
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,250
- We'll leave it to the professionals.
- OK.

90
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,535
And once the heist is over.

91
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,248
OK.

92
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,378
This is going to be amazing.

93
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,166
You're doing really well, mutt.

94
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,328
You look like Jesus Christ.

95
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,380
- How's your hand? Does it hurt?
- I'm loaded with morphine.

96
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,958
- Did you find Tokyo?
- He still has her in the panic room.

97
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,376
We're making a lot of noise.

98
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,170
Let's take our boots off.

99
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:22,996
What was that?

100
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,043
No.

101
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,543
Shit.

102
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,378
Move!

103
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,628
Rio, Denver, you OK?

104
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,880
We have cover.

105
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,326
You can't escape.

106
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,246
Who says I want to escape,
you one-eyed queer?

107
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,828
All the fun is in here.

108
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,166
How many magazines do you have left?

109
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,880
Why don't you come in here and count them?

110
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,173
Bring the drills.
Start drilling holes in the wall.

111
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,078
For each hole,
I'll make another one in you.

112
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,788
He won't touch me.

113
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,251
If he kills me, you kill him.

114
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,673
- And he knows it.
- She's right. We have a chance.

115
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,580
He'll keep shooting her.
It's too risky.

116
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,708
Gandía!

117
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,416
Do you know what?

118
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,665
You're going to be killed by two queers.

119
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,455
What's worse? Being killed by the Serbian
or the one-eyed Argentinian?

120
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,251
Helsinki,
promise you'll kill this bastard.

121
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,673
I promise, Nairobi. I swear I will.

122
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,080
What will your friends
at the shooting club say, Gandía?

123
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,126
You're gonna get killed by a little bear.

124
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,878
Nairobi, save your strength.

125
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,668
You're making my hostage nervous.
And I want her calm.

126
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,210
So we're going to sing.

127
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,081
I want to hear everyone
so I know where you are.

128
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,576
For each person I can't hear singing,
I'll shoot.

129
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,746
Right, Nairobi? Come on, you start.

130
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,541
Do you know, Lord, You Have Come?

131
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,791
Stop fucking kicking me,
for fuck's sake!

132
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:36,955
Sing!

133
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,251
Sing.

134
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,918
<i>You</i>

135
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,461
<i>Have come to the shore</i>

136
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,581
Come on!

137
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,500
<i>Neither searching for</i>

138
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,293
<i>The wise</i>

139
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,915
<i>Nor the rich</i>

140
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,790
I told you to sing!
And anyone who doesn't know it, hum!

141
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,995
<i>Desiring only</i>

142
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:07,083
<i>That I should follow you</i>

143
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,543
<i>Oh, Lord</i>

144
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:15,165
<i>With your eyes set upon me</i>

145
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,126
I can't hear the choir!

146
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,248
<i>I left my boat</i>

147
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,825
<i>On the shore</i>

148
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,455
<i>At your side</i>

149
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,963
<i>I will seek another sea</i>

150
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:38,831
<i>I will seek another sea</i>

151
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,381
That song had a funeral vibe to it.

152
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,581
Our own funeral.

153
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,746
And that slap of reality

154
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,713
began to wake up the Professor.

155
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,670
We're up against the ropes.

156
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,785
Nairobi, TKO.

157
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,293
Tokyo, TKO.

158
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,378
Lisbon, TKO.

159
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:07,956
Professor.

160
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:12,213
I can't think.
I have too many emotional attachments.

161
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,961
I used to have
a gang with city names. Now...

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,290
Now I could have a child,
not with one, but with two of the gang.

163
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,375
Mixing professional
and personal doesn't work.

164
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,498
Tokyo is in the panic room.

165
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,043
And that's precisely where...

166
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,078
Gandía...

167
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,625
wants to get to.

168
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,923
We have to find the room
and ensure there's no way out.

169
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Where would you put a panic room?

170
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,793
A place you need to protect.
Where the gold is.

171
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,785
No.

172
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:53,133
Panic rooms protect lives, not gold.
Whose life is most important there?

173
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,328
- The governor's.
- Exactly.

174
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,246
It must be close to the governor's office.

175
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,713
But why isn't it in the blueprints?

176
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,081
- Perhaps they renovated.
- No.

177
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,790
Palermo, don't answer.

178
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,248
The panic room's
behind the governor's bathroom.

179
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,333
It's not in the blueprints.

180
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:26,076
They must have falsified
the room measurements, but trust me.

181
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,380
I'm sure.

182
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,333
They're singing hymns.

183
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,375
That's a bad omen, right?

184
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,578
These people are eccentric like that.

185
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,076
However, those shots before...

186
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:49,125
could mean the gang is in dire straits,
don't you reckon, Governor?

187
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,498
How would you know?

188
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know.
The shouting, the grenades...

189
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,285
Also, that guy watching us...

190
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,375
I have no fucking clue who he is,
but he doesn't belong to the gang.

191
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,878
We should take advantage of this situation
and tip the scales in our favor.

192
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,578
Even a small push
could mean victory for us.

193
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,876
And if I may, Governor,

194
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,668
I think that small push
is our responsibility, yours and mine.

195
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,250
We must be the ones
to save all these people.

196
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,383
What we must do

197
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,878
is remain calm and wait.

198
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,328
Quiet! If you so much as sigh again,
I'll start shooting.

199
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,495
I'm sorry to disagree with you, Governor,

200
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,503
but it's your responsibility.

201
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,333
You are the governor of the Bank of Spain.

202
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,293
It's your responsibility as a man,
damn it.

203
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,420
Make some decisions, face the problems.

204
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:51,211
As I always say, sometimes it's better
to get up and die on your feet

205
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,501
than to live forever on your knees.

206
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,001
- Know what I think?
- Tell me.

207
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
You're a clown.

208
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,825
You put us all at risk
with your little walks

209
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,626
and your snake-oil salesman spiel.

210
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,830
Leave us in peace.

211
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,495
If you want to die on your feet,
get up and do it.

212
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,415
Grenades, shooting...

213
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,253
All that in six minutes.

214
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,833
And here you are, so calm.
What am I missing?

215
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,246
- I know the same as you, Alicia.
- Liar.

216
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,165
- What's going on in there?
- I don't know.

217
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,880
Why don't we intervene?

218
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,458
If shots are heard,
protocol says we should intervene.

219
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,706
It's Gandía,

220
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,671
- the head of security.
- Shit.

221
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,880
He's on the loose,
armed and acting of his own accord.

222
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,458
Wait a minute. Did you talk to him?

223
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,131
Did you give him the green light
to wage war and kill everyone?

224
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,458
I officially ordered him not to do it.

225
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,461
He said balls to that,
he'd do it in self-defense.

226
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,501
If he wants to defend himself,
I can't stop him.

227
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,213
You're trash, Tamayo.

228
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:15,831
Out there, you're a saint,
worried about your public image,

229
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,576
holding an absurd truce,

230
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,576
while you send a lunatic
to do the dirty work.

231
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,826
If it goes well, you'll take the credit.
If not, you'll say,

232
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,286
I told him, but he was a nutcase.

233
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,825
Us nutcases always do your dirty work.

234
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,286
Do you have a problem
with Gandía waging a guerrilla war?

235
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,415
Or with him sabotaging,
injuring, or killing them?

236
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,580
You don't, right?

237
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,916
Then keep your mouth shut.

238
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,710
Are you thinking?

239
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,211
Yes, I'm thinking.

240
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,081
- What about?
- When was the first time we lost control?

241
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,786
When Gandía didn't go out
with the red boxes.

242
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,205
- The second time?
- I have a problem.

243
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,250
When Lisbon couldn't climb the tree.

244
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,793
Those two mistakes
have put us up against the ropes.

245
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,076
And we need to go back...

246
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,745
and undo them.

247
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,003
I need to exercise to clear my head.
Palermo.

248
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,131
Hold on, you hear me?

249
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,538
Hold on.

250
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,753
Fucking hell!

251
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,420
Mr. Arturo.

252
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,133
I've got something
that may help with that push.

253
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,330
What?

254
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,076
- A phone.
- Hide it.

255
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,916
It's Nairobi's.
The one the police sent in.

256
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,876
I found it while cleaning.

257
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,080
You'll know what to do with it.

258
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,076
What the fuck's going on there?

259
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,666
If I hear so much as a sigh,
I'll shoot.

260
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,916
Sir, I need to use the bathroom.
Now.

261
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,578
Now's not the time.

262
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,996
No one is leaving this place,
so sit down and relax.

263
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,036
After you.

264
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,671
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

265
00:19:56,333 --> 00:20:01,503
- What's going on, Daniel? I was eating...
- No, not Daniel. Here, I'm Denver.

266
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,036
OK? Denver.

267
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,955
I'm sorry,
I'm not used to your new identity.

268
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,880
Well, about that...

269
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,503
There are a few things...

270
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,328
that I'd like to understand,
and it's not easy for me.

271
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,206
Ask away. I'm the same person.

272
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,751
You're not exactly the same person.
You have boobs now.

273
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,375
- Well...
- You have boobs.

274
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,128
- Yes, I do.
- You're a woman, I understand that part.

275
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,288
Are you gay as well?
Or how does it work?

276
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:42,245
So what you're worried about right now
is whether I like men or not, is that it?

277
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,173
Yes.

278
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,245
I like men, to be honest.
I like them very much.

279
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,633
Mind you, not just any type of man.

280
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,075
I like them strong, you know?
The kind that go to the gym.

281
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,746
Tough guys, but well-read too,
so I can learn from them.

282
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,381
The type that watch football.
But in a macho way, you know?

283
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:08,208
Beer in hand, legs spread wide,
and their hand on their groin.

284
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,001
OK, I get it. It's clear.

285
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,631
But...

286
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,001
have you always liked men?

287
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,786
Or was this
a result of becoming a woman?

288
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,825
First of all,

289
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,666
I've always been a woman.

290
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,330
No.

291
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,876
No, you haven't.

292
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,538
I did robberies with you.
You weren't a woman.

293
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,375
How does a woman rob?
By scratching and pulling hair?

294
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,668
I'm not a caveman.

295
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,580
But, I mean, at the end of the day,
you can spot a woman.

296
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,826
When I did a robbery,
I went with Juanito, not a woman.

297
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,000
Maybe this thing about being a woman
happened later.

298
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,416
Listen.

299
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,381
Juanito would finish a robbery
with you...

300
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,418
and go back home, to his room.

301
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,916
He'd put some music on,

302
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,416
he'd roll a joint,

303
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,418
and he'd put some red lipstick on,
a wonderful lipstick I had.

304
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,670
It was Ferrari red.

305
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,416
He'd take his joint

306
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,330
and lie on the bed.

307
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,420
And right there, in those moments,

308
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,171
all alone, relaxed,
and looking gorgeous...

309
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,540
that was when I was really myself.

310
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,076
- You've always been a woman?
- Always.

311
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,170
And I never noticed?

312
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,540
Do you know who made me
really horny back then?

313
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,461
- Of course I do.
- Really?

314
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,581
David Beckham.
You talked about him all damn day.

315
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,376
Beckham made me horny too,
always has, but no.

316
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,168
You. You turned me on so much.

317
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,883
No, I didn't.

318
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,328
- I was in love with you.
- Don't joke about love.

319
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:01,706
Why do you think
I followed you around, doing jobs?

320
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,131
To be near you.

321
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,208
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

322
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,291
I used to grope you on the bike.

323
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,705
You didn't notice,
but I'd grab onto your leg and back...

324
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,291
And your scent drove me wild.

325
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,285
Don't you realize this is serious?

326
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,415
You were taking advantage of me.

327
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,543
I'm pulling your leg,
you dickhead. I mean...

328
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,625
Fucking hell.

329
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,291
Give me a hug, come on.

330
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,415
Excuse me, sir,
but I can't wait any longer.

331
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,380
Nobody move!
I don't want to hear a sound!

332
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,710
Miguel, listen.

333
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,001
We need to establish communication
with the outside.

334
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,083
OK?

335
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,670
Here, hide it.

336
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,003
They've got me in their sights.
You're OK.

337
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,290
- What are you doing here?
- What the fuck?

338
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,958
What's happening? Where's Denver?

339
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,541
- He's fine.
- Who's there?

340
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,170
- It's a hostage.
- Take her away.

341
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,250
- Come on.
- Like hell, I'm staying.

342
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,173
Give me a gun.

343
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,500
You're not here for this, Manila.
Go.

344
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,713
You're in trouble. Give me a gun.

345
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,286
Get out of here right now.

346
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,746
Come on, damn it.

347
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:39,956
Stay calm.

348
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:52,213
From now on, you and I will be
the backbone of the resistance.

349
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,213
My mouth went dry just hearing that.

350
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,170
Denver.

351
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,826
It's four seconds at most.

352
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,543
One advances,
the other provides cover fire.

353
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,785
And we save Nairobi.

354
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,575
Tell us what you want, Gandía.
Let's negotiate.

355
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,626
Negotiate?
Look, let me explain the situation.

356
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,125
Option one.

357
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:27,668
I come out with the gun to Nairobi's head.

358
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,918
You stay up against the right wall.

359
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,416
I let her go, and nobody dies.

360
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:37,381
It's a good deal for both of us.
Zero-zero. A tie.

361
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,125
Option two.

362
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,378
Instead of me coming out, you come in.

363
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,711
I blow Nairobi's head off.

364
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,495
You shoot me.

365
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,380
But I'd still have a free hand
to shoot back,

366
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,458
and I swear,
I'll take out more than one of you.

367
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:56,041
You forgot option three.
Come out on your knees, unarmed.

368
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,285
You surrender and give us Nairobi. 

369
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,955
That's a tie too. How's that?

370
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,581
I won't kneel,
not even before God Almighty.

371
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,666
I'll give you one minute.
Then, I start shooting.

372
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,420
I may well win six-zero.

373
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,923
What an asshole.

374
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,126
Gandía, darling, you couldn't do that.

375
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,043
You're an idiot.

376
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:19,415
The other day,
I turned up with my friend,

377
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,250
and we got you good.

378
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,583
Shut up.

379
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:26,996
Tokyo really got you
with the water trick.

380
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,463
Nairobi, shut up.

381
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,706
- The door handle hit you in the face...
- Shut up.

382
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,461
And knocked you out.

383
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:36,461
Why is she doing that?

384
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,791
Where are your macho balls now?

385
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,995
- So clumsy.
- She wants to save Tokyo.

386
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,633
You're useless.

387
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,381
She knows if he kills her,
we'll kill him.

388
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:52,128
You've spent your whole life
waiting for this moment, right?

389
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,578
With your well-trained little soldiers.

390
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,536
And two chicks show up
and get you real good.

391
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,245
- Should I shoot you now?
- Surprise me.

392
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,290
Should I put a bullet in your ass?

393
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,495
We have to get her out now.

394
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,633
If we let him out,

395
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,788
he'll do whatever he wants.
I don't trust him.

396
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,575
- We have to hold on.
- Why do you want to?

397
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:29,706
She's there because of you.
You freed that butcher.

398
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,381
We have to get her out.

399
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,165
Do you all agree?

400
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:38,915
OK, Gandía.

401
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,168
We're letting you out.

402
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:43,041
OK, good.

403
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,706
This is how it'll go.

404
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,211
You'll see Nairobi the whole time.

405
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:51,291
We'll walk forward with my gun
to her head

406
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:55,325
once she confirms you're all
up against the wall on the right.

407
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:59,326
Starting with
those two fucking kids up there!

408
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:04,076
Did you hear that?
You have to come down.

409
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,290
OK.

410
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:22,325
Earlier you asked me
if sleeping with me made my husband sick,

411
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,536
and I didn't reply.

412
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,831
No. I didn't make him sick.

413
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,330
Because I wasn't a bitch then.

414
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,375
But now I am.

415
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,043
And yes, we had sex.

416
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,285
Everywhere.

417
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,625
And highly creative sex.

418
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:52,496
I guess you and the Professor are
more the type to do it once every 30 days.

419
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:55,543
Missionary position,
even though you're billionaires.

420
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:59,961
All that poison inside you
is eating away at you, Alicia.

421
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,208
I can see it in your face.

422
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,630
What's wrong with it?

423
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,456
You're a caricature of yourself,
going on about sex. What's wrong?

424
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:16,331
Is it the hormones?
Try downloading an app.

425
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,826
There are tons of perverts
who want to fuck pregnant women.

426
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,876
I like to get to know them first.

427
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,998
I don't go off with the first hipster
who comes along,

428
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,043
gives me his number, and says...

429
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:30,751
Hey, gorgeous,
why don't you come to my storehouse

430
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,003
to try my cider? It's very tasty.

431
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,083
Know what it is?

432
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,330
No, tell me.

433
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,786
If your mask slips, you crumble.

434
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:43,328
You're in danger of collapse.
And I get it.

435
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,495
I'm not the one in a mask.

436
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:52,075
Let's see, earlier, we had a deal.

437
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,286
You were holding the phone,

438
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,285
and you backed out.

439
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,633
What happened?

440
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:03,076
I made you waste your time
while you were questioning me.

441
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,746
I pretended
you were slowly wearing me down,

442
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,333
that I was giving in.

443
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:11,996
In the meantime, the Professor
escaped your cordon.

444
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,833
It's called diversion tactics.

445
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,626
And it worked.

446
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,880
Do you know what I think?

447
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,330
Your little shepherd
somehow made it in time.

448
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,076
I'll find out.

449
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,293
Come on.

450
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,498
- Think.
- I knew we weren't in Spain.

451
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:54,205
- I could hear the call to prayer.
- Think, you can do it.

452
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,211
Fly with me.

453
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,496
Shakir.

454
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:09,788
Can you hear me?

455
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,750
Yes, Shakir speaking, Professor.

456
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,463
I need you to track Rio's flight to Spain.

457
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,671
It's a Spanish Air Force
Beechcraft Air King 250.

458
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,330
The flight landed at 16:30 on April 4.

459
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:24,076
Check all the air navigation satellites.

460
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,706
I need the exact point of origin.

461
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,875
Does it have battery?

462
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,711
- It does.
- And signal?

463
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,830
Yes, sir.

464
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,746
OK, go to the call log.

465
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:48,883
Miguel, you need to keep a cool head, OK?

466
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,208
They don't suspect you at all.

467
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:54,081
- Yes, but my fingers are sweating.
- Stay calm.

468
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,921
- There's a call from a hidden number.
- Go to contacts.

469
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:04,998
There's a number.

470
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,458
Call it.

471
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,380
I hope nobody answers.

472
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,331
It's Nairobi's phone.

473
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,830
- What are you doing?
- I won't talk.

474
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,786
- Fuck.
- They hung up.

475
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,211
I'm leaving my fingerprints.
I'm not calling the cops.

476
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,131
Listen.

477
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:29,748
You just need to leave
the call connected

478
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,173
and hold a normal conversation,
between hostages.

479
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,790
They'll know what to do.

480
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:36,923
Understood?

481
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,875
They're calling again.

482
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,208
- Speak.
- So...

483
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,166
we're here,

484
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,630
in the library.

485
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,538
All the hostages.

486
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:57,745
Being watched by just one of the gang,
a guy called Matías.

487
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,713
- Turn the volume up.
- I think it's Arturo Román.

488
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,921
There's no one in the lobby, right?

489
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,208
No one.

490
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:08,711
I've lost my voice.

491
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,878
And since Gandía is free,

492
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,828
it'd be the perfect time
for the police to go in.

493
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,583
Because, I repeat,
there's no one in the lobby.

494
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,956
They've been decimated.
There have been shots, grenades,

495
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,421
shouting, and hymns, right, Miguel?

496
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,330
That's right.

497
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:29,455
Sorry.

498
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:36,828
- We have to go in.
- The Presidency says no more armored vans.

499
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:40,456
They're looking the other way.
We'll catch them off guard.

500
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,711
I can't.

501
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,210
What the fuck are you doing?

502
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:47,581
It's this kid.
He's very nervous. He's lost it.

503
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,206
Poor guy, he was praying.

504
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,671
- He seemed... I don't know.
- Come on.

505
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:56,043
Over here, in silence and close to me.

506
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,628
You, hands where I can see them.

507
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:03,208
Lower them an inch, and I'll shoot you.
Move an inch, and I'll shoot you.

508
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,456
Say a fucking word...

509
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,671
- And you'll shoot me.
- That's right.

510
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,420
- I might just shoot you anyway.
- Come on.

511
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:12,921
Behave.

512
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:20,286
Suárez! Prepare an intervention unit.
We'll go in through the lobby.

513
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,955
Call Gandía in the panic room
to coordinate.

514
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,881
Thank God.
You're finally showing you have balls.

515
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:39,916
Professor.

516
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,455
The Beechcraft Air King 250

517
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:47,831
that brought Rio to Spain
took off from Algeria at 15:03 hours,

518
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,036
from a town called Timimoun.

519
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,673
It's in the Atlas Mountains.

520
00:34:58,916 --> 00:34:59,876
Good.

521
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:03,538
Minutes earlier, they'd have driven him
to the aircraft.

522
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,625
Find that car.

523
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,250
I see it's a desert. No trees.

524
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,633
So you can go back through the images

525
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,828
- to see where the car came from.
- OK.

526
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,996
We'll use the weather satellites.

527
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,003
Very good.

528
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,713
Go to Algeria.
I want you in Timimoun in four hours.

529
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,631
I can't fly with weapons.

530
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,328
I know.
You'll get backup once you arrive.

531
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,540
The plan was to not leave you.

532
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,955
The plan has just changed, Marseille.

533
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,751
I need to bring together
the Serbs and Benjamín's team

534
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,253
and go on the offensive.

535
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,043
We'll strike them everywhere,
so hard and fast,

536
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,205
they won't know which way is up.

537
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,041
How are you?

538
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,753
My stitches...

539
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,125
have come undone.

540
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,170
Where is he?

541
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:16,455
I don't know.

542
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:18,706
Where is he?

543
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,131
Denver...

544
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,670
I don't know.

545
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:35,381
We're here, fucking scumbag.

546
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,788
Where's the other one?

547
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:39,785
I'm here.

548
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,170
Very well.
I'll start cutting Nairobi loose.

549
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,076
Mutt.

550
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,665
Want to say anything before the dance?

551
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,420
No? Well...

552
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,710
- Party time?
- Party time.

553
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,753
Nairobi.

554
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,923
Sleepyhead.

555
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,126
You're brave, asleep up here

556
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:22,958
with everyone at the table
waiting for you.

557
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,331
Come on, wake up.

558
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,293
Hey.

559
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,460
What?

560
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,630
He said yes.

561
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:34,995
The Professor.

562
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,920
He said yes.

563
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,876
- You're going to be an aunt!
- An aunt!

564
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:47,246
- I'm so happy for you.
- I can't believe it.

565
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:48,421
Hey.

566
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,960
- What?
- You'll have a little genius.

567
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:53,041
Yes.
We're going to name them...

568
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,830
What?

569
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,210
Ibiza.

570
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,458
My God, I love it. Ibiza.

571
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:04,751
I love it.

572
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,003
Call them Ibiza...

573
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,961
and you know
you'll have so much fun together.

574
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,751
Fuck, they'll be so popular at school.

575
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,133
But it's not a city, it's an island.

576
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:18,418
Do you know what other rule
we're going to break?

577
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,920
Not seeing each other.

578
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,540
You'll be their aunt.

579
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,963
Look, you know what?

580
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,711
You'll be their godmother.

581
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:27,538
Yes, darling.

582
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,245
- I'm so looking forward to it.
- So am I.

583
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:34,543
So am I.

584
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,246
I can't believe it.

585
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,166
What?

586
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,245
- Ibiza, right?
- Of course.

587
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,253
No more spending Christmas
alone with Helsinki.

588
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,543
He doesn't know any Christmas carols.

589
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,825
From now on,
Christmas will be spent with family.

590
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,206
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

591
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,881
Party for a single mother.

592
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,080
Are you pregnant?

593
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:06,626
- Yes! No, after the heist.
- I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

594
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,128
Me neither.

595
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,328
- What?
- It's a friend with benefits.

596
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,206
Want to know the baby's name?

597
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:14,461
- Ibiza!
- Ibiza!

598
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,253
Mutt.

599
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:42,923
I want you all against the wall.
Lower your weapons.

600
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,996
I'd ask you to put them on the ground,

601
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:50,253
but I know myself. If I see you unarmed,
I might get carried away.

602
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:53,003
So let's show some mutual respect.

603
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,455
Lower them.

604
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:56,791
Come on.

605
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,083
I'm aiming at her head.

606
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:03,211
I have a bulletproof vest.
She's tied up.

607
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,213
You won't get me.

608
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,581
Come on, let's go.

609
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,253
Lower the fucking gun, idiot!

610
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,583
Didn't you hear me?

611
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,133
That's it.

612
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:24,833
Slowly.

613
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,708
Shall we dance?

614
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:33,251
Come on, let's dance.

615
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,583
You're falling, darling.

616
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,423
Sorry.

617
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,665
Look at your big man.
Hello, big man.

618
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,416
That's enough.

619
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,576
Let her go now.

620
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,876
Take it easy.

621
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,083
Easy.

622
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,876
I'm about to let her go.
Take it easy.

623
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,458
I'm about to let her go.

624
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,041
Here we go.

625
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,036
That's it.

626
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:21,831
Mutt.

627
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,708
I said I was going to kill you.

628
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,173
No!
