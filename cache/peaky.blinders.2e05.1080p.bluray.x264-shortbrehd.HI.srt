you might have seen that
the Home Secretary has got himself

162
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,965
into a bit of a fizz
about certain moral issues.

163
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,646
Prostitution.

164
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,011
Protection, racketeering, drinking,
cocaine and, of course,

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,411
gambling.

166
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,725
And he's demanded results.

167
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,566
You offered me protection.

168
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,882
You promised me protection.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,528
Well, no, you see, it was Mr Churchill
that made you that promise.

170
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,282
And the Home Secretary
outranks him, so...

171
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,971
And I can hardly be blamed
if your demented brother

172
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,283
decides to go on some sort
of blood orgy during dinner.

173
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,441
Do not fucking lie to me.

174
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,042
Do not sit here
in your fucking church and lie to me!

175
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,529
You will need to contain your emotions
or this meeting is at an end.

176
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,885
Good.

177
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,005
That's better.

178
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,521
So...

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,482
Let us review the new situation.

180
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,723
I have your brother in a prison cell,

181
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,281
charged with the murder
of Billy Kitchen.

182
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,408
The case against him is strong.

183
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,642
And I have no doubt
that his destiny is to hang.

184
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,727
And then there is Polly's son Michael.

185
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,762
He has already admitted to helping
Arthur burn down the Marquis Pub.

186
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,323
Oh, he was
a tough nut to crack, that boy.

187
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,526
But crack he did.

188
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,448
So I have your brother facing the noose.

189
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,091
I have your cousin facing
five years for arson.

190
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,962
And I have
your entire organisation in disarray

191
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,764
in Birmingham and in London.

192
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,001
What do you want?

193
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,686
What do I want?

194
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,280
I don't understand.

195
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,280
I've already agreed

196
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,642
to do your fucking killing for you.

197
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,248
Now what is it you want from me?

198
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,843
Oh. There you go, you see...

199
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,489
An agreement is not the same thing
as an assurance, now, is it?

200
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,281
See, I found that

201
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,083
I wasn't sleeping so well.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,240
And it wasn’t just that...

203
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,171
...the smell and the noise
in that room, no.

204
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,448
It was the nagging doubt.
The knowledge.

205
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,765
The knowledge that...

206
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,325
Tommy Shelby is not afraid to die.

207
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,164
And therefore,

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,844
the threat to your own life
might not be enough

209
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,082
to make it certain that
you will obey me on the given day.

210
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,729
I needed also the power
of life and death over your family

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,446
and that I now have.

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,766
Your brother, your cousin
and your sister.

213
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,083
I've known her address in Primrose Hill
since the day she moved in.

214
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,602
Now she is safe only as long
as I want her to be.

215
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,089
I've been ahead of you,
every step of the way.

216
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,604
And, as my father used to say,

217
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,566
to make sure your dog obeys you,
you have to show it the stick

218
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,804
once in a while.

(PHONE RINGING)

220
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,489
Tommy, Arthur's in solitary confinement.
Michael's in remand wing...

221
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,166

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,321
Yes, Grace.

227
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,890
I think you called.

228
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,846
I haven't slept.

229
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,483
Grace, this is not a good time.

230
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,406
<i>I can call you back.</i>

231
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,602
- No, no, it's fine. It's all right.
-Can we meet?

232
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,642
Yes, we'll meet.

233
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,646
When?

234
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,607
Grace, there are some things
I have to do first.

(DOOR OPENING)

236
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,440
John?

237
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,961
Coppers have lifted
10 of our men in Camden town,

238
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,205
the rest of them on the run.

239
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,283
- Tom, they've taken Michael.
-Business first.

240
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,330
- They took Michael last night.
-Polly, business first!

241
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,681
John?

242
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,680
They took all our whisky.

243
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,443
So no doubt
they'll be supping that for Christmas.

244
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,449
They've impounded all our vans,

245
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,324
put their own locks on the warehouse.

246
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,681
The Eden Club and all our pubs
have been raided by the coppers

247
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,641
and handed back to Sabini and Solomons.

248
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,241
The Black Country boys think
it was Arthur who killed Billy

249
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,163
because that's what
the coppers told them.

250
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,406
So there'll be no more free passes
for our whisky boats.

251
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,084
I don't give a fuck about whisky.

252
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,969
I don't give a fuck about Billy Kitchen.

253
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,369
I want my son out of prison now.

254
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,805
Thomas, I spoke to Johnny Dogs.

255
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,644
This meeting should just be family.

256
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,643
- I can help.
-It's family only, she's not blood.

257
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,722
- Let her speak.
-Tommy! Or is this a business...

258
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,847
Enough!

259
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,724
Enough, Polly.

Esme.

261
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,128
I spoke to Johnny Dogs.
The Lees are kin.

262
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,362
- The bloody Lees!
-They can give us men.

263
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,249
We don't need more fucking men.

264
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,769
It's men that have done
the damage. It's...

265
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,406
It is men fighting like cockerels that
have put us here in the first place.

266
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,120
Esme, I'll take up their offer.
We need men.

267
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,681
If Michael ever gets out of prison,

268
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,001
I am taking him away
from this family, for good.

269
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,008
This life is bad.

270
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,082
This life is all bad.

-Shut up and walk.

Should I go and speak
to Queen Mary Lee at the Black Patch?

275
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,646
Yes.

for a few nights.

Your gypsy half is the stronger.

You just want to ride away.

284

France is the new place
for us, they say.

285

and spent shells and things.

Now,

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,206
what would prompt me
to do you such a favour, hmm?

323
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,291
What do you want?

324
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,321
Information?

325
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,241
You mean inside information about
Tommy Shelby's criminal empire?

326
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,531
With respect,

327
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,210
I would say I know more
about Tommy's dealings than you do.

328
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,122
He doesn't trouble the family with
Irish business for instance, does he?

329
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,407
No.

330
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,691
So, no.

A glass or two of rum.

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,484
talk about old times,

460
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,925
drink some whisky.

461
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,969
And I was gonna tell you

462
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,606
I hadn't spent a day

463
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,966
without thinking about you.

464
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,530
And then we were gonna go upstairs

00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,531
I changed me mind.

468
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,570
So just have one drink

469
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,130
tell me how happy you are in New York

and then you can go.

-Mmm.

and he's kind to you?

And now I feel like an idiot.

488
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,371
Well, then, go.

489
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,646
Jesus.

490
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,161
(SIGHS)

491
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,924
Well, you're still here.

492
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,241
Are you so certain?

493
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,689
That you're still in love with me?

494
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,686
I was.

495
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,006
But I'm not any more.

496
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,884
You're not armed, Grace, are you?

497
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,805
No, I'm not armed.

498
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,324
I don't carry guns.
I don't have to.

499
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,687
You don't have a sense of humour
any more, either.

500
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,450
What are you talking about?

501
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,683
The thing is, I hate reunions.

502
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,602
I didn't want to sit here
for hours talking about nothing

503
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,490
and dancing around
what we really want to say.

504
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,845
So now,

505
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,081
I know you're happy in New York.

506
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,322
I know your husband's rich
and sweet and kind to you.

507
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,402
I know you're unarmed.

508
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,442
And you didn't come here for sex
because you don't love me any more.

509
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,724
And it's only three minutes past.

510
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,371
Another drink?

511
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,484
I'll take that as a yes.

512
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,760
(SIGHS) It's good to see you, Grace.

513
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,889
So you didn't light the fire?

514
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,924
You see, my real plan

515
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,884
was that we go out.

516
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,170
I want to impress you.

517
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,360
Now,

518
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,804
do you like Charlie Chaplin?

519
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,971
Yes, I like Charlie Chaplin.

520
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,521
Good.

521
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,047
I bet you've never heard
Charlie Chaplin speak.

522
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,570
I thought you were taking me
to see Charlie Chaplin.

523
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,687
I am.

524
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,650
- This isn't a picture house.
-No, it's not a picture house.

525
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,769
(CHUCKLES) So how will
I see Charlie Chaplin?

526
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,850
You will see him and you will hear him,
just like I promised.

527
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,724
There you go. There's Chaplin.

528
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,404
- Oh, my God. That's him.
-Mmm-hmm.

529
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,005
That's really Charlie Chaplin in person.

530
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,129
Yep. He's in England
promoting his film.

531
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,690
And how the hell
do you know Charlie Chaplin?

532
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,570
I don't.
I know his bodyguard, Wag McDonald.

533
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,844
It's that chap there.

534
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,725
Wag was a bookie in Birmingham,
then he went to Los Angeles.

535
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,368
You see, Wag is also Romani gypsy,

536
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,647
as is Chaplin, but he keeps it a secret.

537
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,483
Chaplin was born on the Black Patch,
a gypsy camp in Birmingham.

538
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,363
That's why he gave Wag the job,
even though Wag was on the run.

539
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,726
Thank you.

540
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,446
Thank you.
See, we all have our secrets, Grace.

541
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,522
Come on. I'll introduce you.

542
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,923
Hello, Wag.
Mr Chaplin, this is Grace.

543
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,562
GRACE: Hello, Mr Chaplin.

544
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,291
(PHONE RINGING)

545
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,561
- Hello.
- TOMMY: <i>Hello, Mr Campbell.</i>

546
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,162
<i>Uh, you said you knew
my sister's address in Primrose Hill,</i>

547
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,688
<i>so I expect you have men
watching the house,</i>

548
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,364
<i>see who comes and goes.</i>

549
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,800
Well, tonight your men
will see me return to the house

550
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,484
with a very beautiful woman.

551
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,646
She will stay
until just before midnight.

552
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,287
Of course, I'll close the curtains.

553
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,046
Can you guess who the woman is?

554
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,487
Liar!

555
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,284
Sleep well, Mr Campbell.

556
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,005
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

557
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,810
(WHISPERING) Tommy.

558
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,209
Tommy, do you have someone?

559
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,124
It's too late, Tommy.

560
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,685
It's 11:00, Grace.

561
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,444
I mean, it's too late.

562
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,569
If you'd come with me to New York...

563
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,164
I have things to do.

564
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,967
You mean the coin landed the wrong way?

565
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,289
It couldn't have worked.

566
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,524
That was a question.

567
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,881
Hey.

568
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,402
Tommy, do you have someone?

569
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,410
I have a racehorse.

570
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,921
She's gonna win the derby.

571
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,287
I'll drive you.
(CLEARS THROAT)

572
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,525
When do you sail back?

573
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,691
We don't know yet.

574
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,009
You don't have a return ticket?

575
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,044
This wasn't right, Tommy.

576
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,403
When do you go back, Grace?

577
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,364
They're doing tests on us.

578
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,688
I don't know when they'll be finished.

579
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,850
We're having treatment.

580
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,689
A doctor on Harley Street.

581
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,563
Some new thing, a breakthrough.

582
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,809
We're trying for a baby.

583
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,562
Why did you come here tonight?

584
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,645
The doctor believes
it's surely me who's at fault.

585
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,721
I'm sorry.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,641
It's no one's fault.

588
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,848
I'm tired of that, Tommy.

589
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,845
Can I see you again?

590
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,560
(SOFTLY) Grace.

591
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,087
You're used to working undercover, eh?

592
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,442
I've never lied to him once.

593
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,044
So tell him the truth.

594
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,725
Put your arms up.

595
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,168
Oh, what've we got here then?

(GATE OPENING)

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,325
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

598
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,771
Oh, here he is.

599
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,843
The King of London Town.

600

You been enjoying yourself?

601
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,565
Oh, yeah, it's fucking great.

602
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,722
Surrounded by Sabini's men.

603
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,445
Rats everywhere.

604
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,850
Fucking cockneys.

605
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,162
Well, at least you're going
to get what you've always wanted.

606
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,761
And what's that?

607
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,002
Well, you tried to hang yourself twice.

608
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,684
Now the King is gonna do it for you.

- I've been a fuckin' idiot.
-Yeah.

611
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,929
I haven't appreciated nothing, John.

612
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,490
Are you fucking repenting or something?

613
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,925
Drawing.

614
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,841
I used to be good at drawing.

615
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,491
Arthur, please, for God's sake,
I don't need this.

616
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,289
I should have listened more in class.

617
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,806
What fucking class?
You were never there.

618
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,963
I used to draw horses.

619
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,482
- Arthur...
-Stallions.

620
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,410
- Great big ones.
-Arthur.

621
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,966
- They looked real.
-Not stallions. Not now.

622
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,326
I should have done more
with me life, John.

623
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,649
- Good things.
-Arthur, for God's sake...

624
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,960
Even Ada said it wasn't my fault.

Arthur, will you listen?

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,250
- They're gonna hang me, John.
-They're not gonna hang you.

627
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,651
Says who?

628
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,925
Tommy.

629
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,006
And how is Houdini
gonna get me out of this?

630
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,971
- Well, we...
-Don't tell me. He's got a plan.

631
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,609
But you don't know
what that plan is, do you, John?

632
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,761
I do...

633
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,569
'Cause we just can't be trusted.

634
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,406
All right.

635
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,371
If he's so fucking clever,
why am I in here?

636
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,566
Well, it's...

637
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,450
Why is all our men
and half our whisky been lifted?

638
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,966
Hmm?

639
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,168
The Jew and the cockney
have run rings round him.

640
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,969
- Will you shut up?
-Look at you. Look.

641
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,089
- A big fucking man...
-Fucking shut up!

642
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,762
He's already told me
what I've got to do.

643
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,682
What business have you got here?

644
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,205
I just pulled over.

645
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,681
I never smoke and drive, you know?

646
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,842
- Where are you from?
-I'm from Ireland,

647
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,807
the beautiful north
where the rocks sing in the wind.
