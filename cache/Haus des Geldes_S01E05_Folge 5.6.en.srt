1
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,359
<i>-I’m waiting for instructions.
-I have a clear shot.</i>

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,160
-What the fuck are you doing?
-There are fucking snipers!

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,000
-On your knees!
<i>-They’re aiming.</i>

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,960
-Give me the go.
<i>-They’re going to execute them.</i>

5
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,280
<i>They’re going to shoot.</i>

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,600
Put the gun down!

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,719
<i>They’re going to kill them.</i>

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,320
Open fire.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,079
-Condor three, open fire.
-Behind you!

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,679
SATURDAY
06:00 P.M.

11
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:55,560
Good! Good, Mr Torres. Good. Very good.

12
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,000
But now let’s change the series, okay?

13
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
Let’s change the letter, all right?

14
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,079
Another country. Don’t complain. Come on.

15
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,800
Helsinki! Get downstairs! Hurry!

16
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,439
-What do we have?
-He’s seriously injured. Hurry up!

17
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,000
You killed her, motherfuckers!

18
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,639
Hurry up.

19
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,719
Water, please.

20
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,479
-Water, please.
-Water.

21
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,240
Thanks. Arturo, hold on tight. Rio!

22
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,680
Alcohol.

23
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,800
I need you to take his hand off...

24
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,599
Raquel.

25
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,759
<i>Ex-employees of the Royal Mint</i>

26
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,120
<i>have revealed the identity
of the man wounded by the police.</i>

27
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,919
<i>It’s Arturo Roman,
the general manager of the Royal Mint,</i>

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,400
<i>who was just injured
by the police forces</i>

29
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,759
<i>while on the roof with the robbers.</i>

30
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,599
<i>These events took place
32 hours into the heist.</i>

31
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,199
HOUR 32 OF THE HEIST

32
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,199
I need to talk to my wife, please.

33
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,800
I need to talk to my wife.

34
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,680
<i>They say that when we’re at Death’s door,</i>

35
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,400
<i>we’re finally able
to see our life clearly.</i>

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,159
<i>And Arturo Roman, losing blood on a table,</i>

37
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,160
<i>was waiting for that: Death's wisdom...</i>

38
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,519
<i>to find out once and for all
who the love of his life had been.</i>

39
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,319
<i>Laura, the woman he had shared
14 years of holy matrimony with?</i>

40
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,240
<i>Or Monica, his secretary and lover,
who made him feel young?</i>

41
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,800
<i>Unfortunately, the only certainty
Arturo had at that moment</i>

42
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,279
<i>was that,
if they didn’t getthe bullet out,</i>

43
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,560
<i>he’d croak before solving the enigma.</i>

44
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,800
<i>And, frankly, our first aid courses
weren’t guaranteed to save anyone.</i>

45
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,079
Inferior vena cava.

46
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,519
Right renal vein.

47
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,439
Left.

48
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
Mesenteric.

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,600
Right pulmonary vein. Left.

50
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,839
This is the heart.

51
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
The cava.

52
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,079
Subclavian, right and left.

53
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,839
Brachial.

54
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,319
Humeral.

55
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,680
Internal jugular.

56
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,680
External jugular.

57
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,600
And the main arteries in red.

58
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,240
Hey, stop.

59
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,839
Let’s see.

60
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,079
You want us to learn medical science
with two markers?

61
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,000
If anyone is shot,
he can't go to a hospital.

62
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,639
You have to manage inside.

63
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,680
-It’ll be suicide.
-Shut the fuck up.

64
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,199
It's one thing to lock ourselves
in that death trap.

65
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,360
-It's another to kill each other.
-Denver.

66
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,720
We’re asking you to learn
how to take out a bullet.

67
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,879
-Don’t be dramatic.
-It’s not that hard.

68
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,600
Use the tweezers
without fucking anything else up.

69
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,240
The shot already fucked it up.

70
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,560
If they shoot me, take me to the hospital.

71
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,000
The answer is no.

72
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,040
Well, I prefer being crippled and free
over being healthy in prison.

73
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,160
Nobody leaves.

74
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,639
Each of you is a clue that can be used.

75
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,240
If somebody wants out, now is the time.

76
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,240
You'll stay here until the heist is over.

77
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,800
Is this lesson long?

78
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,680
My dick's shrinking like Helsinki’s.

79
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,759
Hey! What did you say about my dick?

80
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,800
-Enough.
-Do you want to see it?

81
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,759
Please.

82
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,319
Come on, get dressed.
Give someone else a turn.

83
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,319
-Mr. Dick.
-Come on.

84
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,360
-No?
-Well, there we go.

85
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,639
-Well...
-Come on, Nairobi.

86
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,720
-It’s all right.
-Come on, Nairobi!

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,959
So sexy!

88
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,680
Go on. Let’s see what you've learned.

89
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,959
This is the carotid...

90
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,360
<i>And so, while playing doctor,</i>

91
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,000
<i>I found out Nairobi was
more interesting than she seemed.</i>

92
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,160
The heart.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,160
The aorta...

94
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
<i>Nobody knew anythingabout anyone...</i>

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,680
Abdominal aorta.

96
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,079
<i>...but I never suspected
Nairobi had a son...</i>

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
<i>or a daughter...</i>

98
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,199
<i>as it seemed by her C-section scar.</i>

99
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,560
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

100
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,480
-What are you looking at?
-Calm down.

101
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,439
I'm gonna shove that down her throat.

102
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,959
She’s a lesbian. I don’t know
what the fuck she’s looking at.

103
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,920
You’re the lesbian. Your bean
was as hard as a sugar cube.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,439
Sugar cube? I’m going to...

105
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,319
Stop it!

106
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,240
<i>And that’s where our friendship started.</i>

107
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,960
Raquel, the Ministry's on the phone.
What should I tell them?

108
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,519
-Raquel! What should I say?
-Pardon?

109
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,399
They’re asking who gave the order.

110
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,600
I gave the order.

111
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,440
Tell them... the wounded man is a hostage.

112
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,399
-And hang up the fucking phone!
-He looked like a robber.

113
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,399
I asked for the green light. I insisted.

114
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,799
Inspector, I take responsibility too.

115
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,799
Inspector, the ambulance is ready.

116
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,080
Let’s talk to the robber.

117
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,200
<i>Preparing to contact the robber.</i>

118
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,639
We had to make a decision.

119
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,559
It seemed like they’d execute them.
We had to make a decision.

120
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,919
Silence, please!

121
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,759
Professor?

122
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,399
<i>You shot at the hostages.</i>

123
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,559
<i>One is near death.
I guess that’s why you’re calling.</i>

124
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,799
I have an ambulance for the injured man.

125
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,879
Nobody’s leaving here.

126
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,879
-That man is bleeding out.
<i>-From the bullet you shot.</i>

127
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,039
You're going to let him die?

128
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
<i>Let me get a medical team in there.</i>

129
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,679
Professor, listen.

130
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,000
I know it was my mistake,

131
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,759
<i>but if a hostage dies, it’ll be
as awful for you as it'll be for me.</i>

132
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,279
Believe me. In less than five minutes,

133
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
the public will know

134
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,080
that man died because you didn’t
let us come in and save his life.

135
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,480
<i>Two surgeons and a nurse
with surgical equipment.</i>

136
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,600
<i>-Let me know when they arrive.</i>
-Thanks.

137
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,919
<i>I also have something to ask you.</i>

138
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,240
-The man wants to talk to his wife.
-Of course.

139
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,639
Jesus.

140
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,159
Find Mr. Roman’s wife.

141
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:01,039
How soon can a medical team get here?

142
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,679
By helicopter from La Paz,
in ten to 15 minutes.

143
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,879
-Bring them here. Now!
-Okay.

144
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,759
Excuse me.

145
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,720
Can you drive?

146
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,200
-Yes.
-I need to go for a ride.

147
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,600
-Yes.
-Thanks.

148
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,799
Hey, Raquel.

149
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,240
What’s up?

150
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,080
I have to think.

151
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,000
Drive.

152
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,159
Don’t look at me like that.
I’m not leaving you alone.

153
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
Where the fuck is she?

154
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,399
That bitch escaped!

155
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,159
Let’s see...

156
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,159
I’m coming.

157
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,519
There we go.

158
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,240
What's going on?

159
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,559
<i>Are you able to come over tonight?</i>

160
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,440
-I don’t know, Mom.
<i>-Why? Did something happen?</i>

161
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,200
Mom, it’s...

162
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,320
I’m...

163
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,840
I madea huge mistake at work.

164
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,759
Honey, your job is really difficult.

165
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,159
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

166
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,440
Things don't seem so serious
after you talk about them.

167
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,840
I was drinking wine with...

168
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,600
That's nice. With who? Do I know him?

169
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,559
No, Mom. I don’t know him either.

170
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,840
The thing is...

171
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,159
When I went back to the tent,
there was a very serious situation,

172
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,200
<i>a risky one,
on the roof of the Royal Mint and...</i>

173
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,679
I thought one of the hostages
was in danger, so I gave...

174
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,039
the order to shoot.

175
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,240
And an innocent man was shot.

176
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,480
-Yes. I saw it on TV, honey.
<i>-Now I don’t know what to do.</i>

177
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,159
I don’t know whether to call his wife,

178
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,360
give a press conference, resign...
I don’t know what to do, Mom.

179
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,919
Well, first of all, relax
and don’t blame yourself.

180
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,759
<i>They all have masks and guns,</i>

181
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,720
confined, all mixed together.

182
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,279
You only wanted
to protect the hostages, right?

183
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,799
<i>Honey, what if you saved somebody’s life?</i>

184
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,440
You wouldn’t be calling me, would you?

185
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,519
<i>Well...</i>

186
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,759
<i>and then...</i>

187
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,320
I wouldn’t know you like to meet
and have drinks with strangers.

188
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,320
God! I don’t meet strangers.

189
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,720
Honey, we have
so little time in this life...

190
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,120
Okay, Mom,
but that’s not the issue now.

191
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,720
The issue is
I’m in a critical situation at work.

192
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,039
Honey, screw that job.

193
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,639
<i>Why don’t you tell them
you want to stamp passports?</i>

194
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
<i>Maybe you'll have some fun. Heavens!</i>

195
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,039
<i>Or do you think you’ll end up
holding hands with the robber</i>

196
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,159
in a retirement home?
You won’t, honey.

197
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,600
But maybe with that stranger...

198
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,799
<i>Don’t laugh.
I knowwhat I’m talking about.</i>

199
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,120
I’ve been a widow for 20 years and...

200
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,879
Time doesn’t stop, honey.

201
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,639
It doesn’t go backwards either, you know?

202
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,039
Entering the perimeter.

203
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,320
I’ll think about it, Mom.

204
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,159
Don't wait up for me, all right?

205
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,200
Fine.

206
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,360
Listen, you go to bedwith someone too.

207
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:20,000
RAQUEL LIKES A STRANGER

208
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,039
-What the fuck do you want?
-I don’t know. I saw that earlier and...

209
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,600
And it got my attention.

210
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,240
I didn’t know what it was.

211
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Sorry.

212
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,720
Okay, I forgive you.

213
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay, see you later.

214
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,679
What are you doing?

215
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,320
Beat it. I don’t want to chitchat.

216
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,680
How old is he?

217
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,079
Your son.

218
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,599
Seven.

219
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,960
He’s seven.

220
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,640
Where's he?

221
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,279
With his father?

222
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,559
With his father?
No, he’s never been around.

223
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,599
We don’t know anything about his father.

224
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,440
What’s his name?

225
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,519
Axel.

226
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,000
His name’s Axel.

227
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,160
It means axe.

228
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,079
-Axe.
-Yes.

229
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,400
And he’s an ace.

230
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,359
Just like his mother.

231
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,240
That kid's a survivor, you know?

232
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,359
He's survived everything.

233
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,759
He’s like a cork in the middle of the sea.

234
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,559
He doesn’t sink.

235
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,440
That’s the way he is.

236
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
When he was three...

237
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,759
I had to take him from my mother’s house
because her husband...

238
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,359
gave him anisette when I wasn’t there,
because his crying bothered him.

239
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
So I left with him.

240
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,599
Just the two of us.
We didn't need a family.

241
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,759
Me and him.

242
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,240
And we were fucking great.

243
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,359
But I screwed it up.

244
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:44,960
One day...

245
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,480
I had to go get pills to sell.

246
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,039
And...

247
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,359
And I left him alone.

248
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,400
For five minutes.

249
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,519
It was just five minutes.

250
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,680
And he caused a scene
as fucking Spider-Man. Damn Spider-Man!

251
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,279
Because he wanted to be a superhero.

252
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,160
He climbed everywhere.
He climbed very well.

253
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,680
He went out the window
and got on the balcony.

254
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,799
He took a chair and got up on it

255
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,359
and shouted, "Mommy!"

256
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,039
He was three and a half.

257
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,160
Sure enough, five minutes later,

258
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,400
we had the police, firemen...

259
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,799
everyone.

260
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,079
They caught me with the pills,

261
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,519
with a record,

262
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,559
without a job.

263
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,079
I went to jail.

264
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,960
So my child started moving
from one foster family to the next.

265
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,160
And I got nothing.

266
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,359
Nothing, huh?

267
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,160
I wasn’t allowed
a single visit, a single call...

268
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,440
Nothing.

269
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,720
Then I was released...

270
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,720
and nothing happened.

271
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,920
They didn’t give him back to me.

272
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,039
-Have you seen him since?
-They won’t let me.

273
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,319
But...

274
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,759
I know where he is.

275
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,559
-Really?
-He’s in the Canary islands.

276
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,519
He’s with a family who owns a hotel.

277
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,759
He’s fine.

278
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,640
Are you going to go and get him?

279
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,400
I’m taking him...

280
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
and that’s it.

281
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,160
To the other side of the world.

282
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,279
I'll tell you something.

283
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
In this heist,

284
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,519
nobody’s going to screw up,
not me or anyone else.

285
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,920
If somebody screws up,
I’ll destroy their life.

286
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,039
Out of all the plans everyone has,

287
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,519
yours...

288
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,039
is the best.

289
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,960
And let me tell you something else.

290
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,480
Do you like tequila?

291
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,599
It’s 4:03 am.

292
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,359
We have class very early.

293
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Plastic explosives.

294
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,799
Sorry.

295
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,279
It’d be great
if you were well rested for class.

296
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,680
-We couldn’t sleep.
-Go to bed.

297
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:55,000
-The three of us together?
-In our own beds.

298
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,480
Those pajamas look
really good on you, Professor.

299
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,680
Now.

300
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,640
Now.

301
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,039
And you... And you with the lights.

302
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,880
That guy really turns me on. Really.

303
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,880
-He really turns me on!
-Really? I can’t tell at all.

304
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,920
You can't tell?

305
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,400
-A lot.
-Let him notice.

306
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,920
What a headache, man!

307
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,640
Jesus...

308
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,599
Monica. Hey...

309
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,680
-What are you doing here? Are you crazy?
-I wasn’t feeling well.

310
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,960
I think the medication made me sick.

311
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,920
Medication?

312
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,359
That'll do it. Yes, child. That’ll do it.

313
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,440
Oh, my, you’re burning up.

314
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,759
She has to get the hell out of here.

315
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,400
-I’ll help you.
-Wait.

316
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,599
-Could I be alone for a minute?
-Yes.

317
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,079
Please.

318
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,519
What do you think?

319
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,279
She’s not feeling very well.
She looks bad.

320
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,240
If we don’t take that bullet out,
she’s fucked.

321
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,160
Dad, calm down, all right?

322
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,279
She’ll be fine.

323
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,359
Why did you fucking shoot her?

324
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,599
Because Berlin was going to kill her.
I had no other choice.

325
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
Son of a bitch.

326
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,599
If he wants to kill someone,
he should pull the trigger, not you.

327
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,759
We came for a robbery.
Not to kill people or save lives.

328
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,319
We’re fucking idiots.

329
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,039
-Of all the people--
-Dad, calm down.

330
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,000
Calm down.

331
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Monica, are you finished yet?

332
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,519
Yes.

333
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,200
-Let’s go.
-Raquel, wait a second.

334
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,319
I want to talk to you.
I want to go in with the medical team.

335
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,440
No. Somebody’s going in, but not you.

336
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,240
Sure. There’s always
someone better than me for everything.

337
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,640
Raquel, I’m a firearms expert.

338
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,000
I can go in and know, at a glance,
how many, what type, and if they’re fake.

339
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,480
We could figure out who the robbers are.

340
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,279
You’re right.

341
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,960
You’ll go with the doctors and cover them.

342
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,559
Now let me tell you what we’re doing.

343
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,000
I heard a shot earlier.

344
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,119
The police. They shot a hostage.

345
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,119
-A hostage?
-Yes.

346
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,480
Who?

347
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,079
Who?

348
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
Who did they shoot?

349
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,319
The manager.

350
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,799
Arturo?

351
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,000
Did the police kill Arturo?

352
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
No. They didn’t kill him.

353
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,519
-Is he okay?
-Yes.

354
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,440
Is he alive?

355
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,519
-Is Arturo okay?
-He’s fine. Yes.

356
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,799
-Are you sure?
-Sure.

357
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,680
-Is he okay?
-A surgeon is coming in with his team.

358
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,559
They'll operate and save him.

359
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,200
-They're going to operate?
-Yes.

360
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,400
You have to tell him I’m alive.

361
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,519
You have to tell Arturo.

362
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:15,319
-Do you hear me?
-Nobody is saying anything.

363
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,880
Because you’ll be fine
and he will too, okay?

364
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,119
Let’s have a look at the wound.

365
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,680
Calm down.

366
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,960
He is going to blame himself.
He asked me to get the phone,

367
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,000
and he'll think I'm dead because of him.

368
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,880
You have tell him I’m alive, okay?

369
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,319
And his son too.

370
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,559
You're pregnant?

371
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,559
Very well.

372
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,039
Congratulations.

373
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,720
-Give me a pen, please.
-Okay.

374
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,039
When?

375
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,240
Thanks.

376
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,039
Angel!

377
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,039
I’ve decided we should go in.

378
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,400
I'll use the medical team to do it.

379
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,440
I cherish these decisions you make
on ambulance rides.

380
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,400
I'm only here
to fulfill the wishes of the government.

381
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,039
and avoid a violent outcome.

382
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,200
Wow!

383
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,319
The CNI officer
has suddenly become a pacifist.

384
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
Weren’t you the one
who wanted to bring in tanks?

385
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,839
I wanted to surprise them.
Finish this quickly.

386
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,559
But now the priority is
to have zero victims.

387
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,440
So I advise you to negotiate and wait.

388
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,200
It must suck being here all day

389
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:51,599
thinking you’re the best,
yet unable to make any decisions.

390
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,400
Like being on a hostage crisis talk show.

391
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,400
Inspector, I’m not going to fall for that,

392
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,839
because I understand that,
at a certain age, hormones take over.

393
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,480
-I know because of my mother.
-Where are you going?

394
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,039
You know, I have to report
all this, right?

395
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,119
Of course.

396
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,559
So far, the robbers
have always been ahead of us.

397
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,559
Everything was planned. Except this shot.

398
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,680
It’s the first thing not in the plan.

399
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,480
And we must take advantage.

400
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,519
The only way to get in
without being detected by their cameras

401
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,319
is to move along this underground tube
that leads straight to the basement.

402
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,000
It’s the ventilation pipe.

403
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,000
It was added seven months ago
to release heat from the presses.

404
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,359
It’s a work in progress.
They probably don’t know it’s there.

405
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
I need two of your men
to go through there.

406
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,000
Officer Garcia Lobo, here,
and I’ll go with him.

407
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,079
Fine.

408
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,319
Deputy Inspector Rubio
will go with the two surgeons as a nurse.

409
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,960
It's 6:09 p.m.
Let's synchronize our watches.

410
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,640
<i>At 06:15 p.m.,
the medical team will go in.</i>

411
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,680
<i>The surgery
shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.</i>

412
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,240
But they can keep going
until exactly 7:00 p.m.

413
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,160
When the doctors leave,

414
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,960
a lot of the robbers will be watching.

415
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,279
That’s when Suarez and Lobo
enter through the underground pipe.

416
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:17,000
<i>They’ll arrive in the basement
dressed in red jumpsuits and Dalí masks.</i>

417
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,839
They’ll become hostages.

418
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,279
This will only be successful
if done like clockwork.

419
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,960
Inspector?

420
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,759
Arturo Roman’s wife is here.

421
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,920
One moment, please.

422
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,079
Suarez, get moving.

423
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,519
Take care of the doctors. And be careful.

424
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,160
Get the operation ready!

425
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,359
What happened? Is my husband okay?

426
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,640
He's conscious and stable.

427
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,599
He was shot by mistake.

428
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,839
-Shot? What do you mean?
-He’s injured, but alive.

429
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,319
Calm down.

430
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,720
The robbers are letting
a surgical team go in

431
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,559
and they'll help him right away.

432
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,319
Sorry, but...
I wasn’t even listening. Sorry.

433
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,799
Calm down.

434
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,680
Everything’s gonna be all right.

435
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,480
-Sit down, please.
-Thanks.

436
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,960
-You can talk to him right now.
-Yes.

437
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Take this.

438
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,119
Almansa, record!

439
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:12,519
We have to take that bullet out right now.

440
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:17,759
You do it, Dad.

441
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,160
You’re less nervous.

442
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,559
Where’s the surgical kit
the Professor gave us?

443
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,720
-There’s a scalpel in there.
-Berlin has it.

444
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,519
Fuck.

445
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,480
It’s not a good idea to ask him for it.

446
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,920
The surgeons!
Go and get one from them. Hurry.

447
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,880
Okay.

448
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,039
Wait!

449
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,039
Give him the note, please.

450
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,400
I’ll clean the wound now, okay?

451
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,079
Relax. You’re going to be fine, okay?

452
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,440
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Professor, Arturo Roman’s wife is here.

453
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,119
Arturo.

454
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,599
Arturo.

455
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,480
What’s your wife’s name?

456
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,119
Laura.

457
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,279
A beautiful name. You can talk to Laura.

458
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:30,599
Wives are good for moments like these.

459
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,880
They’re comforting.

460
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Nobody remembers their wife

461
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,000
when they're at a club
in the middle of a bender,

462
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,640
If you have a problem, an accident,
or... you’re simply scared,...

463
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,559
things change.

464
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,880
Are you thinking
about your secretary right now?

465
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,279
Yeah?

466
00:32:59,119 --> 00:32:59,960
No.

467
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,759
Who has time to think about a lover
who is about to abort your baby?

468
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,519
-Or just nothing?
-Spare me the speech.

469
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,880
Listen to me.

470
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,759
If you say anything, I’ll finish you

471
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:15,319
and your wife will hear it live.
Imagine that.

472
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,640
Inspector.

473
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,279
They’re turning on a phone.

474
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,839
We have to tap that phone.

475
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
I want to see the selfie and main cameras.

476
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,920
There.

477
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,559
<i>Hello, darling.</i>

478
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,000
Arturo, darling, how are you?

479
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,640
Fine. I’m fine.

480
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,839
<i>"It was a clean shot...</i>
-There’s no image.

481
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,559
No selfie or main cameras.
They covered them.

482
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,039
<i>They’re letting some surgeons in.</i>

483
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,200
I know.

484
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,799
Look, I’ve...

485
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,200
I’ve been thinking about you and...

486
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,200
and everything we did wrong.

487
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,480
Don’t think about it, darling. Not now.

488
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,960
<i>Not now.</i>

489
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,640
Besides, it’s my fault.

490
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,079
I know we’re not fine.
We haven’t been fine for some time.

491
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,639
I neglected you and our children.
I’ve been selfish.

492
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,119
I promise that’s all going to change.

493
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,639
<i>I promise that’s going to change.</i>

494
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,280
<i>You’ve beensaying for ten years
you want to see your sister in Australia.</i>

495
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,400
That it could be
a chance for the kids to learn English

496
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,519
and see kangaroos.

497
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,719
<i>That’s the first thing
we’ll do when I get out.</i>

498
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,960
I owe you that.

499
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,639
I’ll do it for you.

500
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,840
Because I love you so much.

501
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,039
All these years wasted, chasing...

502
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,599
thinking all that mattered
was money and status and...

503
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,079
<i>But all that matters is you.</i>

504
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,559
<i>It’s always been you.</i>

505
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,960
Since the day I met you.

506
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,760
I swear there are times when...

507
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,599
I try to remember that day...

508
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:09,199
<i>and I wonder
what the hell you saw in me, Monica.</i>

509
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,199
Laura.

510
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,440
Just concentrate on getting out.

511
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,559
<i>Just think about that.</i>

512
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,199
<i>I love you.</i>

513
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,159
I love you, honey.

514
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,039
Laura, are you okay?

515
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,480
Calm down.

516
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,079
You’re a real expert, Arturo.

517
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,639
Your secretary... with the belly...

518
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,760
Laurita waiting for you
in the 4x4 with the children.

519
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,960
You're surrounded by money.
You're a legend.

520
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,559
Berlin. The doctors are outside.

521
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,960
You must excuse me.

522
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,360
Does everyone know what to do?

523
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,679
They do. Of course they do.

524
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,079
Are you ready?

525
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,440
Okay, they’re ready.

526
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,360
Mercedes!

527
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Are you ready?

528
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,159
Yes, sir.

529
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,480
I want her out of here.

530
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,039
Rio, take her to an office.

531
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,280
Nairobi.

532
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,000
Put on your masks!

533
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,159
Come with me! Rock and roll!

534
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,400
Come in.

535
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,840
Leave everything on the floor.

536
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,280
Close the doors.

537
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,159
Move forward.

538
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,079
Hands on your head and legs apart.

539
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,320
We’re going to frisk you.

540
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,400
Get him out of here, please.

541
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:07,559
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

542
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,519
One of the nurses is an undercover cop.

543
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,679
-Which one?
<i>-The one with glasses.</i>

544
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,519
<i>You know what to do.</i>

545
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,840
-Perfectly. Let’s get to it.
-Berlin!

546
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,480
It has to be fucking precise work.

547
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,760
I know.

548
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,199
Guys, the man with glasses is the cop.

549
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,000
They’ll go in.

550
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,119
Maybe during an attack
or an emergency...

551
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,880
It could be a Red Cross guy
or the pizza guy,

552
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,480
but they will surely
try to infiltrate someone.

553
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,320
And that will be our chance
to try and sneak in a Trojan horse.

554
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,599
Do you know what that is?

555
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:51,119
-I don’t, but it reminds me of something.
-No!

556
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
-The Trojan horse...
-Condoms!

557
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,360
Shut up and focus. Jesus!

558
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,360
Sorry.

559
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,840
I’m sorry.

560
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,440
The Greeks were at war with the Trojans.

561
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:11,280
One day the Trojans found,
in front of their city,

562
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,960
a wooden horse, a huge wooden horse.

563
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,679
And, arrogantly, they thought it was
from the Greeks to say they surrender.

564
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,400
So they opened the gates...

565
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,199
and they brought it in.

566
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,480
But they didn’t know
that horse was hollow...

567
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,559
and full of Greek warriors.

568
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,800
That night, the Trojans lost the war.

569
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,360
And that’s exactly what we're going to do.

570
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,639
When they try to enter...

571
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,239
thinking they’re winning the battle...

572
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:12,360
Leave all your metallic objects
on that tray.

573
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,920
Glasses.

574
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,920
Watches.

575
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:17,920
If you have weapons,

576
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,480
microphones,
I also advise you leave them there.

577
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:23,039
We’re going to track
any type of radio frequency.

578
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,440
Take off your shoes too, please.

579
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,360
And now lie down.

580
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,800
On the ground.

581
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,039
That's it.

582
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,199
Like cockroaches.

583
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,280
Stand up.

584
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,679
Put on your shoes.

585
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,960
Take only the glasses.
You’re going to need them.

586
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,760
<i>Now, yes...</i>

587
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,880
<i>Welcome.
Take your things and come with me.</i>

588
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,000
<i>Thanks.</i>
