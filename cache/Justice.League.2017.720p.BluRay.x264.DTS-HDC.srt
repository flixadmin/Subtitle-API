1
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:52,817
<i>There he is!</i>

2
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,974
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

3
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,574
<i>Superman, Superman,</i>

4
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:57,525
<i>can we ask you some questions?</i>

5
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,073
<i>It's for our podcast.</i>

6
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:00,078
<i>Well, in that case...</i>

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,278
<i>How many people that
you saved... Have you saved?</i>

8
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,706
<i>I...
Never mind.</i>

9
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,719
<i>Does your thing really stand for hope?</i>

10
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:06,674
<i>Yes. It does.</i>

11
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:08,218
<i>But it looks like an S.</i>

12
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,921
<i>Yes. It's meant to. It's...</i>

13
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,559
<i>meant to wind. Like a river.</i>

14
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:15,049
<i>It comes and goes. My...</i>

15
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,057
<i>A man I knew used to say that
hope is like your car keys.</i>

16
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,540
<i>Easy to lose,</i>

17
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:22,708
<i>but if you dig around,</i>

18
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,220
<i>it's usually close by.</i>

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,450
<i>Did you ever fight a hippo?</i>

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,639
<i>No... That's dumb.</i>

21
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,520
<i>But hippos are the most deadly.</i>

22
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,271
<i>What's...</i>

23
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,171
<i>What's the best thing
about Planet Earth?</i>

24
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:03,629
What are you doing?

25
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:04,899
Wait!

26
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:05,917
No, wait!

27
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:07,338
Wait. Wait!

28
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:09,709
Please! Please, man. Please!

29
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:14,972
What do you want from me?

30
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,476
<i>Fear.</i>

31
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,649
<i>They can smell it.</i>

32
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,070
What the hell?

33
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,167
What was that?

34
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:33,436
<i>A scout.</i>

35
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:35,665
From space?

36
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,439
<i>Like an alien army?</i>

37
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,704
<i>Alfred, are you seeing this?</i>

38
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:40,711
I am.

39
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,176
Matches the other sightings.

40
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,761
And that pattern
is all over Luthor's notes.

41
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,373
<i>Prep the jet.
We're going north tonight.</i>

42
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:50,821
Good. It's time, then.

43
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,464
It's because they know he's dead, right?

44
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,539
Superman.

45
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,187
He's gone.

46
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:02,869
Where does that leave us?

47
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,226
Drop your guns now!

48
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,202
Excuse me.

49
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,590
Go!

50
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,515
Move it! Move! Move!

51
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,214
Get down!

52
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,248
Line them up along the wall!

53
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,902
Keep them quiet!

54
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,309
Children, stay close to me.

55
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,042
Who are you?

56
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,631
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

57
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,206
Now, who are you?

58
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,181
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists.

59
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,020
We know that sin has brought
on this plague of aliens.

60
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,082
Why the hostages?

61
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:17,471
You're too late.

62
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,607
The countdown's already begun.

63
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,273
In a few minutes,

64
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:22,734
four city blocks...

65
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:26,204
While the world watches.

66
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:30,062
Hush!

67
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:31,638
Shut up!

68
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,666
This is man's best hope.

69
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:35,943
Down with the modern world.

70
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,349
Back to the Dark Ages,

71
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,819
and the safety of holy fear.

72
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,925
Quiet!

73
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:24,182
This would have been over quickly, but...

74
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,663
No! Don't!

75
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:49,846
I don't believe it.

76
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:51,528
What are you?

77
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:52,714
A believer.

78
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:31,604
I'm asking for your help.

79
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,908
I believe there is a stranger,

80
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,961
who comes to this village from the sea.

81
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,785
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry,

82
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:41,236
and brings fish.

83
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:44,293
He comes on the king tide.

84
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,206
That was last night.

85
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,336
Icebergs in the harbor,

86
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:55,575
four months since
the last ship got through.

87
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,449
Well, this stranger,

88
00:11:58,303 --> 00:11:59,734
doesn't come by ship.

89
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:03,012
There are enemies coming,

90
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:04,743
from far away.

91
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,895
I need warriors.

92
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,804
I'm building an alliance,

93
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,276
to defend ourselves.

94
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,488
Look, I'll give you $25,000
to talk to this man right now.

95
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:16,493
Outside.

96
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,930
Tell me what those three boxes
are and I'll make it $30,000.

97
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,616
You should get out.

98
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:48,886
Can you at least point me to Atlantis?

99
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:53,147
Arthur Curry.

100
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,899
Also known as Protector of the Oceans.

101
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:03,723
The Aquaman.

102
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,219
I hear you can talk to fish.

103
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,431
So let me get this straight.

104
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,093
You do it dressed like a bat?

105
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:15,960
Like an actual bat?

106
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,221
It's worked for 20 years in Gotham.

107
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,560
Oh, that shithole.

108
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:21,979
When the fight comes, we'll need you.

109
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,200
Don't count on it, Batman.
Why not?

110
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,369
Because I don't like you coming here,

111
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,318
digging into my business
and getting into my life.

112
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,246
People from Atlantis tell me. Do this.

113
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,576
Now you say. Do that.

114
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:31,700
I wanna be left alone.

115
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,211
Is that why you help these people
out here in the middle of nowhere?

116
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:35,564
Because you can just leave?

117
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,045
I help them because no one else does.

118
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:40,624
If you want to protect them,
you need to work with me.

119
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,746
Strong man is strongest alone.

120
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:43,840
You ever heard that?

121
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:45,832
That's not a saying.

122
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,494
That's the opposite of what the saying is.

123
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,467
Yeah.

124
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,931
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

125
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,100
You ever hear of Superman?

126
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,259
He died fighting next to me.

127
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:56,673
My point exactly.

128
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:00,456
What's in the three boxes?

129
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,336
It's ancient history.

130
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,207
What is it? Mankind's melting
the polar ice caps,

131
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:06,762
destroying the ecosystem.

132
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:07,766
They got it coming?

133
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,431
Hey,

134
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:10,828
I don't mind if the oceans rise.

135
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,780
How about if they boil?

136
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:15,125
Dressed like a bat.

137
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:17,977
You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne.

138
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,130
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

139
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,410
So you say you have no way of
reconnecting with this Aquaman?

140
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,797
Oh, I put a tracking device in his coat,

141
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,018
but he left without it.

142
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:45,519
May, in fact, not have been his coat.

143
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:48,486
Those squares,

144
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:49,807
from Luthor's notes.

145
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,091
I think they must be containers
of some kind.

146
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,193
Of what?

147
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,474
I don't know. Money. Power.

148
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,553
Something worth starting a war over.

149
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,461
Well, we've had luck with one
person on the team list.

150
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:05,785
Barry Allen of Central City.

151
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,577
He's completely off the grid.

152
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:11,706
Squatting, I think.
Moves suddenly and often.

153
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:13,343
Disappearing act.

154
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,227
But he does visit his father.

155
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,992
In prison,

156
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:18,775
for murdering his mother.

157
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,777
Jesus.

158
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:22,182
Young Barry always
protested his father's innocence.

159
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,485
But he was nine
and nobody listened to him.

160
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,990
We have somebody at the prison?

161
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,986
Oh, yeah.
We'll find the address.

162
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,187
What about...

163
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,666
Diana?

164
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,230
Well, you have her number.

165
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,472
What, you could've called her.

166
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:39,805
Perhaps I should fly to Paris
with a handwritten note.

167
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,799
Will you be Bruce's teammate?

168
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:43,250
Check yes or no.

169
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:45,511
I'm only interested in her skill set.

170
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,193
I'm sure you are.

171
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:48,188
Can we?

172
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:52,187
Well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

173
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:53,974
But they've got a partial match.

174
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:55,812
A Victor Stone.

175
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,221
Genius IQ,

176
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,538
football scholarship to GCU,

177
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,111
and deceased.

178
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:02,215
Figures.

179
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,189
Fairy tales and ghost stories.

180
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:06,939
One misses the days
when one's biggest concerns

181
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:09,032
were exploding wind-up penguins.

182
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:10,722
The simple life.

183
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:13,976
I don't recognize this world.

184
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:16,614
I don't have to recognize it.

185
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:19,662
I just have to save it.

186
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:28,049
Here to see Henry Allen.

187
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:29,523
Sign.

188
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,833
Hurry it up, will you?

189
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:40,695
What, you got a problem?

190
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,024
No, there is no problem.

191
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:45,033
Better not be.

192
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:51,741
You know where to go.

193
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,166
Are those prescription?

194
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,739
Or are you just trying to look brainy?

195
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,391
Because you're holding
yourself back.

196
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:13,162
You're going in circles.

197
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:15,986
You're working three dead-end jobs,
going on four.

198
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,299
Where do you even have the time?

199
00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:18,346
I make the time.

200
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:20,734
And this is all to pay
for a criminal justice degree?

201
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:22,968
Ok, I really don't wanna talk
about this again.

202
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:24,758
The investigation was botched.

203
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:26,117
Give me your hand, man.

204
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,334
I want you to listen to me, Barry,

205
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,760
because I mean this.

206
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,080
I want you to give all that up.

207
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:45,259
And I want you
to stop coming to see me.

208
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:50,249
I am a drag on your life.

209
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,921
Please don't ever say that to me again.

210
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:56,531
Please?

211
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:58,507
You can be whatever you want to be.

212
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,849
You're brilliant, man.

213
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,882
Absolute best of the best.

214
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,788
I can't sit here,

215
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:10,251
and watch you run in place in Central City

216
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,632
for some old dude,

217
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:13,096
who is not...

218
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:14,287
going...

219
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:15,298
anywhere.

220
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,849
Dad, that's not true.
It's time.

221
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:17,833
That's not true.

222
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,404
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

223
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:21,266
I want you to make your own future.

224
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,398
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

225
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,268
Open gate.

226
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:49,626
Lab's all yours, Howard.

227
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:51,259
11:30.

228
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,225
Early night for you, Silas.

229
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:55,103
Yes. Early.

230
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,175
I never got to say...

231
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,506
I'm very sorry about what happened.

232
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,131
Victor was a wonderful kid.

233
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,020
Thank you.

234
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:21,132
Victor.

235
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,206
Victor, you're not stuck up here.

236
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,530
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

237
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,640
If you stay up here brooding...

238
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,619
I'm processing.

239
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:37,739
I can access everything.

240
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:39,970
But I can't put it all together.

241
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:40,721
Not yet.

242
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:43,737
But if you worked with me,
if we had the change engine...

243
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,390
So you'd do to someone
else what you did to me?

244
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:48,448
No.

245
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,902
The box stays hidden.

246
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:53,907
If you could see what we're learning
from the Kryptonian ship.

247
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:56,672
I think the change engine
could integrate with its energy,

248
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,577
get it powered up and does anybody know?

249
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:00,299
What?

250
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,389
At the lab.

251
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,175
Does anybody know I'm alive?

252
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,297
I...

253
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,408
I... I...

254
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,240
didn't think you were ready
for them to...

255
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,110
To what?

256
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,588
For them to see the monster?

257
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,821
You are not a monster.

258
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:16,359
It's weird that you thought I meant me.

259
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:21,126
What I did...

260
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:25,644
I lost your mother in that accident.

261
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,600
I wasn't about to...

262
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:31,389
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

263
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:32,601
But you did.

264
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:37,026
I got a language in my head
that I don't speak.

265
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:39,474
It's not just digital.

266
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:41,103
It's alien.

267
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,865
Every day, I wake up different.

268
00:20:46,014 --> 00:20:47,054
Modified.

269
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,120
How do you...

270
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,755
Couldn't do that last night.

271
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:00,980
Ever since we got visitors
from Krypton,

272
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,705
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

273
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,050
Now I got to wonder if I'm it.

274
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:26,289
Any changes today?

275
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:27,847
No, my Queen.

276
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,130
The Mother Box has awoken,

277
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:32,940
yet nothing has happened.

278
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,510
It has slept for thousands of years,

279
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:37,091
since the First Age.

280
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:39,037
Why did it wake at all?

281
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
Amazons! On your mark!

282
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,448
Yes, soldiers! Fight on!

283
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,215
Ready!

284
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:15,402
Steppenwolf.

285
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:19,925
Mother.

286
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,901
Millennia in exile, searching...

287
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,407
At last you call me home.

288
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,280
You will not like your welcome.

289
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,829
Oh, I think I will.

290
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,690
Steady!

291
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,803
Forward!

292
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,410
Gather the legions!

293
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,341
You must seal the cage!

294
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:00,324
Go!

295
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:02,309
Flank right!

296
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,796
Yes.

297
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,476
Run.

298
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,114
Seal the gates!

299
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:37,134
Keep it moving.

300
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,104
Got it! Go!

301
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:55,080
Enough.

302
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,346
Noble Queen, why do you fight?

303
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,537
After the unity,

304
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,670
you will join my legion

305
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,334
and you will know
the righteousness of power.

306
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:20,715
You will love me.

307
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:31,307
You all will.

308
00:26:57,063 --> 00:26:59,127
We have to light the ancient
warning fire.

309
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,584
The fire has not burned for 5,000 years.

310
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:05,033
Men won't know what it means.

311
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,242
Men won't.

312
00:27:09,193 --> 00:27:10,193
She will.

313
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,614
Listen to me, Diana.

314
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,343
What did you do this weekend, Diana?

315
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,033
Me?
Yeah.

316
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,082
Nothing very interesting.

317
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:53,961
That's all you ever tell us.

318
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,707
What can I say, I'm not that exciting.

319
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,980
<i>So-called shrine of the Amazons,</i>

320
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,750
<i>an enormous bonfire burned
right behind me,</i>

321
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:08,098
<i>baffling absolutely everyone from
locals to government authorities alike.</i>

322
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:11,181
<i>The fire could be seen for miles on end.</i>

323
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,087
Invasion.

324
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,788
<i>On the local scene,</i>

325
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:18,395
<i>this janitor's wife had some
strong words for the aliens</i>

326
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,839
<i>she says, stole her man.</i>

327
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,050
<i>My Howard is a good man.</i>

328
00:28:23,474 --> 00:28:24,633
<i>He's a provider.</i>

329
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,299
<i>And these aliens are gonna... probe him?</i>

330
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,568
<i>Come down to the Lakeview,</i>

331
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,945
<i>and I'll stick a... probe up your alien... you...</i>

332
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:35,868
I found a little place.

333
00:28:36,203 --> 00:28:37,275
By the diner.

334
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:39,112
Suits me just fine.

335
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,705
I wish you'd said something.

336
00:28:40,747 --> 00:28:41,364
Oh, no.

337
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,018
I got behind in the payments.

338
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,476
And you know the banks,

339
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:46,645
jump like a cougar if you miss by a dime.

340
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:49,547
Place was too big for me, anyway.

341
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,789
Shuffling around like an old ghost.

342
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,266
Well, I might've been able
to talk to someone, or...

343
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,877
You had enough to deal with.

344
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:58,679
Don't need to add
mother-in-law to the list.

345
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:01,288
Not that I was ever...

346
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:02,108
Hey, Lane?

347
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,263
Who was your source...

348
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:07,366
the activist in that university?

349
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:09,302
Well, it's my source.

350
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:11,584
I got tapped for the kidnapping story.

351
00:29:12,155 --> 00:29:14,112
There were all those student protests.

352
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:15,909
Anyway, I'm thinking it's political. So...

353
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,030
who's your guy?

354
00:29:17,495 --> 00:29:19,108
Well, I'll see if she'll take your call.

355
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:21,641
So it's a she.

356
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:25,564
It's not a she.

357
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,031
Sounds like you should be
working that story.

358
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:30,842
I'm...

359
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:33,516
I'm not ready yet.

360
00:29:34,378 --> 00:29:36,677
I'm perfectly happy doing fluff pieces

361
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,046
about kitten grooming.

362
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,883
For a while.

363
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,926
It was hard coming back here at all.

364
00:29:45,454 --> 00:29:47,824
Well, I can hardly read the news,
anyway.

365
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,958
So much bitterness.

366
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,030
Of course I think it's all
because he's gone.

367
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:56,617
But I suppose a mother does.

368
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,580
But it's not like there is any
less that needs reporting.

369
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,796
And Clark promised me you were
gonna bring home another Pulitzer.

370
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:07,074
Oh, did he?
Oh, yes. He did.

371
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,582
He said that you were the thirstiest
young woman that he'd ever met.

372
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:14,117
Hungriest.

373
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:15,654
Hungriest... Yeah.

374
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,876
He said you could smell a story
further away than he could hear.

375
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:27,711
Well, stories just made sense.

376
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,350
It was more than just a puzzle.

377
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:31,825
It was about the truth.

378
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,097
It was about,

379
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:36,698
seeing the engine of the world.

380
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:39,011
When it still ran.

381
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:48,744
<i>Victor Stone.</i>

382
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:50,178
<i>Deceased.</i>

383
00:31:32,872 --> 00:31:33,638
That one.

384
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,848
Pretty sure that's what made
the alien go crazy.

385
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,215
<i>I'll see about rigging
something for the suit.</i>

386
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,567
<i>Won't be quick.</i>

387
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:41,889
Anything that can give me an edge.

388
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,635
You know, I paid millions of dollars
for this building's security.

389
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,480
Yeah, it looked expensive.

390
00:32:03,979 --> 00:32:04,791
Hi.

391
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:07,421
A new toy?

392
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:09,270
Prototype troop carrier.

393
00:32:10,743 --> 00:32:13,049
I once knew a man
who would have loved to fly it.

394
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:15,004
Yeah.

395
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,164
We're gonna need more than a pilot.

396
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:19,925
I think there is an attack coming.

397
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,459
Not coming, Bruce.

398
00:32:22,261 --> 00:32:23,591
It's already here.

399
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,118
<i>They called him Steppenwolf,</i>

400
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:30,797
<i>the end of worlds.</i>

401
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,407
<i>He lived only to conquer.</i>

402
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:37,636
<i>Millions fell before his blade,</i>

403
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,300
<i>or rose again as his Parademons.</i>

404
00:32:41,741 --> 00:32:44,311
<i>Nightmare creatures who feed on fear.</i>

405
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,425
Yeah, I think I met one.

406
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:49,053
We didn't hit it off.

407
00:32:49,382 --> 00:32:50,524
Here in Gotham?

408
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:51,664
They're all over.

409
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:54,027
They're looking for his boxes?

410
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:56,090
The Mother Boxes.

411
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:57,407
Mother Boxes.

412
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,886
I guess Steppenwolf took the one
your people were guarding.

413
00:32:59,888 --> 00:33:00,933
That leaves two more.

414
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:02,554
I'm impressed.

415
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:05,049
Don't be.
I have no idea what's in them.

416
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:06,734
A weapon? Some kind of power?

417
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:08,477
They don't contain power.

418
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,662
They are power.

419
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,121
<i>Carried from planet to planet,</i>

420
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,480
<i>the Mother Boxes combine
to form the unity.</i>

421
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:22,770
<i>An apocalyptic power
that not only destroys worlds,</i>

422
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:27,854
<i>but transforms them into the primordial
hellscape of Steppenwolf's birth world.</i>

423
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:31,041
<i>We should have died.</i>

424
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,857
<i>But we formed our own unity.</i>

425
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:36,845
<i>Amazons, Atlanteans,</i>

426
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:40,573
<i>all the tribes of men fought side by side.</i>

427
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:45,016
<i>Warriors of legend...</i>

428
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:50,077
<i>allies from other worlds,</i>

429
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,036
<i>even the gods themselves,</i>

430
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:55,635
<i>all acted as one,</i>

431
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,489
<i>laying down their lives
to drive Steppenwolf away.</i>

432
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:13,247
<i>Some say it drove him mad.</i>

433
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,791
<i>The disgrace of his first retreat.</i>

434
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:18,890
<i>He swore our alliance would crumble.</i>

435
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,448
<i>That darkness would cover the Earth.</i>

436
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,129
<i>And that he would return when it did.</i>

437
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:33,608
<i>Left behind,</i>

438
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:37,006
<i>the Mother Boxes were too
dangerous to be kept together.</i>

439
00:34:39,622 --> 00:34:41,788
<i>One was entrusted to the Amazons.</i>

440
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,780
<i>One to the Atlanteans.</i>

441
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:49,387
<i>Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.</i>

442
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,916
<i>The Box of Men was buried in secret,</i>

443
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,837
<i>so that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.</i>

444
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,541
Such harmony out of such horror.

445
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:07,815
It was truly an Age of Heroes.

446
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,266
Something tells me we're not
getting the band back together.

447
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,164
The Atlanteans were forced undersea,

448
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,141
and the Amazons to an island
they can never leave.

449
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,677
Well, I would not count
on the tribes of men.

450
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,071
We tend to act like the Doomsday
Clock has a snooze button.

451
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,451
How long until...
Days.

452
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:27,540
At most.

453
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:31,660
Steppenwolf's mistake last time
was attacking us.

454
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,282
He wanted to make the Earth
kneel before he destroyed us.

455
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:37,224
This time he'll just go after the boxes.

456
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,450
I got a location for one of our recruits.

457
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:41,298
Barry Allen.

458
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:42,650
What about the other one?

459
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:43,664
Victor Stone?

460
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,512
I was hoping you would dig him up.

461
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,976
We're asking people we don't
know to risk their lives.

462
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:52,338
I know.

463
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:54,704
That's how this works.

464
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:28,334
Barry Allen,

465
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:29,868
Bruce Wayne.

466
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,678
You said that like it explains
why there is a total stranger,

467
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,527
in my place sitting in the dark,

468
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:37,297
in my second favorite chair.

469
00:36:38,217 --> 00:36:39,227
Tell me about this.

470
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,451
This is a person who looks exactly
like me, but who is definitely not me.

471
00:36:49,692 --> 00:36:51,609
Very attractive Jewish boy.

472
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,658
Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocket watch?

473
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,741
Or railroads?

474
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,594
I know you have abilities.

475
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,321
I just don't know what they are.

476
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,690
My special skills include viola,

477
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:05,958
web design,

478
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,499
fluent in sign language...

479
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:09,065
Gorilla sign language.

480
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,430
Silica-based quartz sand fabric,

481
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:12,784
abrasion resistant,

482
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:13,608
heat resistant...

483
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:15,905
Yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

484
00:37:15,907 --> 00:37:17,407
It's what they use on the space shuttle

485
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,315
to prevent it from burning up on reentry.

486
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,088
I do very competitive ice dancing.

487
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,080
Whoever you're looking for,

488
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:26,347
it's not me.

489
00:37:50,504 --> 00:37:51,501
You're the Batman?

490
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:53,418
So, you're fast.

491
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,924
That feels like an oversimplification.

492
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:57,115
I'm putting together a team.

493
00:37:57,466 --> 00:37:59,240
People with special abilities.

494
00:37:59,732 --> 00:38:01,492
You see, I believe enemies are coming.

495
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,384
Stop right there. I'm in.

496
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:04,675
You are?

497
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:05,511
Yeah.

498
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,630
I need friends.

499
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,485
People are...

500
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:13,124
difficult. They require a lot of focus.
They...

501
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:16,609
They have like a rhythm that
I haven't quite been able to...

502
00:38:17,118 --> 00:38:18,386
Like brunch! Like...

503
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:20,268
what is brunch?

504
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,826
You wait in line for an hour
for essentially lunch.

505
00:38:24,474 --> 00:38:25,238
I mean...

506
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:27,343
I don't know.

507
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:29,396
People are...

508
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:31,153
a little slow.

509
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:33,275
I'll try to keep up.

510
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,095
Can I keep this?

511
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,150
It's like this layer of dimensional reality,

512
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,650
and it seems to manipulate space-time.

513
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,752
I call it the Speed Force.

514
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:43,833
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories.

515
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:46,443
So I'm just a black hole of snacks.

516
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,058
I am a snack hole.

517
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,342
How many people

518
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:52,152
are on this special fight team?

519
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,802
Three, including you.

520
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:55,412
Three? Against what?

521
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:57,679
I'll tell you on the plane.

522
00:38:58,381 --> 00:38:59,412
The plane?

523
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,223
What are your superpowers again?

524
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:03,902
I'm rich.

525
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,676
The program always gets
twitchy with this footage.

526
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:43,621
You know who we are.

527
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:50,272
Are you Victor Stone?

528
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,149
I need to speak to you.

529
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,576
No. Face-to-face.

530
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:02,483
I'm old-fashioned that way.

531
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,467
If I was going to attack you,

532
00:40:07,898 --> 00:40:09,584
I would have done it by the lake.

533
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,677
Looks like you have a date,
Ms. Prince.

534
00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:18,378
About time somebody here did.

535
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:53,007
Face-to-face.

536
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,756
I've been doing some tracking.

537
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,713
What you're looking for
is sticking to the dead zones.

538
00:41:01,683 --> 00:41:03,035
If it gets in front of a camera,

539
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:04,393
causes a surge,

540
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,572
I'll let you know.
That's not good enough.

541
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:08,715
Not good enough?

542
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:10,479
For you.

543
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,354
Look, I don't know you, and...

544
00:41:13,356 --> 00:41:15,407
I don't know how you got these gifts.

545
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:16,336
Gifts?

546
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:18,121
No one else can do what you do.

547
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,546
No. If these are gifts,

548
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:23,820
then why am I the
one paying for them?

549
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:25,295
We need you Victor.

550
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,587
And maybe you need us.

551
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,637
I do fine alone.

552
00:41:30,886 --> 00:41:33,174
I told myself the same for a long time.

553
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:41,009
I lost someone I loved once.

554
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,977
I shut myself off from...

555
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,623
From everyone.

556
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:52,053
But I had to learn to open
back up again.

557
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,533
The truth is, I'm still working on it.

558
00:41:57,533 --> 00:41:59,948
And if you agreed to meet me,

559
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:04,125
you're working on it, too.

560
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,966
Trust me, Victor.

561
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,134
Mayday! Mayday!

562
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,372
Something came down from the sky!

563
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,970
Cortlandt, you're cutting out.

564
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,913
Please help me!

565
00:42:46,556 --> 00:42:47,453
Whiskey.

566
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,692
And one for Ahab, there.

567
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:51,559
They came from the sky.

568
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:54,351
I... I heard a cannon.

569
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,647
To ocean's rage.
And they came.

570
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,834
Monsters from...

571
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,808
from the sky.

572
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:03,655
Tore right through my boat.

573
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,630
Monsters.

574
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:09,669
It's on him.

575
00:45:35,056 --> 00:45:36,288
You took a hell of a hit.

576
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:38,242
You alright?

577
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,952
At last.

578
00:45:40,316 --> 00:45:42,886
The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna.

579
00:45:44,682 --> 00:45:45,499
Wait.

580
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,908
Please.

581
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:53,032
I knew her.

582
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:56,516
Well, that makes one of us.

583
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,497
When my parents fought in the wars,

584
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:00,795
she took me in.

585
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:01,834
What a saint.

586
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:03,928
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

587
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,230
Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

588
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,279
and never gave me another thought.

589
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:09,197
Your mother left you to save your life.

590
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,610
You cannot imagine how it hurt her.

591
00:46:12,345 --> 00:46:13,464
What it cost her.

592
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,742
But you're not a defenseless child now.

593
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:20,980
It would have been her responsibility

594
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,741
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

595
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,290
Now...

596
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:28,660
it's yours.

597
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,411
Then I'm gonna need something
from you.

598
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,324
I see, Mother.

599
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,475
I see why you waited to summon me.

600
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:45,610
The Kryptonian's death plunged
this timid world into such terror.

601
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:51,866
Amazons, Atlanteans,
each stands and falls alone.

602
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,327
I know Mother,

603
00:47:57,462 --> 00:47:59,703
you've waited too
long for the unity.

604
00:47:59,997 --> 00:48:01,017
I know.

605
00:48:01,124 --> 00:48:02,522
But you will feed.

606
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,704
And my exile will come to an end.

607
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,133
I will take my place among
the New Gods.

608
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,679
Find the last one!

609
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,221
Its power will cleanse this world.

610
00:48:22,974 --> 00:48:24,559
For the unity!

611
00:48:26,221 --> 00:48:27,679
For Darkseid.

612
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,468
Oh, Victor.

613
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,454
Asshole!

614
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,928
Eight kidnappings.
Six in Metropolis, two here.

615
00:48:53,941 --> 00:48:55,690
All the vics work for STAR Labs.

616
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,808
Attacked by a flying vampire.

617
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:05,211
Suspect was a giant bat
with huge fangs.

618
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:06,663
One of them was a little kid.

619
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:09,209
Scared. Won't say a word but drew this.

620
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:09,950
Looks like...

621
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,265
I know what it looks like.

622
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,550
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here,

623
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,130
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

624
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,508
I'll talk to him tonight.

625
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,394
World's gone crazy, Jim.

626
00:49:22,695 --> 00:49:24,135
Maybe he did, too.

627
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,030
Did you find the cyborg?

628
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:32,521
We spoke.

629
00:49:33,089 --> 00:49:34,206
Give him time.

630
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:36,533
You must be Barry.

631
00:49:36,535 --> 00:49:37,569
I'm Diana.

632
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,126
Hi, Barry, I'm Diana.

633
00:49:39,207 --> 00:49:41,007
That's not right. Great.

634
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,573
So this is us?

635
00:49:42,575 --> 00:49:43,889
Yeah, this is us.

636
00:49:44,796 --> 00:49:45,860
Awesome!

637
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,740
That's the Bat-Signal!
That's your...

638
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,252
Sorry.
That's your signal.

639
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:51,654
That means we have to go now.

640
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,356
Yeah, that's what that means.

641
00:49:53,412 --> 00:49:54,469
It's so cool.

642
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,689
How many of you are there?

643
00:50:32,427 --> 00:50:33,530
<i>Not enough.</i>

644
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,835
Eight people abducted
from or near STAR Labs.

645
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,619
Here's the potential perp.

646
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,465
Parademons.

647
00:50:41,982 --> 00:50:43,036
Ok.

648
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:45,319
The demons must have caught
the scent of the Mother Box.

649
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,923
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

650
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:49,517
<i>So the eight may still be alive.</i>

651
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,403
Nine.

652
00:50:53,424 --> 00:50:55,794
The head of STAR Labs
was taken as well.

653
00:50:56,795 --> 00:50:58,035
You made it.

654
00:50:59,764 --> 00:51:00,856
So then,

655
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:02,582
there must be a nest nearby.

656
00:51:02,865 --> 00:51:05,188
I plotted all the sightings in Metropolis,

657
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,242
Gotham.

658
00:51:06,249 --> 00:51:07,619
No pattern I can see.

659
00:51:07,712 --> 00:51:09,570
The lines on the map don't converge.

660
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,356
On land.

661
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:13,398
These lead back to Braxton
Island between the two cities.

662
00:51:13,451 --> 00:51:14,691
<i>Gotham Harbor.</i>

663
00:51:14,693 --> 00:51:15,825
<i>These are air vents.</i>

664
00:51:15,827 --> 00:51:19,890
<i>They all lead down to the tunnel for
Metropolis Project that was abandoned in '29.</i>

665
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:24,016
Do you really think that...

666
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:27,041
They just...

667
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:28,436
They really just vanish.

668
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:31,178
That's rude.

669
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,950
<i>Where are we, Alfred?
Braxton Island.</i>

670
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,187
You should be...

671
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:05,462
directly under the venting
tower for the tunnel.

672
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:08,513
<i>Now look to your left,
you should see a staircase.</i>

673
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,718
<i>It'll give you access
to the machine room.</i>

674
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:18,854
Define access.

675
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,770
<i>One at a time.</i>

676
00:52:20,772 --> 00:52:21,873
<i>The bridge may not...</i>

677
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:23,774
<i>hold.</i>

678
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,265
Just tell me the truth.

679
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,420
Please, just let us go.
I have a family.

680
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,543
Wrong answer.

681
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,120
Humans.

682
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:42,203
The stench of your fear
is making my soldiers hungry.

683
00:52:42,688 --> 00:52:45,058
Shall I feed them?

684
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,393
You've been near the Mother Box.

685
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:50,030
Her scent is on you.

686
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,861
Please. We have families.

687
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:54,635
Why does everyone keep telling me that?

688
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,570
Please.

689
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,974
I don't need to hurt you...

690
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:00,815
Right. Ok. Yeah.

691
00:53:00,817 --> 00:53:01,669
Here's the thing.

692
00:53:02,314 --> 00:53:04,288
See, I'm afraid of bugs and...

693
00:53:04,918 --> 00:53:07,564
Guns and obnoxiously tall people.

694
00:53:07,566 --> 00:53:09,226
And murder. And I can't be here.

695
00:53:10,135 --> 00:53:13,086
It's really cool you guys seem
ready to do battle and stuff but...

696
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,781
full transparency, I've never done battle.

697
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,353
I've just pushed some people
and run away.

698
00:53:19,025 --> 00:53:20,050
<i>Save one.</i>

699
00:53:20,415 --> 00:53:21,212
What?

700
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,020
<i>Save one person.</i>

701
00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:25,666
Which one?

702
00:53:25,795 --> 00:53:27,461
<i>Don't talk, don't fight.</i>

703
00:53:27,463 --> 00:53:29,015
<i>Get in, get one out.</i>

704
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:30,505
And then?

705
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:32,066
<i>You'll know.</i>

706
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,215
Ok.

707
00:53:37,144 --> 00:53:38,319
Useless.

708
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,418
You then.

709
00:53:43,733 --> 00:53:46,623
Where is my Mother Box?

710
00:53:48,157 --> 00:53:50,073
I'll die before I tell you.

711
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:53,788
At last, one that doesn't whine.

712
00:53:56,681 --> 00:53:58,450
But you will scream.

713
00:54:03,552 --> 00:54:04,446
Dad.

714
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:05,762
Victor.

715
00:54:07,732 --> 00:54:10,112
You were born of her.

716
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,150
A creature of chaos.

717
00:54:13,155 --> 00:54:14,423
Not how I see it.

718
00:54:14,595 --> 00:54:16,335
Give it time.

719
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,043
Amazon!

720
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:40,865
Ok.

721
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,860
Save one. Save one.

722
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,430
This one is mine.

723
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,884
You overestimate yourself.

724
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:01,139
Child,

725
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,889
my ax is still slick
with the blood of your sisters.

726
00:55:20,548 --> 00:55:22,097
<i>Alfred, I need the Nightcrawler.</i>

727
00:55:22,308 --> 00:55:23,604
Thought you'd never ask.

728
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,574
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

729
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,721
Ok, you good?

730
00:55:41,935 --> 00:55:44,405
At the end of the hall,
there should be stairs. Go!

731
00:55:44,561 --> 00:55:46,861
He's after the change engine.
His Mother Box.

732
00:55:46,863 --> 00:55:48,058
You have to keep him from it.

733
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,625
Help people get to safety.
Promise me!

734
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,205
Go!

735
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:27,571
Finish her!

736
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,338
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

737
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:36,399
<i>I didn't bring a sword.</i>

738
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:51,979
<i>Jesus. He is tall.</i>

739
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,660
Oh, fuck.

740
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,454
So, you have the blood
of the Old Gods in you.

741
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,630
The Old Gods died.

742
00:58:24,106 --> 00:58:24,699
No!

743
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:44,292
Heads up.

744
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,712
Thanks, Alfred,

745
00:58:56,714 --> 00:58:57,976
but I'll take it from here.

746
00:58:58,886 --> 00:59:00,084
Do I know you?

747
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,386
Primitive beings.

748
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,249
What are we under right now?

749
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,404
<i>Gotham Harbor.</i>

750
00:59:34,174 --> 00:59:35,474
You all need to move.

751
00:59:35,476 --> 00:59:36,497
You get him out.

752
00:59:36,499 --> 00:59:37,632
<i>Diana, there is no time.</i>

753
00:59:37,669 --> 00:59:39,449
Also among my fears is drowning.

754
00:59:40,085 --> 00:59:41,750
You are a distraction.

755
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:44,276
Mother is calling.

756
00:59:48,903 --> 00:59:49,898
Diana, come on!

757
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,301
Oh, come on.

758
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:43,613
The change engine.

759
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,426
Did he just bail?

760
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,584
Millions in structural damage.

761
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:55,302
You haven't lost your touch.

762
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:57,966
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

763
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,145
Dressed like a bat.

764
01:01:04,065 --> 01:01:04,808
I dig it.

765
01:01:05,978 --> 01:01:07,566
<i>May be temporary.</i>

766
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,250
<i>So...</i>

767
01:01:09,252 --> 01:01:10,743
<i>what made you change your mind?</i>

768
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,127
Steppenwolf.

769
01:01:13,197 --> 01:01:14,819
He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.

770
01:01:15,252 --> 01:01:17,588
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

771
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:19,151
<i>If he doesn't already have it.</i>

772
01:01:22,456 --> 01:01:23,474
He doesn't have it.

773
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:13,606
It's like a cave.

774
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,126
Like a bat cave.

775
01:02:22,355 --> 01:02:23,355
Barry.

776
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:27,296
My father called it a change engine.

777
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:29,634
It was found by the British
during World War I.

778
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,180
They studied it, but they couldn't
even date it, it's so old.

779
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,127
It was shelved till
the night Superman died.

780
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,400
Then she lit up like Christmas.

781
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:44,448
They brought it to STAR Labs where my father
recognized it as a perpetual energy matrix.

782
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:47,594
That sounds cool. I thought
it was like a nuclear bomb.

783
01:02:47,621 --> 01:02:49,728
A Mother Box destroys
as it creates.

784
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,254
It's a cycle of life,

785
01:02:52,256 --> 01:02:53,865
but a million times faster.

786
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,010
My father thought it was the key
to unlimited energy.

787
01:02:57,605 --> 01:02:58,884
New formulas.

788
01:02:59,215 --> 01:03:00,595
Cellular regeneration.

789
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,922
But it's too volatile
to control.

790
01:03:03,254 --> 01:03:04,584
He used it on you.

791
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:06,978
I was in an accident.

792
01:03:07,646 --> 01:03:08,731
Should've died.

793
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:12,261
My father thought that he
could use the Mother Box

794
01:03:12,263 --> 01:03:13,823
to rebuild the broken parts of me

795
01:03:13,825 --> 01:03:15,546
with a few cybernetic enhancements.

796
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,575
Instead he built a living machine

797
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,368
that may be stronger than its host.

798
01:03:19,815 --> 01:03:21,015
Too much.

799
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:22,921
Too much life.

800
01:03:23,978 --> 01:03:25,478
What's on your weird mind?

801
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,700
Muscles,

802
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:30,279
coordination, basic cellular integrity.

803
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:33,382
A human being can only absorb so much.

804
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,151
The Mother Box was designed
to reshape a planet.

805
01:03:37,746 --> 01:03:38,456
So?

806
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:39,545
So...

807
01:03:39,547 --> 01:03:41,555
what if you were stronger than a planet?

808
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:44,059
Your cells lying dormant,

809
01:03:44,591 --> 01:03:46,293
but incapable of decay.

810
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,837
If you were in a conductive field,

811
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:51,098
a boost from the Mother Box...

812
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,236
Could bring him back to life.

813
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:58,430
The Kryptonian ship
has an amniotic chamber,

814
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,761
which would be a perfect...
No.

815
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,731
Diana...
Bruce, no.

816
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:04,670
You have no idea what kind
of power you are dealing with.

817
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,310
Even if there is a fraction of a chance?

818
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:09,010
That what? That we could raise
a monster like Luthor did?

819
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,536
We have tech Luthor's never even seen.

820
01:04:10,538 --> 01:04:12,168
Superman is dead.

821
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,591
We all wish he weren't.

822
01:04:14,593 --> 01:04:16,127
We don't know what state he's in.

823
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,197
We know we can't bring him back.

824
01:04:18,584 --> 01:04:20,709
But this is science beyond our limits.

825
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:22,696
And that's what science is for.

826
01:04:22,698 --> 01:04:24,455
To do what's never been done.
To make life better.

827
01:04:24,457 --> 01:04:25,826
Or to end it.

828
01:04:26,423 --> 01:04:28,300
Technology is like any other power.

829
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,917
Without reason, without heart,

830
01:04:29,919 --> 01:04:31,288
it destroys us.

831
01:04:32,474 --> 01:04:34,174
You're risking lives.

832
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,783
Theirs and maybe countless more.

833
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:39,180
We don't have time for a control group.

834
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,127
Is it a risk? Yes.
But it's necessary.

835
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:42,563
Why, because of your guilt?

836
01:04:44,985 --> 01:04:46,778
Bruce, I was there.

837
01:04:47,068 --> 01:04:48,931
You didn't kill Superman.

838
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:52,992
At some point, even you have
to learn to move on.

839
01:04:53,387 --> 01:04:55,291
Steve Trevor tell you that?

840
01:05:06,884 --> 01:05:08,178
Superman

841
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,870
was a beacon to the world.

842
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:13,749
Why aren't you?

843
01:05:15,594 --> 01:05:17,258
You're an inspiration, Diana.

844
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,118
You don't just save people,

845
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:21,883
you make them see their better selves.

846
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:27,246
And yet, I'd never heard of you until
Luthor lured you out by stealing

847
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,786
a picture of your dead boyfriend.

848
01:05:31,387 --> 01:05:32,842
You shut yourself down,

849
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,230
for a century,

850
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,158
so let's not talk about me moving on.

851
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,009
You know that if she kills you,
we'll cover for her.

852
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:42,677
We are not enough!

853
01:05:43,383 --> 01:05:45,316
Each of us, in our own way,
is held back.

854
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:47,754
And I promise you, Steppenwolf is
not out there talking about ethics.

855
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,735
He's trying to burn down the world!

856
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:51,924
The way we're gonna stop him,

857
01:05:52,429 --> 01:05:53,837
is by using his power...

858
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:56,261
This power, against him.

859
01:05:57,924 --> 01:05:58,942
I agree.

860
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,463
I don't like the idea of
reintegrating with the Mother Box,

861
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,360
but I was running the numbers
while you were being an asshole,

862
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,700
and there is a high probability
that we can bring him back.

863
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,628
Right, right.

864
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:12,012
But we mean bring him
back in like a, Yay he's back!

865
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:13,018
Way, not in like a...

866
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:15,082
Pet Sematary...

867
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,620
scenario.

868
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:18,115
You lose something when you die.

869
01:06:19,084 --> 01:06:20,296
Even Superman.

870
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:21,984
Maybe not his mind.

871
01:06:22,569 --> 01:06:23,739
Maybe his soul.

872
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:26,146
I'll have a contingency plan for that.

873
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:29,814
If he wakes up and you're
the first thing he sees,

874
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,642
you'll need one.

875
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,414
Well, that was fun while it didn't last.

876
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,900
She could've stopped me.

877
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,107
I practically dared her to.

878
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,930
I don't see why you're pushing her.

879
01:06:52,189 --> 01:06:53,529
We have to boost the signal.

880
01:06:53,585 --> 01:06:55,171
Put it through the Batmobile speakers.

881
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,642
Yeah, now you're changing the subject.

882
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:58,077
I have a contingency.

883
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,834
What?
Diana was right about the risk.

884
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:02,574
If the plan goes south,
we're gonna bring in the big guns.

885
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,253
But that's not...

886
01:07:04,682 --> 01:07:06,369
Those are very big guns.

887
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:08,371
You've got a team here.

888
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:09,935
Superman would bring
this team together

889
01:07:09,937 --> 01:07:11,756
better than I ever could.
His strength...

890
01:07:11,758 --> 01:07:13,298
It doesn't matter how strong you are.

891
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,370
Or what abilities you might have...

892
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:16,770
He was more human than I am.

893
01:07:21,351 --> 01:07:22,479
He lived in this world.

894
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:24,430
Fell in love.

895
01:07:24,612 --> 01:07:25,624
Had a job.

896
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,060
Despite all that power.

897
01:07:30,158 --> 01:07:31,498
The world needs Superman.

898
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,820
And the team needs Clark.

899
01:07:37,485 --> 01:07:38,925
And what does Clark need?

900
01:07:40,207 --> 01:07:41,747
Maybe he's at peace.

901
01:07:43,016 --> 01:07:44,026
He'll get over it.

902
01:07:54,914 --> 01:07:55,821
You know,

903
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:58,047
I could do this a lot faster. I just...

904
01:07:58,477 --> 01:08:00,269
Is it weird that it feels disrespectful?

905
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:01,356
Yep.

906
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,110
Do you feel a sense of confidence

907
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,640
that we're not doing something horribly

908
01:08:07,642 --> 01:08:09,060
wrong and macabre here?

909
01:08:09,915 --> 01:08:10,867
Not really.

910
01:08:11,252 --> 01:08:14,162
Ok, then why...
Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

911
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:15,777
The stories Diana told us,

912
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:17,961
I believe them.

913
01:08:18,817 --> 01:08:20,068
Why we got to stop him.

914
01:08:20,683 --> 01:08:21,680
That's the plan.

915
01:08:22,951 --> 01:08:23,951
That's the plan.

916
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:29,594
Ok. We're not ready for...

917
01:08:30,892 --> 01:08:32,066
It's racially charged.

918
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:35,549
You got struck by lightning?

919
01:08:36,544 --> 01:08:38,430
Yeah,
that's the abridged version.

920
01:08:39,101 --> 01:08:40,669
And you...
Explosion.

921
01:08:41,332 --> 01:08:42,451
Woke up in a lab.

922
01:08:42,684 --> 01:08:44,424
So we're the accidents.

923
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:46,928
Yeah, that's us.

924
01:08:47,908 --> 01:08:49,978
Hey. No, no.

925
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:04,066
<i>We're approaching the Kryptonian ship.</i>

926
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,291
<i>ETA 30 seconds.</i>

927
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:13,661
I'm here for him.

928
01:09:14,834 --> 01:09:16,864
<i>I swear I would never...</i>
Save it.

929
01:09:37,997 --> 01:09:39,406
Ok.
Ok.

930
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:41,631
Ok.

931
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:04,216
This is amazing.

932
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,870
This is crazy.

933
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,563
Oh, what, now it's crazy?

934
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:10,984
You lunatics better know
what you're doing.

935
01:11:01,196 --> 01:11:02,380
<i>Welcome.</i>

936
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,220
Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

937
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,836
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

938
01:11:10,842 --> 01:11:12,112
I might be able to do it.

939
01:11:13,157 --> 01:11:14,455
I might be able to jump-start it.

940
01:11:14,457 --> 01:11:15,621
If I can get enough distance,

941
01:11:15,836 --> 01:11:17,771
I can conduct a significant electrical current.

942
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,708
I might be able to wake the box.
If that's...

943
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:23,410
still what we want.
<i>We have to try.</i>

944
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,160
This must be the end of the line so...

945
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,813
<i>I'm in position.</i>

946
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,406
The Mother Box is ready.

947
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,673
You have to charge it the moment
it touches the fluid.

948
01:11:39,202 --> 01:11:40,616
Five.
Five.

949
01:11:40,834 --> 01:11:42,168
Diana's right.

950
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,678
This is a bad idea.

951
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:45,729
Four.
Four.

952
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:48,851
Three.
Three.

953
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:50,256
Two.

954
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:51,892
Two.

955
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:54,452
One.

956
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,650
He's back.

957
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:57,700
<i>Dispatch, this is 3-Adam-1-6.</i>

958
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:58,900
<i>Backing up Code Three.</i>

959
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,100
<i>I'm currently two minutes out.</i>

960
01:14:03,161 --> 01:14:04,342
He's not alright.

961
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,040
<i>Copy that.</i>

962
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,410
He's scanning us.
What?

963
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:12,840
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

964
01:14:12,842 --> 01:14:13,982
Because he's not alright.

965
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:14,985
Oh, no.

966
01:14:15,094 --> 01:14:17,822
Should we bow?
Or show our bellies?

967
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,744
Victor? Victor!

968
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,725
Shit!
What are you doing?

969
01:14:24,841 --> 01:14:25,483
Victor!

970
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:26,635
It's my armor's defense system.

971
01:14:26,637 --> 01:14:28,256
No!
It's stronger since the interface.

972
01:14:28,258 --> 01:14:29,538
I can't control it.
Victor!

973
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,812
No! Victor!

974
01:14:30,882 --> 01:14:32,190
Just think happy thoughts!
Victor!

975
01:14:32,192 --> 01:14:33,528
Go to a happier place.

976
01:14:45,745 --> 01:14:46,831
Kal-El, no!

977
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,359
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

978
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,101
Pet Sematary.

979
01:15:04,905 --> 01:15:07,140
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

980
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:13,800
I got him.

981
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,419
Kal-El,

982
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,861
the last son of Krypton.

983
01:15:36,028 --> 01:15:38,158
Remember who you are.

984
01:15:40,066 --> 01:15:41,441
Tell me who you...

985
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:39,583
<i>Clark.</i>

986
01:16:44,403 --> 01:16:45,405
I know you.

987
01:16:52,323 --> 01:16:53,998
Please don't make me do this.

988
01:17:15,581 --> 01:17:16,910
Alfred, I need the big gun.

989
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,490
You did this.

990
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,112
I had to.

991
01:17:26,536 --> 01:17:28,166
You won't let me live.

992
01:17:29,575 --> 01:17:31,175
You won't let me die.

993
01:17:31,977 --> 01:17:33,407
The world needs you.

994
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,797
But does it need you?

995
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,003
Tell me.

996
01:17:45,187 --> 01:17:46,627
Do you bleed?

997
01:17:48,835 --> 01:17:49,705
Clark!

998
01:17:58,456 --> 01:17:59,261
Clark.

999
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:02,321
Please.

1000
01:18:21,595 --> 01:18:22,595
Please.

1001
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:31,003
Please.

1002
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:32,924
Just go.

1003
01:18:34,545 --> 01:18:35,545
Yeah.

1004
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,110
Let's go.

1005
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:52,379
Yeah, something is definitely bleeding.

1006
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:13,851
The Mother Box.

1007
01:19:15,624 --> 01:19:16,892
He has the last one.

1008
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,263
You brought us here.

1009
01:19:35,143 --> 01:19:36,203
You remembered.

1010
01:19:39,222 --> 01:19:40,304
This is home.

1011
01:19:43,009 --> 01:19:44,015
You smell good.

1012
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:49,162
Did I not before?

1013
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:06,486
Don't do that.

1014
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:08,970
We just got our asses handed to us.

1015
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,720
And Steppenwolf has got
the third box.

1016
01:20:10,882 --> 01:20:12,179
So we find them.

1017
01:20:13,253 --> 01:20:15,479
If the boxes are even close
to each other,

1018
01:20:15,488 --> 01:20:18,118
there is going to be
some kind of energy surge.

1019
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,417
Steppenwolf's gonna be keeping
them somewhere where they don't read.

1020
01:20:20,556 --> 01:20:22,686
No Internet, no satellite coverage.

1021
01:20:22,795 --> 01:20:25,027
Well, that narrows it down.
Not enough.

1022
01:20:25,442 --> 01:20:26,810
So, you can't find them.

1023
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,830
Or maybe you don't want to.

1024
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:32,822
Arthur.

1025
01:20:32,824 --> 01:20:34,639
Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of Superman.

1026
01:20:34,714 --> 01:20:37,200
Man, I'm not doing this on purpose.

1027
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,280
Right, because you can't
control the machine.

1028
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:43,412
So is this a bad time
to bring up my blood sugar?

1029
01:20:45,844 --> 01:20:46,844
Very hungry.

1030
01:20:49,092 --> 01:20:50,155
Victor.

1031
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,483
You can find the boxes.

1032
01:20:52,485 --> 01:20:53,995
You share their energy.

1033
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:57,179
I know it's frightening,
but if you go under,

1034
01:20:57,247 --> 01:20:59,647
I promise we will pull you back out.

1035
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,426
Just keep the little merman
away from me while I work.

1036
01:21:09,566 --> 01:21:11,872
Barry, go find Alfred in the pantry.

1037
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,380
When you come back, get online.

1038
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:15,328
Everybody checks everybody
else's work.

1039
01:21:16,608 --> 01:21:17,427
Listen...

1040
01:21:18,024 --> 01:21:19,061
I was wondering if you could...

1041
01:21:19,343 --> 01:21:20,335
put out a...

1042
01:21:20,337 --> 01:21:21,798
you know, feeler.

1043
01:21:22,386 --> 01:21:23,916
Like, aquatic.

1044
01:21:24,445 --> 01:21:25,062
You know.

1045
01:21:26,378 --> 01:21:27,678
Do you talk to fish?

1046
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:32,156
The water does the talking.

1047
01:21:33,303 --> 01:21:34,058
Of course.

1048
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,449
If the current comes in strange,
it might point the way.

1049
01:21:37,609 --> 01:21:38,301
Ok.

1050
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:02,846
Wait.

1051
01:22:04,232 --> 01:22:05,046
Let me.

1052
01:22:06,502 --> 01:22:07,902
It's just a little out of place.

1053
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:13,591
So Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

1054
01:22:13,706 --> 01:22:14,987
He could've killed you.

1055
01:22:15,566 --> 01:22:17,006
I was willing to make the trade.

1056
01:22:19,329 --> 01:22:21,000
And bringing in Lois Lane?

1057
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,870
Remember what you told me
about heart in the hangar?

1058
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:24,911
I bet you...

1059
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,364
thought I wasn't listening.

1060
01:22:27,737 --> 01:22:28,767
Thank you.

1061
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,200
You know you can't do this forever.

1062
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:36,107
I can barely do it now.

1063
01:22:37,076 --> 01:22:38,217
Steppenwolf.

1064
01:22:39,032 --> 01:22:40,092
This is the job.

1065
01:22:40,094 --> 01:22:41,077
It's my job.

1066
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:43,910
And I haven't been doing it.

1067
01:22:43,912 --> 01:22:45,061
I've been reacting.

1068
01:22:45,855 --> 01:22:46,855
Not leading.

1069
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:51,885
You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor...

1070
01:22:51,887 --> 01:22:53,377
It wasn't my business.
I'm sorry.

1071
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:57,823
You were pushing me
to lead the team.

1072
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:00,980
But leaders get people killed.

1073
01:23:02,095 --> 01:23:02,951
I fought,

1074
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:04,350
always,

1075
01:23:05,341 --> 01:23:06,512
when I was needed.

1076
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:10,822
But to lead, to step into
the light and to say to people,

1077
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:13,211
This is worth your life.

1078
01:23:15,401 --> 01:23:16,841
When it's your fault,

1079
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:20,773
they're all Steve Trevor.

1080
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,154
We make it through tonight,

1081
01:23:25,429 --> 01:23:27,415
you can stay in the shadows forever.

1082
01:23:28,733 --> 01:23:30,033
Dress up like a bat.

1083
01:23:30,127 --> 01:23:31,397
I won't even sue.

1084
01:23:32,636 --> 01:23:34,941
If we get through the night.

1085
01:23:55,809 --> 01:23:56,839
Are you ok?

1086
01:23:59,582 --> 01:24:00,842
You brought us here, but you've...

1087
01:24:00,919 --> 01:24:02,583
hardly spent a minute in the house.

1088
01:24:03,074 --> 01:24:04,574
I know. It's...

1089
01:24:07,261 --> 01:24:08,861
I just got out of a wooden box.

1090
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:12,859
What was it like?

1091
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:15,867
Coming back?

1092
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:21,102
Itchy.

1093
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,823
I mean, honestly,

1094
01:24:25,553 --> 01:24:28,289
weird in so many ways.

1095
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:31,889
But mostly just...
I wasn't strong.

1096
01:24:35,428 --> 01:24:36,628
I didn't...

1097
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,380
You would have been
very disappointed in me.

1098
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,289
I wasn't...

1099
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:44,630
Lois Lane, the dedicated reporter. I...

1100
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,241
I just...

1101
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,035
It's ok.

1102
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:52,557
I'm the idiot who left.

1103
01:24:53,946 --> 01:24:55,049
But I'm back now.

1104
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:57,725
And I'm gonna make things right.

1105
01:25:18,899 --> 01:25:19,959
You called Mom.

1106
01:25:21,588 --> 01:25:22,580
Of course.

1107
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:24,159
Thank you.

1108
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,362
I was hoping it was gonna
take you longer to recover.

1109
01:25:32,069 --> 01:25:32,772
Why?

1110
01:25:34,473 --> 01:25:36,460
Because now I have to send you away.

1111
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:40,090
Bruce.

1112
01:25:40,796 --> 01:25:41,907
He needs you.

1113
01:25:42,698 --> 01:25:44,571
Fate of the world, I think that's the deal.

1114
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:45,874
He was pretty tense.

1115
01:25:46,499 --> 01:25:48,099
Well, I guess I do owe him one.

1116
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:50,434
Right.

1117
01:25:51,998 --> 01:25:53,138
But no dying.

1118
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:55,731
And I get the exclusive.

1119
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:57,869
Yes, ma'am.

1120
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:35,860
Are you really you?

1121
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,430
I'm really me, Ma.

1122
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,840
At last.

1123
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,071
Praise to the unity!

1124
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:59,320
The three as one.

1125
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:30,681
Praise to the mother of horrors.

1126
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,890
Is Steppenwolf there?

1127
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:43,225
<i>Just a minute.</i>

1128
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:45,403
Sorry.

1129
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,337
It's Pozharnov

1130
01:27:47,339 --> 01:27:48,493
in northern Russia.

1131
01:27:48,495 --> 01:27:49,651
The nuclear plant.

1132
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:51,492
Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

1133
01:27:51,494 --> 01:27:53,924
There have been some
attempts to resettle nearby.

1134
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:56,215
But it looks like really rough sledding.

1135
01:27:56,682 --> 01:27:58,667
Who picks this place to put down roots?

1136
01:27:59,102 --> 01:28:01,112
People that have been
kicked out of everywhere else.

1137
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,102
The Earth starts changing,

1138
01:28:03,297 --> 01:28:04,879
it will hit them first.

1139
01:28:05,009 --> 01:28:06,240
How long have we got?

1140
01:28:06,242 --> 01:28:07,394
A few hours.

1141
01:28:08,077 --> 01:28:09,762
Transport won't fly that fast.

1142
01:28:10,999 --> 01:28:12,099
It will for me.

1143
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,877
The unity brings all three boxes
together in perfect sync.

1144
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:00,947
Its power builds until
it can't be contained.

1145
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,326
But if I can cause a delay between
each box, even for a nanosecond,

1146
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:08,049
its energy will cascade, form a loop.

1147
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:09,101
They'll feed on each other.

1148
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:11,360
And that's it?
We just pull them apart.

1149
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,762
No fuss, no muss.

1150
01:29:12,844 --> 01:29:15,444
Separating the boxes is still
gonna cause a massive surge.

1151
01:29:15,646 --> 01:29:16,678
I'll have to be there.

1152
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:18,940
But you guys should think
about getting clear.

1153
01:29:18,942 --> 01:29:20,330
We're with you till it's done.

1154
01:29:20,367 --> 01:29:22,647
Honestly, I think we're all
gonna be dead way before that.

1155
01:29:23,449 --> 01:29:24,471
And you know what?

1156
01:29:24,847 --> 01:29:25,810
I don't mind.

1157
01:29:25,975 --> 01:29:27,172
It's an honorable end.

1158
01:29:28,021 --> 01:29:29,950
But we got to shut Steppenwolf down.

1159
01:29:30,906 --> 01:29:32,256
Superman's a no-show.

1160
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:34,379
You got no powers. No offense.

1161
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,852
This guy might be working
for the enemy, we don't know.

1162
01:29:37,212 --> 01:29:39,032
You're tripping over your feet and mine.

1163
01:29:41,636 --> 01:29:42,936
You're gorgeous.

1164
01:29:43,116 --> 01:29:45,360
And fierce, and strong, and...

1165
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,316
I know we went to war with the
Amazons, but that was before my time.

1166
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,513
And you know what?
I don't wanna die.

1167
01:29:51,012 --> 01:29:53,010
I'm young.
There's shit that I want to do.

1168
01:29:53,694 --> 01:29:54,553
I just feel like...

1169
01:29:54,749 --> 01:29:57,219
I didn't really embrace
the sea or the land.

1170
01:29:57,648 --> 01:29:59,118
I've been a loner my whole life.

1171
01:29:59,259 --> 01:30:01,856
But being part of something
bigger like this,

1172
01:30:03,212 --> 01:30:04,644
maybe I'm scared because

1173
01:30:05,364 --> 01:30:06,571
I'm meant to...

1174
01:30:18,491 --> 01:30:20,131
I think that was beautiful.

1175
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:25,299
You say a word about this,

1176
01:30:25,301 --> 01:30:27,121
and you'll meet every piranha I know.

1177
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,862
I honestly didn't hear anything
after, We're all gonna die.

1178
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:56,590
Let them come.

1179
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:07,082
<i>I'm going to take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.</i>

1180
01:31:07,335 --> 01:31:08,462
<i>You get to Steppenwolf.</i>

1181
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:10,661
<i>Don't wait for me, just do the job.</i>

1182
01:32:14,974 --> 01:32:17,065
<i>Alright, Alfred.
Are we set for broadcast?</i>

1183
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:19,705
Playing all your favorite hits.

1184
01:32:30,006 --> 01:32:32,156
<i>Come on, follow me, you damn insects.</i>

1185
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:44,830
<i>They're coming.</i>

1186
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,880
<i>They're all coming.</i>

1187
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:54,457
We might not have thought this through.

1188
01:32:58,488 --> 01:32:59,807
He's clearing the field.

1189
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,065
He won't last three minutes.

1190
01:33:02,332 --> 01:33:03,572
Then let's use them.

1191
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:08,128
On my lead.

1192
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:22,830
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1193
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:26,400
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

1194
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:30,331
Oh, snap!

1195
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,798
You're welcome.

1196
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:39,867
Yeah!

1197
01:34:39,961 --> 01:34:41,161
<i>This isn't the plan.</i>

1198
01:34:41,163 --> 01:34:42,533
<i>No, Master Wayne.</i>

1199
01:34:43,193 --> 01:34:44,365
This is the team.

1200
01:34:45,432 --> 01:34:46,673
Hey, blame the lady.

1201
01:34:46,873 --> 01:34:48,913
We would have left you,
but she didn't ask for a vote.

1202
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:54,335
So your genius move is dying?

1203
01:34:54,721 --> 01:34:56,239
You really are out of your mind.

1204
01:34:56,606 --> 01:34:58,431
<i>I'm not the one who brought a pitchfork.</i>

1205
01:35:21,819 --> 01:35:22,952
Ride ain't over yet.

1206
01:35:23,172 --> 01:35:24,120
My man.

1207
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:11,312
Is this what conquering is?

1208
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,498
Hiding from the fight?

1209
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:15,522
Oh, no.

1210
01:36:16,613 --> 01:36:18,027
You're all mine.

1211
01:36:24,192 --> 01:36:25,720
Thanks for the lift.
Yeah, no problem.

1212
01:36:25,884 --> 01:36:26,781
You got this?

1213
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,184
These things are gonna keep coming.

1214
01:36:30,262 --> 01:36:32,590
Ok. You get technical,
I'm on bug duty.

1215
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:33,594
Let's do it.

1216
01:36:38,403 --> 01:36:40,027
Yes! That was gross!

1217
01:37:01,355 --> 01:37:02,247
Thank you.

1218
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:05,482
This is...

1219
01:37:07,194 --> 01:37:08,394
This is a lot.

1220
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:30,362
Now do you see it?

1221
01:37:51,331 --> 01:37:54,039
<i>Whatever you're in the
middle of it's spreading for miles.</i>

1222
01:37:54,448 --> 01:37:56,761
Satellites show civilians moving east.

1223
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,926
They're not gonna make it.

1224
01:37:59,293 --> 01:38:00,138
<i>Barry.</i>

1225
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:02,042
<i>I need you to take a walk.</i>

1226
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,430
God, I hope this is east.

1227
01:38:56,439 --> 01:39:00,003
You're not worthy to touch Mother.

1228
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:01,992
She's power,

1229
01:39:02,408 --> 01:39:05,395
and power is the only law.

1230
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:14,569
You're all too weak to see the truth.

1231
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:16,072
Well...

1232
01:39:17,784 --> 01:39:19,254
I believe in truth.

1233
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:22,599
But I'm also a big fan of justice.

1234
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:32,530
Alright.

1235
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:38,170
Kryptonian!

1236
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:57,101
So, how do I help?

1237
01:39:57,116 --> 01:40:00,590
We buy him some time, he can stop that
box from destroying all life on Earth.

1238
01:40:01,981 --> 01:40:03,096
We hope.

1239
01:40:03,123 --> 01:40:05,759
Well, I knew you didn't bring
me back because you liked me.

1240
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:08,054
I don't not...

1241
01:40:14,585 --> 01:40:16,285
Civilians.
Barry's headed...

1242
01:40:16,293 --> 01:40:17,287
There's too many of them.

1243
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:28,020
Come on.

1244
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,475
Ok, this is definitely east.

1245
01:40:50,515 --> 01:40:51,565
Slowpoke.

1246
01:40:52,178 --> 01:40:53,378
Oh, it's on.

1247
01:40:53,401 --> 01:40:54,901
I'll take the ones on the right.

1248
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:58,915
It's ok.

1249
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,860
Hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

1250
01:41:19,968 --> 01:41:21,138
Dostoevsky!

1251
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,953
Is this guy still bothering you?

1252
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:55,377
Superman!

1253
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,365
We got to pull these things apart.

1254
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:00,023
A couple more seconds,
you'll see your opening.

1255
01:42:00,864 --> 01:42:02,532
Any blowback?
Big time.

1256
01:42:03,393 --> 01:42:04,651
But I think we can take it.

1257
01:42:04,823 --> 01:42:05,418
Good.

1258
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:08,320
Because I really like
being alive.

1259
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:10,436
So do I.

1260
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:34,861
Clark.

1261
01:42:41,101 --> 01:42:42,171
I take it back.

1262
01:42:43,177 --> 01:42:44,447
I wanna die.

1263
01:42:48,693 --> 01:42:50,714
Man, my toes hurt!

1264
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:54,442
I don't even understand
the physics of how my toes hurt.

1265
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,201
Children.

1266
01:42:57,632 --> 01:42:59,150
I work with children.

1267
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:04,588
Have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

1268
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:17,324
I am the end of worlds!

1269
01:43:18,635 --> 01:43:21,161
Who are you to defy...

1270
01:43:23,768 --> 01:43:26,798
This world is my right!

1271
01:43:48,487 --> 01:43:49,685
No!

1272
01:43:50,178 --> 01:43:52,425
This cannot be.

1273
01:43:52,427 --> 01:43:53,711
You recognize that smell?

1274
01:43:55,488 --> 01:43:56,424
Fear.

1275
01:44:00,219 --> 01:44:02,187
No! Leave me!

1276
01:44:05,522 --> 01:44:06,615
Get off me!

1277
01:44:06,913 --> 01:44:08,420
I command you.

1278
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:11,250
No!

1279
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:14,506
No!

1280
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:17,891
I'll kill you!

1281
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:19,879
I'll kill you all!

1282
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:46,147
Booyah!

1283
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:13,310
I'm glad I didn't miss this.

1284
01:45:14,881 --> 01:45:15,911
So am I.

1285
01:45:16,513 --> 01:45:17,508
Yeah.

1286
01:45:17,909 --> 01:45:19,239
<i>Now she's glad.</i>

1287
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:53,070
Thank you is not enough
for what you did.

1288
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:55,994
I just undid a mistake, that's all.

1289
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:07,460
How did you get the house back
from the bank?

1290
01:46:08,634 --> 01:46:09,974
I bought the bank.

1291
01:46:12,659 --> 01:46:13,544
The whole bank?

1292
01:46:13,704 --> 01:46:16,081
It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

1293
01:46:20,223 --> 01:46:21,139
What?

1294
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:24,481
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1295
01:46:24,624 --> 01:46:26,812
But my foot's in the door.

1296
01:46:27,301 --> 01:46:28,233
Yeah,

1297
01:46:28,421 --> 01:46:30,102
I got a recommendation from a friend.

1298
01:46:30,164 --> 01:46:31,701
This is like a job job?

1299
01:46:32,484 --> 01:46:33,343
Job job.

1300
01:46:37,254 --> 01:46:38,554
Look at you go.

1301
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,041
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Darkness,</i></font>

1302
01:46:58,217 --> 01:46:59,991
<font color="#ff8000"><i>the truest darkness,</i></font>

1303
01:46:59,993 --> 01:47:02,044
<font color="#ff8000"><i>is not the absence of light.</i></font>

1304
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:07,110
<font color="#ff8000"><i>It is the conviction that
the light will never return.</i></font>

1305
01:47:08,189 --> 01:47:10,440
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1306
01:47:10,819 --> 01:47:11,874
Must be.

1307
01:47:13,402 --> 01:47:14,735
Big round table.

1308
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:17,110
Six chairs, right there.

1309
01:47:18,495 --> 01:47:19,765
But room for more.

1310
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,818
But room for more.

1311
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:27,870
<font color="#ff8000"><i>But the light always returns,</i></font>

1312
01:47:28,316 --> 01:47:30,311
<font color="#ff8000"><i>to show us things familiar.</i></font>

1313

<font color="#ff8000"><i>Home,</i></font>

1315
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:38,165
<font color="#ff8000"><i>and things entirely new,</i></font>

1316
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:40,543
<font color="#ff8000"><i>or long overlooked.</i></font>

1318
01:47:48,698 --> 01:47:51,228

us to pursue them.</i></font>

1319
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:54,670
Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

1320
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:56,600
I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

1321
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:58,600
Yeah, he has it all in storage in Croydon.

1322
01:47:58,610 --> 01:48:00,410
The Belgian?
Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1323
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:03,540
<font color="#ff8000"><i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i></font>

1324
01:48:03,542 --> 01:48:07,372
<font color="#ff8000"><i>coming out of the shadows to
tell us we won't be alone again.</i></font>

1325
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:11,664
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Our darkness was deep,</i></font>

1326
01:48:11,983 --> 01:48:13,932
<font color="#ff8000"><i>and seemed to swallow all hope.</i></font>

1327
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:17,485
<font color="#ff8000"><i>But these heroes

1333
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,170
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1334
01:49:35,953 --> 01:49:37,056
Not at all, Barry.

1335
01:49:38,131 --> 01:49:39,045
Curious myself.

1336
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:41,060
Yeah, and it's not like
a competition, you know?

1337
01:49:41,075 --> 01:49:43,345
Well, it is a competition?

1338
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:45,375
But, you know, it's not like a macho...

1339
01:49:45,652 --> 01:49:46,609
measuring thing.

1340
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,077
But if I win, you're off the team.

1341
01:49:54,163 --> 01:49:55,001
No...

1342
01:49:57,057 --> 01:49:58,019
If I win,

1343
01:49:58,949 --> 01:50:01,669
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch?

1344
01:50:02,113 --> 01:50:04,209
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1345
01:50:04,693 --> 01:50:05,993
I feel stung by that.

1346
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:09,774
Ok, but if I win, I get to tell everyone.

1347
01:50:09,892 --> 01:50:10,706
Deal.

1348
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:12,742
Which coast?

1349
01:50:13,393 --> 01:50:15,187
You know, I've never seen the Pacific.

1350
01:50:16,908 --> 01:50:17,931
Which is that way.

1351
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:18,989
Because...

1352
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:21,044
the sun and it's...

1354
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:08,394
Alright, let's keep it moving.

1355
01:58:08,496 --> 01:58:10,083
<i>Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1356
01:58:11,879 --> 01:58:12,715
<i>Luthor!</i>

1357
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:23,900
Alright, stop jerking around, Luthor,

1358
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:25,300
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1359
01:58:58,430 --> 01:59:00,553
There he is. Welcome aboard.

1360
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,460
Care for a glass of Goût de Diamants?

1361
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,740
I was just celebrating God's return

1362
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:06,897
out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1363
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:10,708
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1364
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:12,302
<i>You better not be wasting my time.</i>

1365
01:59:12,650 --> 01:59:14,365
No. I have too much to live for

1366
01:59:14,388 --> 01:59:16,209
and more important things to do.

1367
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,876
We have to level
the playing field, Mr. Wilson.

1368
01:59:20,117 --> 01:59:21,279
To put it plainly

1369
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:26,026
should not we have a league of our own?

1370
