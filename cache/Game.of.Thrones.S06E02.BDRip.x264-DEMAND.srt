1
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,170
Give him another go, Ned.

2
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,725
That's my father.

3
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,684
And my Uncle Benjen.

4
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,525
Keep your shield up
or I'll ring your head like a bell.

5
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,810
They were all so happy.

6
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,129
So were you, once.

7
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,402
Stop showing off.

8
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,366
Lyanna!

9
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,806
My Aunt Lyanna.

10
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,766
I've seen her statue in the crypt.

11
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,442
My father never talked about her.

12
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,324
Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.

13
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,125
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

14
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,161
I don't know.

15
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,486
What about him?

16
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,483
Wylis, come here.

17
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,406
Hodor?

18
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,970
But he's got giant's blood.

19
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,485
And you've got training.

20
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,490
Sounds like a fair match to me.

21
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,401
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

22
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,051
And lowers it when he's going to dodge,
my lady.

23
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,850
Hodor talks?

24
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,605
You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

25
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,081
Come along, now. It's no place for you.

26
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,931
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

27
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,082
If he ever learned to fight,
he'd be unstoppable.

28
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,243
Well, he's never going to learn to fight
because he's a stable boy.

29
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,810
So leave him be.

30
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,165
It is time to go.

31
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,603
Please, a little longer.

32
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,964
You finally show me something I care about,
and then you drag me away.

33
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,647
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

34
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,087
but if you stay too long, you'll drown.

35
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,889
I wasn't drowning.

36
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,211
I was home.

37
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,846
Wylis.

38
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,085
Hodor.

39
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,084
I saw you as a boy.

40
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,925
You could talk.

41
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,247
What happened?

42
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,406
Hodor.

43
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,606
Where's Meera?

44
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,601
Hodor.

45
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,641
You shouldn't be here.

46
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,209
It's not safe outside the cave.

47
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,125
It's not safe anywhere.

48
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,042
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

49
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,122
- Hodor.
- His real name is Wylis.

50
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,602
And he could talk and fight and...
And then...

51
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,641
What's wrong?

52
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,881
The three-eyed raven
says there's a war coming.

53
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,004
And we're going to fight it in there?

54
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,683
Brandon Stark needs you.

55
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,601
For what?

56
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,164
I sit in there and I watch him have
his visions and nothing ever happens.

57
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,000
He isn't going to stay here forever.

58
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,287
And out there, he needs you.

59
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,681
It's time, Ser Davos.

60
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,689
Open the door and the men inside
can rejoin their brothers in peace.

61
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,725
We'll even set the wolf free north
of the Wall, where it belongs.

62
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,402
Nobody needs to die tonight.

63
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,248
I've never been much of a fighter.

64
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,764
Apologies for what you're about to see.

65
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,807
Come on.

66
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,086
Attack!

67
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,124
Fight, you cowards!

68
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,562
You fucking traitor.

69
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,324
The only traitors here

70
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,847
are the ones who shoved their knives
into their Lord Commander's heart.

71
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,040
For thousands of years, the Night's Watch has
held Castle Black against the wildlings.

72
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,206
Until you.

73
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,126
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

74
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,843
Took a lot of knives.

75
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,211
I'll have my men get the wood for a fire.

76
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,806
Bodies to burn.

77
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,008
Hey.

78
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,607
Right, so there she is,
high and mighty Queen Cersei,

79
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,762
tits and arse jiggling in the breeze.

80
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,966
All of a sudden, she looks my way.

81
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,964
Gives me a little smile like, well?

82
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,487
So, all right, you know, I've never
been shy and I'm blessed down south,

83
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,289
so I pull it right out.

84
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,204
She's never seen anything like it.

85
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,486
I mean, she's used to her brother,

86
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,803
and from what I hear, Jaime Lannister's
half an inch shy of an inch.

87
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,726
She sees it, and I swear to the gods,
she licks her lips.

88
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,570
Well, you all know me.

89
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,483
You know I wouldn't lie about this.

90
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,927
Get out of my way.

91
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,930
King's orders, Your Grace.

92
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,851
What are the King's orders?

93
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,651
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

94
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
for your own protection.

95
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,931
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

96
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,931
Forgive me, Your Grace. By the King's
command, I cannot let you pass.

97
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,604
I would like to speak to my son.

98
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,241
He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

99
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,611
She grew up.

100
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,200
Almost.

101
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,441
Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers?

102
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,803
I expect it was Mother.

103
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,884
Your mother wouldn't do that.

104
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,200
Yes, she would.

105
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,724
Are you angry with her?

106
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,771
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

107
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,126
She has every right to be here.

108
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,406
They told me
she wouldn't be allowed in the sept.

109
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,801
If she had tried...

110
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,645
They're not putting your mother
in a cell ever again.

111
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,165
Not while I'm here.

112
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,243
Why haven't you gone to see her?

113
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,408
Everything she endured, she did it for you.

114
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,642
Don't you think I know that?

115
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,281
I'm sorry.

116
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,006
But I can't.

117
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,841
Why not?

118
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,807
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

119
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,165
what did I do?

120
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,569
When they paraded her through the streets
like a whore,

121
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,091
what did I do?

122
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,009
We all fail sometimes.

123
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,202
The King is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

124
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,808
If I can't even protect my own wife
or my own mother, what good am I?

125
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,604
Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

126
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,851
Your Grace.

127
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,961
Lord Commander.

128
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,888
I want to see my wife.

129
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,569
The gods wait for Queen Margaery
to confess her crimes and seek their mercy.

130
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,811
The King must wait as well.

131
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,289
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

132
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,681
You're a bold man.

133
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,004
On the contrary,

134
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,730
I fear a great deal.

135
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,766
The Father, the Mother,

136
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,560
the Warrior.

137
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,126
Do you know why we use these stones?

138
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,161
To remind us not to fear death.

139
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,330
We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

140
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,528
You must long for the next life.

141
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,210
In truth, I fear that too.

142
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,170
You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.

143
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,084
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

144
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,685
and atoned for her sin.

145
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,969
What about my sins?

146
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,802
I broke a sacred oath
and stabbed my King in the back.

147
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,888
I killed my own cousin.

148
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,491
When the gods judged my brother guilty,
I helped him escape their justice.

149
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,487
What atonement do I deserve?

150
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,522
You would spill blood in this holy place?

151
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,289
Oh, the gods won't mind.

152
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,560
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

153
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,961
Go on then.

154
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,203
I deserve it. We all do.

155
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,006
We are weak, vain creatures.

156
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,364
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

157
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,725
They should be closer
if you mean for them to save you.

158
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,847
I don't.

159
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,284
They'd never reach me before you struck.

160
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,210
I've fought against worse odds.

161
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,522
No doubt many of us would fall.

162
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,682
But who are we, hmm?

163
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,602
We have no names, no family.

164
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,086
Every one of us is poor and powerless.

165
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,208
And yet together...

166
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,288
We can overthrow an empire.

167
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,081
Mother.

168
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,562
Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

169
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,766
Gold.

170
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,402
Good. It was always her color.

171
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,969
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

172
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,762
I shouldn't have, but I was...

173
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,808
I didn't want to lose you again.

174
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,520
I understand.

175
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,364
I'm glad to see you.

176
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,968
I know I should have come sooner.

177
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,604
I wanted to. I was wrong.

178
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,606
It's all right.

179
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,286
No, it isn't.

180
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,122
I should have executed all of them.

181
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,884
I should have pulled down the sept
onto the High Sparrow's head

182
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,769
before I let them do that to you,

183
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,848
as you would have for me.

184
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,805
You raised me to be strong,

185
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,331
and I wasn't.

186
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,411
But I want to be.

187
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,167
Help me.

188
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,206
Always.

189
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,126
If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

190
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,886
Meaning no offense.

191
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,606
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

192
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,045
I do not make dwarf jokes.

193
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,451
You think them.

194
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,326
So...

195
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,008
The fleet. It's been burned.

196
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,807
We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

197
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,281
Surely, there's some good news
lurking somewhere.

198
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,364
Astapor and Yunkai
have stopped asking us for aid.

199
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,923
Perhaps they can tell us their secret.

200
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,408
The Masters have retaken both cities.

201
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,442
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

202
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,845
What about the dragons?

203
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,441
We have two of them here,
beneath the pyramid.

204
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,363
They are not eating.

205
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,171
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

206
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,763
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

207
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,165
Can't very well let the dragons starve,
that's obvious.

208
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,449
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

209
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,761
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

210
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,207
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

211
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,167
I drink and I know things.

212
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,524
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

213
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,001
ranged over hundreds of miles.

214
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,801
Then Daenerys's ancestors
started chaining them up in pens.

215
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,928
A few generations later,

216
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,447
the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

217
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,930
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

218
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,762
Missandei,

219
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,764
how many times were you
in the company of these dragons?

220
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,361
Many times.

221
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,570
And did they ever harm you?

222
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,721
Never.

223
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,924
Dragons are intelligent.

224
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,005
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

225
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,168
They have affection for their friends
and fury for their enemies.

226
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,442
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

227
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,490
They will.
It's time they had their supper.

228
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,569
I'm friends with your mother.

229
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,205
I'm here to help.

230
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,722
Don't eat the help.

231
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,407
When I was a child, an uncle asked
what gift I wanted for my name day.

232
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,366
I begged him for one of you.

233
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,609
It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,
I told him.

234
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,888
It could be little, like me.

235
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,891
Everyone laughed like it was
the funniest thing they had ever heard.

236
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,088
Then my father told me

237
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,607
the last dragon had died a century ago.

238
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,402
I cried myself to sleep that night.

239
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,290
But here you are.

240
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,682
Next time I have an idea like that,

241
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,370
punch me in the face.

242
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,041
What's your name?

243
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,881
What's your name?

244
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,167
No one.

245
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,600
I don't believe that.

246
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,403
You don't believe that.

247
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,011
Who are you?

248
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,327
No one.

249
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,682
If a girl says her name,

250
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,930
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

251
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,170
A girl has no name.

252
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,403
If a girl says her name,
a man will feed her tonight.

253
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,330
A girl has no name.

254
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,082
If a girl says her name,
a man will give her eyes back.

255
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,770
A girl has no name.

256
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,881
Come.

257
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,720
Leave it.

258
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,248
A girl is not a beggar anymore.

259
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,370
We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

260
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,843
Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?

261
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,764
They obviously had help.

262
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,491
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

263
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,240
Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

264
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,650
We know where she's going.

265
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,490
Her brother's at Castle Black.

266
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,369
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

267
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,408
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

268
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,684
So was I, Father.

269
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,962
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

270
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,281
as long as a Stark can
walk through that door.

271
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,082
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

272
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,082
And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

273
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,051
With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow...

274
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,885
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

275
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,567
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

276
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,528
We don't need every house in the North.

277
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,281
The Umbers, the Manderlys
and the Karstarks

278
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,125
command more soldiers
than all the other houses combined.

279
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,370
With their support, none
could challenge us.

280
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,683
The Starks lost my house
the day King Robb cut off my father's head.

281
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,450
It's time for
new blood in the North.

282
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,009
If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog,
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

283
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,927
Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

284
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,361
My lords.

285
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,688
Lady Walda has given birth.

286
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,890
A boy.

287
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,568
Red-cheeked and healthy.

288
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,847
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

289
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,890
Congratulations, Father.

290
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,968
I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

291
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,008
You'll always be my firstborn.

292
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,249
Thank you for saying that.

293
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,129
It means a great deal to me.

294
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,200
Maester Wolkan,

295
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,444
send ravens to all the northern houses.

296
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,646
Roose Bolton is dead.

297
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,045
Poisoned by our enemies.

298
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,091
How did he die?

299
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,451
Poisoned by his enemies.

300
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,364
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

301
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,490
Forgive me, my lord.

302
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,760
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

303
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,244
She's resting, my lord.

304
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,691
At once, my lord.

305
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,640
There he is.

306
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,765
Isn't he wonderful?

307
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,087
May I hold him?

308
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,120
Of course.

309
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,091
Little brother.

310
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,002
Lord Bolton sent for us.

311
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,286
Have you seen him?

312
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,680
Of course. Follow me, Mother.

313
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,450
Where is Lord Bolton?

314
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,124
Get down!

315
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,608
It's all right.
It's all right. Come on.

316
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,046
It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.

317
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,290
Ramsay, where is your father?

318
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,481
Ramsay.

319
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,329
Where is Lord Bolton?

320
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,930
I am Lord Bolton.

321
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,566
Ramsay.

322
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,090
Ramsay, please.

323
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,811
I'll leave Winterfell.
I'll go back to the Riverlands.

324
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,646
Please.

325
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,006
Ramsay.

326
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,605
He's your brother.

327
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,161
I prefer being an only child.

328
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,484
I saw her with a man.

329
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,244
I don't think he hurt her.

330
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,490
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

331
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,480
You don't know which way she went?

332
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,449
I spent three days looking for her.

333
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,321
She disappeared.

334
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,241
How'd she look?

335
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,130
She looked good.

336
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,963
She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.

337
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,684
No, she wouldn't be.

338
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,604
What happened at Winterfell?

339
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,240
I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

340
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,927
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

341
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,768
We've all had to make difficult choices.

342
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,730
We shouldn't be lighting fires.
It's not safe.

343
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,326
He won't stop hunting us.

344
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,050
We just have to make it to Castle Black.

345
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,646
Once we're with Jon,
Ramsay won't be able to touch us.

346
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,407
Jon will have me killed
the moment I step through the gate.

347
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,766
I won't let him.

348
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,647
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

349
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,410
And the truth about the farm boys
I killed in their place.

350
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,610
And the truth about Ser Rodrik,
who I beheaded.

351
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,251
And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

352
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,607
When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

353
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,364
I don't want to be forgiven.

354
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,528
I can never make amends to your family
for the things I've done.

355
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,041
They'll keep you safer than I ever could.

356
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,687
You're not coming with us?

357
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,406
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

358
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,725
I would have died to get you there.

359
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,964
May I take one of the horses?

360
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,724
Where will you go?

361
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,440
Home.

362
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,405
The Glovers have retaken
Deepwood Motte.

363
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,846
And the ironborn who held it?

364
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,241
They died fighting to a man.

365
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,481
What is dead may never die.

366
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,245
But they did, and our
invasion died with them.

367
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,000
Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold
on the mainland.

368
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,889
Then we will take more.

369
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,089
Why?
For more pinecones and rocks?

370
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,808
Because I order it.

371
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,769
We can defeat anyone at sea,

372
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,443
but we'll never hold lands and castles
against mainland armies.

373
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,364
Not if our captains defy my orders,

374
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,729
abandon their posts,
and sacrifice our men on foolish missions.

375
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,683
I won't apologize for
trying to rescue Theon.

376
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,962
- Then where is he?
- Where is your kingdom?

377
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,722
We took those castles
because the Northerners marched off to war.

378
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,689
That war is over.

379
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,808
The last time we provoked them too far,

380
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,408
I watched from that window as they breached
our walls and knocked down our towers.

381
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,244
I lost two brothers that day.

382
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,727
And I lost three sons.

383
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,489
The War of the Five Kings, they call it.

384
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,528
Well, the other four are dead.

385
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,683
When you rule the Iron Islands,
you can wage all the peace you want.

386
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,322
But for now, shut your mouth and obey,
or I will make another heir who will.

387
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,805
Let me pass.

388
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,610
You fool, move aside for your King.

389
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,888
Haven't I always, brother?

390
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,890
I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

391
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,361
What is dead may never die.

392
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,965
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

393
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,008
Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?

394
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,444
You can mock our god without my help.

395
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,522
I don't mock the Drowned God.

396
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,722
I am the Drowned God.

397
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,088
From Oldtown to Qarth,
when men see my sails, they pray.

398
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,770
You're old, brother.

399
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,924
You've had your time.

400
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,083
Now let another rule.

401
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,641
I heard you lost your mind

402
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,769
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

403
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:57,528
They tied you to the mast
to keep you from jumping overboard.

404
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,921
They did.

405
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,288
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

406
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,404
I needed silence.

407
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,207
What kind of an ironborn

408
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,204
loses his senses during a storm?

409
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,123
I am the storm, brother.

410
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,249
The first storm and the last.

411
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,884
And you're in my way.

412
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,767
Lord, take your servant Balon back
beneath the waves.

413
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,166
Feed the creatures of your kingdom
on his flesh.

414
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,848
Pull his bones down to your depths to rest
beside his ancestors and his children.

415
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,247
What is dead may never die.

416
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,680
I'm going to find out who did this.

417
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,444
I'm going to feed them to the sharks
while they live.

418
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,647
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

419
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,646
The Salt Throne is not yours
to swear upon,

420
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,962
not unless the Kingsmoot chooses you.

421
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,883
My father would have wanted me to rule.

422
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,009
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

423
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,485
Perhaps you'll win.

424
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,408
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

425
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,760
And perhaps not.

426
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,924
Come in.

427
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,611
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

428
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,364
You interrupt nothing.

429
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,245
I assume you know why I'm here.

430
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,165
I will after you tell me.

431
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,485
It's about the Lord Commander.

432
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,603
The former Lord Commander.

433
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,726
Does he have to be?

434
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,170
What are you asking?

435
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,240
Do you know of any magic

436
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,165
that could help him?

437
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,121
Bring him back?

438
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,722
If you want to help him, leave him be.

439
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,131
Can it be done?

440
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,723
There are some with this power.

441
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,847
How?

442
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,361
I don't know.

443
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,441
Have you seen it done?

444
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,288
I met a man who came back
from the dead,

445
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,169
but the priest who did it...

446
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,401
It shouldn't have been possible.

447
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,643
But it was. It could be now.

448
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,041
Not for me.

449
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,005
Not for you?

450
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,724
I saw you drink poison
that should have killed you.

451
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,921
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

452
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,923
Everything I believed,

453
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,083
the great victory I saw
in the flames...

454
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,844
All of it was a lie.

455
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,164
You were right all along.

456
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,808
The Lord never spoke to me.

457
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,965
Fuck him then.

458
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,371
Fuck all of them.

459
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,611
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

460
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,888
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

461
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,647
I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.

462
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,246
I'm asking the woman
who showed me that miracles exist.

463
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,523
I never had this gift.

464
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,325
Have you ever tried?

465
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,848
Please.
