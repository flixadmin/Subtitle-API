Corleone,</i> I need your help.

And not just to light a little candle.

3
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,828
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

4
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,788
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

5
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,667
but I was never a true banker.

6

Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

7

9
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:52,944
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

10

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,014
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

18
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,942
That's true.

19
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,648
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

20

No, you're mistaken.

21

This isn't a question
of one person deciding.

500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank

when Mr. Corleone receives
majority control of Immobiliare.

30
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:34,671
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

31
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,463
Few families have control
of such a company.

32
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,969
It seems that, in today's world,

33
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,937
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

34
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,190
600 million dollars.

35

Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

Don Corleone, this
