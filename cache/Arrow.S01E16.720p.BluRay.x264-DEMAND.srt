1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,049
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,450
For five years, I was stranded
on an island with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,680
Survive.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,444
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,162
Now I will fulfill my father's dying
wish, to use the list of names he left me...

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,766
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,566
To do this,
I must become someone else.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,924
I must become something else.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,411
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,848
I'd like you to work with me
on the vigilante investigation.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,128
- Thank you, sir.
- It's just beginning.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,282
In six months
the organization's vision...

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,011
...of what this city should be
will be complete.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,926
Thousands of innocent people
will be dead, and you'll feel nothing.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,730
That's not true.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,803
I'll feel a sense of accomplishment.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,080
- So how can we be of assistance?
- Malcolm Merlyn.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,284
I want you to kill him for me.

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,522
Black arrows aren't consistent
with his MO.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,808
Something doesn't add up.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,244
The chopper's about to touch down?

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,482
The log doesn't have him due
for 20 minutes.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,842
Then lock down the heliport.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,804
I've just landed in Starling City.

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,761
We agreed, half on arrival,
the other half when the job is done.

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,164
Don't worry. The man's as good as--

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,881
Guillermo Barrera.
You have failed this city.

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,965
- You've built quite the reputation.
- And you should've stayed overseas.

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,531
I thought about it,
but then I remembered...

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,001
...I've got a reputation too.

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,691
Ow.

32
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,882
The trick is to keep your weight
evenly distributed.

33
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,646
I thought the trick
was to avoid getting into fights.

34
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,808
Starling City's not the kind of place...

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,122
...where you can talk your way
out of trouble.

36
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,523
Besides, if you're gonna be working
with us...

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,048
...I'll sleep a lot easier knowing
that you can handle yourself.

38
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,645
At least a little bit.

39
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,008
- How'd it go?
- Badly for him.

40
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,286
Who him?

41
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,767
An assassin for hire
with an affinity for knives.

42
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,724
- His name was Guillermo Barrera.
- Was?

43
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,690
So we can't ask him
about his intended target?

44
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,005
No, which is why
I need you to hack his phone.

45
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,970
Barrera's world-class.
He kills high-profile targets.

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,771
And whatever job he was hired for
isn't finished.

47
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,571
We need to figure out
who he was here to kill, and fast.

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,525
- They are probably still in danger. Okay?
- Yeah.

49
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,685
I have to meet McKenna.

50
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,411
Good thing she didn't meet you
at the heliport.

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,249
May not be a good idea to fall
for the cop that's hunting you down.

52
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,364
Well, it's slim pickings
for us vigilantes.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,924
- Four?
- I'm more of a runner.

54
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,323
- Why the sudden desire to work out?
- What else is there to do?

55
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,649
Well, we can try to think
of another way off the island.

56
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,083
There is no other way.
If there was, I would've found it.

57
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,131
We can't just sit here and wait for Fyers
to come and kill us.

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,208
I did have one idea.

59
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,728
If you go into the forest and gather
as much bamboo as you can find--

60
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,006
Yeah.

61
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,085
--We could build ourselves a boat
like they did on Gilligan's Island.

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,121
That's broken.
It got busted during the crash.

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,127
- Did you try to get it to work?
- I'm better at pulling things apart.

64
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,402
My father was a pilot,
and he used to do his own maintenance.

65
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,767
You're hoping aircraft maintenance
is genetic?

66
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,242
No, I used to help him, and I liked it.
Then I got pretty good at it.

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,290
Maybe I can make the radio work.

68
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,883
You should be training
for the inevitable fight that's looming.

69
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,641
I think I have a better chance
of making the radio work.

70
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,928
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- No, I am.

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,642
- I just got caught up at the office.
- Me too. Wow.

72
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,882
You look nice.

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,802
- We should go inside.
- We should.

74
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,602
We don't seem to be going inside.
Ha-ha-ha.

75
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,446
- Welcome.
- Happy birthday, buddy.

76
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,204
Thank you.

77
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,366
- Mm. This feels like a Chéteauneuf du Pape.
- It's gonna taste like one too.

78
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,369
You are a true friend. Thank you.

79
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,245
- Tommy, you remember McKenna Hall.
- From back in the day.

80
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,727
And back again. Ha, ha.

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,328
- Ollie, hi.
- Hi.

82
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,921
Laurel, this is--

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,970
McKenna Hall. We know each other
from the courthouse.

84
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,640
- How are you, counselor?
- I'm well, detective.

85
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,201
- I'm gonna go crack this open.
- Come in.

86
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,204
Such a nice apartment.
So much space.

87
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,800
Oh, this is adorable.
How old are you here?

88
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,521
- That's actually my sister, Sara.
- Oh, I am so sorry.

89
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,802
No, no, it's okay.

90
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,361
I don't know why
my father bought her that canary.

91
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,285
That thing chirped night and day.
It drove us all nuts.

92
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,408
A toast.

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,806
- There you go.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,450
Thank you.

95
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,843
To the first birthday
that I have enjoyed in a long time.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,604
I got my best friend back.

97
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,485
And I have finally figured out...

98
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,843
...why poets have been in business
for the last few thousand years.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,923
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Thank you.

100
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,167
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

101
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,367
Cheers.

102
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,085
- I think that's the food.
- Okay.

103
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,362
- Oh, thank God she didn't cook.
- Amen.

104
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,006
- Mr. Merlyn.
- Laurel. Can I come in?

105
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,808
- Oliver.
- Mr. Merlyn.

106
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,126
- I've been trying to get in touch with you.
- What are you doing here, Dad?

107
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,930
Happy birthday, Tommy.

108
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,087
- Just give us a second.
- Of course.

109
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,049
- We're about to eat, so--
- I can't stay.

110
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,130
Well, that works out,
because you weren't invited.

111
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,969
I'm being honored
by the Starling City Municipal Group.

112
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,600
They're bestowing me
with their Humanitarian Award.

113
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,161
What, they ran out of actual humans
to give it to?

114
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,482
I would like you to be there
if you could.

115
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,046
I am 100 percent certain
that I'll be busy.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,968
You might not believe this...

117
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,487
...but all I ever wanted for you
was happiness.

118
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,122
If it will allay this tension between us,
I'll turn the switch back on.

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,123
Save your money, Dad.

120
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,611
I don't need it anymore.

121
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,167
I'd still like you to come to the event.

122
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,446
It would mean a lot to me.

123
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,442
You know what, Dad?

124
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,809
Sometimes the people
that you want there the most aren't.

125
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,528
You taught me that.

126
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,721
Multiple times.

127
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,842
Hello, Lawton.

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,571
I see your edge has dulled.

129
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,963
Oh, I knew you were there.
I just didn't care if you killed me.

130
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,011
Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah, what do you want?

131
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,488
My organization has been contracted...

132
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,804
...to eliminate a certain
high-profile individual.

133
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,521
- A very well-guarded target.
- Well, forget it.

134
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,049
- Look, I'm retired.
- To drink and smoke your life away?

135
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,922
- Hey, we all gotta die sometime.
- I need someone to die at the right time.

136
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,082
And no one does it better than you.

137
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,531
My vision ain't exactly
what it used to be.

138
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,404
No.

139
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,681
It's going to be better.

140
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,602
So who needs two bullets
in the chest?

141
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,202
Moira, is it happening?

142
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,882
Yes, at the Humanitarian Award
ceremony.

143
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,130
- Isn't that a little public?
- No one will expect it.

144
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,967
I have very welcome news
to share with all of you.

145
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,964
Thanks to Queen Consolidated's
Applied Sciences Division...

146
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,930
...and their recent acquisition
of Unidac Industries...

147
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,367
...the undertaking
which we set for ourselves...

148
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,002
...is only months from fruition.

149
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,801
There's hope on the horizon
for everyone in Starling. Heh.

150
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,611
We won't fail this city.

151
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,605
And I think I speak for everyone here
when I say we're all with you, Malcolm.

152
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,442
Jeez, this was one paranoid assassin.

153
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,490
Barrera's got Cobalt-level encryption
on his phone.

154
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,123
It's not gonna be easy to break.
But Code Breaker is my middle name.

155
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,966
- Actually, it's Megan--
- Felicity, can you get anything off of it?

156
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,600
- Just the last number he dialed.
- Which was?

157
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,367
A restaurant in Chinatown.
Jade Dragon.

158
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,006
Even hired killers
enjoy the city's best chow mein.

159
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,607
Jade Dragon is a front
for the Chinese mafia.

160
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,124
Call the restaurant.
Make a reservation for two for tonight.

161
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,482
You need to decrypt that phone.

162
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,204
- I'm kind of in the mood for Chinese now.
- Mm.

163
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,960
Oh, oh. Uh...

164
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,726
That is one big fried fish.

165
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,531
I was told this was
the most authentic Szechuan in town.

166
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,520
I wanted to make sure that your birthday
celebration got its due celebration.

167
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,762
It was a little bit, urn, tense last night.

168
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,527
Trust my dad to run all the smiles
out of the room.

169
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,841
He did come by.

170
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,005
And it seemed like he was trying
to act a little bit dadlike.

171
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,927
"Dadlike,"
that sums up my father perfectly.

172
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,287
I know the two of you
have never been close...

173
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,762
...but it couldn't have been easy for him
after your mom was killed.

174
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,400
He forgot there were two of us
in that club.

175
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,882
I'm not defending him, Tommy.

176
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,043
With everything I've been through,
people that I've lost...

177
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,848
...I know how hard it can be.

178
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,407
You probably don't remember this.

179
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,249
Uh... We were 8.

180
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,322
But after her funeral,
he left for like two years.

181
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,563
And when he did come back, he was...

182
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,569
He was so freaking cold.

183
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,126
He barely spoke.

184
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,567
That's why I spent so much time
at your house.

185
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,603
From the outside,
it always looked like I had a father.

186
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,130
He paid my bills, he lived in the house,
he bailed me out.

187
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,005
But your dad took me
to my first hockey game.

188
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,845
Your dad taught me how to fly-fish.

189
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,651
Your dad took us
to our first R-rated movie.

190
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,007
But he wasn't perfect.

191
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,971
My dad made mistakes.

192
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,164
And...

193
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,320
We haven't talked about this...

194
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,361
...but I have a lot of anger
towards him.

195
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,210
But still, I would give anything
to have him back...

196
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,125
...because at the end of the day,
your dad is...

197
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,805
...your dad.

198
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,371
I meant what I said last night.

199
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,129
I am really glad that you're back.

200
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,922
I gotta hit the restroom.

201
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,091
Check, please.

202
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,441
I hope you like barbecue.

203
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,807
Don't fall over yourself thanking me
for spending six hours up a tree...

204
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,883
- ...so you can eat.
- What?

205
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,522
Great. I'll eat later.

206
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,564
You've been at that for days.
Give it a rest.

207
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,884
- It's because I can do this.
- Sure, kid. When pigs fly.

208
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,090
You've gotta be kidding me.

209
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,929
- Can you clean this up?
- I don't know.

210
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,764
I don't know how I got this far.

211
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,928
Continue approach, 463 heavy.

212
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,730
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Wedgetail 325.

213
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,530
Pilot and passenger down.

214
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,843
Four-six-three heavy cleared to land,
Runway 27, right.

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,651
Wind 260 degrees, ten knots.

216
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,647
I repeat, pilot and passenger down
on the island of Lian Yu.

217
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,529
Request immediate rescue.

218
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,561
Cleared to land, Runway 27, right.
Four-six-three heavy.

219
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,689
They can't hear us,
and we can't call out.

220
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,609
We're still trapped.

221
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,401
What?

222
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,446
- The Triad have hired a contract killer.
- Yeah? The one you put in the morgue?

223
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,171
Congratulations,
you're the talk of the station again.

224
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,051
If they hired one,
they're gonna hire another, detective.

225
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,249
- Who's the target?
- I'm trying to find out, hitting dead ends.

226
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,765
Put your people on it.

227
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,367
My people don't work for you,
and come to think of it, neither do I.

228
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,684
It's not about you and me, detective.
It's about saving a life.

229
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,960
Call me back when you got a name.

230
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,449
- Hall.
- Yes, sir?

231
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,685
You and me,
we're gonna catch that vigilante.

232
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,281
There are five exit routes from
the main floor that need to be cut off.

233
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,808
Once the fire alarm goes off,
we'll have less than 30 seconds...

234
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,251
...to disable Merlyn's private security
and force him outside with the others.

235
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,686
Once he's outside,
the rest will be up to Mr. Lawton.

236
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,524
Roger that.

237
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,363
- You look handsome.
- I try not to. It just keeps happening.

238
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,921
What's the occasion?

239
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,404
- I decided to go to my dad's thing.
- Really?

240
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,162
- Are you sure?
- Oh, mostly.

241
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,527
- Did you want me to go with you?
- No, no, no.

242
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,446
I know you have work to do.
I promise I will be fine.

243
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,329
You look beautiful.

244
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,526
Thank you.

245
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,049
If you're free, maybe after the ceremony
we could have dinner...

246
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,202
...and talk like we used to.

247
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,686
I'd like that.

248
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,970
That's my cue. Ha, ha.

249
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,484
I've been trying to avoid him
all evening.

250
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,564
If we didn't show, it'd look suspicious.

251
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,327
How can you talk to him that way,
as if nothing is about to happen?

252
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,007
I've been living this lie for five years.
Five more minutes won't matter.

253
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,128
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

254
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,485
Now, tonight's honoree
needs very little introduction.

255
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,887
It is neither his wealth nor his name
that we celebrate here tonight...

256
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,850
...but it is his efforts
in making Starling City...

257
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,288
...a better and safer place to live.

258
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,681
So please help me welcome...

259
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,730
...Starling City's
Humanitarian of the Year...

260
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,450
...Mr. Malcolm Merlyn.

261
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,730
Thank you.

262
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,769
Right, and so that's a stage,
and most nights we'll have a band.

263
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,922
Somebody cool.
Is Fall Out Boy still cool?

264
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,085
They broke up. And never.

265
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,241
So somebody else will pick the bands.

266
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,446
Something bothering you?

267
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,367
Don't say no,
because you're a terrible liar.

268
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,800
Really?

269
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,163
- I thought I was getting better at it.
- Mm-mm.

270
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,084
What's wrong?

271
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,888
There's a lot of stuff going on
in my life.

272
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,926
Work, friends.

273
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:18,010
And I'm having a difficult time
figuring out how to fit it all in.

274
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,081
I've been struggling
with some of those thoughts.

275
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,651
Do you have any good ideas?

276
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,769
I think we just have to be really honest
about what's going on in our lives.

277
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,846
Think you can do that?

278
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,082
Come on, come on.

279
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,321
I'm in.

280
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,042
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes. Yes. Way to go, Felicity Smoak.

281
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,248
You don't happen to speak Spanish,
do you?

282
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,802
- Arabic.
- Le sigh.

283
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,884
Okay.

284
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,808
Oh, my God.

285
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,405
You know I'm there for you.

286
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,565
Excuse me, Mr. Queen.

287
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,486
The IT Department has that item
that you requested.

288
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,721
- One sec.
- Okay.

289
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,445
- You find the target?
- Oliver, the target is Tommy's father.

290
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,768
At the award ceremony?

291
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,802
Tommy's there. McKenna,
Mr. Diggle is gonna take you home.

292
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,090
- I have some unexpected business.
- It's okay.

293
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,526
What?

294
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,284
The target is Malcolm Merlyn.

295
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,602
Establish a perimeter,
but keep your distance.

296
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,167
I don't want the police caught
in the cross fire.

297
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,926
The true humanitarian
in the Merlyn family...

298
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,889
...was my wife, Rebecca.

299
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,289
Many of you here knew her.

300
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,361
She tirelessly devoted herself to helping
those less fortunate in the Glades.

301
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,764
I like to think that if the man
who murdered her knew her...

302
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,369
...knew the work that she did,
knew the person that she was...

303
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,529
...he would have helped her to her car,
made sure she was safe...

304
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,081
...instead of stealing her purse
and shooting her.

305
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,724
The truth is I haven't done enough
for this city.

306
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,083
My City.

307
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,684
I've failed it.

308
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,491
But I promise you,
I am not finished yet.

309
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,726
I promise you that this city will be better
for all of us.

310
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,965
And on that day,
I will look at this beautiful award...

311
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,726
...and feel that I have earned it.

312
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,042
I thank you.

313
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,931
Thank you very much.

314
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,363
Ladies and gentlemen,
please exit calmly and quietly...

315
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,763
...through the glass sliding doors.

316
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,049
- Get outside, get outside.
- Tommy.

317
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,487
Merlyn's not taking the bait.
Change of plans.

318
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,529
I don't like improvisation.

319
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,808
Drive him upstairs
to his penthouse office.

320
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,843
I'll need to switch vantage points.

321
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,650
Tommy.

322
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,121
Tommy?

323
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,285
Come with me.

324
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,089
There's an exit on the second floor.

325
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,886
I wasn't leaving
until I knew you were safe.

326
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,525
Go somewhere safe. I'll hold them off.

327
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,887
- Go now!
- Come on.

328
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,361
- Where are we going?
- Up.

329
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,204
- Who were those guys?
- I don't know.

330
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,601
- They were trying to kill you.
- Seems that way.

331
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,604
We're going up?
Without any bodyguards?

332
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,808
Dad, we need to get out of here.

333
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,169
Tommy, take a deep breath
and trust me.

334
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,482
Upstairs in my office
there's a panic room.

335
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,002
We get there, we seal it off.

336
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,204
Merlyn's headed to the penthouse.

337
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,522
Why do you want
Malcolm Merlyn dead?

338
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,170
I'll settle for you.

339
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,809
- Wait!
- Let's go.

340
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,169
- You killed him.
- As surely as he would have killed you.

341
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,606
Come on, move, move, move.

342
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,005
Electromagnetic locks.

343
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,562
- What if they cut the power?
- This floor is on an entire separate grid.

344
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,166
- The glass?
- Lexan, bulletproof.

345
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,765
It's over.

346
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,161
- How did you know how to do that?
- What?

347
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,004
Fight.

348
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,924
Kill.

349
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,490
Dad?

350
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,444
Freeze! S.C.P.D. Put the bow down.

351
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,882
Tommy, you okay?

352
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,528
Dad!

353
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,650
Dad?

354
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,365
Turn around slowly.

355
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,362
Dad. Dad. I'm sorry.

356
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,967
Unh. I'm okay. I'm okay.

357
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,767
Damn it.

358
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,727
No, no, no. You're bleeding.
You're bleeding.

359
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,524
I'll be fine. I'll--

360
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,402
No, no, no. Dad! Dad!

361
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,164
No.

362
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,887
Stay back.

363
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,486
I'm not here to hurt you or your father.

364
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,526
I said, stay back.

365
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,400
It's a curare.

366
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,245
- Don't come any closer.
- Your father has been poisoned.

367
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,688
An assassin named Floyd Lawton
laces his bullets with curare.

368
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,083
I've dealt with this. We need to dilute
the poison in his blood--

369
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,004
I said, stay the hell back.

370
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,323
In three minutes he's paralyzed.
In four minutes he suffocates.

371
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,724
If you don't let me help you now,
he's dead before anybody gets here.

372
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,129
Help? How?

373
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,647
Fresh blood buys him time
to get to the hospital.

374
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,087
A blood transfusion? That's insane.

375
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,322
It's the only way.

376
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,851
He needs your blood.

377
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,602
You're out of time.
You need to make a decision right now.

378
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,489
Why should I trust you?

379
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,166
Because you always have.

380
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,009
Oliver.

381
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,968
- Okay. Ready?
- Do it.

382
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,009
I'm done.

383
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,171
Hold his arm.

384
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,171
Come on, come OH, come on.

385
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,771
You're the vigilante.

386
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,490
Why?

387
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,211
Later.

388
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,126
He's still gonna need medical attention
to clean out his system, understand?

389
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,964
Okay.

390
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,891
Thank you.

391
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,524
- Tommy?
- I'm right here, Dad.

392
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,566
- What did the Hood say?
- He didn't say anything.

393
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,724
You let a homicidal maniac
talk you into a blood transfusion...

394
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,689
...instead of calling the paramedics?

395
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,490
My father's life was at stake.

396
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,929
So first the Hood rescues you and Queen
from those kidnappers...

397
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,610
...now he saves your old man...

398
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,923
...but he's taking down
every other 1 percenter out there?

399
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,721
Is this guy a friend of yours, Merlyn?

400
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,367
I don't know who the hell he is.

401
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,521
If they can't hear us,
then what's the point?

402
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,929
Wait.

403
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,287
You still might have done us
some good.

404
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,729
FYERS'. --0500 hours from my mark.
Final deployment is five-by-five.

405
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,166
That's Fyers.

406
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,288
I've tuned in
to the soldiers' frequency.

407
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,445
Scylla is en route.
ETA 0600 hours at the southwest bay.

408
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,810
FYERS". I'll call you when Scylla
is in my possession. Fyers out.

409
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,043
- Who was Fyers talking to?
- I don't know.

410
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,010
Sounds like someone off this island.
Maybe his benefactor.

411
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,049
More importantly,
who or what is Scylla?

412
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,407
The Scylla and Charybdis.

413
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,286
It's the Odyssey,
from one of the four nightmare chapters.

414
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,402
Scylla was a monster.

415
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,371
I wanna meet this monster.

416
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,649
Am I going alone?

417
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,849
How does it feel to save a 1 percenter?

418
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,322
Looks like Merlyn is gonna be okay.
They took him to Starling General.

419
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,682
Good thing he was wearing
a bulletproof vest.

420
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,241
He's not in the hospital
because he was shot.

421
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,368
He was poisoned by curare.

422
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,360
Lawton's alive.

423
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,722
I'm sorry, John.

424
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,523
This Lawton kick his dog
or something?

425
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,364
No.

426
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,764
He killed his brother.

427
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,404
Damn.

428
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,086
What?

429
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,121
- What is it?
- You were right.

430
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,566
Scylla is a monster.

431
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,009
A Russian-made
8-300 antiaircraft missile launcher.

432
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,528
It can simultaneously track
up to a hundred targets...

433
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,206
...whilst engaging in at least a dozen.

434
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,167
I mean, from here they could shoot
down a commercial airliner...

435
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,001
...or start a war.

436
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,685
- Hey, you're here.
- Yeah.

437
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,683
Walk with me?

438
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,002
- I heard you were there. You okay?
- I'm fine.

439
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,447
Listen, McKenna...

440
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,002
...I'm really sorry
I had to run out on you.

441
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,091
Don't worry. Five more minutes,
and I would've had to run out on you.

442
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,449
Our lives are complicated.

443
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,010
But I'm willing to figure us out
if you are.

444
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,882
Willing and able.

445
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,884
Hey. Hey, Dad, Dad, Dad.

446
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,963
Take it easy.

447
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,482
You were shot.

448
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,802
The bullet was laced with poison.

449
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,280
I should be dead.

450
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,848
I gave you a blood transfusion.

451
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,481
Actually, it was the vigilante's idea.

452
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,929
- He saved you.
- He did?

453
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,687
- I was worried I was gonna lose you.
- I'm not going anywhere.

454
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,450
You said that after Mom died...

455
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,961
...but you left.

456
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,444
I wasn't a very good father to you
after your mother passed away.

457
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,007
- I was so lost.
- You never told me where you went.

458
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,245
I found myself in a place
called Nanda Parbat.

459
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,801
I met a man there.

460
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,689
He helped me make sense of things.

461
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,841
He helped me to find a purpose
for my life...

462
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,850
...to make this city a better place
for everyone.

463
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,687
Especially for you.

464
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,124
How are you gonna do that?

465
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,129
Malcolm.

466
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,727
Tommy, could I talk to Moira
for a minute?

467
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,168
Thank God you're all right.

468
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,291
We have a traitor in our midst.
I want you to find out who.

469
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,764
He just made his last mistake.

470
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,729
My dad's gonna be okay,
thanks to you.

471
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,167
It's thanks to you.

472
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,640
I once asked you what happened
to you on that island.

473
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,926
You said "A lot."

474
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,282
- That doesn't quite cover it.
- Tommy--

475
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,169
I saw you kill those guys...

476
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,847
...who kidnapped us
when you first got back, didn't I?

477
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,641
L----

478
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,963
- I know you have a lot of questions.
- Yeah.

479
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,246
Yeah, but for now just the one.

480
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,684
Were you ever gonna tell me?

481
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,850
No.

482
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,401
Tommy, I saw it all on the news.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

483
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,927
Okay, bye.

484
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,965
Hello, Laurel.

485
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,564
Mom.

486
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,091
What are you doing here?

487
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,369
I need to talk to you.

488
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,845
About what?

489
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,683
I know I've made mistakes.

490
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,765
Yeah. Yes, you have.

491
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,125
Look, I have to go.

492
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,204
Why don't you send me an e-mail
or a postcard some time?

493
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,010
I have something important
I need to discuss with you.

494
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,325
What could be so important
after all this time?

495
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,289
It's about Sara.

496
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,606
What about her?

497
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,925
I think she may be alive.
