[Monitor] <i>Among the many

Oliver, it's really you.

Ok, what... where's...
where's Walter?

Come on, man.
Why are you looking at me like

49
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,610
I'm the one who's
been gone a decade?

Sweetheart, um, why
don't you settle in?

53

I mean, you
must be exhausted.

Yeah, but I'd like
to see Thea.

She took things
really hard.

Tommy,
it wasn't your fault.

62
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,568
What wasn't his fault?

63
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,572
Thea, on
her 18th birthday...

64
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,452
she overdosed.

[Oliver] Raisa's famous
chicken marsala?

I used to make this
for William all the time.

67
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,591
Who's William?

68
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:17,884
[Tommy] Oh, I know.

69
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,386
He was, like, your Wilson
on the island, right?

70
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,637
Something like that.

71
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:25,349
How did you manage
to survive by yourself all that time?

72
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,477
It's a long story.

73
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,772
[Tommy] So, uh,
things you missed

74
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,482
while you were gone.

75
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,735
I got married
and divorced twice.

76
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:40,490
Ah, let's see. What other
gossip did you miss?

77
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,575
Our parents getting married.

78
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,581
- It's, um...
- Complicated.

79
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,668
[Moira] Oliver, I know
this must all be a lot.

80
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:57,507
Well, mom, my apologies,
but I actually am a little tired,

81
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,592
and I think I'm gonna head
up to my bedroom.

82
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,303
Thank you for dinner.

Hey.

86
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,795
Your bed has been made.

87
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,965
And there are fresh
towels in the bathroom.

88
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,424
Thank you.

89
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,304
I know the changes
must be overwhelming,

90
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,390
and you must feel
like you're

91
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,058
on a different planet
or something.

92
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,393
You could say that.

93
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,313
It couldn't have been easy
all those years on that island.

94
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,691
Sounds like it wasn't
that easy here.

95
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,112
Now, you're not the same
man as when you left.

96
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,614
And don't take this
the wrong way,

97
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,367
but I get the sense
that it's...

98
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,661
it's for the better.

99
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,291
I'm not so sure.

100
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,627
Mom, when we were
growing up,

101
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:24,051
if you had to leave me
and Thea to protect us...

102
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,265
would you have done it?

103
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,729
Oliver, whether
right or wrong,

104
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,107
everything I've ever done
was to protect my children.

105
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,193
It's all
a parent can do.

106
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,991
And someday, hmm,
when you have children,

107
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,369
you'll understand.

108
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,997
Mom, I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:55,541
Ohh. Ohh.

110
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,084
Everything's okay.

111
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,088
You're home.
You're safe.

112
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,967
Close your eyes,
sweetheart.

113
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,719
Get some rest, okay?

114
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,304

All right.

Stand down.

Oliver,

122
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,211
what the hell
are you doing on my Earth?

123
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,138
Showoff.

Nostalgic.

It seems Adrian and I
have the same design sense.

127
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:25,066
If by that you mean
Felicity, yeah.

128
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,443
But this is my bunker.

129
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,153
Chase?

130
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,363
He's one of the good
guys, literally.

131
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,325
And you're helping him
in Star City.

132
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,119
Starling City.
And he's helping me.

133
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,580
We make a pretty
good team, actually.

134
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,873
[scoffs]

135
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,541
Not that kind
of a team.

136
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,377
So how much small talk
do I have to endure

137
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,547
before you tell me what
it is exactly you're doing on my Earth?

138
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:50,841
Yeah, it's
a long story.

139
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,736
Why don't you start
by telling me

140
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,136
what you were doing
on Lian Yu?

141
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,573
You know, if you wanted
to pretend to be back from the dead,

142
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,057
you could've just showed
up in town.

143
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,350
I wasn't given
a choice.

144
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,978
I was sent to your Earth,
and I arrived on Lian Yu.

145
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,689
Sent? Sent by who?

146
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,856
You get him to tell you
the truth yet, pretty bird?

147
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,693
And nothing but.

148
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,029
Seems Mr. Queen survived
the Gambit

149
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:15,241
and has spent the last
12 years on an island called Lian Yu.

150
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,119
[Chase] That means
"purgatory" if I'm not mistaken.

151
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,204
It still doesn't explain
what you're doing

152
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,622
running around in my hood.

153
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,374
I needed an identity
to work under,

154
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,042
and yours seemed
convenient.

155
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:27,753
Sorry.

156
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,403
What were you doing
at Queen-Merlyn?

157
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,132
Not killing those
scientists,

158
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,550
if that's what
you are implying.

159
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,552
Well, I'm using Laurel's
equipment to compare

160
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,971
the metallurgy of your
arrows to the ones that we found

161
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,973
in those men and women,
so we'll see.

It's Malcolm Merlyn.

00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,630
- Yeah, we thought so, too.
- Ruled him out months ago.

170
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,447
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

171
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,658
And he killed those
scientists for a reason.

I have no intention
of interfering.

185
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,533
Are you not here
to confront Malcolm Merlyn

186
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,453
with your suspicion that
he is the Dark Archer?

187
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,039
Well, I went to
Applied Sciences last night

188
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,665
to retrieve the
dwarf star particles

189
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,292
just like you
asked me to.

190

You make it sound
like a trifle.

191
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,006
Those specific particles
can only be found

192
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,799
on this Earth out of
a multitude.

193
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:59,511
My point is that when I arrived,
Malcolm had already stolen them.

194
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,972
You know what
might help?

195
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,141
If I actually knew why
I was after them.

196
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,019
That I have tasked you
should be reason enough.

197
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,898
Or have you come to doubt
your commitment to this mission?

198
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,108
No, I have not.

199
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,906
At Harris Consolidated, we see
the wall coming down as an opportunity.

200
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,283
For the criminals of Star City
to rob the Glades blind?

201
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,534
To reunite the city.

202
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,554
I don't think people
in the Glades got that memo

203
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,580
'cause last I checked,
crime's up 300%

204
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,998
since the wall
went down.

205
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,043
[Man] There's an old saying...
there are 3 kinds of liars:

and statisticians.

207

You're focusing on the Glades
to the exclusion of Star City

208
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,053
while net, there's been
a citywide reduction in crime.

209
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,391
And we have the vigilantes who
brought down the wall in the first place

210
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,558

I believe that fate brought
the four of us together for a reason

476
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,528
just like it
did our parents

477
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,326
when they decided
to save this city.

478
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:45,915
Now it's our turn.

479
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,237
We don't want to mess
it up, do we?

480
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,606
[grunts]

481
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:11,441
[groans]

482
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:27,916
[gunshots]

483
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:31,836
How'd you find me?

484
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,755
- Tracking your shoe.
- Really?

485
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,065
Just kidding. That was
the way I found you

486
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,358
last time this
happened, remember?

487
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,822
Yeah. Yeah. It's not the only
history that's repeating itself.

488
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,888
Tommy's planning his
very own Undertaking.

489
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,974
Don't worry. We'll stop him.

490
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:47,977
John, I appreciate
the assist,

491
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,624
but I still have to
do this on my own.

492
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,648
Right, because you think
you have to die, right?

493
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:53,983
No. I know
I'm gonna die.

494
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,870
And I know that I don't
have to accept that.

495
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:00,073
If I let you help me,
you will get hurt or you will get killed.

496
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,532
And it will be
because of me.

497
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,576
- You don't know that.
- I do know that.

498
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,413
Because everyone else
in my life is either dead or alone.

499
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:10,208
Look at the Earth
that we're on.

500
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,001
I've been gone 12 years.

501
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,420
My mother's alive.
Tommy's alive.

502
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:15,588
Laurel's alive.

503
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,341
Thea is dead.

504
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,426
And, yes, Tommy's alive.

505
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,972
But he's trying another Undertaking
with Rene and Dinah helping,

506
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:27,517
who, if you haven't noticed,
are very bad people here.

507
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,185
Oliver, this world
isn't better.

508
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,561
It's much, much worse.

509
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,021
You know why?

510
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:34,899
Because you weren't in it.

511
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,255
I've known you long enough to know
I can't talk you out of this.

512
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,950
You better have
a good plan.

513
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,202
[pistol clicking]

514
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,417
Oh, look who it is,
and you brought a friend

515
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,043
to my secret bunker.

516
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,420
I've been here before.

517
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:56,754
Oh, great.
You're here, too.

518
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:00,049
Uh, Adrian,
this is John Diggle.

519
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:02,343
He's my... bodyguard.

520
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,928
You need a bodyguard?

521
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:05,680
He's not a bodyguard.

522
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,867
And I thought you
didn't need our help.

523
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,019
I've been wrong before.
The Dark Archer stole dwarf star particles

524
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,272
and is planning to use them
to level the Glades tonight.

525
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,481
And you know that how?

526
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,088
[Oliver] Because I
was just with him.

527
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,277
Tommy Merlyn is
the Dark Archer.

528
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,029
Are you sure?

529
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,781
He blames the Glades for
what happened to Thea.

530
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,619
If you wanted to level
an entire neighborhood,

531
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,079
how would you do it?

532
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,020
[John] I'd use
an Earthquake machine.

533
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,167
That sounds like
science fiction to me.

534
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,503
And Merlyn stole
dwarf star particles,

535
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,381
which would make for
a very real weapon.

536
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,634
Overlaying the blast radius
with a map of the Glades

537
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,887
should allow us to pinpoint
its optimal location.

538
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,098
He's like you, Curtis,
and Felicity all rolled up in one.

539
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,684
I could only narrow it
down to 4 square blocks.

540
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,770
So we split up,
find it on foot.

541
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,855
No, we don't. Thea
died in the Glades.

542
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,690
We find out where,
we find Tommy.

543
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,209
What are you,
some kind of psychic?

544
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,152
Maybe I'm just
10 steps ahead of you.

545
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,992
[Adrian] 4587 Burke,

546
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,244
favorite hangout of
the Glades' worst drug dealers.

547
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:11,537
Good. That's where we head.

548
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,164
[Oliver and Adrian] Suit up.

549
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,008
Tommy could be anywhere inside.

550
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:26,719
Start at the ground floor.
Work our way up.

551
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:29,722
Let's do this.

552
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:39,899
[shouting indistinctly]

[bone cracks]

554
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,170
You should've stayed
on that island.

555
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,449
[Oliver] Back on my Earth,
you had a better teacher.

556
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:33,536
[clanging]

557
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,360
[Tommy] You don't
have to do this.

558
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,646
[Oliver] I was thinking
the same thing.

559
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,422
This is not what Thea
would have wanted.

560
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:48,009
That's funny. You know
what she used to say?

561
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:49,969
The dead don't want
anything.

562
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,430
It's one of the benefits
of being dead.

563
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,018
Tommy.

564
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:10,698

[Tommy groaning]

567
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:56,077
You can't. It's encrypted
by my personal code.

568
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,913
You can't break it in time.

569
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,040
You can.

570
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,921
I know how devastating
it must have been

571
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:10,967
to lose Thea because
we're only as good

572
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,929
as the people we have
in our lives.

573
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,557
I lost people, too,
Tommy.

574
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,561
I lost people
closer to me

575
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,271
than I could possibly
explain to you.

576
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:26,983
Every one of those losses
brings with it a choice

577
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,444
between darkness
and light.

578
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,658
Make the right
choice.

579
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:41,122
Are you gonna kill thousands
of innocent people,

580
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:45,751
or are you gonna be the man
I know you are?

581
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,358
[device powering down]

582
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,365
That was
a pretty good speech.

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,791
[gas hisses]

584
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:34,258
As agreed. The dwarf star particles
that power Merlyn's weapon.

585
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:36,719
Thank you.

586
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,947
And now you're gonna tell me
what you're gonna do with them?

587
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:42,433
Not destroy a city.
Don't worry.

588
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,604
You're from a parallel universe,
aren't you?

589
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:48,898
The Hood from
another reality?

590
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:50,316
How did you know
that?

591
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:54,070
Bruce Wayne once told me
that if you eliminate the impossible,

592
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:58,240
whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth.

593
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,662
Well, as The Hood from
a parallel universe,

594
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:03,996
may I offer you
some advice?

595
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:06,749
Change "The Hood" to
Green Arrow.

596
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,126
Trust me.

597
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,801
Why do I get the sense
that you guys

598
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,720
won't be sticking around
for a victory drink?

599
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:22,264
We have to get
back home to our Earth.

600
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,976
This city's lucky to have
a hero like you in it.

601
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:32,733
Wow. That might be the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

602
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:34,652
Thank you.

603
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,029
You take care of yourself...

604
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,781
both of you.

605
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,911
You okay?

606
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,247
I'm alive.

607
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,024
You say that like it's
a bad thing.

608
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,834
Well, it's a temporary
thing, John.

609
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,210
Oliver, you
don't know that.

610
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,587
And I don't know this
Monitor, but what I do know,

611
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,423
that no one's fate
is sealed.

612
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,508
- He saw me die.
- In the future...

613
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:59,760
which means we can still
prevent this.

614
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,127
Oliver, you're not
alone in this.

615
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,434
Well, not anymore.

616
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,519
Thanks for having
my back.

617
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,897
Always.
Now, can we go home now?

618
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,029
Just one more thing
I got to do.

619
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,200

We'd better find
Vasquez fast.

622
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,393
[Connor over comms]
<i>Where to, William?</i>

623
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,002
Top floor, southwest
corner office.

624
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:34,795
And JJ's got at least
4 friends.

625
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,732
The second I walk through
that door, JJ's gonna try

626
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,090
to run a sword
through my chest.

627
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,017
But that should keep him
occupied long enough

628
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,594
for you to rescue Vasquez.

629
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,971
Whoa. You're using
yourself as bait?

630
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:48,768
Yeah. And it'll work,
too. Trust me.

631

Whatever you want,
I'll give it to you.

00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,441
Please stop.

633
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:56,776
[moaning]

634
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,110
The codes.

635
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,162
This better be everything.

636
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,414
It is. I swear.

637
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:12,917
[elevator bell rings]

638
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:16,170
Okay.

639
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:23,803
What's up, JJ?

640
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,431
- Miss me?
- Kill his ass.

641
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,679
Come on. Let's get you
out of here.

642
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,583
You think that you can
save this city?

643
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,254
I got news for you.
I own this city now.

644
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,428
Mia!

645
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,349
I am so sorry, okay?
I underestimated him.

646
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:11,976
It will never happen again.

647
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,144
No, it won't, because
from now on,

648
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,813
we're gonna do
things my way.

649
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,155
Hey.

650
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,323
Hey.

651
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:29,660
You okay?

652
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,620
I don't know.

653
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:36,625
I haven't known anything
since Thea died.

654
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,295
I understand that.

655
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:40,754
I don't know, Ollie.

656
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,841
Just I... I can't shake
this feeling...

657
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,762
that our sister would
still be alive if you had...

658
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,391
if you'd just been here.

659
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,853
I've made my own mistakes.

660
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,481
[Moira] Oh, God.

661
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:01,811
[Malcolm] Tommy, are you ok?

662
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,528
Don't worry. We're gonna
get you out of here.

663
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:08,991
I am so sorry.

664
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,204
I have to go.

665
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:16,832
Mom?

666
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:27,551
Bye, mom.

667
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,304
I love you.

668
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:31,889
I love you, too.

669
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,601
Hey.

670
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:38,896
I'll see you at the house.

671
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:40,064
Okay.

672
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:48,113
- All good?
- Let's go home.

673
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:57,915
[Man] What's going on?

674
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,959
[phones ringing]

675
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,086
[Woman] My computer
went down!

676
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,213
[radio chatter]

677
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,048
[Laurel] Oh, good.
You're still here.

678
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,425
What's going on?

679
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:09,760
The city's under attack.

680
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:10,928
By who?

681
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:15,349
[rumbling]

682
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,025
[Laurel] We have to get
the hell out of here.

683
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,352
- [John] And go where?
- [Oliver] Home. Cisco's device.

684
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:33,367
- Oliver?
- Mom?

685
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,416
Dig, you got to
go. Go now!

686
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,252
What's happening?

687
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:48,590
Oliver? Oliver!

688
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,301
Laurel, come on.

689
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:22,833
[Man] Greg, move your head.
