the most beautiful women in Laredo.'

- Congratulations, Danny.
- Thank you for coming.

Congratulations.

24
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:56,015
The last time I saw Danny, he was riding
a big wheel down the sidewalk.

25
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,601
It means a lot to your <i>tía</i>
that you're here.

26
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,227
- Don Chucho.
- Luis, how are you?

27
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,479
How are you, sir?

28
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,355
- Javi.
- Hey, Luis.

29
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,400
We heard about what you did in Colombia.
We sure are proud of you.

30
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,070
- Thanks, Luis. Have a good night.
- You, too.

31
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,571
Hello, Paco.

32
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:17,119
Everyone in Laredo is at this thing.

33
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,412
Hey!

34
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,295
Be right back, Pops.

35
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,217
- Here you go, sweetheart. You got that?
- Yummy!

36
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,177
Hey, Lorraine.

37
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,890
Javi. Heard you were back.

38
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,184
I mean, the whole town's talking about it.

39
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,146
- I had some time off.
- Decided to spend it here?

40
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,236
Actually, I'm...

41
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,072
trying to quit.

42
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,199
Doing the Nicorette thing.

43
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,910
Look at you. A whole new man.

44
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,294
Listen, Lorraine...

45
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,842
I just wanted to say
I've thought about things...

46
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,719
and I'm real sorry about all of it.

47
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:17,805
You waited ten years
to tell me you're sorry?

48
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,849
I know what I did.

49
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,394
I was... um...

50
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,357
It was wrong.

51
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,778
I forgave you a long time ago, Javi.

52
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,072
The truth is, I'm grateful.

53
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,033
I ended up where I'm supposed to be.

54
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,161
Maybe we both did.

55
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,539
If you hadn't come into my life
and disappeared from it,

56
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,291
none of that would have
ever happened.

57
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,711
Can you imagine
if we were actually married?

58
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,258
- Here you go, baby.
- Thank you.

59
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,635
- Hey, Jav.
- Randy.

60
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,470
- How are you?
- Good.

61
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,265
Yeah, I just... I just wanted to say hi.

62
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,391
Yeah.

63
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,352
You hungry?

64
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,647
Oh, you are getting so big.

65
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,622
I know you didn't like it tonight,
all the attention, but...

66
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,833
folks want to pay their respects.

67
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,585
You're a hero to them.

68
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,714
I'm not a hero.

69
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,531
Will you tell me something?

70
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,079
What happened to you over there?

71
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:08,540
- Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.
- But you want to go back?

72
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,720
When you were a kid, a little guy,

73
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,517
all you wanted to do was get out of here,
out into the world.

74
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,561
But you didn't like what you found.

75
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,522
A lot of people don't.

76
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,066
But don't try to change it.

77
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,404
More likely, it'll change you.

78
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,032
It was right here, wasn't it?

79
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,869
The last time we had this conversation.

80
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,455
You didn't listen to me then, either.

81
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,833
Nope.

82
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,215
So, Cali.

83
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,679
Cali.

84
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,945
Sir, here you are.

85
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:44,780
Thank you.

86
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,124
'I'm not a hero.

87
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,377
'There were some
in the hunt for Escobar.

88
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,337
'A lot, actually.

89
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,631
'But it's tough to see them
through all the blood.

90
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:07,261
'To kill a monster, sometimes you have
to get in bed with other monsters.

91
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,389
'If that surprises you,
pick up a history book.

92
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:11,890

93
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,438
'The enemy of my enemy is my friend,

95
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:25,821
'The day Pablo went down, the Cali cartel
became Public Enemy Number One.

96
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,324
'And the fact that they helped us
bring him down didn't mean shit.'

97
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,537
Many observers fear Colombia's
other large cartel, the Cali cartel,

98
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,873
will now simply step up
its own drug production.

99
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,291
'And that's exactly
what happened.

was focused on Escobar,

'Where Pablo sought the love and
protection of the masses of Medellín,

with Colombia's elite

105

'and called themselves
"The Gentlemen of Cali".

106
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:59,605

anything tonight?

No.

- Did you talk to the North Valley people?
- Yes.

And?

151

They said what they thought
I wanted to hear.

152
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,962
But tonight, after the announcement,
we'll know the truth.

153

You're more superstitious
than Aunt Luz.

154

- Hey, boss.
- Is everything ready?

155

Yes, sir.

156
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,252
It took all night, but... it's ready, sir.

157
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,630
You can handle it, you're young.

158
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,890
We're meeting Córdova.
He wants to go over the game plan.

159
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,101
Big night tonight, right?

160
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,062
Lots of company.

161
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,664
Gentlemen.
Let's start with the obvious.

162
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,333
Tonight is fucking important.

163
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,877
The Rodríguez brothers never

164
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,630
gather members of their organisation
in one place.

165
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,843
That simply never happens.
But tonight, they're going to do it.

166
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,929
So we have to be sharp.

167
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,641
- Eyes in the back of the head, understood?
- Yes, sir.

168
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,686
- Jorge.
- Stay focused.

169
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,188
Stay on the radio. Communicate.

170
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,566
Tonight is his last operation.

171
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,612
He's leaving us
to become a fancy businessman.

172
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,451
Let's leave a good impression.
Maybe he'll hire us one day.

173
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,245
Let's go.

174
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,756
What do you think Gilberto
is going to announce tonight?

175
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,217
I think it's a move into the Asian market.

176
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,138
I have no idea.
After Friday, it's not my problem.

177
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,058
- Are you really leaving?
- I promised Paola.

178
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,397
I promise things to my wife
every day, brother.

179
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,234
Relax, you'll find someone else
to make you look good.

180
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,987
I hope so, buddy.

181
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,948
Because right now,
I'm surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

182
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,503
'Congratulations on the promotion, sir.'

183
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,755
Tell me what you do again.

184
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,591
I'm the deputy country attaché.
I'll also be your driver.

185
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,760
I drive myself.

186
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,140
You know, you're kind of a big deal
around here. Since Escobar.

187
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,726
- Katie.
- Good morning.

188
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,606
Sir, can I ask?

189
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,775
What was Escobar like?

190
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,194
Never met him.

191
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,907
'Just because we'd been focused
on Escobar the past few years

192
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,785
'didn't mean we were completely
ignoring the Cali godfathers.'

193
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,121
I want updates from Duffy and Lopez
on where we're at with Cornerstone.

194
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,248
- ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,927
Those are our intelligence summaries
on the Cali cartel.

196
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,596
I don't want summaries.
Where's everything else?

197
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,516
'We had agents on them
the whole time.

198
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,268
'Good agents.

199
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,771
'And recently, we had gotten lucky.'

200
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,942
You got some kind of medical condition?

201
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,279
No, I got one.

202
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,239
'The latest break
in the case against Cali

203
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,909
'came from a joint Customs-DEA
operation called Cornerstone.

204
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,665
'And it put a lot of mid-level Cali guys
behind bars in the States.

205
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,086
'And while they weren't eager to help us,

206
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,006
'you could always count
on some poor relative in Colombia...'

207
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,344
'...who would do whatever it takes
to get their brother or son back home.'

208
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,430
Who am I speaking with?

209
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,432
'And if that sounds harsh,
that's because it is.'

210
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,183
This is Andres, his brother.

211
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,102
'The DEA doesn't fuck around.'

212
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,104
And how can I help him?

213
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,951
Here we go.

214
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,372
Hey, brother. Have a seat.

215
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,169
Something to drink?

216
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,258
You're fine, brother.
Nobody out here knows us.

217
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,093
Cali cops don't even know we're here.

218
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,387
Relax. You're safe here.

219
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,222
Lay it on him.

220
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,642
Let's talk about tonight's party.

221
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,353
We need info on the people attending.

222
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,480
Cops, politicians.

223
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,357
- Cops and politicians?
- Yes.

224
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:44,569
Who work for the cartel.
These people are ruining your country.

225
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,113
And the why. Tell him.

226
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:53,370
Look, the thing is, these people
never get together in one place.

227
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,164
We need to know why now.

228
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,583
Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez

229
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,461
is making some kind
of important announcement.

230
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,797
Understand?

231
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,385
If no... bye-bye,<i>hermano.</i>

232
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,395
- How are things in Texas, Agent Peña?
- Hot.

233
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,316
How's the family? You know,
you had a few more weeks off coming.

234
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,068
You could've spent more time at home.

235
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,529
Yeah, well, I guess they couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

236
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,452
Sir, this operation in Miami,
Cornerstone, shook some leads loose.

237
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,121
Could be a break on Cali.

238
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,750
- Anyone testifying?
- No, but it put an asset in play.

239
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,921
Could shed some light
on their next move.

240
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,595
Things won't be like Escobar,
Agent Peña.

241
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,974
It can't be.
Things have changed down here.

242
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,434
New President coming in.

243
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,228
Gaviria put up with things
that this guy might not.

244
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,566
Just take it a little slowly.

245
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,444
Get your feet under you,
get used to the new job.

246
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,949
Sir, the CIA station chief...

247
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,952
he and I have history.

248
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,663
I'm hoping it won't be an issue
moving forward.

249
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,665
I know you and Stechner
have your differences.

250
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,376
- It won't be a problem.
- I'm not sure I share your confidence.

251
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,587
Stechner signed off
on your appointment.

252
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,339
In fact, he wanted you back.

253
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,886
The CIA and the DEA need
to work together on this one.

254
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,512
We have the same goal.

255
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,531
Come in.

256
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,287
<i>Hola,</i> brother.

257
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,457
We were starting to worry.
Everything cool?

258
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,710
We were getting worried.
Everything okay?

259
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,129
Yes, but...
I thought someone was tailing me.

260
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,174
- He thinks he may have been followed.
- No, yeah, I figured.

261
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,384
I had to make sure I was alone.

262
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,137
Let's get you suited up, my man.
Run through the plan again.

263
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,681
Take off your shirt. Sit.

264
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,689
Okay. Ready. We're good to go.

265
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:20,952
Look, don't you think you
should fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

266
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,706
He's a boss.

267
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,750
We're in their territory, right?

268
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,048
Yes. Yes.

269
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,967
I'll fix it tonight.

270
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,260
María.

271
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,470
María.

272
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,102
For our children,
and our children's children.

273
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,688
That sounded great, brother.

274
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,900
Let me do it from the top.

275
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,279
No one gives a shit about your speech.
We can hear it after...

276
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,990
- Pacho!
- Chepe!

277
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,201
Come here, you crazy motherfucker.

278
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,038
What's up?

279
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,790
Look at you. How's New York?

280
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:12,170
Cold. But if you ask nicely,
the girls make up for it.

281
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,506
I brought you something, baby-face.

282
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,802
Lovely. Thanks.

283
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,683
It's been too long
since we were all together.

284
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,023
Tonight is our night,
because we've earned this.

285
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,110
- Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!
- Cheers!

286
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,280
I think there is business
to discuss first, Gilberto.

287
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,117
You're acting like someone
just pissed you off.

288
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,663
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

289
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,624
- But I work harder than him.
- Cheers, then!

290
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,626
To the Pope!

291
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,586
Cheers.

292
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,296
Welcome, Chepe.

293
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:04,472
Look, Gilberto...
you know I have a personal issue

294
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,892
with that son of a bitch,
Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

295
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:12,563
And he's downstairs.
I would like to solve it.

296
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,068
Okay, Pacho.

297
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:22,740
I understand your need for revenge,
but this isn't the time to get into it.

298
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,201
There's too much at stake.

299
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,790
Well... shall we enjoy
this expensive party or what?

300
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,794
No. Instead, let's listen
to Gilberto's speech again.

301
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,171
Chepe, you motherfucker.

302
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,777
Look, that's Menga's chief of police.

303
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,698
I pay him money every month.

304
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,868
I pay all these people.

305
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:11,247
Well done, big shot.
It's not your money.

306
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,166
But I'm the one who controls it.

307
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,752
- Who bought you these earrings?
- Guillermo. Enough.

308
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,962
Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.

309
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,260
Watch it.

310
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,277
- How are you, sir?
- Pallomari.

311
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,321
- Enjoying the party?
- Yes.

312
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,657
Yes.

313
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,243
Nice to see you.

314
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,246
Don Gilberto, good evening.

315
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,957
- Welcome, Mr. Mayor.
- Don Gilberto, how are you?

316
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,920
Good evening, Don Gilberto.

317
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,595
- Look, here it is.
- Motherfucker.

318
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:21,776
Hello.

319
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,820
- Good evening.
- Can I have aguardiente with ice?

320
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,072
- Of course.
- Thank you.

321
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,009
Are you...

322
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,304
...enjoying yourself?

323
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,932
Yes. Very much, thank you.

324
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,191
Miguel Rodríguez, nice to meet you.

325
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,693
María Salazar.

326
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,279
Thank you for having us.

327
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:28,968
Good evening.

328
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,803
Mister Rodríguez would like
for his associates

329
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,930
to join him in the equestrian ring
for an announcement.

330
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,849
Please, go right ahead.

331
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,853
Gentlemen, please follow the ushers
towards the stables.

332
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,771
Thank you.

333
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,777
Stop there.

334
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,072
You must be using
some high-end equipment

335
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,325
if you're getting anything
in this shitty light.

336
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:54,952
Who are you?

337
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,538
I'm in charge of security
for the Rodríguez brothers.

338
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:01,459
See that man over there?
His name is Navegante.

339
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,629
Guess what he does?

340
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,051
Either you come with me,
or you go with him. You understand?

341
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,846
Follow me.

342
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,949
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

343
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,034
You live with your mother
in commune number 3.

344
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,621
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

345
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,333
Your brother is Lucho.

346
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,294
He's in federal custody
in the United States.

347
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,214
That's why you agreed
to work for the DEA.

348
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,966
Don't lie to me.

349
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,969
Andrés, you made a bad decision.

350
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,514
But I think you're smart enough
to realise that.

351
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,060
You have another decision to make,
and it's the only way to get out alive.

352
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,271
Leave Cali.

353
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:08,067
Don't say goodbye to your mother
or to your girlfriend.

354
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,153
I need you to disappear.

355
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,994
Associates, friends.

356
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,955
Our enemy is dead!

357
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,626
Our business is strong!

358
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,838
Together we have taken this business

359
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:32,466
to heights that our predecessors
couldn't have imagined.

360
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:39,265
But friends... there's circumstances
that we need to acknowledge.

361
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,608
- Stoddard!
- 'Listen to me.

362
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:55,781
'The law enforcement spotlight will shine
brightly on us, as it once did on Escobar.

363
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:59,994
'And so, while we celebrate,

364
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,957
'they will do everything they can
to take away everything we've built.

365
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:13,174
An American named Joseph Kennedy
made his fortune selling bootlegged liquor,

366
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,968
but he turned that money into legitimacy.

367
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,220
His children, great politicians.

368
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,932
And one of them was
even elected president.

369
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:27,396
Yes, gentlemen, we have been
negotiating with the authorities,

370
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,273
and soon we will reach an agreement.

371
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,493
Our organisation, within six months,
will be out of the cocaine business.

372
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,747
We will surrender our labs,

373
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,124
our safe houses,

374
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,710
and our trafficking routes.

375
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:56,175
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake
of thinking it won't be on our terms.

376
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,970
Any prison sentences will be minimal.

377
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,306
Our money will remain ours.

378
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,810
Our legitimate businesses
will continue to grow.

379
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:10,481
We have six months to make
as much money as possible!

380
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,151
And gentlemen,
as a token of our friendship,

381
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:19,532
we'll give each of you a juicy share

382
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,660
of the final profits from this year.

383
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,920
To the bright future we'll all soon enjoy.

384
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:37,049
For our children...
and our children's children!

385
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,554
- Cheers...
- Cheers!

386
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,390
- Cheers, gentlemen!
- Cheers!

387
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,643
- What did you think?
- I think it's a great move.

388
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,189
- Congratulations!
- For the future!

389
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,195
Thank you, brother.
Thank you for coming.

390
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,882
What would you like?

391
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,300
Whiskey. Dry.

392
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:25,723
Hey, sir!

393
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,977
We were wondering
if we could get you a drink.

394
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,188
I'm good. Thanks.

395
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,066
Okay.

396
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,447
Six months.

397
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,241
I'm going to bleed New York dry.

398
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:48,704
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty
and fuck her right up her ass.

399
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,128
And then what?

400
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:01,175
We only have six months
of doing whatever the fuck we want?

401
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,060
Hello.

402
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,650
I love you, brother.

403
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,696
I'll see you on the dance floor.

404
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,760
- Can you get in the car, please?
- Why do you want to leave so early?

405
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,220
Because it's time, okay?

406
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:50,266
- Why are you treating me like this?
- That's enough! Get in the car.

407
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,795
How was everything tonight, Jorge?

408
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,171
Very good, sir.

409
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,844
Do you think we surprised them?

410
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,264
Yes. I think you surprised
many people.

411
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,729
I'm told we had an uninvited guest.
What happened there?

412
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,151
Don't be modest.

413
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,570
Córdova told me.

414
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,072
It's your talent.

415
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,743
Spotting the threat,
knowing when they're going to fuck us.

416
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,121
It's priceless.

417
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,544
I'm told you want to leave.

418
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:07,635
I'm grateful to you
and your family, but...

419
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:12,348
I'm starting my own security firm.

420
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:18,354
I only wanted to stay until...
Escobar stopped being a threat.

421
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,942
And we are very grateful. Honestly.

422
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,528
You have done great things for us
over the years.

423
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,490
For my family. For me.

424
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,453
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

425
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:48,884
With all due respect,
I've already made arrangements...

426
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,511
Arrangements can change.

427
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:56,392
Look, we didn't get where we are
by allowing good people to leave.

428
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,230
We will need you more than ever
in the months ahead.

429
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,817
It's only six months.

430
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,405
Can I count on you, Jorge?

431
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,158
Yes?

432
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,205
Of course, boss.

433
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:20,666
Miguel.

434
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:43,230
Pretty girl.

435
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,401
Displays some shaky judgment
in men, though.

436
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,990
Welcome back, Agent Peña.

437
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,367
<i>Mazel tov</i> on the promotion.

438
00:33:55,492 --> 00:34:00,205
That extra, what, 9K a year
is really gonna come in handy.

439
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,041
The same.

440
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:03,751
So?

441
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,878
You signed off on me
coming back to Bogotá.

442
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:10,174
Did indeed.
Because you know how things work.

443
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,259
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean?

444
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:18,432
To the folks back in D.C.,
Escobar was a win.

445
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,641
Thanks.

446
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:24,480
But down here...
we know what it cost, don't we?

447
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,317
Medellín was a failure.
Thousands of Colombians dead.

448
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:31,236
And coke still flooding
American streets by the ton.

449
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:35,115
Oh, come on. You don't care about
American streets or dead Colombians.

450
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,207
What was accomplished, Agent Peña?

451
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,045
We do Cali differently.

452
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,548
No swallowing the spider
to catch the fly this time.

453
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,384
America's got plans for Colombia.

454
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,846
Another bloodbath complicates them.

455
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,268
So...

456
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,396
what's the play?

457
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,318
Surrender.
Cali cartel throws in the towel.

458
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,738
Hands over the keys to the biggest
criminal enterprise in history.

459
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,534
As far as I'm concerned,
the DEA can even take the credit.

460
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,327
And these fucking guys walk?

461
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:26,625
Negotiations are on the two-yard line,
but it has backing from Washington.

462
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,381
So what the fuck do you need me for?

463
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,551
Well, you're the dashing DEA agent
that took down Escobar.

464
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,971
Always helps to have a hero on board.

465
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,766
Don't worry. Cali will serve some time.

466
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,394
Technically speaking.

467
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,606
And that's enough for you?

468
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:54,862
If there were any justice in this world,
Javier, you'd be in jail.

469
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,787
I know your guys are running
an operation on Cali tonight.

470
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,623
Please.

471
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:12,004
I can tell you this:
it'll come up double zeros.

472
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,092
These guys don't make mistakes.

473
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,596
You try to go after the Cali bosses,
all you'll get are more bodies.

474
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,579
I don't know, man.

475
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,748
I met him at an embassy thing
about a year ago.

476
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:48,665
Yeah?

477
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,834
Couldn't drink it or fuck it,
dude wasn't interested.

478
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,548
I hear you.

How could he?

Just for a little while.

How long?

560
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,018
I'm asking you how long.

- Six months.
- Six months?

562

What did you tell him?

563
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:58,113
What could I tell him? It's six months.

564

We've talked about this
for a long time.

565

You're telling me we can't start our new
lives because we have to wait six months?

566

You know what? I don't think
you really want to leave this job.

567
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,378
- How can you say that?
- You think I'm an idiot?

568
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:18,133
You like working for them.
It's become your life, Jorge.

569

You are my life. The girls are my life.

570
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,265
- What do you want me to do?
- Don't say another word.

571
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,059
- It's six months, not six years.
- Not another word.

572
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,996
- She owns a spa.
- Let's go. We should go!

00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:57,166
I think our differences
are in the past.

582
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:06,426
