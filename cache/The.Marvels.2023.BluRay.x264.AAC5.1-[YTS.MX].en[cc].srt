MONICA: Here is what we do know.

893
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,343
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network

894
00:46:24,427 --> 00:46:25,719
is a system of wormholes

895
00:46:25,803 --> 00:46:26,845
through the space-time continuum

896
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:28,138
aka, jump points,

897
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:30,933
which allows us to hop between
different planetary systems.

898
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:33,394
Basically, it stretches
and reconfigures space

899
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:34,770
without rupturing the continuum.

900
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:37,982
Like fracking, the more holes you drill,

901
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:40,276
the more destabilized
the shale becomes,

902
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:41,736
and then... earthquake.

903
00:46:43,947 --> 00:46:46,241
Bottom line, if she keeps
creating these jump points,

904
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:48,327
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

905
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,788
Question is, what does she want?

906
00:46:51,747 --> 00:46:54,166
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree,

907
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:56,419
so maybe the attack was a warning?

908
00:46:56,502 --> 00:46:58,671
So, she could be after
another former colony?

909
00:46:58,754 --> 00:47:00,340
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

910
00:47:00,423 --> 00:47:02,050
CAROL: At one point, the Kree colonized

911
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:04,635
25% of the galaxy, so...

912
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,721
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax,

913
00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:09,349
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

914
00:47:09,432 --> 00:47:10,475
Why a jump point?

915
00:47:10,558 --> 00:47:12,310
You're right.
Jump points aren't weapons,

916
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:13,644
they're means of transportation.

917
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:15,480
Every jump point has two sides,

918
00:47:15,563 --> 00:47:17,941
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away,

919
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:20,777
- it had to go somewhere, or...
- Hala.

You missed me?

DOCTOR:
How's our mysterious visitor?

1768
01:36:39,203 --> 01:36:41,455
She seems a little disoriented.

1769
01:36:41,538 --> 01:36:44,166
Where... Where are we? What happened?

1770
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:46,460
We were hoping you could tell us.

1771
01:36:47,378 --> 01:36:49,797
All we know is that Binary found you.

1772
01:36:49,881 --> 01:36:54,219
My theory? You somehow crossed
through a tear in space-time.

1773
01:36:54,302 --> 01:36:57,014
You are now in a reality
parallel to your own.

1774
01:36:57,765 --> 01:37:00,267
Which is, of course, impossible.

MARIA: I think there might be
a little confusion happening.

1776
01:37:05,814 --> 01:37:07,734
Confusion is but the first step

on the journey to knowledge.

1778

Okay. I'll take it from here.
