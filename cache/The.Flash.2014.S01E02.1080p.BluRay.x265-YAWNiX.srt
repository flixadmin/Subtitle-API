1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,923
My name is Barry Allen.
I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,301
When I was a 11, my mother was murdered.
I saw a ball of lightning.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,388
Inside the lightning was a man.
He killed my mom.

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,849
- I swear to God, I didn't do this.
- Where's Mom?

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,935
What happened that night
was impossible.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,437
Then an accident made me the impossible.

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,608
- You were in a coma.
- How long?

8
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,152
- Nine months.
- Your muscles should be atrophied.

9
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,199
But they're in a state
of cellular regeneration.

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,490
I wasn't the only one affected, was 1?

11
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:35,410
We've been searching
for other meta-humans like yourself.

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,748
All my life I've wanted to do more, and
the first chance I get to help someone...

13
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,001
- I screw up.
- The good you do will far outweigh the bad.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,962
You're not gonna be in here much longer.

15
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,049
Whoever killed Mom,
I think I finally have a way to find them.

16
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,680
This is the part where I'm supposed
to do the whole intro thingy.

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,766
Barry Allen, fastest man alive,
but you know all that already.

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,852
All right, let's get to the good stuff.
You see that smoke?

19
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,522
That's a fire on Western and Third
in downtown Central City.

20
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,984
And that blur? That's me on my way to it.

21
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,195
I'm going 352 miles an hour.

22
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,197
And it's a slow day.

23
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,617
This is Ladder 52.
We're still at least two minutes out.

24
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,786
- People are gonna die.
- I know.

25
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,747
Barry.

26
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,332
Barry.

27
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,961
What? Did I miss it?

28
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,880
You overshot by about six blocks.

29
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,257
My bad.

30
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,843
Paige. My daughter.

31
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,887
Has anyone seen my daughter? Paige.

32
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,224
You there yet?

33
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,560
What are you doing?

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,022
- Nothing.
- Who are you talking to?

35
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,982
- No one.
- Are you talking to Barry?

36
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,400
- Who?
- Barry Allen?

37
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,861
Struck by lightning,
in a coma for nine months...

38
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,739
able to run faster than
the speed of sound? Ring a bell?

39
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,908
- Nope, haven't talked to him.
- Cisco, there's fire everywhere.

40
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,329
Cisco, are you still there?

41
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,624
Mom? Mommy?

42
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,713
Mommy.

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,225
Everybody's out.
What else you got for me, Cisco?

44
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,810
Barry, it's Caitlin.

45
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
Hey, Caitlin.

46
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,151
- How's your day?
- Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,819
Now.

48
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,279
On my way.

49
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,248
Have you both lost your minds?
Who do you think you are?

50
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,001
Well, I'm the eyes and ears,
and he's the feet.

51
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,004
This isn't funny.
You could have gotten yourself killed.

52
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,299
You can't be running around the city
like some supersonic fireman.

53
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,553
Why not? This is what we talked about.
Me using my speed to do good.

54
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,847
We talked about you
helping contain people...

55
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,059
who have been affected
by the particle accelerator explosion.

56
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,271
Meta-humans. And aside from Clyde Mardon,
we haven't found any.

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,400
People in the city still need help.
And I can help them.

58
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,110
We can help them.

59
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,986
Will you please say something?

60
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,116
I think what Caitlin is saying,
in her own spectacularly angry way...

61
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,577
Is we're just beginning to understand
what your body is capable of.

62
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,205
Not to sound like a broken record,
Mr. Allen...

63
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,040
I do caution restraint.

64
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:32,546
Dr. Wells, I doubt restraint
is how you got to be the man you are today.

65
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,881
In a wheelchair and a pariah.

66
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,635
Lack of restraint
is what made me these things.

67
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,887
Know your limits.

68
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,727
Don't expect me to patch you up
every time you break something.

69
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,646
Hey, uh, anything happen out there today?

70
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,607
The sensors in the suit
were kicking back weird telemetry.

71
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,526
Your vitals spiked for a few seconds.

72
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,361
Never felt better.

73
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,660
- Hey, Joe, everything all right?
- Great.

74
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:08,290
I got a fresh crime scene, a dead body,
detectives interviewing witnesses.

75
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,376
Yellow tape stretched over everything.
I'm missing one thing.

76
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,005
- Can you guess what that is?
- I'll be right there.

77
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,300
My day job beckons.

78
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,639
When do you think he'll realize
he didn't take his clothes?

79
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,189
Hmm.

80
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,235
Perp made off with a bunch of handguns.

81
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,114
At least six Glock-19s
fitted with extra ammunition magazines.

82
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,283
Somebody's looking to do a lot of bad.

83
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,202
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

84
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,954
Doing a little Fall shopping?

85
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:53,335
Oh, heh, I was going so fast this morning,
I didn't even notice.

86
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,920
Yeah.

87
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,800
I downloaded surveillance footage
off the video camera.

88
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,722
Looks like only one perp.

89
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,818
Footage may only show one,
but it was six guys.

90
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,320
Look, the tracks.
They're all crossing each other.

91
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,949
Six sets of footprints. Six guns stolen.
We should be looking for a crew.

92
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,701
Huh.

93
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,788
Weird. The shoes.
Looks like they're all the same size.

94
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,290
Men's 10s, I'd guess.

95
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,377
Just like you, captain.
Not that you're a suspect, sir.

96
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,510
Your ability to multitask is remarkable.
The way you can embarrass me...

97
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,929
the captain, and yourself,
at the same time.

98
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,849
- Joe, I'm sorry.
- I'm starting to think, "Joe, I'm sorry"...

99
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,810
is my actual name
considering how often you say it to me.

100
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,938
- I'm dealing with a lot right now.
- Look, I know you are.

101
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:59,150
Believe me, I'm dealing with it too. I've
always had a very simple set of beliefs.

102
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,862
Gravity makes things fall.
Water makes things wet.

103
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,949
Until a few weeks ago, I believed the
fastest man could run a mile in four minutes.

104
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,285
- Not four seconds.
- I can do it in three.

105
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,956
- Not relevant.
- You haven't said anything to Iris, have you?

106
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,083
No, I made a promise. I keep my promises.

107
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,753
Keep on lying. You're liable
to get struck by lightning. Get to the lab.

108
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,256
Start processing the evidence
from the gun store.

109
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,525
- Hey, Iris.
- Did Barry run away again?

110
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,777
Unless that's one
of your homework questions...

111
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,030
it's none of your business.
Go to your room.

112
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,909
- I want to see my dad.
- I already said no, Barry.

113
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,494
He didn't do those things.
He didn't hurt my mom.

114
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,039
I was there that night. I saw.
There was a man.

115
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,667
Yeah, I know.
We've gone through this already.

116
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,336
Then why can't I go see him?

117
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,423
Because I said so.

118
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,509
You're not my father.
You can't tell me what to do.

119
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,804
Right now I'm the only adult
that gives a damn what happens to you.

120
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,890
So, yes, I can tell you what to do.

121
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,975
- Now go to your room.
- I hate you.

122
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,312
This is your fault.
I could've taken European Folklore...

123
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,523
10 cover my sociology requirement,
but no.

124
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,985
You said, "Take Journalism, Iris.
Reporters have all of the fun."

125
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,529
Guess what, Barry?
Reporters have none of the fun.

126
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,615
Journalism is boring. I'm bored.
I blame you.

127
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,535
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

128
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,371
You look really nice.

129
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,667
Thanks. Why don't you look nice?

130
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,377
This afternoon? Suit and tie?

131
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,130
- The university is giving Simon Stagg...
- Simon Stagg...

132
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,425
- Some award. You agreed...
- To explain the science in your article.

133
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,262
- It's all coming back to me now.
- How fast can you get home and change?

134
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,222
Uh, pretty fast.

135
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,768
Allen, Joe asked me to see where you're at
on the evidence from the gun store shooting.

136
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,187
- Oh, hey, Iris.
- Detective.

137
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,110
Please, guys, uh, just kiss already.
I already know, remember?

138
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,118
Ugh, thanks for being
so cool about this, Barry.

139
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,788
I know it's not easy keeping a big secret.

140
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,957
I'm getting used to it.

141
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,589
I find it quite remarkable...

142
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,342
having once been a timid freshman...

143
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,763
to be standing before you
the Regents choice for Man of the Year.

144
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,599
While I very much appreciate the award...

145
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,311
the real honor for me is knowing
that my work in organ transference...

146
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,941
helps give people a second chance at
life. Thank you all very much for coming.

147
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,153
Okay, all right, first things first.

148
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,238
Simon Stagg's work in cellular cloning...

149
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,741
has led to huge advancements
in organ replacement.

150
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,036
- Are journalists allowed to drink on the job?
- If you are bored...

151
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,289
wait until we get to the science
behind cellular regeneration.

152
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,083
I have missed this, Barry.

153
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,336
We haven't spent time together
since you woke up from the coma.

154
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,172
Yeah, I've had a crazy few weeks. I know.

155
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,300
I thought maybe you'd been avoiding me
because of Eddie.

156
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,386
I know you think it's wrong,
me dating my dad's partner and...

157
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,889
No, that is not it. At all.

158
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,728
Oh. Oh. Mr. Stagg, I was wondering
if I could get a quote from you.

159
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,230
Not now, miss.

160
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,024
I'll just make something up.

161
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,319
So, what were you gonna tell me?
You were about to say something.

162
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,411
Quiet down, all of you.

163
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,872
Quiet.

164
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:28,169
How considerate.
You're all wearing your finest jewelry.

165
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,881
Almost like you knew
we were coming to rob you.

166
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,385
Now everybody line up.

167
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,474
Don't.

168
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,226
Freeze.

169
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,566
Drop your weapons.

170
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,094
Barry. Barry. Barry.

171
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,223
I turned around and you were gone.
What happened? Are you okay?

172
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,518
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

173
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,521
I went after them to try to get the plates.

174
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,524
And I fainted.

175
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,033
- Hi.
- Iris.

176
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,076
- Where were you?
- Dad, go easy.

177
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,912
I found him outside. He fainted.

178
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,080
You want me to get you a paramedic,
Allen?

179
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,124
No, I'm fine. Thanks, Eddie.

180
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,586
I thought I was dead.
I saw the gun go off and then boom.

181
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,923
Suddenly, I'm outside.
I have no idea how I got there.

182
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,383
Let me talk to you for a second.

183
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,052
Yeah.

184
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,598
- You chased those gunmen?
- They must be the same guys...

185
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,935
- that knocked over the gun shop.
- What were you going to do...

186
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,938
when you caught them, huh?

187
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,066
Ask them nicely to pull over?
You're not bulletproof.

188
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,901
Wait, are you?

189
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,238
- No.
- Okay. No more heroics.

190
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,533
Chasing bad guys is not your job.
It's mine. You're not a cop.

191
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,620
- Promise me.
- Promise.

192
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,540
And you know Iris is not stupid. Start
making better excuses than "I fainted."

193
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,628
You lied to us.

194
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,339
How could you not tell us
you're experiencing dizzy spells?

195
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,632
We're your doctors.

196
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,884
God knows
what's going on inside your body.

197
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,136
Your cells are in a constant state of flux.

198
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,557
You could be experiencing cardiopulmonary
failure, or a transient ischemic attack.

199
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,811
Mini-stroke. Probably not.

200
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,690
You, of all people, should know
that in science, we share.

201
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,984
We do not keep secrets.

202
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:02,282
Wow, I haven't seen anyone
make her that angry since Ronnie.

203
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,534
Ronnie was Caitlin's fiancé?

204
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,941
The one that died
the night of the accelerator explosion?

205
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,707
Yeah, he is missed.

206
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,586
Now, let's figure out
why this is happening to you.

207
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,839
We're all set.

208
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,510
- A little padding. Just in case.
- Yeah.

209
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,975
You sure about this, Cisco?

210
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,727
Most home treadmills...

211
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,521
have a maximum speed
of about 12 miles per hour.

212
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,151
This one has been Cisco'ed.
Trust me, it can handle your speed.

213
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,695
Okay.

214
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,998
Heart rate, blood pressure,
nerve conduction all normal.

215
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,374
For Barry.

216
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,626
Brainwave function within standard limits.

217
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,545
Heh. Told you the treadmill could take it.

218
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,423
Caitlin, look at the glucose levels.

219
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,550
- Oh, my God. Of course.
- Right?

220
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,177
- It was so obvious.
- Glucose.

221
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,137
Barry, we think we know why you keep...

222
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,391
Passing out.

223
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,189
Barry.

224
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,668
Where's Barry?

225
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,088
Taking a shower.

226
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,549
At 3:00 in the afternoon?

227
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,219
If I go up those stairs,
am I gonna see Barry...

228
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,763
or are you gonna be grounded
for lying to me?

229
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,100
I'm sorry, Daddy.
But don't worry, I know where he went.

230
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,728
Me too.

231
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,699
- I passed out again?
- Total metabolic failure...

232
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,910
brought on by acute hypoglycemia.

233
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,538
I'm not eating enough.
So an I.V. bag and I'm good to go.

234
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,793
Try 40. Guess you were thirsty.

235
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,338
We're gonna need to fashion you a diet
based on your metabolic changes.

236
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,965
I've done a few calculations.

237
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,635
You need to consume an amount equal
to roughly 850 tacos.

238
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:32,473
Unless we're talking cheese and guac, which
is like a whole other set of equations.

239
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,644
For Mexican, I recommend Tito's
on Bruckner Avenue.

240
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,354
Best burrito in the city.

241
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,107
Detective West, what brings you
to S.T.A.R. Labs?

242
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:47,280
When I couldn't find you at your lab,
I started doing a little research.

243
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,826
Turns out, there's been reports
of a red streak around the city.

244
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,787
Stopping muggers.
Rescuing people from burning buildings.

245
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,539
You...

246
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,875
didn't tell him we
were working together.

247
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,377
Joe, I can explain.

248
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,256
You already have a job
in law enforcement, Barry.

249
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,467
- I suggest you get back to it.
- Mm-hm.

250
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,053
Don't look at me. I'm on your side.

251
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,639
Detective, we all want
what's best for Barry.

252
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,018
If you wanted what was best for Barry,
you'd talk him out of this...

253
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,188
instead of encouraging him
going out there risking his life.

254
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,649
You saw a man control the weather.

255
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,486
What are the police gonna do
against someone like that?

256
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,491
Since the accelerator explosion,
we suspect there may more like him.

257
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,369
And you're gonna do what? Catch them?

258
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,038
Are you insane?

259
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:41,709
You think because you can run real fast
that you're invincible? You're not.

260
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,046
You're just a kid. My kid.

261
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,926
I'm not your kid, Joe.

262
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,887
And you're not my father.

263
00:16:55,848 --> 00:17:00,102
My father is sitting in Iron Heights.
Wrongfully convicted.

264
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,104
You were wrong about him.

265
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,106
And you're wrong about this.

266
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,108
Now, I may not be able to help him...

267
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,819
but if I can save someone
from a burning building...

268
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,948
or stop some armed thieves,
I'm gonna do it.

269
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,908
And you can't stop me.

270
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,702
So don't try.

271
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,086
You think you're so smart.

272
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,589
All of you.

273
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,425
But you don't know what you don't know.

274
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,765
And I hope that you're clever enough to
figure it out before somebody gets killed.

275
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,243
Where's the rest of your crew?

276
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,620
Just me.

277
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,623
- What do you want?
- The only thing I still want in life.

278
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,083
Your boss dead.

279
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,377
It's not my fault your team moved too slow.

280
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,879
I told you were Stagg would be,
not how long.

281
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,633
I need his full itinerary
and security access to his office and home.

282
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,095
Screw you. I've got a reputation
in the security business.

283
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:20,391
It's one thing if my employer gets iced.
It's another if it happens in his bedroom.

284
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,603
You'll do what I ask, Mr. Java.

285
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,652
What the hell are you gonna do to me
without your army?

286
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,303
I am an army.

287
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,444
Come to yell at me again?

288
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,197
Simon Stagg's head of security
was murdered last night.

289
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,784
The coroner took some skin samples.
Hopefully they belong to the killer.

290
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,202
See if you can find a match.

291
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,913
Can't be a coincidence
Stagg's benefit was attacked.

292
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,457
- Going to interview Stagg now.
- I'll come with you.

293
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,709
Your job is in here.
Stay in here and do it.

294
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,045
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, baby.

295
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,047
Gotta go.

296
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,967
Why is my dad mad at you?

297
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,345
Work stuff.

298
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,057
Why are you mad at me?

299
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,059
You were supposed to meet me at Jitters...

300
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,395
to give me scientific background
for my article.

301
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,564
- And I didn't show up.
- I have to come up with a new topic...

302
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,025
- in 24 hours or I fail the assignment.
- Iris...

303
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,070
Don't say that you're sorry.
Okay? I know that you are.

304
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,572
What I don't know
is what is going on with you.

305
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,741
We grew up one bedroom down
from each other.

306
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,703
Do you honestly think that I don't know
when you're happy...

307
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,247
or sad, or depressed, or lost?

308
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm gonna ask you one last time, Barry,
and you better be honest with me.

309
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,252
What the...

310
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,714
You want to know what's happening.
I'm fast now.

311
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,757
And, God, I just want to tell you.

312
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,553
How I feel. How you make me feel.

313
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,221
But I can't.

314
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,014
Hell is going on with you?

315
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,978
We are not done talking about this.

316
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,939
Impossible. There was a murder.

317
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,067
These skill cells belong to the murderer,
but these are naive.

318
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:38,571
Stem cells. They can replicate
and become any cell the body needs.

319
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,114
They only come from babies.

320
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,492
This means your killer is what, a newborn?

321
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,911
You honestly think
someone wants to kill me?

322
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,040
We're not sure, Mr. Stagg. But the event
you were being honored at was robbed.

323
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,002
And your head of security
was found murdered this morning.

324
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,089
I am a scientist and a philanthropist.
We're not often the targets of assassins.

325
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,050
What about lawsuits?
You've got about 20 of those pending.

326
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,139
Yeah, it is a sad fact of life, detective,
that when you earn a lot of money...

327
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,600
people who haven't
think they can take yours.

328
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:11,937
People like this guy, for example?
Danton Black?

329
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,522
Danton Black.

330
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,484
You fired him. Now he's suing you.

331
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,403
Unfortunately, our working relationship
wasn't successful.

332
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,406
But I can assure you both of one thing.

333
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,576
Danton Black is not a killer.

334
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,329
He's a clinical researcher,
not a criminal mastermind.

335
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,124
Now, if I can help you in any way,
please let me know.

336
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,169
- I want these people caught as much as you.
- Then here we are.

337
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,254
Down.

338
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,304
Head down.

339
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,476
Additional units are on the way.

340
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,650
- Captain, what's going on?
- Not now.

341
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,986
An armed gunman's
shooting up Stagg Industries.

342
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,447
Joe's there.

343
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,084
Get him out of here. I'll cover you.
Ready? Go.

344
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,239
- Go.
- No.

345
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,495
- Whoever you are, give yourself up.
- Sorry.

346
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,080
We're not going anywhere.

347
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,249
Until Simon Stagg is dead.

348
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,273
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

349
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,298
Sorry. The abrasions
are already rapidly healing.

350
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,342
Yeah, I got my ass handed to me.

351
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,802
You got blood on my suit.

352
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,971
I think some of it belongs to him.

353
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,641
Another not-so-friendly meta-human.

354
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,187
Danton Black.

355
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,981
A bio-geneticist.
Specialized in therapeutic cloning.

356
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:06,403
- Growing new organs to replace failing ones.
- Stagg stole his research and then fired him.

357
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,198
I saw Black create duplicates
from his own body.

358
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,909
That's pretty ironic.
The guy specialized in cloning.

359
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,994
And now he can make Xeroxes of himself.

360
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,665
If he was experimenting on himself
when exposed to the dark matter wave...

361
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,833
released by the accelerator explosion...

362
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,544
Meet Captain Clone.

363
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,840
Don't worry.
I'll come up with something cooler.

364
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,346
Where are you going?

365
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,265
Joe was right.

366
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:39,937
I'm in way over my head.
Yeah, I'm fast, but I am no warrior.

367
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,524
I could barely fight one meta-human,
let alone six.

368
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,277
Barry...

369
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,904
I understand.

370
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,408
Today was a setback.
But any grand enterprise has them.

371
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,411
And we can never learn to fly
without crashing a few times.

372
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,249
This wasn't a grand enterprise, Dr. Wells.

373
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,168
This was a mistake.

374
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,937
Dad.

375
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,399
Sorry, no physical contact.

376
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,901
Five minutes, Allen.

377
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,906
Sit down, son.

378
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,911
Barry, how did you get here?

379
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,498
I ran here. Joe wouldn't bring me.
He wouldn't let me see you.

380
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,835
- I hate him.
- No. No. Don't say that.

381
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,588
It isn't Joe...

382
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,924
that doesn't want you to come here.

383
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,762
I don't want you to come here.
I don't want you to see me like this.

384
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,808
You have to let him go. My dad didn't
do these things. He didn't hurt my mom.

385
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:02,770
The man in the lightning.
The lightning man killed my mom.

386
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,606
- Barry, look at me. Look at me.
- Not my dad.

387
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,277
You can't help me.

388
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,616
Now Joe is gonna look after you
until I can get out of here.

389
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,034
You just...

390
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,287
be the good boy
that your mom and I know you are.

391
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,970
Dad.

392
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,807
Dad.

393
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,656
Detective, was the gunman apprehended?

394
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,658
The shooter's whereabouts are unknown.

395
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:02,329
We consider him armed and dangerous.
Thank you. No more questions.

396
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,582
Nice work, Eddie.

397
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,793
Yeah. Right place. Right time.

398
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,503
No, you were a hero today.

399
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,423
C.C.P.D. still has a killer on the loose.
I should get back to the precinct.

400
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:14,883
Bye.

401
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,682
So did you come here for caffeine?

402
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,184
Or are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

403
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,610
Mr. Stagg, I wish you would reconsider
our offer for protective custody.

404
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:37,406
Danton Black has proven
he is willing to kill, and he's got...

405
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,534
friends, and trust me,
they're all dangerous.

406
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,203
I've increased my security, detective.

407
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46,957
I hope Black comes looking for trouble,
because he'll find plenty.

408
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:55,090
Spoken like a true philanthropist.
Or is it humanitarian?

409
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,927
Sorry, I can never remember
which one you're pretending to be, Simon.

410
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,889
Harrison.

411
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,724
- Don't get up.
- Ha, ha.

412
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,230
Another fan of yours, doctor?

413
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,065
Can we talk, detective?

414
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,942
So you were right.

415
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,069
Barry's not the only one who's special.

416
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,615
This guy that tried
to kill Simon Stagg today, he could...

417
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,867
Replicate spontaneously.

418
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,410
Yeah, we know.

419
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,622
Did you know about Barry?

420
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,084
When he was first in his coma...

421
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,128
you came to the hospital...

422
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,923
and you asked me
if you could take him to S.T.A.R. Labs.

423
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,301
Did you know what he could do?

424
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,845
- Heh.
- Heh.

425
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:47,100
I had my suspicions that he was...

426
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,186
affected.

427
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,772
- Mm-hm.
- Hey, Joe.

428
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,273
I was never looking to become...

429
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
a senior member
of a secret crime-fighting unit.

430
00:28:55,817 --> 00:29:00,280
You and I both know, we are the only ones
equipped to protect Central City.

431
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,283
Maybe I'm more interested
in protecting Barry.

432
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,119
But he's set to fly into the fire
right along with you.

433
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,412
No, he's not.

434
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,916
Not anymore. He quit. He didn't tell you?

435
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,336
I haven't seen him.

436
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,879
I'm sure it's only temporary.

437
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:19,007
From what I know of Barry,
when he sets his mind to something...

438
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,678
no one's gonna talk him out of it,
but the next time he suits up...

439
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,933
runs headlong into danger, he will fail.

440
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,685
Why?

441
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,354
He doesn't think he's capable.

442
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,481
Doubt...

443
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,359
Is his real enemy, Joe.

444
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,319
Not whatever's lurking out there.

445
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,157
And as long as you continue to doubt him,
he'll keep doubting himself.

446
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,000
And for the record, I care about him too.

447
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,096
Guess you were hungry.

448
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,265
Stress eating.

449
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,186
I came to say I'm sorry.
And you're right, I have been distant.

450
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,606
- Correct.
- Kind of a jerk.

451
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,068
You should apologize more often.
You are sensational at it.

452
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,698
So, what were you gonna tell me
the other day?

453
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,035
I thought I had to do something.
Something I thought was important.

454
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,704
But it turns out that
I'm not very good at it.

455
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,124
But what I am good at is being your friend.

456
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,002
So if you need help
with a new topic for your article...

457
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,088
I found one.
Something that actually interests me.

458
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,716
I know this is gonna sound crazy.

459
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,135
It's been all over the internet this week.

460
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,929
At a building fire. At a bank heist.

461
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,807
When those robbers
shot at the security guard...

462
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,642
he said he was whooshed outside.

463
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,480
- Something out there is saving people.
- I thought you were taking Journalism.

464
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,273
Not Science Fiction Writing.

465
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,276
Since I have known you,
you have believed in the impossible.

466
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,780
What if you were right
about the night that your mom died?

467
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,076
Look, I told you. I'm through.

468
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,580
I know, but you need
to get to S.T.A.R. Labs right now.

469
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,340
- Barry, it's okay.
- It is not okay. Black is here and he's...

470
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,760
just standing there.
That's not him, is it?

471
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,804
It's one of his replicates.

472
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,807
- How did you get it?
- I grew him.

473
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,560
I isolated a sample
of Black's blood from your suit...

474
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,397
to see if I could trigger
the in vitro cultivation process...

475
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,107
and learn how Black multiplies.

476
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:45,278
So I exposed the target cells to a protein
gel and they began replicating into that.

477
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,448
Why doesn't he...? It doing anything?

478
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,452
We did a brain scan. Involuntary motor
functions are active. Little else.

479
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,790
- We think it's acting as a receiver.
- The clones are an empty shell without Black.

480
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,001
Shut down the real Black
and you might shut them all down.

481
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,170
How do we know which one's Black?

482
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,464
That occurred to me
given your passing out.

483
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,468
Black has limits, just like you. Controlling
all of those clones must require...

484
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,971
a tremendous amount
of physical strength.

485
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:15,517
So look for the one showing signs
of weakness or fatigue. He's the prime.

486
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,146
Just a theory, but one you might
want to put to the test, Mr. Allen.

487
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:23,316
I whipped up these high calorie protein
bars for you to keep your metabolism up.

488
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,068
- Unh.
- Aah!

489
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,241
- Any more of them?
- Nope.

490
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,411
- Why did it start moving?
- The prime.

491
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,205
The prime is on the move.
This heard the summons.

492
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,167
And I know where he was summoned to.
Stagg Industries.

493
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,502
You should call it in.

494
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,172
Police can't fight this.

495
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,341
What Black's become, like Mardon...

496
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:52,345
beyond me. Maybe way beyond them too.

497
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:56,183
The only person it's not beyond is you.

498
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,186
You gotta do this. I get it.

499
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:03,190
So for once in your life,
do what I tell you to do.

500
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,150
Go stop him.

501
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,958
Just get me those figures by morning, okay?

502
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,216
Freeze. Don't move!

503
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,737
- Hello, Danton.
- Goodbye, Simon.

504
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,450
Stay here.

505
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:04,960
I know Stagg stole your research, but
that doesn't give you the right to murder.

506
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,643
You think this is about my job?

507
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,438
This is about Elizabeth.

508
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,357
She was my wife.

509
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,778
She had a degenerative coronary disease.

510
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:36,825
She'd been on the transplant list
for years, but time was running out.

511
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,287
- So if I couldn't get her a new heart...
- You were gonna grow her one.

512
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:48,545
I was so close until Stagg stole my
research so he could reap the glory.

513
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,631
And I got to bury my best friend.

514
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,301
Now...

515
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,803
I'm alone.

516
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,536
Remember, Barry. Find the prime.

517
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,330
There's too many of them to fight.

518
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,916
- Barry, you need to isolate the prime.
- I can't.

519
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,335
It's impossible.

520
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,505
Nothing's impossible, Barry.
You taught me that. You can do this.

521
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,882
Barry.

522
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,386
- Barry, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

523
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,222
I'm fine.

524
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,224
It's done.

525
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,483
Hang on.

526
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,610
No.

527
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,866
- Don't.
- Unh!

528
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,532
Central City police officials...

529
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,147
are now confirming
former employee Danton Black...

530
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:59,300
- I tried to save him.
- Doesn't sound like he wanted to be saved.

531
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,095
Some people, when they break...

532
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,306
they can't be put together again.

533
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,017
Some people heal even stronger.

534
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,646
I hope so.

535
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,614
Well, at least Multiplex
won't be able to hurt anyone else.

536
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,617
Told you I'd come up with a cool name.

537
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,915
I may be the one in the suit
doing all the running...

538
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,544
but when I'm out there helping people,
making a difference...

539
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,296
you're all out there with me.

540
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,050
Finally realized something.

541
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,054
We were all struck by that lightning.

542
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,950
Hungry?

543
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,080
Pepperoni. Olives.

544
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,167
And jalapenos. Just like you like it.

545
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,543
Thank you.

546
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,882
You were wrong.

547
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:24,511
I have been wrong a lot this week.
You're gonna have to be specific.

548
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,846
You said that one of the things
driving you...

549
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,183
to run around out there
was that you couldn't help your dad.

550
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,106
You can help him.

551
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,525
We can.

552
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:43,404
We're gonna figure out who or what
killed your mother that night.

553
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:47,075
And then we're gonna
get your father out of prison.

554
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,202
Together.

555
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,001
Joe, what I said about you
not being my father...

556
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,505
Barry, I know. I know I'm not your father.

557
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,384
You're right, you're not.

558
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:10,223
You're just the man
who kept me fed and in clothes...

559
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,769
who sat beside my bed at night until I fell
asleep because I was afraid of the dark...

560
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,772
helped me with my homework.

561
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,317
You taught me how to drive and shave...

562
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,945
and you dropped me off at college.

563
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,575
Sounds a lot like a dad to me.

564
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,844
Every kid dreams of being a superhero.

565
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,596
Having powers. Saving people.

566
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:54,350
But no kid thinks about what it's like when
you're a hero and you're not saving people.

567
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:58,605
Truth is, not much else changes.
You still hurt. You still love.

568
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,608
You still wish, and hope, and fear things.

569
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:07,864
You still need people to help you with all
of it. In some ways, that's the best part.

570
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,993
Barry, an armored car
was just hijacked on Griffen Avenue.

571
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,370
- Get your ass over there.
- I got it.

572
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,331
Actually, the best part, it's this:

573
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,474
Wells. Who the hell let you in here?

574
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,309
You been having a party out there?

575
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:40,897
Oh, I'm sure you saw on TV.
Former employee of mine tried to kill me.

576
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,193
Former employee
with the ability to replicate...

577
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,363
faced off against a man
who could move at super speed.

578
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,990
You've seen him too, haven't you?

579
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,245
- Indeed, I have.
- Extraordinary.

580
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,539
The power he possesses.

581
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:02,835
It's like the... It's like the gods of old.
Like Mercury on Earth.

582
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,631
Can you imagine if you could control
his power, if you could harness it...

583
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,176
you could change
what it means to be human.

584
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:15,181
The man in the red mask is the key.
And I'm gonna get him.

585
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,187
The man in the red mask...

586
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,774
he's called the Flash.

587
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,901
Or at least...

588
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,362
he will be, one day.

589
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,532
What the hell?

590
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,371
Forgive me, Simon.

591
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,541
I'm worried you'll think
this is personal. It's not.

592
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,460
It's just that the man in the red mask...

593
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,213
the fastest man alive...

594
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,048
he must be kept...

595
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,262
safe.

596
00:41:54,286 --> 00:42:02,286
