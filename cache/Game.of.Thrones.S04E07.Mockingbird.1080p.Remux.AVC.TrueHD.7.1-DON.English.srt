JAIME: I made a deal for you,

2
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:58,452
to keep your ungrateful head
on your neck a little while longer.

3
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,162
TYRION: I'm sorry, what am I grateful for?

4
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:04,208
The opportunity to live and die at the Wall
as punishment for a crime I did not commit?

5
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,419
You threw your life away.

6
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,629
It's not a joke.
You understand that, don't you?

7
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:11,882
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

8
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:20,641
I couldn't listen to her
standing there, telling her lies.

9
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,518
I couldn't do it.

10
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:24,979
You fell in love with a whore.

11
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,606
Yes.

12
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,609
And I was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

13
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,117
That deal you made,

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,994
it was everything Father wanted.

15
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,831
You do see that? He gets you back as his heir.

16
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,000
The future Lord of the Rock.

17
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,754
And he ships me off to Castle Black,
out of sight at last.

18
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,174
All so perfect.

19
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,346
It felt good to take that from him.

20
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,851
He knows I'm innocent
and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.

21
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,061
He's willing to sacrifice any of us.

22
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,145
Not you.

23
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,482
You're the golden son.

24
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,650
You could kill a king, lose a hand,

25
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,903

you'll always be the golden son.

26

Careful.

27
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,282
I'm the last friend you've got.

28
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,955
At least I got to tell them what they really are.

29

Yes, brilliant speech.

30
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,543
They'll be talking about it for days to come.

31
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,879
I thought you were a realist.

32
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,799
Didn't realise you'd die for pride.

33
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,093
Don't give up on me just yet.

34
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:42,014
I survived one trial by combat,
even though you weren't there to save me.

35
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,266
I can't save you this time either.

36

I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.

37

Where's your sense of adventure?

38
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:58,739
Even if you lose, imagine the look
on Father's face when you fall.

If he wins,

00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,565
I expect I'll be in his debt
for the rest of my life.

on naming as a champion?

50
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,831
I'd enjoy watching Bronn
disembowel that pompous child beater.

Could be food.

168
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,077
The Night's Watch has defended her
for thousands of years.

169
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,122
And in all those centuries,
we have never sealed the tunnel.

170
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,416
Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser?

171
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,627
I have.

172
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,420
The tunnel's gate won't stop them.

173
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,923
The bars on those gates are four inches thick.

174
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,466
Cold-rolled steel.

175
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,509
And they won't stop them.

176
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,014
Remind me which order you belong to,
Lord Snow.

177
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,766
The stewards.

178
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,936
Are the stewards responsible
for maintaining the tunnel?

179
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,355
No.

180
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,898
Who would that be?

181
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,985
- The builders.
- Ah, the builders.

182
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,196
First Builder Yarwyck,

183
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,783
Lord Snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel,

184
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:07,621
leaving us unable to carry out our duties
as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch.

185
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,957
Do you agree with him?

186
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:19,967
No.

187
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,805
ALLISER: Given your deep knowledge
of the wildling army, Lord Snow,

188
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:29,935
you and Tarly will take night duties
atop the Wall until the full moon.

189
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,062
(MEN LAUGHING)

190
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,398
Moving on.

191
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:38,068
First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch
brought atop the Wall.

192
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,152
YARWYCK: Aye.

00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,159
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

196
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,928
My lord.

197
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,182
You have new clothes.

198
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,101
Do you like 'em? Eh?

199
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,938
Gloves are doeskin.

200
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,356
Softer than a virgin's thighs.

201
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,233
I sent for you days ago.

202
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,485
- I've been a bit busy.
- Doing what?

203
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,116
My lonesome bachelor days are over.

204
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,953
I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.

205
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,540
Lollys Stokeworth?

206
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,252
She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.

207
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,047
I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.

208
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,506
She's dim-witted.

209
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,341
If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.

210
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,136
When my sister arranged this love match,

211
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,264
did she mention
that Lollys has an older sister?

212
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,058
Falyse.

213
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,726
Aye, I did know.

214
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,644
And you understand the rules of inheritance?

215
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,188
Falyse is 40 and barren.

216
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,691
She still gets Castle Stokeworth
when her father dies.

217
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,026
She does.

218
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,612
Unless she happens to perish
before her father.

219
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,822
Then Lollys gets the castle.

220
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,620
What? Ladies fall from their horses
and snap their pretty necks all the time.

221
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,081
You and my sister deserve each other.

222
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,167
Why did you bother to come here?

223
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:28,261
You once said if anyone ever asked me
to sell you out, you'd double their price.

224
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,222
Is it two wives you want or two castles?

225
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,306
One of each will do.

226
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,228
But if you want me
to kill the Mountain for you,

227
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,771
it'd better be a damn big castle.

228
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,900
I'm a bit short on castles at the moment.
But I can offer you gold and gratitude.

229
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,777
I have gold.

230
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,112
What can I buy with gratitude?

231
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,197
You might be surprised.

232
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,616
A Lannister always pays his debts.

233
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,034
Your sister's a Lannister, too.

234
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,286
My wife is heir to Winterfell.

235
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,499
If I emerge from this
with my head still on my shoulders,

236
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,544
I may one day rule the North in her name.

237
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,797
I could carve you out a big piece of it.

238
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,799
If and may and could.

239
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,677
It's bloody cold up north.

240
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,638
Lollys is soft and warm. And close.

241
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,476
If I gave you the choice between
fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain,

242
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,895
you'd have your britches down
and your cock out before I could blink.

243
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,564
Does he frighten you so much?

244
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,941
I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me.

245
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,318
He's freakish big and strong.

246
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,487
And quicker than you'd expect
for a man of that size.

247
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,241
Maybe I could take him,

248
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,327
dance around
until he's so tired of hacking at me,

249
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,664
he dropped his sword,
get him off his feet somehow.

250
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,833
But one misstep

251
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,376
and I'm dead.

252
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,879
Why should I risk it?

253
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:45,922
Because you're my friend.

254
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,966
Aye, I'm your friend.

255
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,303
And when have you ever risked your life
for me?

256
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,315
I like you,

257
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,567
pampered little shit that you are.

258
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,027
I just like myself more.

259
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,945
I understand.

260
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,530
I'm sorry it has to be this way.

261
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,282
Why are you sorry?

262
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,286
Because you're an evil bastard
with no conscience and no heart?

263
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:20,123
That's what I liked about you in the first place.

264
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,589
We had some good days together.

265
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,299
Yes, we did.

266

(BANGS ON DOOR)

267
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,607
What will you do?

268
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,069
I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself.

269
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,657
Won't that make for a great song?

270
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,496
I hope to hear them sing it one day.

(BIRD SCREECHING)

272
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,848
How did you get in here?

273
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,517
Your door is well guarded,

274
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,477
but your window is not.

275
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,070
I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.

276
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,115
Don't do that again.

277
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,202
Never met a woman
who didn't like wildflowers.

278
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,121
These are my private quarters.

279
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,540
If I want you here, I will summon you.

280
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,961
Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.

281
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,553
Tell me why you're here.

282
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,391
I came to ask a favour.

283
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,478
I only have two talents in this world.

284
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,063
War and women.

285
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,818
You are staying here in Meereen to rule.
That is a wise decision. I respect it.

286
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,070
But here in Meereen,
I cannot pursue my talents.

287
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,699
I've ordered the Second Sons to
patrol the streets to stop the revenge killings.

288
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,326
You've ordered us to be night watchmen.

289
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,745
And as for women,

290
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,165
there are thousands in Meereen
you can pursue.

291
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,959
There is only one,

292
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,503
and she does not want me.

293
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,548
You swore me your sword.

294
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,009
My sword is yours till the day I die.

295
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,721
So if I command you to stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets?

296
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,724
I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets.

You could never.

308

I just wanted to speak with you before we left.

309
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,507
Could you bring me that vial over there?

310
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,387
The blue one.

311
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,016
No, not that one.

312
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,394
You don't even want to touch that one.

313
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,020
Next to it.

314

(INHALES)

316
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,629
When I looked into the flames this morning,
the Lord spoke to me.

317
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,840
He said,

318
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:43,845
"Tonight, you will have your last good bath
in a long while.

319
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,555
"Make it count."

320
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,019
- A joke.
- (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

321
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,646
Not a very good one, I'm afraid.

322
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,772
It was. I...

323
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,359
Humour isn't my strength.

324
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:02,530
That's because most jokes are lies
and you're devoted to the truth.

325
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,950
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

326
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,702
Not always.

327
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,715
Most of these powders and potions

328
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,799
are lies.

329
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,929
Deceptions to make men think
they witnessed our Lord's power.

330
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:30,350
Once they step into his light,
they will see the lie for what it was,

331
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,936
a trick that led them to the truth.

332
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,522
A pinch of this powder in a bonfire

333
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:39,150
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

334
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,153
And this one creates a black smoke

335
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,447
that will make the bravest man
piss himself with fear.

336
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:49,953
And a drop of this in any man's wine
will drive him wild with lust.

337
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,708
Did you use it with Stannis?

338
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,834
No.

339
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,839
Don't be upset.

340
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,300
Men never crave what they already have.

341
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,637
It's only flesh.

342
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,057
It needs what it needs.

343
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:19,691
No act done in service of the Lord
can ever be called a sin.

344
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:24,070
I thank God every day for bringing you to us.

345
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,905
And Stannis to you.

346
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:30,368
He wants to bring Shireen with us.

347
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,497
I think that would be ill-advised.

348
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:39,335
My daughter has heretical tendencies,
as you're well aware.

349
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,714
I don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

350
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,883
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

351
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,016
I understand how you feel.

352
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,185
But that is impossible.

353
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,398
Why?

354
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,486
You don't need powders and potions,
my queen.

355
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,947
You don't need lies.

356
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:12,910
You are strong enough to look into
the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.

357
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,960
However harsh it is.

358
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:23,463
However hard for us to understand.

359
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,051
You don't need my help,
but I will need yours soon.

360
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:32,430
When we set sail,
your daughter must be with us.

361
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,935
The Lord needs her.

362
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,862
Jorah the Andal.

363
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,574
Are you here to see our queen?

364
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,036
She's in a good mood.

365
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,761
Khaleesi.

366
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,971
- You're here early.
- Later than some.

367
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,185
- You don't approve?
- It's not a question of approval,

368
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,770
it's a question of trust.

369
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,522
You neither approve nor trust.

370
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,399
Why would I? The man's a sellsword.

371
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,985
Didn't you fight for the Golden Company
before pledging your sword to my brother?

372
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,570
I did.

373
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,780
I trust you.

374
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,366
Daario Naharis killed his captains

375
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,703
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

376
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,705
How could you ever have faith
in a man like that?

377
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,125
I could never have faith in a man like Daario.

378
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,295
That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons
to retake Yunkai.

379
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,842
- You have?
- I have.

380
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,885
Without you there to rule, Khaleesi,

381
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,221
I fear the masters will simply bide their time,

382
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,557
wait for the invaders to leave
and reassert control.

383
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,394
That is why I've ordered Daario
to execute every master in Yunkai.

384
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:05,690
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

385
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,151
They mutilate little boys by the thousands.

386
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,653
They train little girls
in the art of pleasuring old men.

387
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,698
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

388
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:17,160
Herding the masters into pens
and slaughtering them by the thousands

389
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,328
is also treating men like beasts.

390
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:23,750
The slaves you freed,
brutality is all they've ever known.

391
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,209
If you want them to know something else,

392
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,086
you'll have to show it to them.

393
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,923
And repay the slavers with what? Kindness?
A fine? A stern warning?

394
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,760
It's tempting to see
your enemies as evil, all of them,

395
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,471
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every war ever fought.

396
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:39,223
Let the priests argue over good and evil.

397
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,017
Slavery is real.

398
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,935
I can end it. I will end it,

399
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,396
and those behind it.

400
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,940
I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.

401
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:53,237
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

402
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,740
I wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

403
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,576
what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.

404
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,209
The man who came to me the other day
about burying his father.

405
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,669
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

406
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:13,466
He will accompany the Second Sons
and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.

407
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,302
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

408
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,889
He will explain
the choice they have before them.

409
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:24,769
They can live in my new world
or they can die in their old one.

410
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,776
Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves.

411
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,236
Tell him I changed my mind.

412
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,905
Yes, Khaleesi.

413
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,453
No.

414
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,626
Tell him you changed my mind.

415
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,889
HOUND: (GRUNTS) Rat cunts.

416
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,102
Fucking whore.

417
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:09,105
You're doing it wrong.

418
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,567
You need to burn away that horrible bit there.

419
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,111
Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester.

420
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,283
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right...

421
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,076
No fire.

422
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:24,996
It'll only take a second.

423
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,207
- It won't hurt that much.
- No fire!

424
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,599
Shut up about it.

425
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:49,812
About everything.

426
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:54,525
Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver
anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.

427
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,821
Which is everywhere between
where we are now and where we're going.

428
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,661
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

429
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:10,082
getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.

430
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,879
No reward is worth this much trouble.

431
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,798
Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

432
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,770
You say your brother gave you that sword.

433
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,358
My brother gave me this.

434
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,528
It was just like you said a while back.

435
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:44,367
Pressed me to the fire like
I was a nice juicy mutton chop.

436
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,246
Why?

437
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,207
Thought I stole one of his toys.

438
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,542
I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it.

439
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,591
The pain was bad.

440
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,426
The smell was worse.

441
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,434
But the worst thing was that
it was my brother who did it.

442
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,191
My father, who protected him,

443
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,904
told everyone my bedding caught fire.

444
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,961
You think you're on your own?

445
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:43,634
Let me wash it out
and help you sew it up at least.

446
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,621
BRIENNE: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.

447
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,082
We've been sleeping in ditches
the last few weeks.

448
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:18,169
I think we can treat ourselves to
a featherbed for the night

449
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,504
and a hot meal not cooked by you.

450
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:21,881
Couldn't agree more, my lady.

451
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,341
Just don't start expecting silk underclothes.

452
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,635
- Not working for your former lord any longer.
- Yes, my lady.

453
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,138
Don't get drunk.

454
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:31,557
No, my lady.

455
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,975
HOT PIE: Can I get you anything else?

456
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,852
No, this will do nicely, thank you.

457
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,312
Kidney pie is wonderful.

458
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,314
Thanks.

459
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,524
I do my best.

460
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,487
A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.

461
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,823
Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.

462
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,742
Easy enough. But the meat,

463
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,578
peacetime or not, getting your hands on
a good bottom round steak

464
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,288
and calves' kidneys is not easy.

465
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:57,083
I mean,
some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.

466
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,794
Got no right to cook anything, them.
Oh, and the gravy.

467
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,630
Don't get me started on the gravy.

468
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:04,131
Very difficult to get right.

469
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,966
See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.

470
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,177
You cannot give up.

471
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,720
No gravy, no pie.

472
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,555
Simple as that.

473
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,643
That's nice armour. Are you a knight?

474
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,188
No.

475
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,399
Oh, it's just people with armour
are usually knights.

476
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,027
Generally speaking.
From King's Landing, though, aren't you?

477
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,947
From there myself originally.
Flea Bottom born and bred.

478
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,199
What brings you to these parts?

479
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:31,742
We're looking for someone.

480
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:34,286
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

481
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,622
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17...

482
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,791
A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.

483
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:42,044
Her name is Sansa Stark,
but she may be using a different name.

484
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,296
Starks?

485
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,844
What, like them lot from "Winterhell"?

486
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,850
No, ain't seen anyone like that.

487
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,393
I heard they was all traitors.

488
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,812
Don't need no traitors in here.

489
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,149
I pledged my life to their mother
Catelyn Stark.

490
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,234
I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.

491
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,700
Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?

492
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,258
- What?
- It's nothing, my lady.

493
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,720
You wouldn't be screwing your face up
like that if it was nothing.

494
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,972
Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't.

495
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,765
You're not interesting enough to be offensive.

496
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,604
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.

497
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,647
The Lannisters have money.

498
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,691
People kill for money.

499
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:50,112
I don't think we should be telling people
we're searching for Lady Sansa.

500
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:03,042
My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?

501
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:06,629
- What about? Not kidney pie.
- You seem like a proper lady.

502
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,839
Someone who could be trusted.

503
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,968
I never met no Sansa Stark.

504
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,262
But I know her sister.

505
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:16,972
Arya.

506
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:23,354
No one's seen Arya Stark
since her father was beheaded.

507
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:25,231
She's presumed dead.

508
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,608
She weren't when I last spoke to her.

509
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,194
- When was that?
- Heading up north with the Night's Watch.

510
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,946
She was all dressed up as a boy.

511
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,531
Like your ladyship, only without the armour.

512
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,492
Going by the name Arry.

513
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,202
- So what happened to her?
- Well...

514
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,495
The quick version.

515
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,623
The Lannisters took us prisoner.

516
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,917
We escaped.

517
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,962
The Brotherhood took us prisoner.
They sold me to the innkeep.

518
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,840
They were gonna sell Arya to her mother
at Riverrun along with another prisoner.

519
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:55,761
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham.

520
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,721
- Not friendly.
- The Hound.

521
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,099
That's the one.

522
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,435
If you find her, could you give her this?

523
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,064
She liked the last one I gave her,
but, well, this one turned out better.

524
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,200
Um...

525
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,202
You were saying?

526
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:26,458
BRIENNE: Her mother's dead,
grandfather's dead,

527
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,961
Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.

528
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,504
The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.

529
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,423
They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.

530
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,633
Why the Eyrie?

531
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,719
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

532
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,471
Catelyn Stark's sister.

533
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:42,725
She's Arya's last living relative with money.

534
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,060
She hates the Lannisters.

535
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,065
Lord Tyrion made sure
I knew which house married which

536
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,067
and who hated who.

537
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,820
BRIENNE: Sansa could be there, too.

538
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,906
PODRICK: Could be.

539
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:06,332
You sure about this?

540
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,253
No.

541
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,230
(DOOR OPENS)

542
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:45,454
I imagined
you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.

543
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:50,042
I did spend some time with
an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.

544
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,587
Mmm. Do tell.

545
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,841
I've got every kind of filth down here
except the kind I like.

546
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,843
Your sister.

547
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:01,970
Oh.

548
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,979
Cersei approached me.

549
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,149
We spoke a great deal about her daughter.

550
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:17,319
How worried your sister is about her.

551
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,990
She was trying very hard to pretend
she had not come to sway me against you.

552
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,701
I think she may have even believed it herself.

553
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:29,998
Making honest feelings do dishonest work
is one of her many gifts.

554
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:33,001
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

555
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,590
It is rare to meet a Lannister

556
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:42,511
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

557
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,598
She desperately wants to see you killed.

558
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,560
She didn't need to bother you.

559
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:52,646
It looks as though
I've taken care of that myself.

560
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,776
The joy she will feel when
my head leaves my neck.

561
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:01,029
She's wanted this for a long time.

562
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,949
Yes, I know.

563
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,952
We met, you and I.

564
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,662
Many years ago.

565
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,623
I think I would have remembered that.

566
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:15,002
Unlikely. You had just been born.

567
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:21,717
Our father brought me and my sister Elia
with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.

568
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,886
My first time away from Dorne.

569
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,138
I didn't like anything about the Rock.

570
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,393
Not the food, not the weather,
not your accents.

571
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:32,978
Nothing.

572
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,232
But the biggest disappointment,

573
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,234
you.

574
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,406
You and my family have more in common
than you might admit.

575
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:48,452
The whole way from Dorne
all anyone talked about was

576
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,581
the monster that had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

577
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,542
A head twice the size of his body,

578
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,336
a tail between his legs,

579
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,546
claws, one red eye,

580
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,508
the privates of both a girl and a boy.

581
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,843
That would have made things so much easier.

582
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:08,263
When we met your sister,
she promised she would show you to us.

583
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:12,434
Every day we would ask.
Every day she would say, "Soon."

584
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,355
Then she and your brother

585
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,898
took us to your nursery and...

586
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,612
...she unveiled the freak.

587
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:29,535
Your head was a bit large,
your arms and legs were a bit small,

588
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:31,870
but no claw.

589
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,456
No red eye. No tail between your legs.

590
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,125
Just a tiny pink cock.

591
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:42,256
We didn't try to hide our disappointment.
"That's not a monster," I told Cersei.

592
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,509
"That's just a baby."

593
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,721
And she said, "He killed my mother."

594
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:54,059
And she pinched your little cock so hard,
I thought she might pull it off.

595
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,186
Until your brother made her stop.

596
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,689
"It doesn't matter," she told us.

597
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,899
"Everyone says he will die soon.

598
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,818
"I hope they are right.

599
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,362
"He should not have lived this long."

600
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,867
Well, (SNIFFLES)

601
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:18,166
Sooner or later,
Cersei always gets what she wants.

602
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:23,755
And what about what I want?

603
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,676
Justice

604
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:31,305
for my sister and her children.

605
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,432
If you want justice,

606
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:36,268
you've come to the wrong place.

607
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,478
I disagree.

608
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,864
I've come to the perfect place.

609
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,118
I want to bring those who have wronged me
to justice.

610
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,079
And all those who have wronged me
are right here.

611
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,001
I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane,

612
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,629
who killed my sister's children

613
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:07,090
and then raped her
with their blood still on his hands

614
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,885
before killing her, too.

615
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,604
I will be your champion.

616
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,482
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

617
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,952
Hello, Robin.

618
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,205
What are you doing?

619
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:23,250
I'm building my home, Winterfell.

620
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:27,337
At least I think I am.
I haven't been back there in a very long time.

621
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:29,756
Why did you leave?

622
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,300
It's a long story.

623
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:34,803
I stay here in the Eyrie.

624
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,889
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads
and I have to keep myself safe

625
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,725
because I'm the Lord of the Vale

626
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:42,144
and a very important person.

627
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:44,479
Yes, you certainly are.

628
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,815
When will you go back?

629
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,776
Probably never.

630
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,947
My family doesn't live there any more
and someone burned it down.

631
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:56,825
Oh.

632
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,162
Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?

633
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,621
No, I'm afraid not.

634
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:03,749
It's not high up in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

635
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,917
- That sounds dangerous.
- (CHUCKLES)

636
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,420
- How do you make people fly?
- We don't.

637
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,005
What do you do with all the bad people

638
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,507
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

639
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:14,551
I never did anything with them at all.

640
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,762
Girls didn't take part in that
where I came from.

641
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:20,140
Well, I'm Lord of the Vale.

642
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,727
When I grow up,
I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.

643
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,771
Or you. When we get married,

644
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,773
you can tell me if you don't like somebody

645
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:29,900
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

646
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:31,610
Right through the Moon Door.

647
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:35,280
I like the sound of that.

648
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,073
Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.

649
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:38,450
All right.

650
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,745
- It can go in here in this big tower.
- Be careful.

651
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:44,289
You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to
rebuild the whole thing.

652
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,707
- I didn't ruin it.
- You did.

653
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,709
It was already ruined
because it didn't have a Moon Door.

654
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,462
- I was fixing it.
- Knocking things down isn't fixing them.

655
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,088
- It's ruining them.
- I didn't ruin it!

656
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:54,174
- You're being stupid.
- I didn't ruin it!

657
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:57,344
(GRUNTING)

658
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,388

00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,390

660

- (SOBBING)
- Robin, I'm sorry, I...

661
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:10,565
LITTLEFINGER: Children.

662
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,446
- I hit him.
- Yes, I saw.

663
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,449
- I shouldn't have done that.
- No.

664
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,786
His mother should have, a long time ago.

665
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:27,040
Consider it a step in the right direction.

666
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,876
If he tells Aunt Lysa...

667
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,212
Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.

668
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,174
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

669
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,970
I'll never see it again.

670
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:44,349
A lot can happen between now and never.

671
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,937
If you want to build a better home,

672
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,857
first you must demolish the old one.

673
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,528
Why did you really kill Joffrey?

674
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,868
Tell me why.

675
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:11,126
I loved your mother
more than you could ever know.

676
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:14,754
Given the opportunity,

677
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:18,133
what do we do to
those who've hurt the ones we love?

678
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,685
In a better world,

679
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:34,482
one where love could
overcome strength and duty,

680
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,278
you might have been my child.

681
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,783
But we don't live in that world.

682
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,714
You're more beautiful than she ever was.

683
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,009
Lord Baelish...

684
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,969
Call me Petyr.

685
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:30,163
(WIND WHISTLING)

686
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,457
You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?

687
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,211
Come here, Sansa.

688
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,560
Do you know how far the fall is?

689
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:55,563
No.

690
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:58,191
Neither do I, precisely.

691
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,402
Hundreds of feet.

692
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,654
It's fascinating

693
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,282
what happens to bodies when
they hit the rocks from such a height.

694
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:08,576
The impact breaks them right apart.

695
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,871
Like eggs dropped on the floor.

696
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:14,374
Sometimes pieces remain intact.

697
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,335
You'll find the head sitting on its own.

698
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:19,462
Every hair in place.

699
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:22,298
Blue eyes staring at nothing.

700
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:33,935
I know what you did.

701
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,731
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

702
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,983
I never should have hit Robin.

703
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,360
- I promise it won't happen...
- Don't be coy with me, you little whore.

704
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:44,863
You kissed Petyr.

705
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,240
- I didn't. You don't understand.
- I saw you.

706
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:50,452
You can't lie to me
because I saw it with my own eyes.

707
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,912
- He kissed me. I pulled away.
- Liar! Whore!

708
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:55,290
- (WHIMPERING)
- He is mine!

709
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,959
My father, my husband, my sister,

710
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,086
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

711
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:04,049
That's what happens to people
who stand between Petyr and me.

712
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,717
Look down!

713
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,054
- Look down!
- LITTLEFINGER: Lysa!

714
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,017
Let her go.

715
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,813
You want her?

716
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,734
This empty-headed child?

717
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:23,818
Let her go.

718
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:27,155
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

719
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:31,409
I lied for you. I killed for you.

720
00:48:31,493 --> 00:48:34,579
- Why did you bring her here?
- I'll send her away.

721
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,751
I swear on my life.

722
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,421
I swear to all the gods.

723
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,424
Let her go, Lysa.
