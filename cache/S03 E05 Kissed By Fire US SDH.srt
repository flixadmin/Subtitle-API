00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09,801
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,200
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

3
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,707
Lord, cast your light
upon us.

4
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,835
Men:
Lord of Light, defend us.

5
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,798
Show us the truth.

6
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,175
Strike this man down
if he is guilty.

7
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,594
Give strength to his sword
if he is true.

8
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,682
<i>Lord of Light,</i>
<i>give us wisdom.</i>

9
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,273
For the night is dark

10
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,899
and full of terrors.

11
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,652
Men:
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

12
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,935
( shouts )

13
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,852
( screams )

14
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,361
Get back.

15
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,265
( men chanting )
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

16
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,977
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.

17
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,562
Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty.

18
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,649
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.

19
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,317
Kill him!

20
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,861
( chanting continues )

21
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,532
( shouts )

22
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,869
( chanting stops )

23
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,046
Lord, cast your light
upon this man, your servant.

24
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,548
Bring him back
from death and darkness.

25
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,966
His flame has been
extinguished.

26
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,843
- Restore it.
- ( shouting )

27
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,428
Thoros:
<i>For the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

28
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,722
-<i> Lord, cast...</i>
<i>- Arya, don't!</i>

29
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,016
Bring him back
from death and darkness...

30
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,684
No!

31
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,562
Let go of me!
Let me go!

32
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,982
Looks like their god
likes me more than
your butcher's boy.

33
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,608
Burn in hell!

34
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,610
Beric:
<i>He will.</i>

35
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,075
But not today.

36
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,852
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

37
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,396
Tell me what you know.

38
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,148
There are four
to a patrol--

39
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,067
two builders to check
for structural damage,

40
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,485
two rangers to watch
for enemies.

41
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,612
How often do these
patrols go out?

42
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,865
It varies.

43
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,284
If I knew where on
the Wall we were heading,
I could tell you.

44
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,661
You'd like to know that.

45
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,208
There are 19 castles
guarding the Wall.

46
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,212
How many are manned?

47
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,547
Three.

48
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,092
You sure of that?

49
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,387
Which three?

50
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,641
Castle Black.

51
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,559
Aye, Castle Black.

52
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,645
Everyone knows
Castle Black.

53
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,563
Which others?

54
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,238
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

55
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,157
and the Shadow Tower.

56
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,495
How many men remain
in Castle Black?

57
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,163
- 1,000.
- Liar.

58
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,084
What happens to your eagle
after I kill you?

59
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,962
Does he drift
away like a kite
with his strings cut

60
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,339
or does he just flop
dead to the ground?

61
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,966
He's no crow.

62
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,260
Just 'cause you
want him inside you
don't make him one of us.

63
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,762
I'm not afraid of you.

64
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,979
I like you, boy.

65
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,898
But if you lie to me,

66
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,068
I'll pull your guts out
through your throat.

67
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,656
1,000 men.

68
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,747
We'll find out soon enough.

69
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,131
I don't need you
to protect me.

70
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,966
Of course you do.

71
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,510
Who stopped Rattleshirt
when he was about to cut
your throat?

72
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,346
Who vouched for you
with Mance?

73
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,473
It seems
you owe me a debt.

74
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,269
- Give it back.
- Well, I stole it.

75
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,898
It's mine.
If you want it,
come steal it back.

76
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,693
<i>Ygritte!</i>

77
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,946
<i>Ygritte!</i>

78
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,244
Ygritte!
Seven hells.

79
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,496
<i>Ygritte!</i>

80
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,252
Is Orell right?

81
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,129
Are you still a crow?

82
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,051
It's time you
proved yourself.

83
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,928
Ygritte.

84
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,472
You swore some vows.

85
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,515
I want you to break 'em.

86
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,854
I want you to see me.

87
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,651
All of me.

88
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,791
We shouldn't.

89
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,045
We should.

90
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,939
( breathing heavily )

91
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,276
Why are you
still dressed?

92
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,611
You know nothing,
Jon Sno--

93
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,240
( moaning )

94
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,795
That thing you did

95
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,672
with your mouth--

96
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,176
is that what lords
do to their ladies
in the South?

97
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,345
I don't know.

98
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,139
I just wanted to kiss
you there is all.

99
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,515
Hmm.

100
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,267
You seemed to like it.

101
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,769
Aye, I liked it some.

102
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,479
Who taught you that?

103
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,274
There's been no one else.
Only you.

104
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,151
A maid.

105
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,944
You were a maid.

106
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,989
I was a man
of the Night's Watch.

107
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,076
How about you?
Were you a maid?

108
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,328
What do you think?

109
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,414
- Who was he?
- Just a boy.

110
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,916
He came trading
with his brothers.

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,086
He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire.

112
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,005
But...

113
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,674
he was weak.

114
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,301
Not like you.

115
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,178
That was the first one.

116
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,305
Then there was
this Thenn boy.

117
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,641
Spoke no Common, but gods,
he was built like a mammoth.

118
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,770
Yeah, thanks.
I think I've heard enough.

119
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,524
We'd best get back.

120
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,860
Tormund--

121
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,406
I'm not done
with you yet.

122
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,665
How long's it been
since you had a bath?

123
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,600
Let's not go back.

124
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,479
Let's stay here
a while longer.

125
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,068
I don't ever want
to leave this cave,
Jon Snow.

126
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,280
Not ever.

127
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,084
Hound:
<i>I want my gold.</i>

128
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,836
Thoros:
It says it clearly
right there on that note

129
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,421
you'll be repaid in full
when the war is over.

130
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,714
Piss on that!
You're nothing but thieves.

131
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,967
We're outlaws.
Outlaws steal.

132
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,427
You're lucky
we didn't kill you.

133
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,719
Come try it, archer.

134
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,513
I'll shove those arrows
up your ass.

135
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,515
You can't let him go.
He's a murderer.
He's guilty.

136
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,934
- Not in the eyes of god.
- You can't!

137
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,146
Enough! The judgment
isn't ours to make.

138
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,693
Go in peace,
Sandor Clegane.

139
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,611
The Lord of Light
isn't done with you yet.

140
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,786
Man:
<i>Riders coming through!</i>

141
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,789
( horses neighing )

142
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,756
The Kingslayer.

143
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,841
Down!

144
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,135
On your knees.

145
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,221
Lord Bolton, I give you
the Kingslayer.

146
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,806
( groans )

147
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,808
Pick him up, Locke.

148
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,774
You've lost a hand.

149
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,986
No, my lord,
he has it here.

150
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,991
- Take this away.
- Send it to his father?

151
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,202
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

152
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,872
Cut her free.
Apologies, my lady.

153
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,041
You're under
my protection now.

154
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,502
Thank you, my lord.

155
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,007
Find suitable rooms
for our guests.

156
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,593
We'll speak later.

157
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,763
Lord Bolton.

158
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,602
Is there word
from the capital?

159
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,438
You haven't heard?

160
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,692
Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to King's Landing.

161
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,195
<i>Sailed into Blackwater Bay.</i>

162
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,365
<i>Stormed the gates</i>
<i>with thousands of men.</i>

163
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,409
And your sister...

164
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,875
How can I put this?

165
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,796
Your sister...

166
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,383
is alive and well.

167
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,177
Your father's forces
prevailed.

168
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,889
Ser Jaime isn't well.

169
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,267
Take him to Qyburn.

170
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,407
( winces )

171
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,367
( groans )

172
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,163
- Will I die?
- No.

173
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,498
The corruption
has spread.

174
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,667
I fear it must
be cut away.

175
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,753
The safest course
would be to take
the whole arm off.

176
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,131
Then you'll die.

177
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,218
You're no maester.

178
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,929
Where's your chain?

179
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,098
The Citadel
stripped me of it.

180
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,435
They found some
of my experiments

181
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,312
too bold.

182
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,982
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

183
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,736
I don't need my right hand
to kill you.

184
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,448
I can take away
the rotting flesh

185
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,075
and try and burn out
the corruption

186
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,328
- with boiling wine.
- Mmm.

187
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,455
With any luck,
that will suffice.

188
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,957
You'll need
milk of the poppy.

189
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,377
- No milk of the poppy.
- There will be pain.

190
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,547
- I'll scream.
- Quite a bit of pain.

191
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,591
I'll scream loudly.

192
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,144
( groans )

193
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,647
<i>( scissors snipping )</i>

194
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,191
( groans )

195
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,193
( breathing heavily )

196
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,288
( screams )

197
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,669
Lord Baelish.

198
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,337
Your Grace.

199
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,464
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

200
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,007
Of course, Your Grace.

201
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,550
I have reason to believe
that House Tyrell

202
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,552
do not hold the crown's
best interests at heart.

203
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,973
I see. And have you
shared these suspicions
with Lord Tywin?

204
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,060
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

205
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,604
Myself, I often
find them a hindrance.

206
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,899
And he appreciates those
who aid his family,
as you well know.

207
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,484
He's almost as generous
to those who help us

208
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,696
as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.

209
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,156
You have a good
working relationship
with the Tyrells.

210
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,243
I thought you might
look into it before
you leave the capital.

211
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,203
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

212
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,998
And your best will prove
better than when I asked
you to locate Arya Stark?

213
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,625
I assure you
that it will.

214
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,716
<i>( liquid pouring )</i>

215
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,218
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

216
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,761
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

217
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,013
Are there any figs?
Fetch some.

218
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,057
I always take figs
midafternoon.

219
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,559
They help move the bowels.

220
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,477
To what do I owe
this summons?

221
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,563
Thank you for seeing me,
my lady.

222
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,898
I had hoped
we might discuss
a few financial matters.

223
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,902
I climbed all
those steps to discuss
financial matters?

224
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,279
It's the royal wedding.

225
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,655
I'm told you had a hand
in planning it.

226
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,990
Naturally.

227
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,242
It's shaping up to be
a very involved affair.

228
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,411
The word extravagant
has been used.

229
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,246
What good
is the word extravagant

230
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,665
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

231
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,584
- I understand that.
- Good.

232
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,378
But, as Master of Coin,
it falls upon me

233
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,921
to calculate the cost
for the crown.

234
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,507
As of now,
it's a huge expense.

235
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,508
And?

236
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,345
And we're at war,
Lady Olenna.

237
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,598
Oh, I'd nearly
forgotten.

238
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,224
Yes, and maintaining
supply lines--

239
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,934
<i>I can't think</i>
<i>how it slipped my mind.</i>

240
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,437
What is it,
12,000 infantrymen

241
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,314
<i>the Tyrell family</i>
<i>has supplied?</i>

242
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,691
1,800 mounted lances.

243
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,610
<i>2,000 in support.</i>

244
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,780
Provisions so this city
might survive the winter.

245
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,656
<i>A million bushels</i>
<i>of wheat.</i>

246
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,076
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

247
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,037
<i>20,000 head of cattle.</i>

248
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,622
<i>50,000 sheep.</i>

249
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,124
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

250
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,876
I'm quite familiar
with them.

251
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,961
And we are so grateful
for your contributions

252
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,297
which are necessary
for the preservation
of the realm.

253
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,341
As is a royal wedding.

254
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,885
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

255
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,553
They crave distractions.

256
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,598
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

257
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,476
And their distractions
are likely to end

258
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,603
with us being torn
to pieces.

259
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,939
<i>A royal wedding</i>
<i>is much safer.</i>

260
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,192
- Wouldn't you say?
- I would.

261
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,194
<i>And traditionally</i>
<i>paid for</i>

262
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,196
- by the royal family.
-<i> ( door opens )</i>

263
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,158
I was told you were
drunk, impertinent,

264
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,118
and thoroughly debauched.

265
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,829
You can imagine
my disappointment

266
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,498
at finding nothing
but a browbeaten
bookkeeper.

267
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,169
Where did you go
for them, Volantis?

268
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,172
- My lady--
- Oh, very well.

269
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,258
I won't have it said
that House Tyrell

270
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,676
refuses to play
its part.

271
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,553
We'll pay for half
the expenses

272
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,847
and the celebrations
will go on as planned.

273
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,849
- Is that sufficient?
- Quite sufficient.
Thank you.

274
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,434
Very good, then.
That's settled.
Good day.

275
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,606
Give me that.

276
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,154
Arya:
<i>What are you doing?</i>

277
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,283
Just mending
Lord Beric's armor.

278
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,368
Why?

279
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,787
I'm going to stay on
and smith for the Brotherhood.

280
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,664
Have you lost your mind?

281
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,959
When the Lannisters
find this place, you think
they'll spare the smiths?

282
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,044
They'll cave your head in
with your own helmet.

283
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,630
The Lannisters wanted
to kill me long before
I joined the Brotherhood.

284
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,465
You don't have to do this.

285
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,217
I want to.

286
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,886
They need good men.

287
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,180
Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.

288
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,349
- And then you--
- What? Serve him?

289
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,478
I've served men
my entire life.

290
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,314
I served Master Mott
at King's Landing

291
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,108
and he sold me
to the Watch.

292
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,651
I served Lord Tywin
at Harrenhal,

293
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,529
wondering every day
if I'd get tortured
or killed.

294
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,282
I'm done serving.

295
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,534
You just said you were
serving Lord Beric.

296
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,331
He may be their leader,
but they chose him.

297
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,500
These men are brothers.
They're a family.

298
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,004
I've never had a family.

299
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,592
I can be your family.

300
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,598
You wouldn't be
my family.

301
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,224
You'd be "my lady."

302
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,075
-<i> ( men shouting )</i>
<i>- ( swords clanging )</i>

303
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,954
Willem.

304
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,456
<i>( sounds get closer )</i>

305
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,166
Willem!

306
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,839
- Is this a rescue?
- Lannister filth!
Take him!

307
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,967
Please, I didn't do anything.
I'm just a squire.

308
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,760
- Please--
-<i> ( squelches )</i>

309
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,983
Bring them in.

310
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,959
Is that all of them?

311
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,381
It took five
of you to murder
two unarmed squires?

312
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,174
Not murder,
Your Grace.

313
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,968
Vengeance.

314
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,178
Vengeance?

315
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,514
Those boys didn't
kill your sons.

316
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,851
I saw Harrion die
on the battlefield
and Torrhen--

317
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,811
Was strangled
by the Kingslayer.

318
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,147
- They were his kin.
- They were boys!

319
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,067
Look at them.

320
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,446
Tell your mother
to look at them.

321
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,990
<i>She killed them</i>
<i>as much as I.</i>

322
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,576
My mother had nothing
to do with this.

323
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,453
This was your treason.

324
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,413
It's treason
to free your enemies.

325
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,082
In war, you kill
your enemies.

326
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,251
Did your father
not teach you that, boy?

327
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,253
- ( grunts )
- Leave him.

328
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,092
Aye.

329
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,428
Leave me to the king.

330
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,057
He wants to give me
a scolding before
he sets me free.

331
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,561
That's how he deals
with treason.

332
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,980
Our King in the North.

333
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,232
Or should I call him

334
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,360
the King Who Lost
the North?

335
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,783
Escort Lord Karstark
to the dungeon.

336
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,451
Hang the rest.

337
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,952
Mercy, sire!
I didn't kill anyone.

338
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,579
I only watched
for the guards.

339
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,706
This one was only
the watcher.

340
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,875
Hang him last
so he can watch
the others die.

341
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,960
Man:
<i>Please! Please, no.</i>
<i>They made me do it!</i>

342
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,839
They made me!
They made me!

343
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,517
Word of this
can't leave Riverrun.

344
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,435
They were Tywin
Lannister's nephews.

345
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,020
The Lannisters
pay their debts.

346
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,647
<i>They never stop</i>
<i>talking about it.</i>

347
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,482
Would you make me a liar
as well as a murderer?

348
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,275
It wouldn't be lying.

349
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,444
We will bury them
and remain silent

350
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,946
<i>until the war is done.</i>

351
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,489
I'm not fighting
for justice

352
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,283
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

353
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,245
<i>no matter how highborn.</i>

354
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,872
He has to die.

355
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,625
The Karstarks
are Northmen.

356
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,961
They won't forgive
the killing of their lord.

357
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,796
Your mother's right.

358
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,715
If you do this,
the Karstarks will
abandon you.

359
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,676
You tended to their wounds.

360
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,512
You brought them supper.
Now they're dead.

361
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,474
And more boys
will keep dying
until this war is over.

362
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,476
<i>You need Karstark men</i>
<i>to end it.</i>

363
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,895
Spare his life.
Keep him as a hostage.

364
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,981
A hostage.

365
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,484
<i>Tell the Karstarks</i>
<i>that as long as they</i>
<i>remain loyal,</i>

366
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,736
he will not be harmed.

367
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,165
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

368
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,973
The blood of the First Men
flows through my veins

369
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,976
as much as yours, boy.

370
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,645
I fought the Mad King
for your father.

371
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,357
I fought Joffrey
for you.

372
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,859
We are kin--

373
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,153
Stark and Karstark.

374
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,572
That didn't stop you
from betraying me.

375
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,199
And it won't save you now.

376
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,118
I don't want it
to save me.

377
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,663
I want it to haunt you
to the end of your days.

378
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,583
Kneel, my lord.

379
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,969
Rickard Karstark,

380
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,679
<i>Lord of Karhold,</i>

381
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,058
here in sight
of gods and men,
I sentence you to die.

382
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,894
Would you speak
a final word?

383
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,731
Kill me
and be cursed.

384
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,776
You are no king of mine.

385
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,459
Arya:
<i>Joffrey.</i>

386
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,586
Cersei.

387
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,173
Ilyn Payne.

388
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,635
Ser Meryn.

389
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,890
The Hound.

390
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,271
What are you
going to do with me?

391
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,232
At first light
we'll ride for Riverrun.

392
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,775
Your brother's there now.

393
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,403
He'll make a contribution
to our cause

394
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,988
and you can go home.

395
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,949
I'm a hostage
and you're selling me.

396
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,409
Don't think of it
that way.

397
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,036
- But it is that way.
-<i> It is.</i>

398
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,956
- And it isn't.
- More is than isn't.

399
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,128
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

400
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,338
He wanted to refuse
your ransom altogether.

401
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,758
- So why don't you?
- We need the gold.

402
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,689
Do I frighten you, child?

403
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,566
No.

404
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,154
You're angry with me.

405
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,530
And I don't blame you.

406
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,157
But letting him go
was the right thing.

407
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,659
I have more reason than most
to want him hanged.

408
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,329
- I thought he killed you.
- He did.

409
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,247
But how...?

410
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,666
Thoros...

411
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,543
how many times
have you brought me back?

412
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,880
It's the Lord of Light
brings you back.

413
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,299
I'm just the lucky drunk
who says the words.

414
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,968
- How many times?
-<i> Five, I think.</i>

415
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,970
<i>No, this makes six.</i>

416
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,513
Six.

417
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,433
There was the first time--
the Mountain.

418
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,018
<i>Show her.</i>

419
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,730
Lance right through
the chest.

420
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,107
Then I was stabbed
in the belly.

421
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,484
Then it was an arrow
in the back.

422
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,236
<i>And that axe in the side.</i>

423
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,740
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

424
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,494
Was it a hanging
or a dagger in the eye?

425
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,705
Both.
Fuckers couldn't decide.

426
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,291
<i>And the Hound makes six.</i>

427
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,335
Second time I've been
killed by a Clegane.

428
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,545
Thoros:
<i>You'd think you'd learn.</i>

429
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,800
It's not getting
any easier, you know.

430
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,802
Beric:
<i>I know.</i>

431
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,887
<i>Every time I come back,</i>

432
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,972
I'm a bit less.

433
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,018
Pieces of you
get chipped away.

434
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,772
Could you bring back
a man without a head?

435
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,569
Not six times.
Just once.

436
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,239
I don't think it works
that way, child.

437
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,997
He was a good man,
Ned Stark.

438
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,751
<i>He's at rest now,</i>
<i>somewhere.</i>

439
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,379
I would never wish
my life upon him.

440
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,631
I would.

441
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,885
You're alive.

442
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,893
Lord, cast your light
upon me.

443
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,314
Protect me
in the darkness.

444
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,943
Burn away my sins.

445
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,280
Help me serve you.

446
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,490
Use me as you will.

447
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,454
For the night is dark

448
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,123
and full of terrors.

449
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,000
<i>( door opens )</i>

450
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,761
I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.

451
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,599
My lady.

452
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,643
I meant to come sooner.

453
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,646
- The battle--
- I know of your troubles,
my king.

454
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,483
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

455
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,152
Yes, of course.

456
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,831
You mustn't despair.
Your claim is true.

457
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,250
- You will be victorious.
- I believed that once.

458
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,921
You are
the one god's champion

459
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,131
and the finest man
I've ever known.

460
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,467
Selyse.

461
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,638
I've broken a sacred vow.

462
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,226
I've sinned.

463
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,395
- No.
- I've wronged you.

464
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,358
- I have shamed you.
- You're doing god's work.

465
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,318
You don't understand.

466
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,951
The Red Woman--

467
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,371
the Lady Melisandre--

468
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,540
I know, Stannis.

469
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,627
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

470
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,880
No act done in service
of the Lord of Light

471
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,508
can ever be a sin.

472
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:47,011
When she told me,

473
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:51,140
I wept with joy.

474
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:05,405
Oh, my sweet boys.

475
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,577
<i>Petyr, Tommard,</i>

476
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,287
<i>Edric.</i>

477
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,500
I thank god
every day

478
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,253
<i>for bringing</i>
<i>Melisandre to us.</i>

479
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,547
She gave you a son.

480
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,926
I gave you...

481
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,138
-<i> nothing.</i>
<i>- That's not true.</i>

482
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,021
So you've come
to see her as well?

483
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,233
There is no need.

484
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,070
You must keep away
from such distractions.

485
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,864
She's my daughter.

486
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,284
I want to see her.

487
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,914
You are a king.

488
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,459
You don't need
my permission.

489
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,758

Father!

( sighs )

499
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,705
You've grown
since I last saw you.

500
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,000
Mother said you fought
in a battle.

501
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,377
Did you win?

502
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,005
No.

503
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,132
Did the Onion Knight
come back with you?

504
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,011
He did.

505
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,680
He fought bravely.

506
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,431
He hasn't come
to visit me.

507
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,643
He said he'd bring
me back a present
from the capital.

508
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,936
He won't be visiting, child.

509
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,563
Why not?
He's my friend.

510
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,357
Look.

511
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,484
<i>( drawer opens )</i>

512
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,241
He made this for me.

513
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,743
But don't tell Mother
I have it.

514
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,036
It's a secret.

515
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,248
Mother doesn't like
the Onion Knight.

516
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,086
Ser Davos
is a traitor.

517
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,966
He's rotting in a dungeon
cell for his crime.

518
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,686
Best forget him.

519
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,860
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

520
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,950
Not so hard.
You'll scrub the skin off.

00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,452
What are you
doing here?

522
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,828
I need a bath.

523
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,372
Help me out
of these rags.

524
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,840
Now get out.

525
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,521
There's another tub.

526
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,357
This one suits me fine.

527
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:44,165
Don't worry.
I'm not interested.

<i>If I faint, pull me out.</i>

530
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,923
I don't intend
to be the first Lannister
to die in a bathtub.

531
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,133
Why should I care
how you die?

532
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,719
You swore a solemn vow,
remember?

533
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,431
You're supposed
to get me to King's
Landing in one piece.

534
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,685
Not going so well, is it?

535
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,230
No wonder Renly died
with you guarding him.

536
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,492
That was unworthy.
Forgive me.

537
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,494
You protected me
better than most--

538
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,121
- Don't you mock me.
- I'm apologizing.

539
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,416
I'm sick of fighting.

540
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,168
<i>Let's call a truce.</i>

541
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,628
You need trust
to have a truce.

542
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,966
I trust you.

543
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,308
<i>There it is.</i>
<i>There's the look.</i>

544
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,894
I've seen it for 17 years

545
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,521
on face after face.

546
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,732
<i>You all despise me.</i>

547
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,026
Kingslayer.

548
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,195
Oathbreaker.

549
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,531
A man without honor.

550
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,872
You've heard of wildfire?

551
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,540
Of course.

552
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,126
<i>The Mad King</i>
<i>was obsessed with it.</i>

553
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,545
He loved to watch
people burn,

554
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,256
the way their skin
blackened and blistered

555
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,800
<i>and melted</i>
<i>off their bones.</i>

556
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,052
<i>He burned lords</i>
<i>he didn't like.</i>

557
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,138
<i>He burned Hands</i>
<i>who disobeyed him.</i>

558
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:25,474
He burned anyone
who was against him.

559
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,354
Before long,
half the country
was against him.

560
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,610
Aerys saw traitors
everywhere.

561
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:41,407
So he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire

562
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,743
<i>all over the city--</i>

563
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,078
beneath the Sept
of Baelor

564
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,872
and the slums
of Flea Bottom.

565
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:51,250
Under houses,
stables, taverns.

566
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,503
Even beneath
the Red Keep itself.

567
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,633
Finally,

568
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,011
the day
of reckoning came.

569
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,263
Robert Baratheon
marched on the capital

570
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,432
after his victory
at the Trident.

571
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,935
But my father
arrived first

572
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,604
with the whole Lannister
army at his back,

573
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:16,150
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

574
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,112
I knew my father
better than that.

575
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,282
<i>He's never been one</i>
<i>to pick the losing side.</i>

576
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,952
<i>I told the Mad King</i>
<i>as much.</i>

577
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,830
I urged him
to surrender peacefully.

578
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,000
<i>But the king didn't</i>
<i>listen to me.</i>

579
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,711
He didn't listen to Varys
who tried to warn him.

580
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:40,299
But he did listen
to Grand Maester Pycelle,

581
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,802
that grey, sunken cunt.

582
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,181
"You can trust
the Lannisters," he said.

583
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,185
"The Lannisters
have always been

584
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,396
true friends
of the crown."

585
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,317
So we opened the gates

586
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,486
and my father
sacked the city.

587
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,906
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>I came to the king,</i>

588
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,201
begging him to surrender.

589
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,165
He told me to...

590
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,793
bring him
my father's head.

591
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,171
Then he...

592
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,425
turned to his pyromancer.

593
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,052
"Burn them all,"
he said.

594
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,265
"Burn them
in their homes.

595
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,225
Burn them
in their beds."

596
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:37,606
Tell me,
if your precious Renly

597
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,526
commanded you to kill
your own father

598
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,571
and stand by while
thousands of men,

599
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,740
women, and children
burned alive,

600
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,326
would you have done it?

601
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,161
Would you have
kept your oath then?

602
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,793
First, I killed
the pyromancer.

603
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,505
<i>And then when the king</i>
<i>turned to flee,</i>

604
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,092
I drove my sword
into his back.

605
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,929
<i>"Burn them all,"</i>
<i>he kept saying.</i>

606
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,806
"Burn them all."

607
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,225
I don't think
he expected to die.

608
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,062
He-- he meant to...

609
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,232
burn with the rest of us

610
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,069
and rise again,

611
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,862
reborn as a dragon

612
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,614
to turn his enemies
to ash.

613
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,121
I slit his throat to make sure
that didn't happen.

614
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:41,921
That's where Ned Stark
found me.

615
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,048
If this is true...

616
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,551
why didn't you tell anyone?

617
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,680
Why didn't you tell
Lord Stark?

618
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,099
Stark?

619
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,643
You think

620
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:59,605
the honorable Ned Stark

621
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,983
wanted to hear my side?

622
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,611
He judged me guilty

623
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,197
the moment
he set eyes on me.

624
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,117
( breathing heavily )

625
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,121
By what right
does the wolf

626
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,872
judge the lion?

627
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,042
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

628
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,710
The Kingslayer!

629
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,005
Jaime.

630
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,924
My name is Jaime.

631
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,555
Shireen:
<i>Onion Knight.</i>

632
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,598
<i>Ser Onion Knight.</i>

633
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,102
Princess?
Gods, what are
you doing here?

634
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,563
- Shh, you'll wake Bert.
- Bert?

635
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,732
He's the fat one.
He's on guard duty tonight.

636
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,651
He likes to drink wine
and sleep a lot.

637
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,529
Go back to your room.
You're not supposed
to be here.

638
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,532
- If your father knew--
- He said you were a traitor.

639
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,825
Are you?

640
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,494
I am, child.

641
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,454
I disobeyed my king,
your father,

642
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,165
and now I'm paying
the price.

643
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,667
I don't care.
You're my friend.

644
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,669
You must get bored
down here.

645
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,671
I brought you
something to read.

646
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,423
It's about Aegon
and his dragons.

647
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,843
Aegon used to live here.
Did you know that?

648
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,970
- And the Targaryens
built this castle.
- Aye.

649
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,097
- So they did.
- You can hide the book
under your cloak.

650
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,725
It's a good one.
I'll bring you more.

651
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,477
Thank you, my lady.
I'm sure it's a fine book,

652
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,021
but it's wasted on me.

653
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,523
Take it.
I have more.

654
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,110
My lady, I can't read
the words.

655
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,987
You can't?

656
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,823
I'll teach you.
I'll come when Bert's
on duty and teach you.

657
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,742
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

658
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,077
- Go. We can't.
- Why not?

659
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,788
What will they do,
lock us in cells?

660
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,874
( laughs )

661
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,880
I wouldn't know
where to start.

662
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,590
At the beginning.

663
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,675
This word is Aegon.

664
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,721
When you see A, E, and G
together like that,

665
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,556
it sounds like egg.

666
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,683
And the title
of the whole book

667
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,685
is "An History
of Aegon the Conqueror

668
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,104
<i>and His Conquest</i>
<i>of Westeros."</i>

669
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,900
<i>( men shouting orders )</i>

670
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,993
Jorah:
It was a bitch
of a siege.

671
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,037
Mm, you were first
through the breach
at Pyke?

672
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,749
The second.
Thoros of Myr
went in alone,

673
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,542
waving that
flaming sword of his.

674
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,337
Thoros of Myr.
Bloody madman.

675
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,590
Robert knighted you
after the battle?

676
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,425
Proudest moment
of my life.

677
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,345
One knee in the dust,
the king's sword
on my shoulder,

678
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,097
listening to the words.

679
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,767
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

680
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,520
All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.

681
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,021
( laughs )

682
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,691
Jorah:
In full plate metal
for 16 hours.

683
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,609
Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

684
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,946
I was very nearly
the first man knighted
to piss on the king's boots.

685
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,572
( laughs )

686
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,866
Robert would have
laughed.

687
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,244
He was a good man,
a great warrior.

688
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,872
And a terrible king.

689
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:07,585
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

690
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,128
- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

691
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,963
And a man of honor
keeps his vows,

692
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:14,300
even if he's serving
a drunk or a lunatic.

693
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,261
Just once in my life
before it's over,

694
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:20,472
I want to know
what it's like
to serve with pride,

695
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,309
to fight for someone
I believe in.

696
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,352
Do you believe in her?

697
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,648
With all my heart.

698
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,530
These are the ones?

699
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,407
Yes, khaleesi.
The officers.

700
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,745
( speaking Valyrian )

701
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,987
All Unsullied boys
are given new names

702
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,697
when they are cut--

703
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,033
Grey Worm, Red Flea,
Black Rat.

704
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:24,036
<i>Names that remind them</i>
<i>what they are--</i>

705
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,372
vermin.

706
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,754
Jorah:
<i>King Robert</i>
<i>wanted her dead.</i>

707
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,464
Of course
he wanted her dead.

708
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,467
She's a Targaryen.
The last Targaryen.

709
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,137
I suppose no one
on the small council
could speak sense to him.

710
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,931
- I didn't sit
on the small council.
- No?

711
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,600
Doesn't the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard
traditionally--

712
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,477
Traditionally, yes,
but I killed a dozen

713
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,479
of Robert's friends
during his rebellion.

714
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,483
He didn't want advice
on how to govern

715
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,402
from a man who had fought
for the Mad King.

716
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,447
Can't say
I minded much.

717
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,449
I always hated
the politics.

718
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,534
Yeah, I imagine
I would, too.

719
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,828
Hours spent jabbering
about backstabbings

720
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,123
- and betrayals
the world over.
- Mm-hmm.

721
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,211
Still, she'll have
to wade through that muck

722
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,464
if she wants to rule
the Seven Kingdoms.

723
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,466
She'll have good men
around her to advise her,

724
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,134
men with experience.

725
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,719
Which men do you
have in mind?

726
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,679
Forgive me, Ser Jorah,
for what I'm about to say,

727
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:09,183
but your reputation
in Westeros has suffered
over the years.

728
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,685
It suffered for a reason.

729
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,562
I sold men into slavery.

730
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,439
I don't know
if your presence
by her side

731
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,691
will help our cause
when we go home.

732
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,568
Our cause?

733
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,653
Forgive me,
Ser Barristan,
but I was busy

734
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,739
defending the khaleesi against
King Robert's assassins

735
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,532
while you were still
bowing to the man.

736
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,660
We both want her to rule.
Am I wrong?

737
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,288
You only joined us
a few days ago.

738
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,373
I can't speak
to your intentions.

739
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,542
If we're truly
her loyal servants,

740
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,587
we will do whatever
needs to be done,

741
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,173
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

742
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,675
You're not
Lord Commander here.

743
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,386
You're just another exile.

744
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,305
And I take my orders
from the queen.

745
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,483
- Talisa:<i> Come to bed.</i>
<i>- You were right.</i>

746
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,277
The Karstarks are gone.

747
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,697
Almost half our forces.

748
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,201
Tywin Lannister knows
what he needs to do
to make us unravel.

749
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,037
Nothing.

750
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,248
Only wait.

751
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,875
Don't let him.

752
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,002
What can I do?

753
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,295
Attack King's Landing?

754
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,548
There's nothing
he'd like better.

755
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,424
He'd crush us
in a day.

756
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,094
We could ride north.

757
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,471
<i>Take your land back</i>
<i>from the Greyjoys.</i>

758
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,766
- Wait out the winter.
- Winter could last
five years.

759
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,518
Once my bannermen
are home again,

760
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,895
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their
families,

761
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,023
warm and safe,
they'll never ride
south again.

762
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,359
When I gathered
my lords together,

763
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,236
we had a purpose,
a mission.

764
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,947
Now we're like a band
of bickering children.

765
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,243
Give them a new purpose.

766
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,828
What?

767
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,540
Oh, I don't know.

768
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,251
I don't even know
where Winterfell is.

769
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,839
Here.

770
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:10,470
And we're here.
King's Landing--

771
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,895
What is it?

772
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,611
I can't force them
to meet us in the field

773
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,946
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

774
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,824
but I can attack them
where they're not.

775
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,871
And Casterly Rock
can't run away.

776
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,249
I'm going to take
their home away from them.

777
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,794
Can you do it?

778
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,631
I need men
to replace the Karstarks
who marched home.

779
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,300
There is only one person
in this kingdom

780
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,678
with that kind of army
who hasn't already sided
with the Lannisters.

781
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,515
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry--

782
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,435
Walder Frey.

783
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,696
He's such
a splendid fighter.

784
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,824
Do you have any idea
when we might...

785
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:16,995
I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey
and I are married.

786
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,330
It should grow quickly.

787
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,748
Joffrey won't let me leave.

788
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,709
He's got too many reasons
to keep me here.

789
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,088
And only one
to let you go.

790
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,340
Because it will
please me.

791
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,592
Man:
<i>Squire!</i>

792
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,681
Well fought, ser.

793
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,475
That was no fight.
I don't know you.

794
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,852
Olyver,
if it please you.

795
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:46,066
I should like
to see you spar with
a proper partner, ser.

796
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,068
( chuckles )

797
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,534
How did you know?

798
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,536
Know what?

799
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,706
That I wanted to.

800
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,624
My lord...

801
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,255
I'll have you know
I'm to be married soon

802
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,466
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

803
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,594
They rarely do,
in my experience.

804
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,805
You have a good deal
of experience, do you?

805
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,933
With the husbands.

806
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,236
That didn't take long.

807
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,447
Well, it took long enough.

808
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:38,076
It seems
our Knight of Flowers
is engaged to be wed.

809
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,703
Is he?

810
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,247
And...

811
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,874
who's the lucky girl?

812
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,335
Littlefinger:
<i>She may not be the grandest</i>
<i>ship in the world</i>

813
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,838
or the fastest,

814
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,923
but she's mine.

815
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,429
I've always wanted a ship.

816
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,765
Now I want a dozen.

817
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,309
- Strange, isn't it?
- What is?

818
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,770
It doesn't matter
what we want,

819
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,521
once we get it,

820
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,398
then we want
something else.

821
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,945
Your hair is different.

822
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,530
Is it?

823
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,948
Lady Margaery
wears it that way.

824
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,284
Many ladies
wear it this way.

825
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,119
I have good news.

826
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,246
I'll be leaving
the city soon.

827
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,748
You still want me
to come with you?

828
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,083
It's not a question
of what I want.

829
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,127
It's what you want.

830
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,462
You want to go home,
don't you?

831
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,131
Of course.
More than anything.

832
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,887
But maybe it would
be better to wait.

833
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,389
I've been thinking
how dangerous it would be.

834
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,392
Not just for me,
but for you.

835
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,977
You've been so kind.

836
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,647
I'd feel
terrible if anything
happened to you.

837
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,442
I can't tell you
how touched I am

838
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,362
by your concern
for my welfare.

839
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,198
I hope you know that
I'm your friend, Sansa.

840
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,492
Your true friend.

841
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,077
I do, Lord Baelish.

842
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,746
- Petyr.
- Petyr.

843
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,790
If you wish to stay,

844
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,793
then of course
you will stay.

845
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,509
We'll speak again
when I return.

846
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,566
Tywin:
<i>You're late.</i>

847
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,569
What's she doing here?

848
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,362
Our business
concerns her, too.

849
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,406
<i>Sit.</i>

850
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,201
You'll be pleased to learn

851
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,787
that after one conversation
with Olenna Tyrell,

852
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,164
I've saved the crown

853
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,709
hundreds of thousands
on this wedding.

854
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,085
Never mind that now.

855
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,712
We have something
important to discuss.

856
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,672
I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

857
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,508
Stop that.

858
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,385
You're making me
uncomfortable.

859
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,513
Your sister has learned that
your new friends the Tyrells

860
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,182
are plotting to marry
Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

861
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,393
Very well.

862
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,395
She's a lovely girl.

863
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,480
Missing some of Loras'
favorite bits,

864
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,357
but I'm sure
they'll make do.

865
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,776
- Your jokes
are not appreciated.
- It wasn't my best, but--

866
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,988
I bring them into
the royal fold and this
is how they repay me,

867
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:23,575
by trying to steal
the key to the North
out from under me.

868
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,076
Sansa is the key
to the North?

869
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,162
I seem to remember
she has an older brother.

870
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,539
The Karstarks
have marched home.

871
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,208
The young wolf
has lost half his army.
His days are numbered.

872
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,170
<i>Theon Greyjoy murdered</i>
<i>both his brothers.</i>

873
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:39,174
That makes Sansa Stark
the heir to Winterfell.

874
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:42,427
And I am not about
to hand her over
to the Tyrells.

875
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,846
Tyrion:
<i>The Tyrell army is helping</i>
<i>us to win this war.</i>

876
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,599
Do you really think
it's wise to refuse them?

877
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,476
There's nothing to refuse.
This is a plot.

878
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,312
<i>Plots are not</i>
<i>public knowledge.</i>

879
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,606
And the Tyrells
won't carry this one out

880
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,399
until after
Joffrey's wedding.

881
00:53:56,483 --> 00:54:00,111
We need to act first
and kill this union
in its crib.

882
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,529
And how do we do that?

883
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,823
We find Sansa Stark
a different husband.

884
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,077
- Wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

885
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,169
You can't mean it.

886
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,963
I can and I do.

887
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,799
Joffrey has made this
poor girl's life miserable

888
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,801
since the day he took
her father's head.

889
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,804
Now she's finally
free of him and you
give her to me?

890
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,681
That's cruel even for you.

891
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,557
Do you intend
on mistreating her?

892
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,518
The girl's happiness
is not my concern,

893
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,520
- nor should it be yours.
- She's a child!

894
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,981
She's flowered, I assure you.
She and I have discussed
it at length.

895
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:39,275
There, you see?
You will wed her, bed her,
and put a child in her.

896
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,696
-<i> Surely you're</i>
<i>capable of that.</i>
<i>- And if I refuse?</i>

897
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,906
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

898
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:49,327
Sansa Stark is a finer
reward than you could
ever dare hope for.

899
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,122
And it is past time
you were wed.

900
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,000
I was wed.

901
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,460
Or don't you remember?

902
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,506
Only too well.

903
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,551
Cersei:
<i>You should be thanking</i>
<i>the gods for this.</i>

904
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,094
This is more
than you deserve.

905
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,680
Tywin:
<i>Tyrion will do as he's bid.</i>

906
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,682
As will you.

907
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,310
What do you mean?

908
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,104
You'll marry Ser Loras.

909
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,692
- I will not.
- The boy is heir
to Highgarden.

910
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,319
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

911
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,072
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

912
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,825
You're still fertile.
You need to marry
again and breed.

913
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,036
I am Queen Regent,
not some broodmare.

914
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,830
You're my daughter!

915
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,373
You will do as I command

916
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,709
and you will marry
Loras Tyrell

917
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,170
and put an end
to the disgusting rumors

918
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,881
about you
once and for all.

919
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,216
Father, don't make me
do it again, please.

920
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,677
Not another word.

921
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,096
My children.

922
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,517
You've disgraced
the Lannister name
for far too long.
