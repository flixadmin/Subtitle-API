It's not my problem.

Don't call me again.

160
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,330
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offense.

161
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,643
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

162
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,210
that's killed innocent people.

163
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,366
I'm sure some newspaper in America might
be interested in hearing more about that.

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,249
You're a cop.

169
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,404
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

170
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,211
Where the Castafios are,
and the Rodriguezes'.

171
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,485
Arrest them.

172
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,369
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

173
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,245
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, no? Then how?

174

Otherwise, this is the deal.

186
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,881
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

187

She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

188

00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,130
I'll take the codes back.
You stay with Pefia, okay?

314
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,040
No fucking way. The codes are staying
with me. I'll take it to Martinez.

315

We give Judy immunity,
take her testimony and we are covered.

316

Don't lie to me again, Pefia.

This is a tier-one narco who's
ready to flip on other tier-one narcos.

It's not intel anyone can provide.

She has leverage over you.

321
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,451
Her information on Escobar
crippled his business.

322
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,841
She'll do the same to Cali,
only this time for us.

323
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,009
The moment she goes on record,
her leverage is gone.

She doesn't get immunity
until after she talks.

325
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,921
Get her on record
and we'll see what she's got.

326

Nobody seems to want to take on Cali.

They've been off-limits,
but this may do the trick.

328

And Pefia. Be discreet. Tell no one.

329

You were a tough little boy,

So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

Yes, Colonel. I verified the frequencies.

365
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,007
The codes are the same ones
Escobar's wife is using.

No. The antenna is not that strong.

about me coming here with my family?

I wasn't paying that much attention.

Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

472
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,526
We spent it. It's gone.

473
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,444
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

474
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,289
You've already hurt me.

475
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,404
You fucked up my life.

476
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,602
I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

477
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,611
Hang on, Maritza.

478
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,486
And this?

479
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,646
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

480
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,964
Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

481
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,726
You lying... bitch! Get off!

482
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,610
Motherfucker! Bastard!

483
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,446
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

484
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,241
- Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.
- [baby whimpering]

485
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,491
What did you say?

486
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,206
Are you going to say something? Hmm?
Are you going to rat on me?

487
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,682
<i>L</i> might! Why shouldn't l?

488
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,401
What? So now you're a killer?
Like your hero? [spits]

489
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,925
Jhon!

490
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,326
I know you! Get that shit out...

491
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,323
Igunshoq {gasps}

492
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,210
[turns off engine]

493
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,131
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

494
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,202
But I have bad news.

495
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,328
- What happened?
- Look.

496
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,564
It's rotten, sir.

497
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,610
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

498
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,723
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

499
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,326
There's about six thousand dollars
I counted, boss.

500
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,929
Get your things. We're leaving.

501
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,646
[Judy] <i>Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.</i>

502
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,009
<i>[Javier] Everything3 set.
We have to do this tonight.</i>

503
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,080
Where?

504
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,202
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

505
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,161
We've used it before.

506
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,884
<i>Berna knows where.</i>

507
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,085
[Judy]
<i>I'll</i> see <i>you there.</i>

508
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,920
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

509
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,771
Let's go, Flaco.

510
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,165
[in English]
She's on her way.

511
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,560
[in Spanish]
I know what you're thinking.

512
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,643
I'm making a mistake. [chuckles]

513
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,805
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

514
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,367
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

515
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,601
Up here, Flaco.

516
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,406
I can't protect a rat.

517
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,727
[static, stops]

518
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,043
I didn't think you'd betray me.

519
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,607
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

520
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,291
So now, you're going to get on that plane.

521
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,284
And if I don't, what? What happens?

522
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,330
If you don't get on,
then you'll leave with the Castafios.

523
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,448
And I won't protect you anymore.

524
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,251
Tell me something.

525
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,562
Did Cali arrange this?

526
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,611
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

527
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,730
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castafios.

528
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,210
They don't understand our business,
but they'll be useful in mine.

529
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,041
- So you fucked over your partner.
- I was never your partner.

530
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,842
I only protected your life.

531
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,882
Relax. You'll have money.

532
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,248
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

533
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,010
- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

534
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,524
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

535
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,849
Don't worry about a thing.

536
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:51,203
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

537
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,089
[in English]
Hey, man. How's it going?

538
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,083
Everything good at the safe house?

539
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,962
- Where's Messina?
- Oh, she's gone.

540
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,807
Reassigned. Headed home.

541
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,885
Likely to spend the rest of her career
busting meth labs in Indianapolis.

542
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,201
Something about chain of command.

543
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,886
- And Judy?
- You didn't hear?

544
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,851
Judy has an interview
with the Miami Herald in, <i>uh...</i>

545
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,843
oh, about five hours.

546
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,891
Now I can't be certain,
but I bet she has a story to tell

547
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,210
about the involvement of a certain
DEA agent with Los Pepes.

548
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,480
All I know for sure is,
whatever Judy has to say,

549
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,642
it won't be pointed in my direction.

550
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,929
You should've stayed in your lane.

551
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,207
[whispers] Wow.

552
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,363
And Cali too, right?

553
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,610
They get a pass?

554
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,808
How much do they pay you
for your protection?

555
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,245
Pay me?

556
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,610
[gentle scoff]

557
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,887
Let me tell you something, Agent Pefia.

558
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,126
Maybe it'll make you feel better,
but maybe not.

559
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,689
We're gonna get them someday.
But not your way.

560
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,930
For everything you know, you're, uh...
extremely naive.

561
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,650
Anyway, I've enjoyed this.

562
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,401
The laughs.

563
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,448
Um... Oh.

564
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,602
I think the ambassador wants to see you.

565
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,405
I guess word about this <i>Miami</i> Hera/d thing
is spreading like a prairie fire.

566
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,846
And bring your passport.

567
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,728
I think you're going home, but...

568
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,084
you didn't hear that from me.

569
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,606
Tata?

570
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,051
[Static]

571
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,404
Tata, can you hear me?

572
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,565
<i>[Tata] Pablo?</i>

573
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,964
It's me, my love.

574
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,048
<i>Finally, I can speak to you, my love.</i>

575
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,330
<i>I've missed you so much.</i>

576
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,002
<i>Where have you been, Pablo?</i>

577
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,125
I had to do something very important.

578
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,521
But I'm back home, my love.

579
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,642
I'm home.
