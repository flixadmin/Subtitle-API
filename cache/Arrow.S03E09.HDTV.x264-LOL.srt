1
00:00:01,416 --> 00:00:03,226
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:06,184
I'm sorry, I--

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,108
I should go.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,843
The night of the siege,

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,478
you were
at the train station.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,081
I got attacked by one of those
crazy masked things,

7
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,150
but he got shot
by a cop, I think.

8
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,952
It was Malcolm Merlyn.

9
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:20,986
He's dead.

10
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,554
Thank you, Dad.

11
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,424
I promised you, Thea.
I will never let anyone hurt you.

12
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,092
Sara Lance is dead?

13
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,294
Yes.
At Merlyn's hand?

14
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,929
It appears.

15
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:32,264
Al Sa-Her will face
the League's justice.

16
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,565
What of Queen?

17
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,734
He has sworn to protect Merlyn
at any cost.

18
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,403
If that is true...

19
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:41,073
then Oliver Queens
courts war with us.

20
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,959
Hey.

21
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,160
Very nice.

22
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,171
Merry Christmas.

23
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,256
Well, I feel bad.
I didn't get you anything.

24
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:15,490
You keep
the city safe.

25
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:17,692
So do you.

26
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:22,777
You know, these days, you're
the closest thing to a partner I got.

27
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:24,980
Happy holidays.

28
00:01:24,982 --> 00:01:27,749
Here you go, buddy.

29
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:33,421
Merlyn!

30
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:09,891
Nyssa.

31
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:11,960
What is this?

32
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:14,195
We agreed!
To nothing.

33
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:16,865
My father merely decided
to give you the time

34
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,634
to bring Sara's killer to justice,
and you have failed.

35
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:22,737
We are doing
everything that we can!

36
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,106
You've been distracted
protecting the city.

37
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:28,209
And you've exhausted
my father's patience.

38
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,678
In civilizations past,

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,660
when someone
in the village was murdered,

40
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,896
the League would come
and kill 50 people a day

41
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:36,664
until the true criminal
was rooted out.

42
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,579
Find and deliver the one
who killed Ta-er Al-Sahfer.

43
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,314
You have 48 hours,
or the citizens of Starling

44
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:44,549
will see what the League
of Assassins is capable of.

45
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:48,120
You're going to slaughter
innocent people.

46
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:50,822
The cleansing of Starling City
will fall to Sarab.

47
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,462
Maseo?

48
00:02:57,464 --> 00:02:59,231
Maseo is no longer.

49
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,234
As she said...
I am Sarab.

50
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:03,735
Deliver Sara's killer

51
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:06,438
or blood will flow
in your streets.

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,341
This isn't what
Sara would want!

53
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:11,576
Sara is dead.

54
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:13,912
It's time you remember that.

55

57
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:27,459
Dad's ok.
Um...working too much.

58
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,027
Sorry.

59
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:30,962
I never really know what to say
when I come here.

60
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,531
I just...

61
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,136
I wanted to wish you
a Merry Christmas,

62
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:41,306
and tell you
how much I miss you.

63
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:44,776
Laurel?

64
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,678
Thea.

65
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,180
What are you
doing here?

66
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:50,048
I was just leaving
flowers for my mom.

67
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,485
Who were you talking to?

68
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:54,487
Nobody.

69
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:57,355
I just come here...
Sometimes.

70
00:03:57,357 --> 00:04:00,058
Even though
Sara's still alive?

71
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,761
Laurel, what--what's wrong?

72
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:04,496
Everything's fine.
Sara's ok.

73
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:07,132
No, Thea.

74
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:11,837
Sara's dead.

75
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:14,039
What?

76
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,475
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:18,877
While you were
gone...

78
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,879
She was murdered.

79
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:24,049
By who?

80
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:27,185
I don't know.
I buried her here.

81
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:31,127
Why didn't you tell anybody,
like at least your father, the police?

82
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:32,324
No, no.

83
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:34,493
Thea, no one
can ever know.

84
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:35,961
Why?

85
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,081
Sara, she was, uh,

86
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,405
she was complicated.

87
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:46,307
And if my father
found out,

88
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:48,476
it would kill him.

89
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,847
You have to promise
me that you won't tell Oliver.

90
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:55,516
Of course, I--I promise.

91
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:59,086
I'm so sorry.

92
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,491
Hey.

93
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:05,326
Did you know there's
a cafeteria in the building?

94
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,713
There's a cold press juice bar,
organic salad station.

95
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:10,398
I know.
I eat there every day,

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,600
along with 800
of your other employees.

97
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:13,734
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

98
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:14,769
I'm late for a meeting.

99
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:17,271
Wait, Felicity!
Are we ok?

100
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,874
If by "we"
you mean you and me

101
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:23,311
as individual entities, then yes,
we are fantastic.

102
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:25,207
This is about the kiss.

103
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,174
This is not
about the kiss.

104
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:29,376
You sure? 'Cause it really
feels like it's about the kiss.

105
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:33,313
Unless it's about
how I left after the kiss.

106
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:34,948
- I can explain.
- No.

107
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,818
I can explain. It was a moment
and you regret it.

108
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,020
It's over. Now can we please pretend
like it never happened

109
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:42,222
and go back to being
professionals?

110
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:47,027
I have to go.

111
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,462
Work.

112
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:51,298
But you're at...work.

113
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,234
What happened?

114
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:56,297
Nyssa paid me a visit.

115
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:59,367
The League wants Sara's killer handed
over in the next 48 hours.

116
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:01,102
Why do I sense
there's an "or else"

117
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:02,937
at the end
of that sentence?

118
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,572
Or else they'll start killing
innocent civilians.

119
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:06,074
Oh, my god, two days?

120
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:08,209
Caitlin has the DNA that
we pulled off of the arrows

121
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:10,478
that killed Sara,
but the STR markers are degraded,

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,580
so it's taking
a little bit longer.

123
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,582
Felicity...

124
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:18,353
It can't take
any longer.

125
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:20,155
If we can't find
Sara's killer in time,

126
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:22,057
we're going to need
a contingency plan.

127
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:24,826
I know.

128
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:27,262
I don't have one.

129
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,976
Here.

130
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:48,016
Oh, I'm not hungry.

131
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:51,386
The first time
I interrogated someone,

132
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:54,622
I lost my appetite
for two days.

133
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:57,092
You need
your strength.

134
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:59,794
I didn't interrogate anyone.

135
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:02,497
I tortured him.

136
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,966
The question is,

137
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:07,969
did you learn anything about
Chien Na Wei's plans?

138
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:11,372
There's a biotech
company in Hong Kong.

139
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:13,774
They were working
on a super-antibiotic.

140
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:17,311
They got a super-virus instead.

141
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,580
They're calling it
Oh-Mei-Gah,

142
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:22,116
which is the Chinese
translation for...

143
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,118
Omega.

144
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,088
Said one vile could
wipe out an entire city.

145
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,125
So it's a bio weapon
Chien Na Wei's after.

146
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:33,494
Did he tell you
where it is now?

147
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,396
Yeah.

148
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,698
He didn't want to,
but I made him.

149
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,167
You did what
was necessary.

150
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,404
One man's agony
is not worth

151
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:46,273
the lives of
an entire city.

152
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,595
But
you're all right?

153
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,496
Okay. Yes, it is
coming through now.

154
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:55,699
No, I'm fine. Things are just,
um, tense here.

155
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,301
Thank you, Caitlin.

156
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,336
Happy holidays
to you, too.

157
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:01,405
Are those the DNA results?

158
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,007
It's the reassembled
genome S.T.A.R. Labs

159
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,875
was able to get off of the arrow
that killed Sara.

160
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,443
I need to run it against
potential suspects.

161
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,878
What database
are you using?

162
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,847
SCPD maintains a genetic
markers database.

163
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:12,683
Anyone's who committed
a felony in the past three years.

164
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,118
No, that--

165
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,098
that can't be right.

166
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:16,028
Who is it?

167
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:17,290
It must be a mistake.

168
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,923
Felicity!
Who killed Sara?

169
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,559
You did.

170
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:49,525
This must be a mistake.

171
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:52,728
I took perspiration
off the arrows that killed Sara.

172
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,563
Two years ago when the police
arrested Oliver

173
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,732
because they thought,
accurately, that he was the vigilante,

174
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,167
they took a DNA sample.

175
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:01,145
That sample is a match for 12
out of the 13 STRs.

176
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:02,588
The odds of that...

177
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,864
They're impossible.

178
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:06,064
Ok, so somehow
my DNA is on the arrows.

179
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,332
Someone's setting you up,
Oliver.

180
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:09,134
Well, somebody with
a vested interest

181
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,802
in pitting me against
the League of Assassins.

182
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:12,137
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

183
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:15,007
Merlyn was in Corto Maltese
with Thea when this was going down.

184
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:18,210
Unless he wasn't. I mean, Merlyn hid
successfully for two years

185
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:20,279
from the police and the League.

186
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,747
He's good
at covering his tracks.

187
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:23,182
So we uncover them.

188
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:26,118
But it might
take some time.

189
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,620
In less than 48 hours, the League
is going to murder 50 people.

190
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:31,190
We don't have time.

191
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:45,341
Move to the lab.
I'll deal with

192
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,409
the rest
of security.

193
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:49,578
Stay on comms.

194
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,380
Maseo, are you set?

195
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,649
Just about.

196
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:04,159
Found Omega.

197
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:06,362
Be careful with it.

198
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,731
Yeah, we might
have a problem.

199
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,165
What's wrong?

200
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,382
Somebody already
took it.

201
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:13,896
How did she get
in here before us?

202
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:22,978
She didn't need
to get in, Oliver.

203
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,681
She already
had someone inside.

204
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,584
Yeah, I know,
but it's the holidays

205
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,219
and I guess
I'm feeling charitable.

206
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:32,121
Is that ok?

207
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:34,356
Jake, I got
to call you right back.

208
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:35,130
Hey.

209
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:36,255
Hi!

210
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,862
Look who it is.

211
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,397
How was your ride down?

212
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,765
Oh, uneventful.

213
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,367
Chance to grade
some papers.

214
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:46,602
Dad, maybe you can tell me
why half your officers

215
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,372
are allergic
to search warrants?

216
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:50,328
Mom!

217
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:51,861
Hi, sweetheart.

218
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,463
I didn't know that
you were coming to town.

219
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,198
Well, I guess
that's my fault,

220
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
'cause I thought you could
do a little Christmas surprise.

221
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:58,901
Hmm.

222
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:01,671
Of course I want to spend
Christmas with my family.

223
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:02,972
So where's Sara?

224
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:05,141
She's not returning
my phone calls.

225
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:07,443
Uh, yeah, that's 'cause
she's, uh, she's traveling.

226
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:12,148
Backpacking through the Andes.

227
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,450
I think.
Yeah.

228
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:17,721
I found something!

229
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:21,024
A.R.G.U.S. monitors air traffic
in and out of countries of interest.

230
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,459
Corto Maltese is on that list.

231
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,894
This is a list of every
commercial airliner,

232
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,963
private jet, sea plane,
and, I'm not kidding,

233
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:29,499
hot air balloon that took off
from Corto Maltese this past year.

234
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:30,967
Look at this flight path.

235
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,703
Private charter
from Corto Maltese to Caracas,

236
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,472
then to Cartagena,

237
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:37,740
only to fly back to Caracas,
and then to Tijuana.

238
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:40,777
Whoever was on that plane was working
pretty hard to hide where it was going.

239
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:42,345
The route ends
at a private landing strip

240
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,314
just outside
Starling City.

241
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:45,515
When did it
land?

242
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:48,151
The night before
Sara was murdered.

243
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:53,857
Please! All I do
is fly the plane!

244
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,358
Quiet!

245
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,526
The man in this photo--

246
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:58,795
did you fly him
from Corto Maltese

247
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:01,197
to Starling City?
No.

248
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,836
This time,
look at the photo!

249
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:08,771
He'll kill me.

250
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:11,508
He's not here. We are.

251
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,510
All right, ok, yes,
I flew him here.

252
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:16,212
I've got security footage,
you want to see?

253
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:17,881
Hanukkah present?

254
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:20,583
Security footage from the airfield
where Merlyn landed.

255
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:23,419
Check
for October seventh.

256
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:29,182
Right there,
stop.

257
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,077
I thought you said Merlyn was keeping
his distance from Thea,

258
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,213
that he hadn't had
any contact.

259
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,848
He lied.

260
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,452
And so did she.

261
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,386
Maybe there's something
we should consider here.

262
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,388
Maybe it wasn't your DNA, Oliver,
maybe it was Thea's.

263
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,457
What?
You two are siblings.

264
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,492
There would be overlap, maybe
even enough to--

265
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:14,494
Diggle, are you
listening to yourself?

266
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:16,830
You're suggesting that
Thea killed Sara.

267
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,531
Even if--even if she would,

268
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,166
even if she could...

269
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,694
Why?

270
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,560
Well, Malcolm Merlyn
is her father.

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I hate to even say this.

272
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,853
Then don't.

273
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:30,421
Oliver...

274
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:31,989
I know how much
you love your sister,

275
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,258
but we have to look
at the facts.

276
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,093
The virtual autopsy
I did on Sara;

277
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:37,528
I thought Roy might
have stabbed her

278
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,497
because the trajectory
wasn't consistent

279
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:41,566
with that of an archer
of average height.

280
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:43,534
You weren't considering
a killer of Thea's size.

281
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:45,336
Enough, both of you!

282
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:48,172
My sister
did not kill Sara.

283
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:49,507
The DNA on
the arrows is mine

284
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:52,843
because Malcolm Merlyn
put it there.

285
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:59,183
Hi.

286
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:00,585
Hey, uh,
we need to talk,

287
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,020
so I came here.
Here where?

288
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,689
Where you are.

289
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:08,125
I might have pinged
your phone...again.

290
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,696
I thought I was pretty clear when I
said I didn't want to talk about this.

291
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:13,998
You were.

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,133
But you were
also pretty wrong

293
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:19,036
when you said
I regretted kissing you.

294
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:21,839
I can't imagine
there's a man on the planet

295
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:24,575
who would ever
regret kissing you.

296
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:26,377
Well, I can think of one.

297
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,181
But I am sorry about
the way I reacted.

298
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:35,252
When I kissed you,
I felt guilty.

299
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:37,221
Oh, my God,
you're cheating on someone.

300
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:39,824
No.

301
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:42,026
Her name is Anna,

302
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:44,862
and we were engaged.

303
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,932
Last spring,
the night those men...

304
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,700
took over the city,

305
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:53,170
we ran into a few.
We tried to escape, but we couldn't.

306
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:55,206
I tried to fight them,
but I couldn't.

307
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,109
I wasn't strong
enough. I...

308
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:00,845
They broke my leg,

309
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:03,214
and went after her,

310
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:06,017
but I couldn't
save her.

311
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,419
And I watched
them...

312
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:11,889
as they broke
her neck.

313
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,725
Ray, I am so sorry.

314
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:17,595
Anna was supposed
to be the last woman I ever kissed.

315
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,730
And she was,

316
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,899
until suddenly
I was kissing you.

317
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:41,519
Hey!

318
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:42,477
What are you doing home?

319
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,597
I wanted the Christmas
tree to be a surprise.

320
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:47,224
It's a surprise.

321
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:49,427
I thought since it was
just the two of us now,

322
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:52,396
smaller the family,
bigger the tree.

323
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:54,365
What about Malcolm?

324
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,568
Thea, I know you saw him
in Corto Maltese.

325
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,905
Ollie, we've
lost everyone. I--

326
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:04,709
Malcolm's the only
family I have left besides you.

327
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:08,279
Thea, I deserve
to know what

328
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:09,947
you've been doing
with Malcolm Merlyn.

329
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:11,816
I've just been getting
to know him, that's all.

330
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:13,117
A couple of months ago,
did you fly back

331
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,719
to Starling City
with him?

332
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:16,253
No!

333
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:18,155
Ollie, if I was back
in Starling City,

334
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:19,857
don't you think
I would have called you?

335
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,259
I was in Corto Maltese
since May.

336
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,595
Now will you please just...

337
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:28,065
Come upstairs and help me
find some more Christmas stuff?

338
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,234
Ok.

339
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:50,187
What's
he saying?

340
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,022
He's trying to bribe us.

341
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:57,428
We want the vial
of Omega you stole.

342
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,363
I don't know
what you're talking about!

343
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,998
I didn't steal
anything!

344
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,134
Don't waste
your energy on lies.

345
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,169
We will get
the truth from you--

346
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:08,305
one way or the other.

347
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:11,008
My friend can be
very persuasive.

348
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:20,251
So, how are you?

349
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:22,820
Mmm. I'm great.

350
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:25,990
Work's great.
I--I've just been really busy.

351
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:27,658
Something's happened.
What?

352
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,227
No. No,
nothing's happened.

353
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:32,763
It's Sara.

354
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,198
Isn't it?

355
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,167
When I mentioned her earlier,

356
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,403
you seemed so...broken.

357
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:42,673
Mom,
Sara's fine.

358
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,942
She's just
being Sara.

359
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:49,346
There are few things
as powerful as a mother's intuition.

360
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:53,317
You are hiding something.
I know it.

361
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:57,555
Just like I was the only one who knew
that Sara didn't die on that boat.

362
00:17:57,557 --> 00:18:00,724
I have this feeling
that I would see her again.

363
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:03,194
And right now,

364
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:06,030
that feeling...

365
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:08,432
is gone.

366
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,351
She's dead...

367
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,486
isn't she?

368
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:20,189
Mom, listen to me.

369
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:23,893
Sara, she was involved with some
very, very dangerous people.

370
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,895
This has
to remain a secret,

371
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,164
at least until we figure out
exactly what happened.

372
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,599
I don't understand.

373
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:31,067
Doesn't your father know?

374
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,303
If he knew
about Sara...

375
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:36,739
He couldn't take it.

376
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:43,112
And I can't lose
anyone else.

377
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:42,071
Father.

378
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:45,608
It's nearly time.

379
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,045
Mr. Queen has not yet
presented the guilty?

380
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:53,416
Perhaps he believes
our threats are empty.

381
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:55,918
We must correct that belief.

382
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,096
Return to Starling City.

383
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,331
Be merciless.

384
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,901
Teach Oliver Queen
we only ask but once.

385
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:07,447
Where you been?

386
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:09,314
I went
to see Thea.

387
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:13,018
She lied to me again,
but she didn't kill Sara.

388
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,152
Oliver...

389
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:15,721
I looked her in
the eyes, Felicity.

390
00:20:15,723 --> 00:20:17,889
These are eyes
that I have known my entire life.

391
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:21,326
She could lie to me about
Merlyn and spending time with him,

392
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:22,861
but she could
never do this.

393
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:25,097
Oliver, you are one
of the smartest men

394
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,409
I have ever known,

395
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,896
but you have a blind spot
when it comes to your family.

396
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:29,525
Not this time--

397
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:31,266
First your mother,
then your father,

398
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,566
and now Thea.
That's enough, Diggle!

399
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:33,634
You know she lied
to you, Oliver!

400
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:35,536
Both of you, stop!

401
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:36,770
Oliver,

402
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:39,406
I can't imagine
how difficult

403
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:42,276
this must be for you,
but John is right.

404
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:43,597
Thea lied.

405
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:44,646
She lied about Merlyn!

406
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:46,613
But Sara...

407
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:50,817
I don't want to believe that she can
do something like this.

408
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:55,455
Which is why you shouldn't be
the one asking the questions.

409
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,810
Thea Queen!

410
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:20,013
Where is
Malcolm Merlyn?

411
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:23,116
I don't know! Please,
please don't hurt me!

412
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:33,678
Stay away from me
and my father!

413
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:59,725
It's the strangest thing.

414
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,426
Thea just called

415
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:04,928
and said she was
attacked by the Arrow.

416
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,937
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that,

417
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:08,871
now would you, Oliver?

418
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:11,274
This was you.

419
00:22:11,637 --> 00:22:13,870
You know, I figured

420
00:22:13,872 --> 00:22:17,474
when I spared the man who
murdered my mother,

421
00:22:17,476 --> 00:22:20,110
I would never
kill again.

422
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:24,247
I was wrong.

423
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:26,452
You might want to reconsider.

424
00:22:26,477 --> 00:22:27,286
Why?!

425
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:28,752
For Thea.

426
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:34,191
Check your phone.

427
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,659
I can wait.

428
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:52,174
I don't think you want
the League to see that.

429
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:55,144
And if you kill me,
they will.

430
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:57,179
This isn't her.

431
00:22:57,181 --> 00:23:00,316
Have you ever
heard of a plant called Votura?

432
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:03,619
Grows in South America.
In fact, it thrives in Corto Maltese,

433
00:23:03,621 --> 00:23:07,089
making the subject extremely
susceptible to suggestion,

434
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:10,192
or retaining no memory
of their actions.

435
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:14,897
I will tell Ra's this was you,
that Thea was under your control.

436
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:17,600
And he will still kill her.
She fired the arrows.

437
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:19,368
You have given her
a death sentence.

438
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,103
No.

439
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:24,607
What I've done
is given you incentive.

440
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:25,941
To do what?

441
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:29,345
To tell Ra's that
you killed Sara Lance.

442
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:31,080
By right, you will be
given a trial by combat--

443
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:33,582
with Ra's.

444
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:37,653
His death will erase
any blood debt from his reign,

445
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:40,055
including Thea's.

446
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:42,224
And yours.

447
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,894
I have to be honest--

448
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:48,030
it was my concern that
the whole killing thing

449
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:50,132
would have been
a dealbreaker for you.

450
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:54,803
But, uh, I'm gratified
to see that Thea

451
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:58,107
is still sufficient
motivation.

452
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,476
Don't take too long
making up your mind.

453
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:03,646
Ra's isn't known
for his patience.

454
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:06,649
Thea was always so kind.

455
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:09,018
Kindest person
I've ever known.

456
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,821
My sister wasn't
born a killer.

457
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:15,190
Malcolm Merlyn
made her one,

458
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:16,792
and I let it happen.

459
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:19,295
No, you didn't.

460
00:24:19,297 --> 00:24:20,929
When it comes to your family,
you always place the blame

461
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:23,098
on yourself,
but this is not your fault.

462
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,768
She's right, Oliver.
Throw Malcolm in front of Ra's,

463
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,836
let the League
sort this out.

464
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:29,638
Merlyn has a video.

465
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,141
He made contingencies.

466
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:33,909
Oliver, if you
fight Ra's al Ghul,

467
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:35,077
he'll kill you.

468
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,579
No, he won't.

469
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,315
During the Undertaking,
Merlyn told me

470
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:40,983
that I couldn't win,

471
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:43,952
because I didn't know
what I was fighting for.

472
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:46,689
Now I do.

473
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:49,425
I'm fighting for Thea.

474
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:56,932
He should have
confessed by now.

475
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:59,868
We have video evidence of him
taking the vials.

476
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,403
He says he doesn't remember.

477
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:03,339
He's lying! You don't
do something like that

478
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:05,574
and not remember it!
There is a way.

479
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:08,344
I didn't think it
a possibility until now.

480
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:11,513
There's a drug.
It's called Votura.

481
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:15,384
I've heard it makes people extremely
susceptible to suggestion.

482
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:18,153
Like mind control?

483
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:21,023
Really,
that's a thing?

484
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:22,658
Those who get dosed
often have no memory

485
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,860
of what they do
while under the influence.

486
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:27,463
Oh, great. All this
was for nothing?

487
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:29,298
Chien Na Wei
has the vile,

488
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,767
and we have no way
of finding her!

489
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,536
We've taken her inside man.

490
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:37,206
Finding her may not be
the problem at hand.

491
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:40,008
The problem could be
her finding us.

492
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:51,420
Hello, Mrs. Yamashiro.
Is your husband home?

493
00:25:57,595 --> 00:25:59,595
Don't you dare
talk to my son!

494
00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:01,930
Quaint house...

495
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:04,099
for a spy.

496
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:06,268
Except for these.

497
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,036
They belong to you,
don't they?

498
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:10,372
Tatsu, isn't it?

499
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:14,943
Beautiful blade.

500
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:40,436
Where is he?

501
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:42,404
You really think
my father,

502
00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:45,674
the Demon's head, would travel
all the way from Nanda Parbat

503
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,309
simply because you wished it?

504
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:48,944
Yes.

505
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:52,614
This way.

506
00:26:58,455 --> 00:27:02,157
Kneel before
the Demon's head.

507
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:19,241
You're just a boy.

508
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:23,346
Well, Mr. Queen,

509
00:27:23,347 --> 00:27:26,014
you failed to protect
the city you love.

510
00:27:26,015 --> 00:27:27,547
Now you'll watch it bleed.

511
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:31,057
Nobody in my city
will die tonight.

512
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:33,218
Well.

513
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,821
There was only one way
to prevent that.

514
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:37,789
You were to produce
for me the one

515
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,692
who killed
Ta-er Al-Sahfer.

516
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:43,462
And yet
you've come alone.

517
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:46,431
Because it was me.

518
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:50,211
I killed Sara.

519
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,679
Why would you kill a woman
you once professed to love?

520
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:54,714
Because she
begged me to.

521
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,683
You lie.

522
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:04,880
It wasn't the first time Sara chose
death over a life in the League.

523
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:07,281
And meeting you now,

524
00:28:07,283 --> 00:28:08,783
I can see why.

525
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:13,955
I should have Sarab cleave
your head from your shoulders.

526
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:16,157
Not for killing
my daughter's beloved,

527
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,526
but for thinking me a fool.

528
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:20,761
By League law,
I have the right

529
00:28:20,763 --> 00:28:24,098
to challenge you to
a trial by combat.

530
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:31,844
It's been 67 years
since a man challenged me.

531
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:35,445
You covet death that much?

532
00:28:35,445 --> 00:28:38,013
Do you accept?

533
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:40,482
Oh, yes.

534
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:05,125
I see the years have done little
to dull your stubbornness.

535
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:05,657
Maseo...

536
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:06,797
My name is Sarab!

537
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,132
You told me once a man cannot
live by two names.

538
00:29:09,134 --> 00:29:10,733
And I don't.

539
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:12,769
Maseo is dead.

540
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:15,438
I am all that's left, Sarab.

541
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,974
A phantom.

542
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:21,744
After it happened,

543
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:24,714
you went
to Nanda Parbat.

544
00:29:24,716 --> 00:29:27,583
I arrived the same year
as Ta-er Al-Sahfer.

545
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:30,820
She was a great warrior.

546
00:29:30,822 --> 00:29:32,955
You did not kill her.

547
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:37,607
When you face the Demon,

548
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:40,475
it will be my duty
to bear witness.

549
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:42,943
I have no desire
to watch you die.

550
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:44,612
Under our code,

551
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:47,615
you have 12 hours
to settle your affairs.

552
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:50,652
The 13th hour,
be at this place.

553
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:54,755
This location is consecrated
ground for the League.

554
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,825
A place for the settlement
of blood debts--

555
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:59,527
if one survives the climb.

556
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:02,764
If you do.

557
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:05,099
See you
on the mountain.

558
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:11,239
Do you remember how when
the two of you were little,

559
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:13,441
you'd play dress up?

560
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:15,810
One day I overheard
you and Sara.

561
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:17,879
You were pretending

562
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:22,050
to be grown-up
versions of yourselves.

563
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:24,786
That day, you
and your sister,

564
00:30:24,788 --> 00:30:27,355
you had your own
families.

565
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:29,824
Careers.

566
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:31,993
I was a cop, just like dad.

567
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:33,361
And Sara...

568
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:35,463
Was a doctor.

569
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:38,399
She wanted
to heal people.

570
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,505
She deserves
more than this.

571
00:30:48,544 --> 00:30:51,012
Mom, can I tell you
something?

572
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:53,147
Whoever did this to Sara,

573
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:56,184
I am going to find them
no matter what it takes.

574
00:30:56,186 --> 00:30:58,753
And I am going
to make them pay.

575
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:05,760
Then you
make them pay.

576
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:09,831
And you make them
suffer.

577
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:16,838
Looks good.

578
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,040
That window
should be as good as new.

579
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:20,575
Thank you.

580
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:22,944
What happened
to the window?

581
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:24,746
Oh, God, you should
have seen it.

582
00:31:24,748 --> 00:31:27,215
This bird went completely
Hitchcock on the thing.

583
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:28,850
I vacuumed up
most the glass,

584
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:30,285
but I'd still watch your step.

585
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:32,453
I'll be
extra careful.

586
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:35,523
Are you ok?

587
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:37,892
Last time you had
that look on your face,

588
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:40,461
you told me dad
committed suicide.

589
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:42,397
You haven't
called him dad

590
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,265
since you found out
about Malcolm.

591
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:48,369
What's going in
with you, Ollie?

592
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:50,605
You think you know who
Malcolm Merlyn is.

593
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:52,941
But there are things that
I've discovered,

594
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:57,045
years ago,
recently, that...

595
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:59,981
He doesn't
love you, Thea.

596
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:02,784
Because he's not
capable of it.

597
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:04,786
Ollie, please.

598
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:06,955
Don't.

599
00:32:06,957 --> 00:32:10,625
Don't make me choose
between my father

600
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:12,126
and my brother.

601
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:15,596
I would never
make you choose.

602
00:32:15,598 --> 00:32:18,666
You are my family.

603
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:21,336
There's nothing
that I won't do to protect you.

604
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:24,405
What does that mean?

605
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,878
It means I love you,

606
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,014
no matter what.

607
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:42,490
Tatsu?

608
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:45,193
Akio! What happened here?

609
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:49,163
Oh, God, no.
No, no, no!

610
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,765
Akio, no!

611
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,633
Daddy!
Akio!

612
00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:55,870
Akio, where is your mother?

613
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:58,840
The white-haired
woman! She took her!

614
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:06,948
Guess who just designed
a microprocessor

615
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,417
with a SPECint score
just north of 9,000?

616
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,719
Ray...What are you doing

617
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:14,622
with Queen Consolidated?
Why did you buy it?

618
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:16,557
Because it was
for sale.

619
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,761
My life is a little more
complicated than I let on.

620
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:22,497
Suffice it to say, I have gotten
very good at keeping secrets,

621
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:25,666
particularly the kind of secrets
someone like you keeps.

622
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:28,703
Someone in pain.

623
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:30,705
Wasn't easy for me to tell you
about Anna.

624
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:32,940
You told me about Anna,
but you didn't tell me the truth

625
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:34,709
about what it is you're doing.

626
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:36,778
So tell me, or I walk.

627
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,747
I can't tell you.

628
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:42,183
I have to show you.

629
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:48,089
The dawn
of the computer age,

630
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:50,324
developers thought
the only way a machine

631
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:52,360
could process information
as fast as a human brain

632
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,896
was to build a mainframe
the size of Texas.

633
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:57,331
But one developer
realized that the only way

634
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,033
to reduce heat
and power consumption

635
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:01,335
was to bring the components
closer together.

636
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:03,704
Which meant
making them smaller.

637
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:05,573
But why stop
at computers?

638
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:07,809
What if it could
take other things,

639
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:09,777
like, say, all of
the military-grade technology

640
00:34:09,779 --> 00:34:11,212
in Applied Sciences,

641
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:14,115
and make it smaller,
too? So small

642
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:16,551
that it can fit in
the palm of my hand.

643
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:19,287
I can help a lot
of people that way.

644
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:21,522
- I don't understand.
- This will help.

645
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:28,629
Whoa.

646
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:31,232
What is it?
OMAC

647
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:33,134
is a Queen Consolidated
designation.

648
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:37,205
But I'm kind of partial
to A.T.O.M.

649
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:39,407
Advanced Technology
Operating Mechanism.

650
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,942
A.T.O.M.

651
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:42,577
What are you going
to use it for?

652
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:44,479
To protect
the people of this city.

653
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:47,482
And I want you
to help me.

654
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:51,652
Why does this keep
happening to me?

655
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:54,760
Oliver...

656
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,594
John, I have to do this.

657
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:58,496
I know.

658
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,064
I'd just rather die than let you
go it alone.

659
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:03,134
Not this time.

660
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,142
Take care of Thea.

661
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,747
Absolutely.

662
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,242
I'm sorry.

663
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:14,445
Something came up...

664
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:16,743
No.

665
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:21,988
Let's give them
a minute.

666
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:26,768
So you're going?

667
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:27,616
Mm-hmm.

668
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,082
To Nanda Parbat?

669
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:30,550
No, it's a neutral site.

670
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:33,787
It'll be fine.
I'll come back.

671
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:36,589
Thea will be ok.

672
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:39,192
I wish that sounded
more convincing.

673
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:41,628
And I wish you wouldn't go, but
I know you better,

674
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,296
so I'm not going
to ask you to stay.

675
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:46,466
I appreciate that.

676
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:48,401
But there is
one thing

677
00:35:48,403 --> 00:35:50,937
I need
to ask you to do.

678
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,506
And you're not
going to want to.

679
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:56,609
Well, if it's you
asking, I'll do it.

680
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:58,511
Kill him.

681
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:02,182
You have to kill
Ra's al Ghul.

682
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:04,717
This is a duel...
Oliver,

683
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:07,353
with one of the most dangerous men
that has ever walked the earth.

684
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:09,522
I wouldn't be doing it
if I didn't think I could win.

685
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:12,859
I don't doubt that.
I don't doubt that you can beat him.

686
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:16,362
I am terrified that
you won't kill him.

687
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:18,665
Because that's not
who you are anymore.

688
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:21,401
And I am so afraid
that Ra's al Ghul

689
00:36:21,403 --> 00:36:23,970
is going to use
your humanity against you.

690
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:27,473
Felicity,
I honestly don't know

691
00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:29,008
if I'm a killer anymore.

692
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,044
But I do know two things--

693
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:33,546
the first is that...

694
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:36,015
whoever I am,

695
00:36:36,017 --> 00:36:40,086
I am someone that will
do whatever--whatever--

696
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:44,490
it takes to save my sister.

697
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:01,995
And the second thing?

698
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,726
I love you.

699
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:40,342
Remove your shirt.

700
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:43,545
This is custom.

701
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:46,381
Ra's al Ghul is not know
to be merciful.

702
00:37:46,383 --> 00:37:48,183
But if there was a chance,

703
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:51,987
this will be your final
moment for it.

704
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:56,844
Choose your weapon.

705
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:10,358
I was 11 years old
when I killed my first man.

706
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:16,131
I remember the look
in his face

707
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:18,934
when the light went out
behind his eyes.

708
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:22,170
Such a sudden change,

709
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:25,107
almost imperceptible,

710
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:28,110
between life and death.

711
00:38:28,112 --> 00:38:29,644
And I felt ashamed.

712
00:38:29,646 --> 00:38:31,346
I had stolen
from that man

713
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:33,014
the most precious
gift of all--

714
00:38:33,016 --> 00:38:34,916
life.

715
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:38,620
But I also felt
something else--

716
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:41,156
pride,

717
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,158
because I had taken up arms
against someone

718
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,761
who sought to do ill
against my family.

719
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:50,699
And I realized what I had
done was necessary.

720
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:52,501
You see...

721
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:56,505
I had replaced evil
with death.

722
00:38:58,374 --> 00:38:59,708
And that...

723
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,612
is what the League
exists to do.

724
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:06,615
And I have killed several
thousand more men since then.

725
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:10,065
And the world
is better off for it.

726
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:13,034
You've taken
your last life.

727
00:39:13,036 --> 00:39:14,635
No.

728
00:39:14,637 --> 00:39:16,704
You have lived your last day.

729
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:19,640
We are ready.

730
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:24,412
I am envious of you.

731
00:39:24,414 --> 00:39:26,781
You will see her
before I do.

732
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:32,453
Fight me, boy.

733
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:36,057
You're unnarmed.

734
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:39,260
I'll take your blades from you once
you are through with them.

735
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,655
You should take pride.

736
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,826
You survived
longer than most.

737
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,344
Don't be afraid,
my son.

738
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,715
Death comes for us all.

739
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:10,151
We can only
evade it so long.

740
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,874
Consider this
an honorable exit.
