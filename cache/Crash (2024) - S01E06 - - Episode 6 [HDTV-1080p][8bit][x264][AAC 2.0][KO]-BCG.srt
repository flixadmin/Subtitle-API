1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,327
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,543
EPISODE 6

5
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,254
The bulletin board?
The murderer?

6
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,215
How did someone like him
become a police officer?

7
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,176
How embarrassing.

8
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,344
Unbelievable.

9
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,651
Hey.

10
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,787
The post on the website
of Seoul Metropolitan Police--

11
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,996
You're right.

12
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,791
It's about me.

13
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,253
Everything is true.

14
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,299
I was prepared for it.

15
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,594
If a problem arises,
I'll take responsibility.

16
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,723
I didn't come here to say that.

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,186
Fine. Let's talk about this openly.

18
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,355
It'll be a problem, of course.

19
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,856
Someone wrote a malicious post.

20
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,443
On top of that, you're in a team
that deals with traffic crimes.

21
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,781
Why a police officer?

22
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,950
You could've taken the easy way.

23
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,456
I didn't want to run away.

24
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,129
Running away won't erase the memories.

25
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,884
Is that why you don't drive?

26
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,512
It's because of that accident.

27
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,888
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,891
I'll make sure
I don't cause trouble to the team.

29
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,062
You caused trouble to the team in one way.

30
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,523
You weren't honest with your teammates.

31
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,616
CRASH

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,577
This is about Cha Yeonho,
right?

33
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,498
Gosh, who knew he had such a past.

34
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,666
Hello, sir.

35
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,834
Hello.

36
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,629
- Good morning, Director General.
- Hello.

37
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,340
Did something happen?

38
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,302
Director General, didn't you hear?

39
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,928
It's about Cha Yeonho.

40
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,347
The bulletin board is in an uproar.

41
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,484
HOW CAN A MURDERER
BECOME A POLICE OFFICER?

42
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,237
HOW COULD A MURDERER
BE A POLICE OFFICER?

43
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,323
- Did you see the bulletin board?
- You saw it too?

44
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,991
- Yes. What are we going to do?
- What will happen?

45
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,203
- Good morning.
- Hello.

46
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,454
About Inspector Cha…

47
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,462
- Is Captain not here yet?
- Yes. Chief called him over.

48
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,380
- Chief?
- Yes.

49
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,011
Okay.

50
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,270
Let's have Cha Yeonho
take a break for a while.

51
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,234
How will we work
with the atmosphere so hectic?

52
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,653
The joint investigation unit is here too.

53
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,781
Until we receive orders
from the headquarters,

54
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:04,744
I think we should put Cha Yeonho
on leave or something.

55
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,329
There's no reason to do that.

56
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,457
It doesn't raise any legal issues either.

57
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,334
I mean-- Goodness.

58
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,714
It's not about the law.
It goes against the public sentiment.

59
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,299
It ruffles the public sentiment.

60
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,884
There are national petitions too.

61
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,637
They want Cha Yeonho expelled.
They want him fired.

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,556
There are so many posts.

63
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,351
HQ said they'll be sending
inspection officers too.

64
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,186
I understand how you feel.

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,816
But this time,
being stubborn won't solve the matter.

66
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,317
I'm not being stubborn.

67
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,156
I'm the one responsible
for hiring Cha Yeonho.

68
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,451
If problems arise,
I'll take full responsibility.

69
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,414
So, please just trust me and watch me.

70
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,005
For goodness' sake.

71
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,301
He's such a nuisance.
Human resources is the most important.

72
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,095
What's wrong with him? How frustrating.

73
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,684
Did you call for me?

74
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,523
HOW CAN A MURDERER
BECOME A POLICE OFFICER?

75
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,195
Find out who posted it.

76
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,449
Yes, sir. I'll look into it.

77
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,210
What did Chief say?

78
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,671
What? Nothing much.

79
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,882
Why?

80
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,887
This is TCI.

81
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,848
Okay.

82
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,642
The DNA analysis result is out.

83
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,358
Inspector Cha.

84
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,568
Go and check the result.

85
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,112
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,581
What'll happen to Inspector Cha?

87
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,166
I don't know.

88
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,544
An interview with the deceased's family
tells me that it got resolved.

89
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,712
What's strange is that

90
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,424
the victim's family
kept in touch with Inspector Cha.

91
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,177
Goodness.

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,429
Then is that why he still can't drive?

93
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,431
It must be why he rides a bicycle.

94
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,392
Inspector Cha

95
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,353
must have had a hard time.

96
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,414
Hello.

97
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,460
- Hello.
- Thank you for your hard work.

98
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,504
I should've known when you guys acted out.

99
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,257
You're here.
I didn't think I'd see you again.

100
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,135
- Let's eat.
- Okay, Superintendent.

101
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,886
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

102
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,763
How about jjamppong, sir?

103
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,889
- Sounds good.
- Good choice.

104
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,683
DNA ANALYSIS REPORT

105
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,227
THE DNA DOES NOT MATCH
WITH ANY SUSPECTS

106
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,271
Thank you.

107
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,648
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

108
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,361
It's too bad.

109
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,613
It was an interesting approach.

110
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,499
The car thief isn't the serial rapist?

111
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,589
Then Inspector Cha's theory--

112
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,756
It was incorrect.

113
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,433
It's for the best.

114
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,686
We can keep investigating the car thief
like we've been doing.

115
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,564
Let's pick up the pace.

116
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,609
We know for sure
that the method was scissoring.

117
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,863
Donggi, list the ex-convicts
who have committed the same crime.

118
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,157
Hyunkyung, go to the 112 center

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,117
and find Seo Yujung's stolen car.

120
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,911
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,126
Inspector Cha.

122
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,004
Aren't you going to work?

123
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:29,884
If your theory turned out to be incorrect,
you should try to make up for it.

124
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,388
Moping around won't make the culprit
turn himself in, will it?

125
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,934
Did you join our team to be like this?

126
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,480
If things are too hard,
you can find a different job.

127
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,196
Let's go.

128
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,282
At times like this,
we need to move our bodies.

129
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,579
Can you drop me off on the way
at the Seoul Metropolitan Police?

130
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,956
It isn't on the way.

131
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,917
What are you saying? It is.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,834
No, it isn't.

133
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,641
Director General.

134
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,519
We received a call
from National Forensic Service.

135
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,647
They found another set of DNA
from the scissors the culprit used.

136
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,731
What?

137
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,861
But it didn't match the DNA
from the cigarette butts anyway.

138
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,613
As for the cigarette butts,

139
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,325
we can't be certain
if the culprit smoked one of them.

140
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,327
It's too strange.

141
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,665
The locations and dates are too similar
for it to be a coincidence.

142
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,840
- Request a reanalysis.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,113
It wasn't me.

144
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,575
I'm leading an honest life, so go.

145
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,368
Do you have an alibi?

146
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,870
I don't know. Go.

147
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,747
It's a red Pride from 2010.

148
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,001
It was stolen after August 26th.
Please search this area.

149
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,253
Excuse me. Hello.

150
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,463
You're Choi Seokhyun, right?

151
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,674
Can you tell me where you were
on Thursday, August 29th?

152
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,388
- Mr. Kim Hyungwoo?
- What?

153
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,641
I'm Lieutenant Min Sohee
of Namgang Police Station.

154
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,685
Do you remember where you were
on August 29th?

155
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,437
I was at home.

156
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,291
What happened?

157
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,211
This afternoon, it was caught
on a parking enforcement camera.

158
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,170
I see.

159
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,464
Fortunately, it popped up
as a wanted vehicle.

160
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,465
I see.

161
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,844
- My goodness.
- It's so clean.

162
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,180
I think he cleaned it up
to not leave any evidence.

163
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,057
Let's go inside.

164
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,232
- He took the SD card already.
- I see.

165
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,411
Women who work in the office
carry heels in their car just in case.

166
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,496
Heels are inconvenient for driving.

167
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,248
Isn't it strange?

168
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,794
If he was going to get rid of it,
why steal it in the first place?

169
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,637
Put it down. It makes you look weird
when you keep holding it like that.

170
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,139
Hurry up and put it down.

171
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,598
The silver Festa.

172
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,935
Did the car that ran over Jung Geunso

173
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,311
also not have an SD card?

174
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,688
Yes, of course.

175
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,773
He wanted to cover his trails.

176
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,404
If you were the culprit,

177
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,742
how would you find out
the victims' personal information?

178
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,787
The driver's identity, workplace,
and home.

179
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,748
The dashcam.

180
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,918
I see. Okay.

181
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,380
Let's see if there were similar cases
in previous reports.

182
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,310
POLICE STATEMENT
CHO MOONJU

183
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,728
INSIDE THE VEHICLE

184
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,820
- You found it.
- Yes.

185
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,281
The pattern is the same
as Seo Yujung's case.

186
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,533
Cho Moonju, age 34. A female driver.

187
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,994
There were many women's items in the car.

188
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,162
As you can see,

189
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,915
her self-defense stun gun,
dash cam, and SD card were stolen.

190
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,001
I'll give her a call.
Let's meet her tomorrow.

191
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,045
Let's set off early in the morning.

192
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,672
We should meet her
before she leaves for work.

193
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,968
- Do you ever sleep?
- Enough to stay awake.

194
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,472
Is it because the DNA wasn't a match?

195
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,392
You're working hard.

196
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,645
Not that I'm saying
you didn't work hard in the past.

197
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,563
Perhaps, it could be

198
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,650
my last case.

199
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,407
Inspector Cha.

200
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:48,994
See you tomorrow.

201
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,542
Bye.

202
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,601
- Are you going to work?
- Yes.

203
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,571
You're Ms. Cho Moonju, right?
I called yesterday.

204
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,700
I told you that I have nothing to say.

205
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,826
I need to go to work.

206
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,996
Were the items stolen from your car
returned to you?

207
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,794
Let's talk in the car.

208
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,089
Please wait.

209
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,149
What do you want to ask?

210
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,986
Okay.
Well, was a stolen item returned to you?

211
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,529
No.

212
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,823
Had that happened to me,
I would've reported it.

213
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,495
I see. I'm not trying
to pry information from you.

214
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,331
I'm telling you that nothing happened.

215
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,047
If that's all, I'm going to go.
I need to go to work.

216
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,089
Okay.

217
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,258
Oh. Here.

218
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,512
If you ever have anything to say…

219
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,395
Okay.

220
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,605
Ms. Cho Moonju.

221
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,401
Call me anytime if you need help.

222
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,779
Not as a police officer,

223
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,864
but as a fellow woman.

224
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,230
What did she say?

225
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,775
She said it didn't happen.
None of the items were returned to her.

226
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,360
But,

227
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,072
there was a pink stun gun in the car.

228
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,411
A pink stun gun
was in the list of missing items.

229
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,084
If Ms. Cho Moonju is a rape victim--

230
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,838
It must be the same culprit
who broke into Seo Yujung's house.

231
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,008
The SD card went missing
and a stolen item was returned to her.

232
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,762
So why was the DNA result different?

233
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:05,482
He threatens with a weapon, ties up
the victim, and ejaculates externally.

234
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,652
He takes the victim's hair or belongings
as a trophy.

235
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,447
He leaves the victim in a naked state

236
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,699
or makes her take a shower
to get rid of evidence

237
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,243
and delay the report time to the police.

238
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,454
The culprit is a controlling type.
That means--

239
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,580
That means?

240
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,670
He's likely to commit another crime
in a short period of time.

241
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,011
- Superintendent So.
- Yes?

242
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,764
Are you looking into ex-convicts
with similar records?

243
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,558
Yes, we're investigating the sex offenders

244
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,603
who live
in the four neighboring precincts.

245
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,813
But as of now,

246
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,067
we already have their DNA records,

247
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,778
- so we would've gotten it if--
- My goodness.

248
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,157
The joint investigation unit
was set up ten days ago.

249
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,836
Listen.

250
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,422
If a serial rapist's DNA

251
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:15,469
isn't in the database,
there must be a reason, don't you think?

252
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,263
He's either a first-time offender
or a minor.

253
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,434
Collect DNA from every single person
who's suspicious.

254
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,646
We'll catch the suspect this week
no matter what.

255
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,244
We can't collect DNA as we want
in this day and age.

256
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,329
The law changed ages ago.

257
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,208
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

258
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,794
It's a 100% match
with the DNA from the scissors.

259
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,714
Who else knows this?

260
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,260
Only the National Forensic Service and us.

261
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,763
Well done.

262
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,684
Hey, keep this off the record for now.

263
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,227
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

264
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,656
Korando Turismo.

265
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,120
Did you meet Kang Minchul?

266
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,746
It isn't Kang Minchul.

267
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,167
I'm at the hospital.
He has been hospitalized.

268
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,836
He hurt his back last month
at a construction site.

269
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,382
- Did you check the hospital records?
- <i>Yes, I did.</i>

270
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,050
Then Kang Minchul is out.

271
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,680
- Well done. Let's talk at the station.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

272
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,980
PARK SUNGJIN

273
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,481
Park Sungjin.

274
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,369
What brings you here?
You must be very busy.

275
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,165
Gosh, I came here to take a breather
because I was too busy.

276
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,129
Things are hectic, but we have
no process with the investigation.

277
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,715
Meanwhile, HQ is pressuring me
for results.

278
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,885
Oh, dear. It seems like my team
wasted your precious time.

279
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,387
Not at all. The suspicion was warranted.

280
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,140
His name is Cha Yeonho, right?

281
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,892
He's quite smart.

282
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,895
He's eccentric but quite useful.

283
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,689
But there was a bad rumor.

284
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,484
I heard that he caused trouble
in the past.

285
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,362
There were no issues with the procedure,
so it'll be resolved.

286
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,367
I hope so.
He's the first to catch my eye in a while.

287
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,913
Is he a suspect?

288
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,209
Yes. The car thief.

289
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,628
Though we don't know for sure yet.

290
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,096
Is there anything else?

291
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,770
Oh, right. Was it called scissoring?

292
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,273
It's an old method.

293
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,484
Why do you think it came up again
after all this time?

294
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,201
He's a convict
who has been discharged recently, right?

295
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,203
He couldn't commit crimes for a while.

296
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,705
As expected.

297
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:34,334
Had someone like you joined our team,
work would've been much easier.

298
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,337
Would you like to join?

299
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,759
Why would you want a wolf cub?

300
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,345
You'd be too worried about my fangs
to sleep at night.

301
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,472
You're right.

302
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,309
Wolf cubs like to travel in packs,

303
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,519
so you'd struggle under a loner like me.

304
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,237
Well then. Have a good day.

305
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,239
Captain Loner.

306
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,183
Bring me a list of car thieves
who were discharged

307
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,226
right before the first rape.

308
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,519
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

309
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,942
- Welcome.
- Hello.

310
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,404
Hello, sir. It's me, Jaeyoung.

311
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,114
Have you been well?

312
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,867
- Auntie, two more.
- Two seolleongtang.

313
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,663
Goodness,
I can tell it's a good restaurant.

314
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,083
Don't stay out so late.

315
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,051
Sir, why did you ask to see me?

316
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,638
Why did you write a post about Cha Yeonho?

317
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,640
How did you know?

318
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,600
I told you not to babble about it.

319
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,520
Sir, it wasn't like that.

320
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,398
I suddenly became angry.

321
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,109
It makes no sense
that a punk like him is a police officer.

322
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,366
I'm sorry.

323
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,957
Live quietly for a while.

324
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,669
I'll find the punk
who sent the letter, okay?

325
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,296
Yes, sir.

326
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,222
- Eat.
- Yes, sir.

327
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,703
Inspector Cha Yeonho, right?

328
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,956
- Who are you?
- We're inspection officers.

329
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,499
Let's talk.

330
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,300
Gosh, it's my first time seeing
something like this.

331
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,178
Inspection officers from HQ
in the Traffic Division?

332
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,095
Superintendent Yeom.

333
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,390
I'm just saying.

334
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,393
I'm just used to seeing civil plaintiffs.

335
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,605
What's going on? Who is here?

336
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,360
<i>You served in the army</i>
<i>and graduated from KAIST.</i>

337
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,739
<i>You saw a psychiatrist for a long time
after the accident.</i>

338
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,743
Are you taking any medication right now?

339
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,828
- No.
- Any aftereffects?

340
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,872
Perhaps you keep thinking of the accident

341
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,082
<i>or have sleeping problems.</i>

342
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:09,966
<i>Do you?</i>

343
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,471
Will it pose a problem
in doing my work as a police officer?

344
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,808
Listen up, Inspector Cha.

345
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,229
We're only trying to help you.

346
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,898
You need to be honest
so we can find a way to help.

347
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,530
You need to be honest for me to help you.

348
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,492
I have nightmares at times.

349
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,702
I have trouble having a deep sleep.

350
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,790
I suffer from tinnitus at times.
It lasts 20 to 30 seconds.

351
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,292
When it happens, I see white lights too.

352
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,296
<i>I have muscle spasms
whenever I see the scene of an accident.</i>

353
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,091
But I can control them now.

354
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,217
And it's still hard…

355
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,554
for me to drive.

356
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,392
It may take a while.

357
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,769
Let's wait upstairs.

358
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,728
Okay.

359
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,023
<i>If a TCI member</i>
<i>can't drive,</i>

360
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,150
- <i>you can't do your job, no?</i>
- I'll get going.

361
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,073
<i>You graduated from KAIST.
Why did you become a police officer?</i>

362
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,244
There was a self-defense stun gun
in Cho Moonju's car.

363
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,247
I thought it went missing.

364
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,957
What? Then--

365
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,335
It's similar to Seo Yujung's
case. She got a stolen item back.

366
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,213
Does that mean she was raped?

367
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,299
- Probably.
- How frustrating.

368
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,468
Then she should report it to the police
and catch the culprit.

369
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,264
When it comes to sexual assault cases,
over 90% of them are unknown.

370
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,434
It means that the victims fear
the secondary victimization

371
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,893
from society even more.

372
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,689
We can't blame the victims
for not reporting to the police.

373
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,694
During the car theft,
he sought out his targets.

374
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,529
That piece of garbage.

375
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,032
I believe women's items in the car
are his triggers.

376
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,034
For example, high heels.

377
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,452
From the dashcam videos,

378
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,413
he learns the victims' information
and their daily patterns.

379
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,790
Doesn't that mean
Inspector Cha was correct?

380
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,293
The car thief and the serial rapist
are the same.

381
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,796
So why don't the DNA results match--

382
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,964
Hold on.

383
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,509
Director General Lee was here.

384
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,720
- Why would he come here?
- Who knows?

385
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,849
He seemed very interested
in the car thief we were after.

386
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,024
Hyunkyung, request a reanalysis
with the National Forensic Service.

387
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,317
Okay.

388
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,994
<i>An investigation unit for</i>
<i>the serial rape in the northwestern region</i>

389
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:47,207
<i>was formed ten days ago,
but there are no leads of the suspect.</i>

390
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,542
- <i>The public are growing anxious.</i>
- What will you have, Mrs. Cho?

391
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,045
<i>According to Namgang Police Station…</i>

392
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,880
- Mrs. Cho.
- Yes?

393
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,465
The menu.

394
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,966
Oh, right.

395
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,928
- I'll have this.
- …<i>but the police have no suspects.</i>

396
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,056
<i>The police conducted a DNA analysis
on ex-convicts,</i>

397
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,600
<i>but the situation isn't hopeful.</i>

398
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,853
<i>The culprit's identity has been a mystery
for four months.</i>

399
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,277
Director General Lee Taeju.

400
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,987
What are you playing at?

401
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,781
Why did you lie
about the DNA analysis result?

402
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,118
Oh, that.

403
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,454
I found out just now.
I was going to tell you.

404
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,581
- You expect me to believe that?
- Min Sohee.

405
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,834
- What are you saying?
- Do you really not know?

406
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,713
The car thief and the serial rapist
are the same man!

407
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,178
How…

408
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,264
Let's talk outside.

409
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,314
I can explain.

410
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,692
What is there to explain? It's obvious.

411
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,527
It's not like that.

412
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,529
A set of DNA was found on the scissors,

413
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,616
so I requested an analysis just in case
and found out later in the day.

414
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,369
- Then why did you come to our office?
- That was…

415
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,414
I went to say hello to Captain
since I had time.

416
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,832
You think I don't know you?

417
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,210
You never move without a purpose.

418
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,424
So?

419
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,718
Nothing is different.

420
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,930
Whether or not it's the same person,
we need to catch the culprit.

421
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,348
It's different.

422
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,560
This is an obstruction of justice.
You obstructed an investigation.

423
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:34,063
Didn't you think that
your greed could result in another victim?

424
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,110
Don't make a big deal out
of something so trivial.

425
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,696
Hey, Lee Taeju.

426
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,908
What happened to you?

427
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,000
Why did he keep it a secret?

428
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,170
For goodness' sake. It makes no sense.

429
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,714
Seriously. What was the reason?

430
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,719
For goodness' sake.

431
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,312
Don't make unnecessary assumptions.

432
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,856
Focus on the investigation.

433
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,706
It's about Director General Lee.

434
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:38,211
I get why he kept it a secret
from Min Sohee and TCI,

435
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,632
but he shouldn't have hid it
from you and your team.

436
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,300
What kind of logic is that?

437
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,971
He should've let TCI know too.

438
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,558
Isn't it obvious?

439
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,894
The members from the headquarters
want to take all the credit.

440
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,148
But since things have come to this,

441
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,026
it means that Cha Yeonho was right.

442
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,696
In any case,

443
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,324
Director General Lee
made a fool out of himself by being sly.

444
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:13,204
Anyway, where is Cha Yeonho?

445
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,081
He isn't helping the joint investigation?

446
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,668
Investigation officers came
from the headquarters to see him.

447
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,379
They're investigating as we speak.

448
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,256
For goodness' sake.

449
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,258
He ruined the police's prestige.

450
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,219
Why did he become a police officer
after killing someone?

451
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,555
- Geez.
- My goodness.

452
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:36,895
Cha Yeonho was definitely at fault,
so it'll be hard for him to get out of it.

453
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,313
That's what I'm saying.

454
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,399
What was he thinking
when he became a police officer?

455
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:45,403
It caused a ruckus in the station.
It must be difficult for him too.

456
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,197
Why did he dig his own grave?

457
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,699
- Hey.
- What?

458
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,910
You having fun? Huh?

459
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,453
You're spitting on your own face.

460
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,001
Cha Yeonho figured out
that it was the same culprit.

461
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,129
Why don't you compliment him,
not talk behind his back?

462
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,964
- Darn it.
- What?

463
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,551
Hey, So. So!

464
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,137
What's up with him?
Did I say something wrong?

465
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,224
My goodness. If I had a needle,

466
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,435
I would've sewn your mouth shut like this

467
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,480
and made everyone happy.

468
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,649
Yeom! So!

469
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,026
Those jerks…

470
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,409
So what happens now?

471
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,786
What do you think?

472
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,914
We handed over the materials.
They'll take care of it from here.

473
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,792
Gosh, we worked so hard on this case.

474
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,088
The joint investigation unit
is in charge of this case.

475
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,465
It's right for us to step back.

476
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,384
In the end, we did all the work and--

477
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,555
Is Inspector Cha still being investigated?

478
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,182
It's taking long.

479
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,434
I know. He couldn't even eat.

480
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,606
Yes, Cho Moonju.

481
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,570
All right. I'll be there soon.

482
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,199
I need to go.
Cho Moonju is at the station.

483
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,118
- Why?
- I'll know once I'm there.

484
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,787
See you later.

485
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,583
Thank you for coming.

486
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,961
Not at all.

487
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,686
What you suspect is true.

488
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,481
I didn't have the courage
to report it to the police.

489
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,656
Soon after I filed a report for theft,

490
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,326
I found the stun gun that was missing.

491
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,539
When I came back from work,
it was in the mailbox.

492
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,544
- <i>The wallet came back?</i>
<i>- Yes, it was in the mailbox.</i>

493
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,132
My husband bought it for me in case
something happens when I drive alone.

494
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:18,514
At first, it was strange
so I thought about calling the police.

495
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,976
But things got busy at work,

496
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,313
and I was busy taking care
of the babies at home.

497
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,690
So I didn't think much of it.

498
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:34,363
Since my husband often works overtime,
I'm used to falling asleep alone.

499
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,619
That night,

500
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:44,540
I went to bed around 11 p.m.

501
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,630
Based on today's investigation,
an evaluation committee will be convened.

502
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,049
The result will come out next week.

503
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,969
You did well despite the long hours.

504
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,123
THESE SUIT A POLICE OFFICER MORE

505
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,285
Um--

506
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,412
Do you remember what he looked like?

507
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,711
He was tall. I think he was about 180 cm.

508
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,046
He had a big build too.

509
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,884
I didn't see his face
since he was wearing a mask.

510
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,304
I remember his eyes.
He had double eyelids.

511
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,726
Also, he used a Gyeongsang dialect.

512
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,857
Could it be him?

513
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,533
I'm not sure. He does look similar.

514
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,037
I see.

515
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,836
What was the weapon he had in his hand?
A knife? Scissors?

516
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,129
Scissors.

517
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,256
Craft scissors.

518
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:06,474
Are there any other characteristics
you remember?

519
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,478
He smelled like cigarettes.

520
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,564
He bragged about himself a lot.

521
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,776
He talked about how
he was popular among women.

522
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,988
I didn't think
that would've been the case.

523
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,035
And…

524
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,916
His name is Park Sungjin.

525
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,293
His address on paper is Sujeong-si,

526
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,380
but that is his mother's place,
and his current whereabouts are unknown.

527
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,883
According to his mother,
he dropped by briefly after his discharge.

528
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,178
She hasn't seen him since.
She doesn't even know his phone number.

529
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:49,600
Call history, medical records,
bank transactions, and travel history.

530
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,477
Go through everything and find him.

531
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,187
Catch him as soon as possible.

532
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,106
Yes, sir.

533
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,579
PARK SUNGJIN

534
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,173
The information you've shared
will be used for the investigation,

535
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,800
but I'll keep it a secret.

536
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,635
You don't have to tell me. I know.

537
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,389
Goodbye then.

538
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,058
Okay.

539
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,062
We'll catch the culprit.

540
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,569
I promise.

541
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,640
Did the investigation go well?

542
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,351
Yes.

543
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:21,067
Well, what you said was correct.

544
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,111
The car thief and the serial rapist
are the same.

545
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,156
Then why did the DNA analysis…

546
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,077
Perhaps the cigarette butts
weren't the culprit's.

547
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,913
This time, it's certain
because the DNA is from the scissors.

548
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,123
Also,

549
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,584
Cho Moonju visited me just now.

550
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,879
It's as we expected.

551
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,801
She spoke so calmly
despite going through such ordeal.

552
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,140
- Did she say anything else?
- Oh, right.

553
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,435
He bragged about how popular
he used to be.

554
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,020
And…

555
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:02,024
He said when he had his eyes on a woman,
he had never failed.

556
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:07,154
He's a bigger loser than I thought
to say such nonsense in that situation.

557
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,325
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

558
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,618
Let's go eat.

559
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,162
- Could it be…
- Why?

560
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,666
"When he had his eyes on a woman,
he had never failed."

561
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,335
What if he was talking about his targets?

562
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,715
- Seo Yujung.
- Let's go.

563
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,969
I'll update the joint investigation unit.
Meet me at the parking lot.

564
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,995
<i>The number you have dialed
is not available.</i>

565
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,459
The culprit is after Seo Yujung.

566
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:06,547
- What are you talking about?
- I received a tip-off.

567
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,842
He said he never failed
when he had eyes on a woman.

568
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,260
It has to be Seo Yujung.

569
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,095
We don't have time. Hurry up!

570
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,307
The team from HQ went to arrest
the suspect. What are you saying?

571
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,766
She's talking nonsense.

572
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,103
Hey, get the car.

573
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,440
Superintendent,
why would you listen to her?

574
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,649
Go get the car!

575
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,653
Geez.

576
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,763
Inspector Cha, where are you?

577
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,349
- <i>I'm already on my way.</i>
- What?

578
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,185
Ms. Seo Yujung wasn't picking up.

579
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,686
I'll go there first.

580
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,856
Let's talk later.

581
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,691
Hello? Inspector Cha.

582
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,360
I can't believe him!

583
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,153
- You coming or not?
- I'm coming.

584
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,030
Lieutenant, what's going on?

585
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,449
Get in. I'll explain on the way.
Captain, I'll call you.

586
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,034
- Hurry up and get in.
- Okay.

587
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,203
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

588
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,369
<i>How will you catch the culprit?</i>

589
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,122
What good is being smart
if your body can't keep up?

590
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,623
A police officer shouldn't be slow.

591
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,669
You'll lose the chance to save someone.

592
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,685
- Mom, please get me a towel.
- Okay.

593
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,645
Here.

594
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,940
Why is the door open?

595
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,652
Mom.

596
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,571
Did she go to the market?

597
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,669
Hello?

598
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,837
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- In front of Seo Yujung's house.

599
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,922
<i>What's the situation?</i>

600
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,050
It seems fine.

601
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,929
We'll arrive soon,
so don't act recklessly.

602
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,514
Okay.

603
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,383
Did you wash up?

604
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,056
- Did you wait for me?
- M-- Mom!

605
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,850
Mom.

606
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,394
Your mom went somewhere. Be quiet.

607
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,271
Mom. Mom.

608
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:36,316
Don't be scared. Calm down, okay?

609
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,376
Hold on.

610
00:45:56,336 --> 00:46:00,549
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

611
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,928
Don't cry. I'll be gentle.

612
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,516
Be quiet.

613
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,144
Be quiet or I'll kill you.

614
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,230
What the hell?

615
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,359
- Looking for this?
- Damn. You startled me.

616
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,821
Darn it.

617
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,782
Park Sungjin.

618
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,661
- Stop now.
- Stop what? I didn't even get started.

619
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:54,144
No! Yujung!

620
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,229
Yujung!

621
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,191
- Yujung.
- Ma'am, stay with your daughter.

622
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,535
Oh, there!

623
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,455
Inspector Cha!

624
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,750
- Inspector Cha!
- Inspector Cha!

625
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,960
Inspector Cha!

626
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,462
Inspector Cha!

627
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,755
- Let's go this way.
- Okay.

628
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,007
We'll go that way.

629
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,473
- There he is!
- What?

630
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,478
- There he is!
- What's going on?

631
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,757
What now?

632
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,178
You think you'll win this time?

633
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,848
You damn po-po.

634
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,542
<i>Why can't you land an attack once?</i>

635
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,294
How will you catch the culprit?

636
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,755
<i>Everyone has their own attacking pattern.</i>

637
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,256
<i>You need to remember it well.</i>

638
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,388
<i>Attack me this time.</i>

639
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,474
<i>Flip me over.</i>

640
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,908
To do the shoulder throw,

641
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,910
pull the elbow downward with force.

642
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,636
For goodness' sake.
I told you not to show me your back.

643
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,858
Park Sungjin, you're under arrest

644
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:33,655
for hit-and-run, murder, car robbery,
theft, and serial sexual assault.

645
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,969
SEOUL NAMGANG POLICE STATION

646
00:50:56,053 --> 00:51:00,098
Hello, I'm Superintendent So Byunggil
of Seoul Namgang Police Station.

647
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,225
I will give

648
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,063
an investigation report
on the serial burglary and sexual assault

649
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,065
of northwest Seoul.

650
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,275
Superintendent So has

651
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,445
- become a national star.
- What on earth is Superintendent So doing

652
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,654
up there?

653
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,574
Lieutenant Min or Inspector Cha
should be up there.

654
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,160
He's the chief superintendent
of the joint investigation unit.

655
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,621
In any case, Superintendent So cuffed him.

656
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:26,374
Inspector Cha had subdued him
using the choke he learned from you,

657
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,168
so he just landed a finishing blow.

658
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,004
Either way, the case ended well.

659
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,798
That's what matters.

660
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,677
When will the investigation result
come out?

661
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:41,181
Who knows? They must be
going over it at HQ by now.

662
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,934
Inspector Cha did a lot for this case.

663
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,811
They'll take it
into consideration.

664
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,066
You worked hard.
Thanks to you, the case ended well.

665
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,734
You're too kind.

666
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,820
Everyone knows that TCI solved the case.

667
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,991
- Congrats, Lieutenant Min.
- Thank you for your hard work, sir.

668
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,121
Congratulations, Inspector Cha.

669
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,958
There's another cause for celebration
for Inspector Cha.

670
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,460
What? Did the results come out?

671
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,171
You won't be dismissed from duty.

672
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:20,929
Inspector Cha.

673
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,099
I think we'll be seeing each other often.

674
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,440
Yes!

675
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,027
What are you doing? Let's go.
We can't pass up on this opportunity.

676
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,654
I'll treat you all to beef!

677
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,365
- Yes! Beef!
- Beef!

678
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,326
Be quiet! Why would you eat beef
over something like this?

679
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,912
Let's just eat pork at the bulgogi place.

680
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,875
- Boo! No pork!
- No. Boo! No pork!

681
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,710
No pork bulgogi!

682
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,050
Eat when it's cooked.

683
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,928
Who cooks beef all the way?
It's just wrong.

684
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,306
Let's just send her to the butcher shop.

685
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,058
She doesn't need her meat grilled.

686
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,895
Why aren't you eating?

687
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,564
If you wait for it to get cooked,
you'll have nothing left.

688
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,065
I'm eating.

689
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:19,946
Where is Captain?
He should pay for the second round.

690
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,781
It's the anniversary of his wife's death.

691
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,994
I see. I didn't know it was today.

692
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,457
How did Captain's wife pass away?

693
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,464
- Hey, the meat is burning. Eat.
- Okay.

694
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,840
Eat up.

695
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,475
The night air feels nice.

696
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,063
How did you drive that day?

697
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,815
I don't know.

698
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,276
I just thought that I shouldn't be late.

699
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,321
You said that
a police officer shouldn't be slow,

700
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,365
or I'll lose the chance to save someone.

701
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,118
I'm glad

702
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,247
that this case wasn't your last.

703
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,543
I'm glad that you think so.

704
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,131
I didn't get hurt this time.

705
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,175
Thanks to you.

706
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,680
You did well. Hmm.

707
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,558
Oh. Isn't it inconvenient to wear glasses?

708
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,769
Haven't you gotten hurt
because of your glasses?

709
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,688
Well.

710
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:43,697
By the way, is there a reason
why you won't talk about

711
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,740
how Captain's wife passed away?

712
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,411
Well, there isn't a particular reason.

713
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,249
It was a hit-and-run.

714
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,168
She was on her way to the station
to bring him some clothes.

715
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,509
It makes no sense.

716
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,429
- How could a punk like him--
<i>- You heard my father.</i>

717
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,639
Don't make a big deal and lay low for now.

718
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,435
Hey, Pyo Jungwook…

719
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,603
…I don't like
the way you're talking to me.

720
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,773
How is it that everyone in
your family is so demanding?

721
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:22,360
- <i>Don't you understand what I'm saying?</i>
- I do.

722
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,405
- But your tone is so damn annoying.
- <i>Hey, Yang Jaeyoung.</i>

723
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,407
Go to your dad and tattle.

724
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,201
- Why is this bastard acting up?
- <i>He's just a police officer!</i>

725
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,789
Does he think I'm his underling?

726
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,173
What the hell?

727
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,257
Is he crazy?

728
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,184
That jerk.

729
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,187
Look at this bastard.

730
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,362
You punk.

731
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,663
Look at that jerk.

732
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,507
Hey, stop the car! Are you insane?

733
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,134
I said stop the car!

734
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,928
Is that jerk deaf? Hey!

735
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,729
I got this.

736
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,606
Here I come, you bastard!

737
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,024
You messed with the wrong man.

738
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,653
I'm going down, you punk.

739
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,572
Okay.

740
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,034
Hey, you bastard. Did you see that?
Stop the car!

741
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,579
Look at you.

742
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,501
You jerk.

743
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,066
Please help me.

744
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,611
Help me.

745
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,990
Please help.

746
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,366
Please.

747
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,453
Please help.

748
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,789
Help.

749
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,091
I'm sorry.

750
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,635
I'm sorry.

751
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,614
CRASH

752
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,808
I don't think it was a simple accident.

753
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,269
The brake fluid line was pulled out.

754
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,688
Sir, wake up.

755
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,148
<i>A car carrier trailer rollover</i>

756
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,192
<i>caused tens of millions of won's
worth of damage.</i>

757
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:35,029
- Someone cut it on purpose.
- Then it's a case, not an accident.

758
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,656
<i>I saw a suspicious man.</i>

759
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,575
<i>He was wearing a black jacket
and a green hat.</i>

760
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,579
So you're not going to lift a finger.

761
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,289
<i>He's the suspect we were looking for.</i>

762
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,084
- Lieutenant, it's dangerous. Get out.
- What?

763
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,173
PEOPLE OF THE POLICE STATION

764
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,051
Gwangju, 97.4%.

765
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,012
Jeju, 97%.

766
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,639
Sangju and Chilgok
of Gyeongsang Province, 100%.

767
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:04,934
JUNG CHAEMAN, TCI

768
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,103
Did you figure out what the numbers mean?

769
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,607
The answer is the arrest rate
for hit-and-run cases.

770
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:16,029
In Korea, the distribution rate is high
for surveillance cameras and dashcams.

771
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:20,408
The license plate recognition system
using AI has been implemented recently.

772
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:25,163
So the police have a high arrest rate
of 99% on average.

773
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:31,377
Thus, a hit-and-runner has
no chance of avoiding arrest.

774
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,881
So don't even think about
running away from an accident.

775
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,509
And harsher sentencing
is applied for a hit-and-run,

776
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,803
so you may receive life imprisonment.

777
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,056
You won't have it easy
for being a first offender.

778
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,559
A hit-and-run is punished
in the strictest way.

779
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,686
So, when an accident occurs,

780
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,065
protect the victim
and report to the police right away.

781
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,816
Keep that in mind.

782
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:59,697
And even if the victim
doesn't seem to be seriously hurt

783
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,116
or says that he or she is fine,

784
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,160
leaving after giving
your contact information

785
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:06,621
will make you punishable by law.

786
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:12,210
No matter how small the accident,
make sure to report it to the police.

787
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,461
Keep that in mind.

788
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,258
