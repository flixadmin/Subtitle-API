00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,910
Our queen tried to make peace with
the Masters, and they tried to murder her.

165
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,998
We enter these negotiations with open eyes.

166
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,541
Trust me.

167
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:14,378
My own recent experience with slavery
has taught me the horrors of that institution.

168
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,879
How many days were you a slave?

169
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,715
<i>(STAMMERS)</i> Long enough to know.

170
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,926
Not long enough to understand.

171
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:30,394
I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor.

172
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:36,233
And somehow, you've risen to
the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

173
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,652
It's most impressive.

174
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:41,363
And now you speak for
the Good Masters of Astapor.

175
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,574
Here's to reversals of fortune.

176
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,200
We came here to meet the queen,

177
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,870
and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.

178
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,747
TYRION: Let's make this simple, shall we?

179
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:51,707
Tell me what you want.

180
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,752
We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.

181
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,630
Take your dragons
and your mercenaries and go.

182
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,550
Queen Daenerys
won't stay in Meereen forever.

183
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,218
Her path takes her westward.

184
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,679
When we last met, I offered her ships,

185
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,432
so she could return to Westeros
where she belongs.

186
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,516
She refused them.

187
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
She refused them
because hundreds of thousands

188
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,771
of men, women and children
still lived in chains.

189
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,315
As they have since the dawn of time.

190
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,399
Not anymore.

191
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,610
Oh, you think you're a free man now?

192
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,570
You still follow orders.

193
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:25,908
Just because your master has silver hair
and tits doesn't mean she's not a master.

194
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,826
Friends, friends. Friends.

195
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,703
Please.

196
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,375
There have always been those with
wealth and power and those with nothing.

197
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,145
That is the way of the world.
I'm not here to change the way of the world.

198
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,797
Slavery is the way of our world.

199
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,550
You don't need slaves to make money.

200
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,220
There haven't been slaves in Westeros
for hundreds of years,

201
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,263
and I grew up richer than any of you.

202
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:54,353
But our queen recognizes that she erred

203
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:59,066
by abolishing slavery without providing
a new system to replace it.

204
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,319
So, here is the queen's proposal.

205
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,781
Slavery will never return to Meereen,

206
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,493
but she will give
the other cities of Slaver's Bay

207
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,412
time to adjust to the new order.

208
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,955
What does that mean?

209
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,332
Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,

210
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,836
we will give you seven years
to end the practice.

211
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:28,720
Slaveholders will be compensated
for their losses, of course, at fair prices.

212
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:33,183
In exchange, you will cut off your support
for the Sons of the Harpy.

213
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,852
We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.

214
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,855
Fine, fine, but you will cut it off
all the same.

00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,440
When Khal Drogo died,

322
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:16,526
she was supposed to come here
and join the Dosh Khaleen,

323
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,528
the widows of the dead khals.

324

That's where they'll have taken her.

What are you doing?

327
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,422
It's forbidden to carry weapons
in the sacred city.

Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city
and steal their khaleesi?

If they spot us and we're unarmed,

330

we'll say we're traders
heading for the Western Market.

But if they see weapons...

You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth.

333

There's 100,000 of them down there.
We can't fight our way out.

We wait till dark, and then we'll find her.

It was a feast.

453
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:39,547
I bought old fine wine
and young pretty girls,

454
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:42,925
and invited my friends
to come and share it all.

455
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:47,430
We passed around the wine,
passed around the women,

456
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,058
and soon we fell into a stupor.

457
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,271
I woke before dawn.

458
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,191
I could barely stand.

459
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:03,279
Everyone else was asleep
on the couches or on the floor,

460

lying in heaps next to their fine clothes.

461
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,621
The truth of their bodies laid bare.

462
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:15,208
I could smell them

463

beneath the incense and the perfume,

464
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,092
and the fine food
that had already started to turn.

465
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:28,638
And I saw it with perfect clarity.

466
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:32,517
I saw what my sins were.

467
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:36,813
The gold I had, the wine I drank,
the women I used,

468
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:41,150
my ceaseless struggle
to maintain my position.

469
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,865
It was all part of a story.

470
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,454
A story I was telling myself
about who I was.

471
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,459
A collection of lies
that would disappear in the light.

472

they were closer to the truth
than I ever was.

475

So, what did you do?

476
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,891
I left to go and find them.

477
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,686
I didn't even put on my shoes.

478
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,856
I walked out the door

479

This High Sparrow.

I have dealt with fanatics

Not setting them off,
that's the most important thing.

I am advising the king
on our current predicament.

- Leave.
- I am a member of the Small Council.

514
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:59,223
- The king...
- Is this a Small Council meeting?

515
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,516
Obviously not.

516

I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.

Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester.

That will be all for now.

00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:10,943
Your Grace.

520
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:38,888
Since I've missed the past
several Small Council meetings,

521
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,349
I wanted to speak to you about a few things.

522
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,853
I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.

523
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,396
As have we all, unfortunately.

524
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,067
We need to be careful
in dealing with such a man.

525
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:55,154
To prevent things
from escalating any further.

526
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,283
We have to be careful not to antagonize him.

527
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,576
He has Margaery.

528
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,662
We can't put her at risk. He's dangerous.

529
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,246
Look at me.

530
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,666
What did they do to me?

531
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,542
To the king's own mother?

532
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,048
It's all right.

533
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:18,386
It's done. It's in the past.

534
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:22,765
And of course,
Margaery's safety is paramount.

535
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:28,688
You don't like Margaery, do you?

536
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:33,526
Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

537
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,947
Margaery is the queen.

538
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:42,451
Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

539
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:45,454
Not just for their own sake,
but for everyone's.

540
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,960
The High Sparrow
has no respect for kings or queens.

541
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,795
No respect for anything in this world.

542
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,715
He has no use for the things of this world.

543
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:59,552
He wants to knock them down,
and replace them with what?

544
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,679
With fantasies.

545
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,597
With beggars in the street.

546
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,932
With nothing.

547
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:07,935
Mother.

548
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,731
There's something I want to tell you.

549
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,484
Something the High Sparrow told me.

550
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:19,989
You've spoken with him?

551
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:25,703
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out...

552
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,223
It would be a breach of confidence
which he would not take lightly,

553
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:31,167
given his constant prattling
about the truth.

554
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,797
I am your mother.

555
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,842
You can always trust me.

The Small Council meeting
has been postponed on the king's orders.

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,064
I would have thought
we were perfectly clear the first time.

559
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:55,191
You're not welcome.

560
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,918
You once spoke of your respect
for our father

561
00:37:56,942 --> 00:38:00,029
because he understood
the necessity of working with one's rivals.

562
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:05,034
My dear, you have been stripped
of your dignity and authority,

563
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:08,829
publically shamed
and confined to the Red Keep.

JAIME: Cersei is the mother of the king.

566
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,835
She has the king's ear and his trust.

567
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:18,798
And the king has been speaking regularly
with the High Sparrow

568
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:21,217
about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

569
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,385
The High Sparrow seized power
knowing full well

570
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:26,555
we'd bicker amongst ourselves
instead of seizing it back.

571
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,599
Here we are. Well done to us.

572
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:32,770
Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms
rests in his dirty peasant hands.

573
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,980
In a few days, he'll have a trial for me.

574
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:39,276
But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

575
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:44,990
Yes, Margaery will repent her sins
before the good people of the city.

576
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:46,867
Oh, no.

577
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,662
That cannot happen.

578
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,331
That will not happen.

579
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:53,958
I agree.

580
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:59,713
You've got
the second largest army in Westeros.

581
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,035
You'll bring them into the city,

582
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:04,093
stop Queen Margaery's humiliation
before it starts,

583
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,679
and take her back into Crown custody.

584
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:12,017
The king has ordered me to take no action
against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant

585
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:13,602
out of fear for the queen's safety.

586
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:15,604
You will take no action at all.

587
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:18,232
When the Tyrell armies come,
you will stand down.

588
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:22,278
Were you expressly forbidden
from standing down?

589
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,905
No, but if the king should call...

590
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:27,908
The whole thing will be over
before anyone can call on you to do anything.

591
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:31,871
When the High Sparrow is in custody,
or dead, preferably,

592
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,665
and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,

593
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,917
do you think
the king will be angry at the outcome?

594
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,795
You hate these fanatics as much as we do.

595
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:43,007
You hate what they've done to your son.

596
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,802
Do you want Lancel back?
Or have you given him up for good?

597
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,848
Of course I want him back.

598
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,311
Then stand aside

599
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:59,690
and let the people that took him from you
be destroyed.

600
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:07,156
If it doesn't go as planned,
the Sparrows have many friends in this city.

601
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:10,075
We'll have civil war. Many will die.
