That's gonna fuck him up.

I know that
that means something to you.

And who knows better than you?

700
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:09,979
When he was a little boy,
5 or 6, he was quite sweet.

00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:12,649
He'd cuddle up to me.

702
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,405
He loved stories about
Davy Crockett, Teddy Roosevelt.

703
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:24,035
Loved the idea of the woods,
the forest, manifest destiny.

704
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,998
But I needed him
to be the strongest man in the world.

So I went to work on him.
