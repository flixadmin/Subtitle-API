1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,510
Sir, security confirms
worldwide airspace clearance
for tonight's flight.

2
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,278
Transport reports
donner and blitzen

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,646
are acting up,
your jolliness.

4
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,448
Ho ho ho ho.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,851
Oh, those rascals
always get the jitters

6
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,452
before showtime.

7
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,721
And the toys?

8
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,823
Wrapped and ready
to deliver.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,928
(Hissing)

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,334
Unh!
Aah!

11
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:36,468
Oh, my.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,137
Code red.

13
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,072
If you've come
for a gift,

14
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,908
well, I'm afraid
you've just made
the naughty list.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,278
Your <i> chi</i> is the only
"gift" I require.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,780
Elvin: Secure Santa!
Huh?

17
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,348
Ooh!

18
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,856
(Door closes and locks)

19
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,328
Elf magic!

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,465
Elves: Aah! Unh!

21
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,802
Elves: Aah! Unh!

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,672
(Alarm ringing)

23
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,310
Second wave!
Go! Go! Go!

24
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:22,848
I see I shall
have to unwrap
my present later.

25
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,052
Elves: Unh!

26
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,792
Oh, my.

27
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:37,796
And to all,
a good night.

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,768
(Daolon laughs)

29
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,196
Thank you!
Merry Christmas!

30
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,866
Bye-bye!
- Hee hee hee hee hee!

31
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,602
Are you sure uncle
isn't running a fever?

32
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,405
Jade,
uncle loves Christmas.

33
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,841
It is when sales
are best. Ow!

34
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,976
Commercialism
not important!

35
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:01,880
Christmas spirit is.

36
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,650
Ahh...Mother's recipe.

37
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:09,421
Yes. And we will be
so happy to see her

38
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,925
for the holidays,
tohru.

39
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,093
¶ We-ird ¶

40
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,230
we must leave some out
for "you-know-who."

41
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,298
Who?

42
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,402
Oh! I mean, um...

43
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:27,606
I am sure Santa will be
very hungry tonight.

44
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,841
Tch. Nice try,
but I'm old enough

45
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,110
to know the lowdown on
the kris kringle scam.

46
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:35,414
Jade! You do not believe
in Santa claus?

47
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,282
<i>Sure</i> I do.

48
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,251
Just like I believe
in the tooth fairy.

49
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,153
Right, Jackie?

50
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,525
Gotcha!

51
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,261
I told you
the tooth fairy was sick

52
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,629
and I was filling in.

53
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,898
Tooth fairy
does not exist!

54
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,733
Ha! See?

55
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,102
But Santa claus
does.

56
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,072
I have <i> research</i>
to prove it.

57
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,240
(Doorbell rings)

58
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,043
Mommy!

59
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,647
Mmm!
Aah!

60
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,249
Captain black!

61
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,084
I am sorry.

62
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,518
That's all right, tohru.

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,655
I'm often mistaken for
elderly Japanese women.

64
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:20,559
Good tidings
to my favorite
unofficial agents.

65
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:24,529
Please tell me you
found <i> ultramoose ii:</i>
À <i> antler gear solid,</i>

66
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,964
yellow version.

67
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,800
I've called on all
of section 13's resources,

68
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,670
but the game
is sold out everywhere.

69
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,940
Oh, Jade will be
so disappointed.

70
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,275
(Doorbell rings)

71
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,377
Mommy!

72
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,247
Negatory.

73
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,686
(Gasps)
How may
I help you?

74
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,489
Name's elvin:
Head of security, north pole.

75
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,624
Whoa. You guys are
really going all out

76
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,959
to convince me,
aren't you?

77
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,160
I need your help.

78
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,895
The big red one
has been abducted.

79
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,297
(All gasping)

80
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,734
Haven't I seen you
in homeroom?

81
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:06,538
If what you say
is true, uh, elvin,

82
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,240
why come to us?

83
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:10,175
Not you. The magic man.

84
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,210
Pulled your credentials
from the nice list.

85
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,478
Very impressive.

86
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,314
We have reason to believe
you may know the perp.

87
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,816
Creative services
handcrafted this likeness.

88
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,352
(Gasps)
Daolon wong!

89
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:21,520
Oh, he's good.

90
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,389
But what would daolon wong
want with Santa?

91
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,792
Uh, revenge
for years of coal?

92
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,827
Jade: Duh.
Wong's part-grinch.

93
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,429
He wants
to ruin Christmas!

94
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,197
Not that Santa's
for real.

95
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,133
He may not be real
for long if we don't
find him, ma'am.

96
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,602
Daolon wong
wishes to possess

97
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:42,674
the extraordinary good <i> chi</i>
belonging to Santa claus.

98
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,010
Tch! Like
Santa's Chinese.

99
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,447
"Chi" is a universal
life force

100
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,482
which goes by
many names,

101
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,784
as do its 2 sides:

102
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:56,688
Yin and Yang,
dark and light,

103
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,225
naughty and nice.

104
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,228
Yes, well,
this wong character vanished

105
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,163
with the big cheese,
house and all.

106
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,798
We can't get a bead
on their whereabouts.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,234
I'll put all
- of section 13's manpower

108
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,602
on this right away.

109
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:13,839
No! Magic
must find magic.

110
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,475
I will cast
a locator spell,

111
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,111
but I require an
item belonging

112
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:20,712
to Santa claus.

113
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,314
All his gear
is up at the pole,

114
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:23,515
including an empty sleigh

115
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,384
and toys that won't
get delivered tonight

116
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,452
if we don't act quickly.

117
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,490
But what about mommy?

118
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,226
I'll wait here
for her, tohru...

119
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,828
Provided "sensei" thinks
I can handle it.

120
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,997
Tch. And how are
we supposed to get

121
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,265
all the way
to Santa's workshop

122
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,467
in time
to save Christmas?

123
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,341
Whoa.

124
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,478
(Elves chattering loudly)

125
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,020
(Gasps)

126
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,289
Tell me it's
the rescue team.

127
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,557
Check.

128
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,092
Thank goodness
you're here.

129
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,527
Mrs. claus phoned
from the Bahamas,

130
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,128
and we had to make like
everything was ok

131
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,430
so she wouldn't worry.

132
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,332
Enough chitchat!
Uncle needs ingredients!

133
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,735
Santa's workshop.

134
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,237
He <i> is</i> for real.

135
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,173
There's no margin
for error, guys.

136
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,642
If we're gonna save Santa,
we need more muscle.

137
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:27,312
Oh, she's having
one of her moments.

138
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,715
We need...The j-team!

139
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,718
(Indistinct chatter)

140
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,587
So after
the dot-com bust,
uh-huh.

141
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,456
I moved my money into
solid blue chip stock

142
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,624
uh-huh.
Like pharmaceuticals.

143
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,360
Excuse me.

144
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,896
Jade?

145
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:45,964
How did you--

146
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,367
you brought an elf
to a hanukkah party?

147
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,269
Viper,
here's the skinny:

148
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,671
The team's
on a rescue mission.

149
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,173
The stakes:
Kris kringle himself.

150
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,274
Sounds festive.

151
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,577
I'll grab
a costume change.

152
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,881
Are you guys in
or are you out?

153
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,517
You can depend
upon <i> El toro fuerte.</i>

154
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,219
And paco, too.

155
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,487
All right, team.

156
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,789
Let's just hope Santa's
still packing his <i> chi.</i>

157
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,058
(Gasps)

158
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,239
Forces of darkness,
spring forth...

159
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,411
And Pierce the veil
of elf magic!

160
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,180
Oh, dear.

161
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,061
Mrrr!

162
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,264
Strange friend,

163
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,665
your desire
for cheese

164
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,734
will not prevail
against good.

165
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,670
<i>Chi,</i> not cheese!

166
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,377
There must be
a weak spot.

167
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,115
Daolon: Hmm?

168
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,984
Of course.

169
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,387
Keep 'em moving,
keep 'em moving.

170
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,188
Santa <i> will</i> return...

171
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,924
Won't he?

172
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,626
Uncle needs
egg of sparrow!

173
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,728
Saliva of eel!

174
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,197
Foam of goat's milk!

175
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,599
(Groans)

176
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,934
Not foamy enough!

177
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,669
And bring snake tails!

178
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,640
From real snakes!

179
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,642
Uh, force of habit.

180
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:41,780
Do you want me
to locate Santa claus?!
Yes?!

181
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,783
Then where is personal item
belonging to him?!

182
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,051
Will these do?

183
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,821
Hot cha!

184
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,223
If you elves have
all this hocus-pocus,

185
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,025
why don't you guys
deliver the gifts?

186
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,928
Tradition.
We need reindeer,
a sleigh, and a Santa.

187
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,029
All things considered,

188
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,831
maybe it's time
to find a stand-in.

189
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,833
It takes
a <i> very</i> big man

190
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,969
to fill
- the big man's shoes.

191
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,206
How big we talkin'?

192
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,542
Oh, no.

193
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,255
Daolon: Whoa! Oh!

194
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,424
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

195
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,127
(Chanting)

196
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,999
Oh, dear.

197
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,377
Lookin' slick
for a trick St. Nick.

198
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,681
Oh...I have
a bad feeling about this.

199
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,717
So do I. This is
highly irregular.

200
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,985
So is Christmas morning

201
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,054
with no gifts
under the trees.

202
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,790
(Reciting incantation)

203
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,924
Oh!

204
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,826
The himalayas!

205
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,230
We have underwear
on the move.

206
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,536
That is where
we will find
Santa claus!

207
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,372
Grab some winterwear.
We're moving out!

208
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:20,278
Jade, I know you want
to come, but it is
far too dangerous.

209
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,681
And miss the joyride
of a lifetime?

210
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,182
We are Santa's helpers!

211
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,455
Ho ho <i> ho!</i>

212
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,856
No accent on 3.

213
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,558
It's just,
"ho ho ho."

214
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,061
Jade:
Come on, sumo claus.

215
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,263
Let's see
what this baby's
got under the hood.

216
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,265
don't forget
the nice list!

217
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,368
Uh...Giddyup.

218
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,472
Tch.
On, dasher, on, dancer,

219
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,674
on, prancer, on, ViXen!

220
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,909
Tohru: Uuhh!

221
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,114
Whoa!
Oh!

222
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,688
Tohru: On, donner,
on, comet,

223
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,257
on, cupid, on, blitzen!

224
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,536
Mommy?!

225
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,325
Jackie: You could not
get us any closer?

226
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,360
Elf magic
won't pop the bubble.

227
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,429
A dark <i> chi</i>
àforce field.

228
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,298
How do you suggest
we shake up
this snow globe?

229
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,637
Jade: First stop...
26 maple street.

230
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,909
Down the chimney
you go!

231
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,444
Hit it, t!

232
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,316
But...I am not
chimney-friendly.

233
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,219
Eh--wu--oh!

234
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,792
Mmm...

235
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,260
Cookies.

236
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,930
Child: Daddy!
A fake Santa's
eating Santa's cookies!

237
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,800
Come here, you!

238
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,237
Comet and cupid
got your back.

239
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,746
(Chanting)

240
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,386
Please, please...
Think of the children.

241
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,587
Ahh...

242
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,989
Your pleas
are fruitless.

243
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,458
For my soul,
dear kringle,

244
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,495
is as black
as coal.

245
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:03,274

246
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,081

Ooh...
Ooh...
Oh...

00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,712

257
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,515
Rescue team, sir.

Oh, my.

262
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,329
Oh...
Sorry.

263
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,464
Ho ho!

264
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,933
No more dark barrier.

265
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,813
How many deliveries
have we made so far?

266
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,417
3.
Only...

267
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,322
That many more to go.

268
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:28,893
(Groans) Ohh...
I'm a very bad
Santa.

269
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,901
Whoa!

270
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,873
Let's get you home,
sir.

271
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,274
Uh!

(Gasps)

273
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48,513
Elf...Or garden gnome?

274
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,429
Abominable snowmen.

275
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,264
Attack!

276
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,498

(Both chanting)

280
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,149
Mistletoe!

Aah!

282
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,520
Made you look!

00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,533
Yeee-aaahh-ha!

Aah!

00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,191
Watch as angels
lose their--

286

Huh?

287

Aah!

289
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,335
Jade: Snow angel! Cool!

(Hisses) Haaah!

292
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,091
Transport, I need
- a pickup on Santa's house...

293
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,792
Asap.

294
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,831
Your sleigh.

295
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,433
Should I need
assistance
in the future,

296
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,838
I hope your fine
services will be
available, old chum.

297
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,574
I...Would be
honored.

298
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,610
Ha. Had to check.

299
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,446
Ho ho ho! Splendid!

300
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,249
Thank you, everyone!

301
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,621
Oh! Only 3 stops?
Oh, dear.

302
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,056
We must boogie.

303
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,958
Hah!

304
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,060
Ho ho ho!

305
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,696
Ho ho ho ho!

306
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,671
I come to visit son
at Christmas

307
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:04,242
and spend all my time
talking to a stranger!

308
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,545
And talking...
And talking...

309
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:11,482
Tohru was very busy
substituting
for Santa claus!

310
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,084
I know.

311
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,920
I am so proud
of him!

312
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,556
One more thing.

313
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,725
Uh...

314
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,897
Oh! Billy goat!

315
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,267
(Gasps)

316
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,302
My first mask!

317
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,906
(Chuckles) Wear it
proudly, paquito.

318
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,642
I shall never
remove it!

319
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,178
Closer together,
and...

Hey, it's for me!

00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,891
Uh, Jade, with
all of the excitement,

326
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,526
I'm very sorry--

327
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,362
I did not have time
to complete the quest
for your...

328
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,264
It's from Santa!

00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,777
Come on, Jackie.
He's Santa claus.

333
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,215
(Everyone chattering)

334
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,350
Ok, everybody. Group hug!

335
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,688
All: Merry Christmas!

336
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,663
Hey, Jackie, what's
your favorite food?

337
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,131
I eat everything.

338
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:37,134
I only tell people,
try it before
you don't like it.

339
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,569
You have to try
the food.

340
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,172
"Ooh! What's that?
It smells, stink!"

341
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,974
It's not polite.

342
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:46,444
Eat first.
"Oh. That's not
good for me. Ok."

343
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:49,113
For me, I eat everything.
Yeah.
