From the truck, before we blew it up.

155
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,932
So before...

156
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:09,270
Even before Akio died, I wanted revenge
on Shrieve for the pain he caused.

157
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,565
But instead, you used it
to trade your way into the League.

158
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,817
I am not strong.

159
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,614
Not enough for myself
and certainty not enough for Tatsu.

-It is immaterial.

-Maseo Yamashiro is no more.
-He doesn't have to be.

When I'm Ra's,
I can release you from your oath.

163
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,128
I can set you free.

164
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,632
The League is not my prison.

165
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,343
From my prison...

166
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,930
...there is no escape.

167
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,810
So now Malcolm Merlyn can summon us.

168
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,272
I really don't like the idea
that he can summon us.

169
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,815
Any idea what this is about?

170
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,651
No, but Merlyn assures me
he'll be waving the white flag.

171
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,153
-I'm sorry, I forgot the flag.
LAUREL: That's too bad.

172
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,323

where you could put it.

-This won't be easy for all of you to believe...

174

You're a sociopath and a liar.

Be that as it may, this will be
much quicker for all of us...

176
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,127

through the cynicism...

177

...and realize that I am telling the truth.

178

-About what?
-Oliver.

179

His allegiance with the League is a charade.

180

Why would you even play
with our emotions?

181
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:29,058
This plan was born the moment Oliver realized
that he had to capitulate to Ra's to save Thea.

182
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,687
And instead of sharing this plan with us,
he trusted you.

none of you are good actors.

You've seen for yourselves how dangerous
Ra's and the League are.

188
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:50,246
-The circle of trust had to be small as possible.
-Until now? What changed?

189
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,333
Forget it. There's nothing he could say
that we could believe.

190
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,796
Mr. Diggle's right. Which is why
I brought along a friend of Oliver's.

A woman we've never met or even heard of?

Oliver doesn't speak about the past.

He's not forthcoming
about the present, either.

He knows that the danger

Okay, how many times are we gonna

This request comes from Oliver.

-Yeah, and how's that going for you?
-I am so bored.

-Heh. Yeah, well, that's why I brought you this.

Malcolm stole it out of impound. Don't worry,
I made him promise nobody would get killed.

that he's Arsenal too, right?

were caused by a chemical spill.

Felicity, I don't know if you're right
that Oliver's gone forever or not.

233
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,285
The truth is, for me it doesn't matter.

danger in my city, I'm reporting for duty.

Then why do you ask me to marry someone
I do not love?

241
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:52,780
When I was in Odessa, tending to some affairs,
I crossed paths with a woman.

242
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:58,953
She was breathtaking
in both visage and fortitude.

243
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,290
Her name was Ameena Raatko.

244
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,335
I had taken other lovers before...

245
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,254
...but she was different.

246
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:13,968
She had a wit and a fire about her
that I found myself I could not live without.

247
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,014
So she became my concubine
and the mother of my child.

248
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:33,821
This was my gift to her in honor of you,
the gift that she gave me.

249
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:38,659
And so I kept it in the hopes that one day
you would wear it on your wedding day.

250
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,831
You expect me to marry Al Sah-him
because of some trinket?

251
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,629
I expect you to marry Al Sah-him
because it is my will.

252
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:54,884
You defy that and I will see you
suffer the pain of a thousand deaths.

I am sorry to intrude.
Mr. Merlyn said that I would find you here.

That might be the only thing
he's ever said that isn't a lie.

During his recuperation, Oliver spoke of you.

Of how his last thought
before the fall was of you.
