<font color=#FFFF55><i>It is a land of

<font color=#FFFF55>Come back!</font>

23
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:40,838

- Very good.</font>

<font color=#FFFF55>Where are you going?
Slow down!</font>

31
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,042
<font color=#FFFF55>Hello mother.</font>

32
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:36,144
<font color=#FFFF55>How are you today?</font>

33
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,264
<font color=#FFFF55>Let's get you back to school,
before another tutor quits.</font>

34
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:43,851

to start my training?</font>

35
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:46,310
<font color=#FFFF55>Antiope thinks I'm ready.</font>

36
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,376
<font color=#FFFF55>Does she?</font>

37
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,579
<font color=#FFFF55>I could begin showing
her some things.</font>

38
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:55,545
<font color=#FFFF55>She should at least be
able to defend herself.</font>

39
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:56,885
<font color=#FFFF55>From whom?</font>

40
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,967
<font color=#FFFF55>In the event of an invasion.</font>

41
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:02,469
<font color=#FFFF55>Isn't that why I have the greatest
warrior in our history...</font>

42
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,972
<font color=#FFFF55>...leading an entire army,
General?</font>

43
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:09,137
<font color=#FFFF55>I pray there will never come
when she has to fight.</font>

44
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:12,412
<font color=#FFFF55>But you know,
a scorpion must sting...</font>

45
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:15,096
<font color=#FFFF55>- A wolf must hunt.
- She is a child.</font>

46
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:17,685
<font color=#FFFF55>The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.</font>

47
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,731
<font color=#FFFF55>But, mother...</font>

48
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,129
<font color=#FFFF55>There will be no training.</font>

49
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,377
<font color=#FFFF55>What if I promise to be careful?</font>

50
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:32,209
<font color=#FFFF55>It's time to sleep.</font>

51
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,206
<font color=#FFFF55>What if I didn't use a sword?</font>

52
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:39,108
<font color=#FFFF55>Fighting does not
make you a hero.</font>

53
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,033
<font color=#FFFF55>Just the shield then,
no sharp edges.</font>

54
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:46,304
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana, you are the most precious
thing in the world to me.</font>

55
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,198
<font color=#FFFF55>I wished for you so much, so I
sculpted you from clay myself.</font>

56
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:53,964
<font color=#FFFF55>...and begged Zeus
to give you life.</font>

57
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,798
<font color=#FFFF55>You've told me this story.</font>

58
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:59,914
<font color=#FFFF55>Which is why.. tonight
I'll tell you a new one.</font>

59
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:03,726
<font color=#FFFF55>The story of our people
and my days of battle.</font>

60
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:04,786
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes!</font>

61
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,000
<font color=#FFFF55>So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.</font>

62
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:17,575
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Long ago, when time was new...</i></font>

64
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,708
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...the gods ruled the earth.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF55><i>Zeus king among them.</i></font>

66
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:32,317
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Zeus created beings over
which the Gods would rule.</i></font>

67
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,365
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Beings born in his image...</i></font>

68
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,227
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i></font>

69
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:44,058
<font color=#FFFF55><i>He called his creation "Man".
And mankind was good.</i></font>

70
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:48,264
<font color=#FFFF55><i>But Zeus' son.. grew
envious of mankind...</i></font>

71
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:51,631
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.</i></font>

72
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,106
<font color=#FFFF55><i>This was Ares,
the God of War.</i></font>

73
00:06:58,313 --> 00:07:02,477
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.</i></font>

74
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,771
<font color=#FFFF55><i>He turned them against
one another...</i></font>

75
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,966
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...and war ravaged the Earth.</i></font>

76
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,082
<font color=#FFFF55><i>So, the gods created
us, the Amazons...</i></font>

77
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,731
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...to influence men's
hearts with love...</i></font>

78
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,430
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...and restore
peace to the Earth.</i></font>

79
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:24,555
<font color=#FFFF55><i>And for a brief time,
there was peace.</i></font>

80
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:31,879
<font color=#FFFF55><i>But it did not last.</i></font>

81
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,373
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Your mother, The Amazon
Queen, led a revolt...</i></font>

82
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:45,476
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...that freed us all
from enslavement.</i></font>

83
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:55,774
<font color=#FFFF55><i>When Zeus led the gods
to our defence...</i></font>

84
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:59,107
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...Ares killed
them one by one...</i></font>

85
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,463
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...until only Zeus
himself remained.</i></font>

86
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:08,252
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Zeus used the last of his
power to stop Ares...</i></font>

87
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:13,797
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...striking such a blow, the god
of war was forced to retreat.</i></font>

88
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,194
<font color=#FFFF55><i>But Zeus knew...</i></font>

89
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:20,533
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...that one day Ares might
return to finish his mission.</i></font>

90
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:22,469
<font color=#FFFF55><i>An endless war...</i></font>

91
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,058
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...where mankind would finally
destroy themselves...</i></font>

92
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:29,626
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...and us with them.</i></font>

93
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:32,328
<font color=#FFFF55><i>So Zeus, left us a weapon.</i></font>

94
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:35,627
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...One powerful enough
to kill a god.</i></font>

95
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,847
<font color=#FFFF55><i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island...</i></font>

96
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:43,021
<font color=#FFFF55><i>to hide us from
the outside world...</i></font>

97
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,644
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...Somewhere Ares
could not find us.</i></font>

98
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:52,425
<font color=#FFFF55><i>And all has been
quiet ever since.</i></font>

99
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:04,283
<font color=#FFFF55>We give thanks to the gods
for giving us this paradise.</font>

100
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,711
<font color=#FFFF55>And the God Killer?</font>

101
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:13,514
<font color=#FFFF55>The God Killer?</font>

102
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:16,230
<font color=#FFFF55>The weapon that is strong
enough to kill a God.</font>

103
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,554
<font color=#FFFF55>Can I see it?</font>

104
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,544
<font color=#FFFF55>The Gods gave us many gifts.</font>

105
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:32,745
<font color=#FFFF55>One day, you'll know them all.</font>

106
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:36,260
<font color=#FFFF55>This great tower..
is where we keep them.</font>

107
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:49,922
<font color=#FFFF55>The God Killer.</font>

108
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,169
<font color=#FFFF55>It's beautiful.</font>

109
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,127
<font color=#FFFF55>Who would wield it?</font>

110
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,281
<font color=#FFFF55>I pray it will never
be called to arms.</font>

111
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:06,971
<font color=#FFFF55>But only the fiercest
among us even could.</font>

112
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:09,383
<font color=#FFFF55>And that's not you, Diana.</font>

113
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,586
<font color=#FFFF55>You see?
You are safe...</font>

114
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:16,008
<font color=#FFFF55>...and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.</font>

115
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:30,981
<font color=#FFFF55>You keep doubting
yourself, Diana.</font>

116
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:33,410
<font color=#FFFF55>- No, I don't.
- Yes. You do.</font>

117
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:35,066
<font color=#FFFF55>No, I don't.</font>

118
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,751
<font color=#FFFF55>You arestronger than you believe.
You have greater powers than you know.</font>

119
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,061
<font color=#FFFF55>- But if you don't try harder...
- Diana!</font>

120
00:10:57,903 --> 00:10:58,904
<font color=#FFFF55>Are you hurt?</font>

121
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,413
<font color=#FFFF55>No, Mother, I'm fine.</font>

122
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,307
<font color=#FFFF55>- I was just...
- Training.</font>

123
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:06,229
<font color=#FFFF55>Seems I'm not the
revered queen I should be.</font>

124
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,749
<font color=#FFFF55>Disobeyed, betrayed
by my own sister...</font>

125
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,100
<font color=#FFFF55>No, mother. It was me.
I asked her...</font>

126
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,362
<font color=#FFFF55>Take her to the palace.</font>

127
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:15,650
<font color=#FFFF55>Off you go.</font>

128
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:26,015
<font color=#FFFF55>You left me no
choice, Hippolyta.</font>

129
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,351
<font color=#FFFF55>You neglect your duty,
if she cannot fight.</font>

130
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,688
<font color=#FFFF55>You speak of a time
that may never come.</font>

131
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,794
<font color=#FFFF55>He might never return.
He could have died from his wounds.</font>

132
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,706
<font color=#FFFF55>Ares is alive.</font>

133
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:45,411
<font color=#FFFF55>You feel it as I do,
in your bones.</font>

134
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:48,490
<font color=#FFFF55>It is only a matter of
time before he returns.</font>

135
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:56,292
<font color=#FFFF55>The stronger she gets,
the sooner he will find her.</font>

136
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,181
<font color=#FFFF55>Hippolyta,
I love her as you do.</font>

137
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:03,727
<font color=#FFFF55>But this is the only way
to truly protect her.</font>

138
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:18,124
<font color=#FFFF55>You will train her harder
than any Amazon before her.</font>

139
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,537
<font color=#FFFF55>Five times harder...</font>

140
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,919
<font color=#FFFF55>...ten times harder.</font>

141
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:26,022
<font color=#FFFF55>Until she's better
than even you.</font>

142
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,425
<font color=#FFFF55>But she must never
know the truth...</font>

143
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,082
<font color=#FFFF55>about what she is...</font>

144
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,830
<font color=#FFFF55>...or how she came to be.</font>

145
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:28,486
<font color=#FFFF55>Harder.</font>

146
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,644
<font color=#FFFF55>You are stronger
than this, Diana.</font>

147
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,686
<font color=#FFFF55>Again.</font>

148
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,515
<font color=#FFFF55>Never let your guard down.</font>

149
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,352
<font color=#FFFF55>You expect the battle to be fair.</font>

150
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,114
<font color=#FFFF55>A battle will never be fair.</font>

151
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,134
<font color=#FFFF55>Anti­ope!</font>

152
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:14,049
<font color=#FFFF55>Lay still..</font>

153
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,576
<font color=#FFFF55>You're bleeding.</font>

154
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:19,078
<font color=#FFFF55>- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana.</font>

155
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,551
<font color=#FFFF55>What had I done?</font>

156
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,825
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm sorry.</font>

157
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,096
<font color=#FFFF55>Where did this fog come from?</font>

158
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:09,717
<font color=#FFFF55>There...
Go forward.</font>

159
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:27,550
<font color=#FFFF55><i>There he is!</i></font>

160
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:29,282
<font color=#FFFF55><i>- The pilot! I can see him.
- He's there!</i></font>

161
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,302
<font color=#FFFF55>Wow.</font>

162
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:06,610
<font color=#FFFF55>You are a man.</font>

163
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,827
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah. I mean...</font>

164
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,517
<font color=#FFFF55>Do I not look like one?</font>

165
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,253
<font color=#FFFF55>Where are we?</font>

166
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,245
<font color=#FFFF55>Temiscira.</font>

167
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:26,377
<font color=#FFFF55>What?</font>

168
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:27,952
<font color=#FFFF55>Who are you?</font>

169
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,942
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm one of the good guys and
those are the bad guys.</font>

170
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:40,148
<font color=#FFFF55>What?</font>

171
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:42,104
<font color=#FFFF55>The German.
Come on, we need to get out of here.</font>

172
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,051
<font color=#FFFF55>- The Germans?
- Diana!</font>

173
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,817
<font color=#FFFF55>Step away from her.. now!</font>

174
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:50,898
<font color=#FFFF55>Ready your bows!</font>

175
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:55,311
<font color=#FFFF55>They have guns.
Right?</font>

176
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,197
<font color=#FFFF55>Fire!</font>

177
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:01,537
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on!</font>

178
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,361
<font color=#FFFF55>Stay down!</font>

179
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:20,071
<font color=#FFFF55>Shield!</font>

180
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:41,834
<font color=#FFFF55>No!</font>

181
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:43,942
<font color=#FFFF55>No!</font>

182
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,711
<font color=#FFFF55>No.</font>

183
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,721
<font color=#FFFF55>No. No.. Antiope.</font>

184
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,474
<font color=#FFFF55>Anti­ope, hey.</font>

185
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:02,319
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana.</font>

186
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:06,005
<font color=#FFFF55>- The time has come.
- No.</font>

187
00:22:06,903 --> 00:22:08,944
<font color=#FFFF55>You... you must...</font>

188
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:12,240
<font color=#FFFF55>What?
What, Anti­ope?</font>

189
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,477
<font color=#FFFF55>God Killer!</font>

190
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,207
<font color=#FFFF55>- Diana, go...
- Go where?</font>

191
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,195
<font color=#FFFF55>- Where?
- Go...</font>

192
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,624
<font color=#FFFF55>No, please no.
No, no!</font>

193
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,010
<font color=#FFFF55>- No!
- Anti­ope!</font>

194
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:32,975
<font color=#FFFF55>No!</font>

195
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:41,825
<font color=#FFFF55>- You.
- No..</font>

196
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,255
<font color=#FFFF55>No mother no.</font>

197
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,798
<font color=#FFFF55>He fought at my side
against the invaders.</font>

198
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,235
<font color=#FFFF55>What man fights against
his own people?</font>

199
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,153
<font color=#FFFF55>These aren't my people.</font>

200
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,488
<font color=#FFFF55>Then, why do you
wear their colors?</font>

201
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:54,546
<font color=#FFFF55>I can't tell you that.</font>

202
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,923
<font color=#FFFF55>You need to tell us now!</font>

203
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:56,914
<font color=#FFFF55>What's your name?</font>

204
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,676
<font color=#FFFF55>I can't tell you that either.</font>

205
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:03,524
<font color=#FFFF55>We should kill him now
and be done with it.</font>

206
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,851
<font color=#FFFF55>If he dies...</font>

207
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,401
<font color=#FFFF55>...we know nothing about who
they are and why they came.</font>

208
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:18,405
<font color=#FFFF55>My...</font>

209
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:24,585
<font color=#FFFF55>Name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot,
American Expeditionary Forces.</font>

210
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,973
<font color=#FFFF55>Serial number 8141921.</font>

211
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:36,935
<font color=#FFFF55>Assigned to British
Intelligence.</font>

212
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,446
<font color=#FFFF55>What the hell is this thing?</font>

213
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:43,448
<font color=#FFFF55>The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.</font>

214
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:45,345
<font color=#FFFF55>But it's really hot.</font>

215
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,351
<font color=#FFFF55>It is pointless and
painful to resist.</font>

216
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,697
<font color=#FFFF55>What is your mission?</font>

217
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:54,560
<font color=#FFFF55>Whoever you are, you are in more danger
than you think.</font>

218
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,100
<font color=#FFFF55>What is your mission?</font>

219
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,230
<font color=#FFFF55>I am a...</font>

220

<font color=#FFFF55>I am a...</font>

221
00:24:09,437 --> 00:24:10,940
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm a spy.</font>

222
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,384
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm a spy.
I'm a spy.</font>

223
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:20,598
<font color=#FFFF55><i>British Intelligence got word...</i></font>

224
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:23,393
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...that the leader of the
German Army Gen. Ludendorff.</i></font>

225
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,443
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman empire.</i></font>

226
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,542
<font color=#FFFF55><i>I posed as one of their
pilots and flew in with them.</i></font>

227
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,361
<font color=#FFFF55><i>According to our Intel, the
Germans had no troops left...</i></font>

228
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:37,206
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...no money, no
munitions of any kind.</i></font>

229
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:41,970
<font color=#FFFF55><i>But our Intel was wrong. The German
had the Turks building bombs for 'em.</i></font>

230
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:44,313
<font color=#FFFF55><i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i></font>

231
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:45,922
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Secret weapons.</i></font>

232
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:52,665
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Invented by Ludendorff's chief
psychopath, Dr. Isabelle Maru.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF55><i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Doctor Poison".</i></font>

234
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:59,414

235
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:32,005
<font color=#FFFF55><i>From what I could tell if Dr Maru
was able to complete her work,</i></font>

236
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:35,426
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i></font>

237
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,588
<font color=#FFFF55><i>I was there to observe and
report, nothing more...</i></font>

238
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:40,834
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...but, I had
to do something.</i></font>

239
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:52,573
<font color=#FFFF55>Which is.. I need more time.</font>

240
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,345
<font color=#FFFF55>Unfortunately,
Dr. we don't have more time.</font>

241
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,835
<font color=#FFFF55>This work, this...</font>

242
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:04,088
<font color=#FFFF55>Get that man!</font>

243
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,177
<font color=#FFFF55>Now!</font>

244
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,916
<font color=#FFFF55>But if I can get these notes back to
the British Intelligence in time...</font>

245
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:05,735
<font color=#FFFF55>...it could stop
millions more from dying.</font>

246
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:08,127
<font color=#FFFF55>It could stop the war.</font>

247
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,423
<font color=#FFFF55>War? What war?</font>

248
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:14,128
<font color=#FFFF55>The War.</font>

249
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:19,501
<font color=#FFFF55>The war to end the all wars.</font>

250
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,410
<font color=#FFFF55>Four years...</font>

251
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,279
<font color=#FFFF55>27 countries...
25 million dead.</font>

252
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,599
<font color=#FFFF55>...Soldiers and civilians.</font>

253
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,157
<font color=#FFFF55>Innocent people...</font>

254
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:35,071
<font color=#FFFF55>...Women and
children slaughtered.</font>

255
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:39,658
<font color=#FFFF55>Their homes and thier villages
looted & burned.</font>

256
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:46,901
<font color=#FFFF55>Weapons far deadlier
than you can...</font>

<font color=#FFFF55>...ever imagine.</font>

258
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:57,316
<font color=#FFFF55>It's like nothing
I've ever seen.</font>

259
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:00,454
<font color=#FFFF55>It's like the world's gonna end.</font>

260
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,573
<font color=#FFFF55>Should we let him go?</font>

261
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,677
<font color=#FFFF55>And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?</font>

262
00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:08,750
<font color=#FFFF55>We can not hold him
forever, my queen.</font>

263
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:10,722
<font color=#FFFF55>Mother, excuse me...</font>

264
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:15,005
<font color=#FFFF55>...but after everything the
man said, this must be Ares.</font>

265
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,328
<font color=#FFFF55>What are you talking
about, child?</font>

266
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:19,800
<font color=#FFFF55>Forgive me, Senator, but the man
called it a war without end.</font>

267
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:22,548
<font color=#FFFF55>Millions of people already dead.</font>

268
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:25,189
<font color=#FFFF55>Like nothing he's ever seen.</font>

269
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:27,128
<font color=#FFFF55>Only Ares could do such a thing.</font>

270
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:32,422
<font color=#FFFF55>We can not simply let him go.
We must go with him.</font>

271
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:35,953
<font color=#FFFF55>I will not deploy our army and
leave them scare defences...</font>

272
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:36,812
<font color=#FFFF55>...to go and fight their war.</font>

273
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:38,732
<font color=#FFFF55>It's not their war.</font>

274
00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:41,986
<font color=#FFFF55>Zeus created man to be just, and
wise, strong and passionate...</font>

275
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,402
<font color=#FFFF55>That was a story, Diana!</font>

276
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:46,088
<font color=#FFFF55>This much, you
do not understand?</font>

277
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:47,090
<font color=#FFFF55>Men are easily corrupted.</font>

278
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:49,625
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, but Ares is behind
that corruption!</font>

279
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:53,437
<font color=#FFFF55>It is Ares who has these
Germans fighting..</font>

280
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:57,209
<font color=#FFFF55>And stopping the God of war
is our fore ordinance.</font>

281
00:28:57,534 --> 00:29:00,118
<font color=#FFFF55>As Amazons this is our duty.</font>

282
00:29:00,191 --> 00:29:03,574
<font color=#FFFF55>But you're not an Amazon
like the rest of us.</font>

283
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,510
<font color=#FFFF55>So you will do nothing.</font>

284
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:07,678
<font color=#FFFF55>As your queen I forbid it.</font>

285
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:21,964
<font color=#FFFF55>Strange.</font>

286
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,485
<font color=#FFFF55>Is it true you saved his life?</font>

287
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,192
<font color=#FFFF55>Who told you that?</font>

288
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,542
<font color=#FFFF55>He did.</font>

289
00:29:54,412 --> 00:29:56,035
<font color=#FFFF55>Ah.. I didn't see you come in.</font>

290
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:04,896
<font color=#FFFF55>Would you say you are a...</font>

291
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:08,557
<font color=#FFFF55>...a typical example
of your sex?</font>

292
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,078
<font color=#FFFF55>I am...</font>

293
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,343
<font color=#FFFF55>...above average.</font>

294
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,316
<font color=#FFFF55>What's that?</font>

295
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,616
<font color=#FFFF55>It's a...</font>

296
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,724
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh...</font>

297
00:30:29,606 --> 00:30:30,607
<font color=#FFFF55>It's a watch.</font>

298
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,430
<font color=#FFFF55>A watch?</font>

299
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:33,802
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah, it's a watch.</font>

300
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,437
<font color=#FFFF55>Tells time.</font>

301
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:37,975
<font color=#FFFF55>My father gave it to me.</font>

302
00:30:39,777 --> 00:30:41,169
<font color=#FFFF55>Went through hell 'n back with him.</font>

303
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:45,533
<font color=#FFFF55>Now it's for me and,
good thing it's still ticking..</font>

304
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:47,655
<font color=#FFFF55>What for?</font>

305
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:51,197
<font color=#FFFF55>Because it tells time.</font>

306
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:55,077
<font color=#FFFF55>When to eat, sleep,
wake up, work...</font>

307
00:30:56,608 --> 00:30:59,577
<font color=#FFFF55>You let this little thing
tell you what to do?</font>

308
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:01,343
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah...</font>

309
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:09,249
<font color=#FFFF55>Can I ask you some questions?</font>

310
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,492
<font color=#FFFF55>- Where are we?
- Temiscira.</font>

311
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:16,273
<font color=#FFFF55>No, I got that before, but I mean..
Where are we?</font>

312
00:31:17,184 --> 00:31:19,169
<font color=#FFFF55>What is this place?
Who are you people?</font>

313
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:21,477
<font color=#FFFF55>Why does the water do that?</font>

314
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:23,939
<font color=#FFFF55>How come you don't know what a watch is?
How can you speak English so well?</font>

315
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:25,912
<font color=#FFFF55>We speak hundreds of languages.</font>

316
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:30,177
<font color=#FFFF55>We are the bridge to a greater
understanding between all men.</font>

317
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:33,631
<font color=#FFFF55>Right.</font>

318
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:39,812
<font color=#FFFF55>You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this...</font>

319
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:45,474
<font color=#FFFF55>...earlier, but thank you for
dragging me out of the water.</font>

320
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:48,284
<font color=#FFFF55>Thank you...</font>

321
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:51,213
<font color=#FFFF55>...for what you
did on the beach.</font>

322
00:31:59,189 --> 00:32:00,190
<font color=#FFFF55>So...</font>

323
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,011
<font color=#FFFF55>...you are here to let me go?</font>

324
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:07,879
<font color=#FFFF55>I tried, but it's not up to me.</font>

325
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,265
<font color=#FFFF55>I even asked them to
send me with you..</font>

326
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,257
<font color=#FFFF55>Or anyone.</font>

327
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:15,619
<font color=#FFFF55>In Amazon..</font>

328
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,670
<font color=#FFFF55>The Amazons.</font>

329
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:18,880
<font color=#FFFF55>The Amazons?</font>

330
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:21,781
<font color=#FFFF55>It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.</font>

331
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:24,663
<font color=#FFFF55>And I wish to go..</font>

332
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:29,492
<font color=#FFFF55>But my mother will not allow it.</font>

333
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:32,966
<font color=#FFFF55>Well...</font>

334
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:35,854
<font color=#FFFF55>I can't say I blame her.</font>

335
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:38,056
<font color=#FFFF55>The way this war's going...</font>

336
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,557
<font color=#FFFF55>...I don't wanna let
anyone I care about near.</font>

337
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:43,018
<font color=#FFFF55>Then why do you want to go back?</font>

338
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:45,665
<font color=#FFFF55>I don't think "want"
is the word, right?</font>

339
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,020
<font color=#FFFF55>I guess I gotta try.</font>

340
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:54,623
<font color=#FFFF55>My father told me
once he said...</font>

341
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,496
<font color=#FFFF55>" If you see something wrong
happening in the world...</font>

342
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:59,319
<font color=#FFFF55>"... you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."</font>

343
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:02,993
<font color=#FFFF55>And I already tried nothing.</font>

344
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:43,153
<font color=#FFFF55>Nice outfit.</font>

345
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:45,026
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh, thank you.</font>

346
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,875
<font color=#FFFF55>Now.. I'll show you the
way off the Island...</font>

347
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:51,205
<font color=#FFFF55>...and you'll take me to Ares.</font>

348
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:53,306
<font color=#FFFF55>Deal.</font>

349
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:03,489
<font color=#FFFF55>I am leaving on that?</font>

350
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:04,996
<font color=#FFFF55>We are..</font>

351
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,367
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah, we're leaving in that?</font>

352
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:09,969
<font color=#FFFF55>Do you not know how to sail?</font>

353
00:36:10,352 --> 00:36:11,428
<font color=#FFFF55>Of course I know how to sail.</font>

354
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:13,418
<font color=#FFFF55>Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...</font>

355
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:15,888
<font color=#FFFF55>It's been a while.</font>

356
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,485
<font color=#FFFF55>I am going, mother.</font>

357
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:50,482
<font color=#FFFF55>I cannot stand by while
innocent lives are lost.</font>

358
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,871
<font color=#FFFF55>If no one else will defend the
world from Ares, then I must.</font>

359
00:36:57,473 --> 00:36:58,902
<font color=#FFFF55>I have to go.</font>

360
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:00,401
<font color=#FFFF55>I know.</font>

361
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:04,178
<font color=#FFFF55>Or at least I know I
can not stop you.</font>

362
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,503
<font color=#FFFF55>There is so much...</font>

363
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,580
<font color=#FFFF55>So much you do not understand.</font>

364
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:14,802
<font color=#FFFF55>I understand enough.</font>

365
00:37:15,614 --> 00:37:19,149
<font color=#FFFF55>But I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.</font>

366
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:23,430
<font color=#FFFF55>Like you once did.</font>

367
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:26,038
<font color=#FFFF55>You know that if you
choose to leave...</font>

368
00:37:27,658 --> 00:37:29,256
<font color=#FFFF55>...you may never return.</font>

369
00:37:30,844 --> 00:37:33,028
<font color=#FFFF55>Who will I be if I stay?</font>

370
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,957
<font color=#FFFF55>This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history...</font>

371
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,457
<font color=#FFFF55>...our beloved Anti­ope.</font>

372
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:49,991
<font color=#FFFF55>Make sure you're worthy of it.</font>

373
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,151
<font color=#FFFF55>I will.</font>

374
00:37:56,293 --> 00:37:58,622
<font color=#FFFF55>Be careful in the
world of men, Diana.</font>

375
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:02,732
<font color=#FFFF55>They do not deserve you.</font>

376
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:10,119
<font color=#FFFF55>You have been my greatest love.</font>

377
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:15,564
<font color=#FFFF55>Today...</font>

378
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:20,245
<font color=#FFFF55>...you are my greatest sorrow.</font>

379
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:00,016
<font color=#FFFF55>Should you have told her?</font>

380
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:05,232
<font color=#FFFF55>The more she knows, the
sooner he will find her.</font>

381
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:18,590
<font color=#FFFF55>How long until we reach the war?</font>

382
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,925
<font color=#FFFF55>The war, which part?</font>

383
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:23,761
<font color=#FFFF55>The Western Front in France is...</font>

384
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,164
<font color=#FFFF55>...400 miles long, from the
Alps to the North Sea.</font>

385
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:29,705
<font color=#FFFF55>Where the fighting is
the most intense then.</font>

386
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:32,759
<font color=#FFFF55>If you take me there, I'm
sure I'll find Ares.</font>

387
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:38,715
<font color=#FFFF55>Ares as in..
the God of War?</font>

388
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,816
<font color=#FFFF55>The God of war is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.</font>

389
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:45,728
<font color=#FFFF55>With this.</font>

390
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,483
<font color=#FFFF55>And once I do...</font>

391
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,644
<font color=#FFFF55>...the war will end.</font>

392
00:39:57,455 --> 00:39:59,932
<font color=#FFFF55>Look. I appreciate your spirit...</font>

393
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:01,871
<font color=#FFFF55>...but this war is...</font>

394
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:04,883
<font color=#FFFF55>It's a great big mess.</font>

395
00:40:05,507 --> 00:40:08,282
<font color=#FFFF55>And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.</font>

396
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:11,150
<font color=#FFFF55>I mean, we can get back to London
and try to look for men who can.</font>

397
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,229
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm the man who can!</font>

398
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:15,449
<font color=#FFFF55>Once I find and destroy Ares...</font>

399
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:18,326
<font color=#FFFF55>...the German armies will be
freed from his influence...</font>

400
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:20,912
<font color=#FFFF55>...they will good men again
and the world will be better.</font>

401
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:26,543
<font color=#FFFF55>Great.</font>

402
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:28,280
<font color=#FFFF55>You will see.</font>

403
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:32,667
<font color=#FFFF55>What are you doing?</font>

404
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,811
<font color=#FFFF55>I thought maybe you wanna...</font>

405
00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:38,015
<font color=#FFFF55>...get some sleep.</font>

406
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:43,886
<font color=#FFFF55>What about you?
Are you not sleeping?</font>

407
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:45,979
<font color=#FFFF55>Does the average men not sleep?</font>

408
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:53,026
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, we sleep. We just
don't sleep with a...</font>

409
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:54,313
<font color=#FFFF55>You don't sleep with women?</font>

410
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:57,376
<font color=#FFFF55>No, I mean, I do, I sleep with...
I sleep with...</font>

411
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:00,169
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, I do..</font>

412
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:01,806
<font color=#FFFF55>But out of the...</font>

413
00:41:02,805 --> 00:41:05,920
<font color=#FFFF55>...confines of marriage.</font>

414
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:11,479
<font color=#FFFF55>Not polite to assume, you know?</font>

415
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:16,827
<font color=#FFFF55>"Marriage"?</font>

416
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:18,712
<font color=#FFFF55>Weird! You don't have that...</font>

417
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,361
<font color=#FFFF55>You go before a judge...</font>

418
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:26,168
<font color=#FFFF55>...and you swear to love, honor
and cherish each other...</font>

419
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,370
<font color=#FFFF55>...Until death do you apart.</font>

420
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:30,192
<font color=#FFFF55>And do they.. love
each other till death?</font>

421
00:41:30,474 --> 00:41:32,309
<font color=#FFFF55>Not very often, no.</font>

422
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:33,761
<font color=#FFFF55>Then why do they do it?</font>

423
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:36,367
<font color=#FFFF55>I have no idea.</font>

424
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:40,194
<font color=#FFFF55>So you cannot sleep
with me unless I marry you..</font>

425
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:42,021
<font color=#FFFF55>I will sleep with you if you want.
I'll sleep right there.</font>

426
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,121
<font color=#FFFF55>There is plenty of room.</font>

427
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:45,713
<font color=#FFFF55>- Then fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.</font>

428
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:48,548
<font color=#FFFF55>- I'm just fine.
- Coming to sleep with you.</font>

429
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:49,758
<font color=#FFFF55>Okay.</font>

430
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:15,963
<font color=#FFFF55>You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.</font>

431
00:42:16,778 --> 00:42:19,319
<font color=#FFFF55>You know, um..
being a spy...</font>

432
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:22,692
<font color=#FFFF55>You have to show a
certain amount of...</font>

433
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,541
<font color=#FFFF55>...vigor.</font>

434
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,208
<font color=#FFFF55>Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?</font>

435
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,057
<font color=#FFFF55>I have no father.</font>

436
00:42:34,776 --> 00:42:36,352
<font color=#FFFF55>My mother sculpted
me from clay...</font>

437
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:38,768
<font color=#FFFF55>...and I was brought
to life by Zeus.</font>

438
00:42:41,897 --> 00:42:43,192
<font color=#FFFF55>Well that's neat.</font>

439
00:42:46,904 --> 00:42:47,905
<font color=#FFFF55>Sorry.</font>

440
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:52,397
<font color=#FFFF55>Where I come from..</font>

441
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:56,011
<font color=#FFFF55>...babies are made differently.</font>

442
00:42:57,069 --> 00:42:58,908
<font color=#FFFF55>You refer to
reproductive biology.</font>

443
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:00,626
<font color=#FFFF55>- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.</font>

444
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,939
<font color=#FFFF55>I know all about that.</font>

445
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:06,026
<font color=#FFFF55>I mean I refer to that
and other things.</font>

446
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,255
<font color=#FFFF55>The pleasures of the flesh.</font>

447
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,708
<font color=#FFFF55>Do you know about that?</font>

448
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:17,996
<font color=#FFFF55>I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
criticism on earthly pleasures</font>

449
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,061
<font color=#FFFF55>12 huh?</font>

450
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:27,698
<font color=#FFFF55>Did you bring any
of those with you?</font>

451
00:43:28,213 --> 00:43:29,468
<font color=#FFFF55>You would not enjoy them.</font>

452
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:30,903
<font color=#FFFF55>I don't know.
May be.</font>

453
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,124
<font color=#FFFF55>No you wouldn't.</font>

454
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:33,390
<font color=#FFFF55>Why not?</font>

455
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:37,030
<font color=#FFFF55>They came to the conclusion that man
are essential for procreation...</font>

456
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,055
<font color=#FFFF55>...but when it comes
to pleasure...</font>

457
00:43:40,248 --> 00:43:41,253
<font color=#FFFF55>...Unnecessary.</font>

458
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:42,424
<font color=#FFFF55>No.</font>

459
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:48,735
<font color=#FFFF55>Goodnight.</font>

460
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:04,254
<font color=#FFFF55>How long until we're operational?</font>

461
00:44:04,555 --> 00:44:05,876
<font color=#FFFF55>Two days, sir.</font>

462
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:07,759
<font color=#FFFF55>We'll have it up
tonight, Captain.</font>

463
00:44:07,994 --> 00:44:12,104
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir, the men have had
no food, no sleep.</font>

464
00:44:12,105 --> 00:44:14,266
<font color=#FFFF55>Do you think I have had a
neat food or rest, captain?</font>

465
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:16,745
<font color=#FFFF55>Do you hear me making excuses?</font>

466
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:17,501
<font color=#FFFF55>No.</font>

467
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:19,444
<font color=#FFFF55>Your men, they are
weak, complacent.</font>

468
00:44:19,644 --> 00:44:22,089
<font color=#FFFF55>You've let them forget for an
attack can happen at any time.</font>

469
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,622
<font color=#FFFF55>...from any cover!</font>

470
00:44:23,893 --> 00:44:25,174
<font color=#FFFF55>So let's you & I remind them...</font>

471
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:26,362
<font color=#FFFF55>...Shall we?</font>

472
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,816
<font color=#FFFF55>- Doctor.
- General.</font>

473
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:44,047
<font color=#FFFF55>Progress?</font>

474
00:44:44,169 --> 00:44:45,476
<font color=#FFFF55>Not enough.</font>

475
00:44:46,288 --> 00:44:48,119
<font color=#FFFF55>It is over, General.</font>

476
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,204
<font color=#FFFF55>Germany is giving up.</font>

477
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:54,298
<font color=#FFFF55>Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice.</font>

478
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:56,588
<font color=#FFFF55>We have run out of time.</font>

479
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:00,943
<font color=#FFFF55>As soon as the Kaiser sees
the newest weapon...</font>

480
00:45:01,192 --> 00:45:02,915
<font color=#FFFF55>...he will not
sign the armistice.</font>

481
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:04,103
<font color=#FFFF55>But without my notebook...</font>

482
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:05,688
<font color=#FFFF55>We will get your book!</font>

483
00:45:05,689 --> 00:45:08,200
<font color=#FFFF55>It is you that I believe in,
not it.</font>

484
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,680
<font color=#FFFF55>I know what you can
and will succeed...</font>

485
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:17,757
<font color=#FFFF55>It is what you're put
on this earth to do.</font>

486
00:45:21,404 --> 00:45:24,738
<font color=#FFFF55>Something, did come
to me last night.</font>

487
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:26,963
<font color=#FFFF55>A different type of gas.</font>

488
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:29,098
<font color=#FFFF55>For you.</font>

489
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:31,549
<font color=#FFFF55>To restore your strength.</font>

490
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:04,325
<font color=#FFFF55>I have got it!
I have got it!</font>

491
00:46:04,614 --> 00:46:07,578
<font color=#FFFF55>And if it's what I think...</font>

492
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,745
<font color=#FFFF55>It's going to be...</font>

493
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:13,762
<font color=#FFFF55>...terrible.</font>

494
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:36,329
<font color=#FFFF55>Morning!</font>

495
00:46:36,722 --> 00:46:39,419
<font color=#FFFF55>We got lucky. We caught a
ride, we make some good time.</font>

496
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,105
<font color=#FFFF55>Welcome to Jolly old London!</font>

497
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:44,033
<font color=#FFFF55>It's hideous..</font>

498
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:46,046
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah, it's not for everybody.</font>

499
00:47:08,053 --> 00:47:09,670
<font color=#FFFF55>- Good morning Darling.
- What a babe.</font>

500
00:47:09,923 --> 00:47:10,924
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh no!</font>

501
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:13,414
<font color=#FFFF55>Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.</font>

502
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,239
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on!</font>

503
00:47:18,823 --> 00:47:20,356
<font color=#FFFF55>Why are they holding hands?</font>

504
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,479
<font color=#FFFF55>Probably because
they're together.</font>

505
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:28,865
<font color=#FFFF55>No... No.. We're not together,
I mean, in that way.</font>

506
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,151
<font color=#FFFF55>This way.</font>

507
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:31,252
<font color=#FFFF55>To the war!</font>

508
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:34,095
<font color=#FFFF55>Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta get this way first.</font>

509
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,596
<font color=#FFFF55>And where are we going?</font>

510
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,588
<font color=#FFFF55>We gotta get this
notebook to my superiors.</font>

511
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:38,909
<font color=#FFFF55>Hey! Hey..!</font>

512
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:42,081
<font color=#FFFF55>No. I let you go.
You take me to Ares.</font>

513
00:47:42,347 --> 00:47:44,079
<font color=#FFFF55>- We made a deal, Steve Trevor.
- Yeah.</font>

514
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,542
<font color=#FFFF55>And a deal is a promise.</font>

515
00:47:45,784 --> 00:47:47,684
<font color=#FFFF55>And a promise is unbreakable.</font>

516
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:50,639
<font color=#FFFF55>Oi, damn it, alright.</font>

517
00:47:51,737 --> 00:47:53,422
<font color=#FFFF55>Come with me first
to deliver this...</font>

518
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:55,279
<font color=#FFFF55>...and then we'll
give you a ticket...</font>

519
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:57,297
<font color=#FFFF55>...to the war.</font>

520
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,581
<font color=#FFFF55>Deal?</font>

521
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:01,215
<font color=#FFFF55>- Let's go.
- Diana...</font>

522
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:02,240
<font color=#FFFF55>What are you doing?</font>

523
00:48:02,288 --> 00:48:04,681
<font color=#FFFF55>You can not do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.</font>

524
00:48:04,706 --> 00:48:07,917
<font color=#FFFF55>Let's go... Let's go
buy some clothes.</font>

525
00:48:08,205 --> 00:48:10,122
<font color=#FFFF55>What do these women
wear into battle?</font>

526
00:48:10,147 --> 00:48:11,499
<font color=#FFFF55>They don't...</font>

527
00:48:12,108 --> 00:48:13,362
<font color=#FFFF55>A baby!</font>

528
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,858
<font color=#FFFF55>No, no.. No babies.</font>

529
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,741
<font color=#FFFF55>One's not made out of clay.</font>

530
00:48:20,055 --> 00:48:21,105
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on.</font>

531
00:48:21,324 --> 00:48:23,334
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana! Please.</font>

532
00:48:38,756 --> 00:48:39,989
<font color=#FFFF55>Thank God! You're not dead!</font>

533
00:48:42,725 --> 00:48:44,293
<font color=#FFFF55>Hurray!</font>

534
00:48:44,294 --> 00:48:46,627
<font color=#FFFF55>I did think you're dead till
I got your call, you know?</font>

535
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:49,569
<font color=#FFFF55>He's been gone for weeks..
Not a single word.</font>

536
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:50,893
<font color=#FFFF55>Very unlike him.</font>

537
00:48:51,049 --> 00:48:53,349
<font color=#FFFF55>I am introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.</font>

538
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,367
<font color=#FFFF55>I am Steve Trevor's secretary.</font>

539
00:48:55,654 --> 00:48:56,852
<font color=#FFFF55>What is a secretary?</font>

540
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:58,507
<font color=#FFFF55>Well, I do everything.</font>

541
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:01,161
<font color=#FFFF55>I go where he tells me to go and
I do what he tells me to do.</font>

542
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:03,661
<font color=#FFFF55>Well, where I am from,
that's called slavery.</font>

543
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:04,934
<font color=#FFFF55>I really like her.</font>

544
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:06,521
<font color=#FFFF55>Fantastic.
Ladies after you.</font>

545
00:49:06,522 --> 00:49:07,691
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh.. I do, I like her.</font>

546
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:20,375
<font color=#FFFF55>Is this what passes for
armor in your country?</font>

547
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,007
<font color=#FFFF55>Ah. well, "Oh my".
It's fashion.</font>

548
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:24,640
<font color=#FFFF55>Keeps our tummies in..</font>

549
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,343
<font color=#FFFF55>Why must you keep them in?</font>

550
00:49:26,676 --> 00:49:28,801
<font color=#FFFF55>Any woman with a tummy
would ask that question!</font>

551
00:49:30,595 --> 00:49:34,015
<font color=#FFFF55>Conservative, but
not entirely unfun.</font>

552
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,564
<font color=#FFFF55>Try it on at least.</font>

553
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:37,942
<font color=#FFFF55>Very well..</font>

554
00:49:39,331 --> 00:49:40,332
<font color=#FFFF55>No!</font>

555
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:48,709
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on!</font>

556
00:49:57,982 --> 00:50:00,644
<font color=#FFFF55>How can a woman
possibly fight in this?</font>

557
00:50:01,023 --> 00:50:02,033
<font color=#FFFF55>Fight?</font>

558
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:03,642
<font color=#FFFF55>We use our principles.</font>

559
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:05,546
<font color=#FFFF55>I mean that's how we are
gonna get to vote.</font>

560
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:09,427
<font color=#FFFF55>Although I am not opposed to
engaging in a bitter fist stickups..</font>

561
00:50:09,628 --> 00:50:11,352
<font color=#FFFF55>...should the occasion arise.</font>

562
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:14,012
<font color=#FFFF55>Lovely.</font>

563
00:50:15,757 --> 00:50:17,976
<font color=#FFFF55>It's itching.
It's choking me.</font>

564
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:21,328
<font color=#FFFF55>Can they blame it?</font>

565
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,863
<font color=#FFFF55>Etta.</font>

566
00:50:23,393 --> 00:50:24,141
<font color=#FFFF55>Where is she?</font>

567
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:26,625
<font color=#FFFF55>She's trying on upto number 226.</font>

568
00:50:36,311 --> 00:50:39,538
<font color=#FFFF55>Ms. Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less</font>

569
00:50:39,761 --> 00:50:40,778
<font color=#FFFF55>...distracting.</font>

570
00:50:43,196 --> 00:50:44,307
<font color=#FFFF55>May I?</font>

571
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:50,146
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah, really? Specs?</font>

572
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,522
<font color=#FFFF55>Certainly she's not the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?</font>

573
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:00,461
<font color=#FFFF55>Better.</font>

574
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:12,882
<font color=#FFFF55>Yep, that's not gonna work.</font>

575
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:14,809
<font color=#FFFF55>Please put the
sword down, Diana.</font>

576
00:51:15,061 --> 00:51:16,062
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana!</font>

577
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,284
<font color=#FFFF55>Let me try it by myself.</font>

578
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,590
<font color=#FFFF55>After you, sir.</font>

579
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:30,166
<font color=#FFFF55>Etta...</font>

580
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:32,858
<font color=#FFFF55>Why don't I meet you
back at the office?</font>

581
00:51:33,108 --> 00:51:34,929
<font color=#FFFF55>And meanwhile, I'll take
this for safekeeping.</font>

582
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:36,209
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh no, I don't think so.</font>

583
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:38,039
<font color=#FFFF55>You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.</font>

584
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:40,047
<font color=#FFFF55>- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.</font>

585
00:51:40,048 --> 00:51:42,334
<font color=#FFFF55>Put the sword down,
first of all.</font>

586
00:51:44,924 --> 00:51:48,330
<font color=#FFFF55>Promise me you'll protect
it with your life.</font>

587
00:51:49,063 --> 00:51:50,736
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes... no.</font>

588
00:51:51,006 --> 00:51:52,929
<font color=#FFFF55>You can trust her.
Just hand that over.</font>

589
00:51:53,314 --> 00:51:55,106
<font color=#FFFF55>- Shield.
- And the shield to her..</font>

590
00:51:56,538 --> 00:51:57,570
<font color=#FFFF55>You got it? Thanks, Etta.</font>

591
00:51:57,595 --> 00:51:58,812
<font color=#FFFF55>This is easy.</font>

592
00:52:01,143 --> 00:52:02,144
<font color=#FFFF55>There we go.</font>

593
00:52:30,115 --> 00:52:31,157
<font color=#FFFF55>What is it?</font>

594
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,232
<font color=#FFFF55>Hopefully, nothing.
Come on.</font>

595
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:46,999
<font color=#FFFF55>- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on!</font>

596
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,232
<font color=#FFFF55>Captain Trevor.</font>

597
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:02,145
<font color=#FFFF55>I believe you have something that
is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.</font>

598
00:53:03,906 --> 00:53:06,379
<font color=#FFFF55>Ah, it's the bad guy convention.</font>

599
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:08,736
<font color=#FFFF55>Give us Dr Maru's note book.</font>

600
00:53:09,566 --> 00:53:10,966
<font color=#FFFF55>Where I put that thing?</font>

601
00:53:13,142 --> 00:53:13,943
<font color=#FFFF55>Stand back!</font>

602
00:53:25,128 --> 00:53:26,129
<font color=#FFFF55>Or maybe not.</font>

603
00:53:42,215 --> 00:53:43,216
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh, tough luck.</font>

604
00:53:49,998 --> 00:53:52,044
<font color=#FFFF55>Is there anything else
you wanna show me?</font>

605
00:53:53,048 --> 00:53:54,735
<font color=#FFFF55>Where do you think you're going?</font>

606
00:54:01,477 --> 00:54:03,968
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm sorry, but you're clearly
under Ares' control.</font>

607
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:06,876
<font color=#FFFF55>- Diana.
- Let me help you get free.</font>

608
00:54:07,146 --> 00:54:08,576
<font color=#FFFF55>Where will I find Ares?</font>

609
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,789
<font color=#FFFF55>He's... He's dead.</font>

610
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:20,243
<font color=#FFFF55>Cyanide.</font>

611
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,846
<font color=#FFFF55>Stay here.
I'll be right back.</font>

612
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:33,721
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Come on! Gentlemen, please!</i></font>

613
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:40,549
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Let him speak!</i></font>

614
00:54:40,649 --> 00:54:41,907
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes thank you, gentlemen...</font>

615
00:54:42,561 --> 00:54:46,556
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Germany is an immensely
proud nation.</i></font>

616
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:49,714
<font color=#FFFF55><i>They will never surrender.</i></font>

617
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:52,741
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Now look.
The only way to end this war...</i></font>

618
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:55,377
<font color=#FFFF55>Colonel, I need to
talk to you outside.</font>

619
00:54:55,477 --> 00:54:58,063
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...and restore world peace...</i></font>

620
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,337
<font color=#FFFF55><i>is to negotiate...</i></font>

621
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:03,727
<font color=#FFFF55>...an armistice.</font>

622
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:05,933
<font color=#FFFF55><i>There's a woman.</i></font>

623
00:55:06,923 --> 00:55:08,387
<font color=#FFFF55>What is she doing here?
Get her out..</font>

624
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:11,593
<font color=#FFFF55>Ger her out..</font>

625
00:55:12,236 --> 00:55:13,237
<font color=#FFFF55>Sorry.</font>

626
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:15,740
<font color=#FFFF55>Blind sister,
she got lost on the way to her bathroom..</font>

627
00:55:15,741 --> 00:55:17,919
<font color=#FFFF55>I think it's this way.
Sorry guys.</font>

628
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:20,601
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Our only aim at this time...</i></font>

629
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:23,446
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...must be to achieve peace...</i></font>

630
00:55:23,447 --> 00:55:25,450
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...at any cost!</i></font>

631
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:31,356
<font color=#FFFF55>Why you been not hearing speech?
He is talking of peace.</font>

632
00:55:31,357 --> 00:55:32,968
<font color=#FFFF55>Not right now!</font>

633
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:40,553
<font color=#FFFF55>Trevor, what the hell were you thinking
bringing a woman into the counsel?</font>

634
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:42,566
<font color=#FFFF55>The Intel that I brought
back is time sensitive.</font>

635
00:55:42,859 --> 00:55:44,784
<font color=#FFFF55>This is one of Dr.
Maru's notebooks.</font>

636
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:45,520
<font color=#FFFF55>Notebook or notes...</font>

637
00:55:45,571 --> 00:55:46,448
<font color=#FFFF55>We need to get it
to Cryptography.</font>

638
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:48,227
<font color=#FFFF55>And I need a immediate
audience with the generals.</font>

639
00:55:48,228 --> 00:55:50,310
<font color=#FFFF55>You do not just barge in here.</font>

640
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:52,078
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir with all due respect..
What I saw in my last trip...</font>

641
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,215
<font color=#FFFF55>...will change the
course of war.</font>

642
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:54,806
<font color=#FFFF55>Captain Trevor!</font>

643
00:55:56,928 --> 00:55:58,654
<font color=#FFFF55>I heard we lost you in
one of your mission...</font>

644
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,086
<font color=#FFFF55>...and yet here you are,
back from the dead...</font>

645
00:56:00,087 --> 00:56:02,037
<font color=#FFFF55>...and I see you
brought a friend with you.</font>

646
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:03,828
<font color=#FFFF55>My deepest apology for
interruption sir.</font>

647
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:05,497
<font color=#FFFF55>No, no no... non sense.</font>

648
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,465
<font color=#FFFF55>Thanks to this young woman...</font>

649
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:11,116
<font color=#FFFF55>...the room was finally quiet enough
for me to get atleast a few words in.</font>

650
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,418
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir Patrick Morgan,
at your service.</font>

651
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,392
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana, princess of the...</font>

652
00:56:15,634 --> 00:56:17,374
<font color=#FFFF55>"Prince". Diana Prince.</font>

653
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:19,290
<font color=#FFFF55>She is...</font>

654
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,541
<font color=#FFFF55>and I..</font>

655
00:56:20,707 --> 00:56:21,708
<font color=#FFFF55>...are...</font>

656
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:22,871
<font color=#FFFF55>...working together.</font>

657
00:56:23,401 --> 00:56:25,483
<font color=#FFFF55>She actually helped me bring
this notebook back here.</font>

658
00:56:25,626 --> 00:56:27,288
<font color=#FFFF55>That's from Dr Maru's lab.</font>

659
00:56:27,313 --> 00:56:30,580
<font color=#FFFF55>I think the information it contains
inside will change the course of the war.</font>

660
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:32,605
<font color=#FFFF55>My.. God.</font>

661
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:35,552
<font color=#FFFF55>- Dr Poison herself.
- Yes.</font>

662
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:45,186
<font color=#FFFF55>P s a g m e n o .com</font>

663
00:57:05,947 --> 00:57:06,948
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes.</font>

664
00:57:07,555 --> 00:57:08,756
<font color=#FFFF55>Intriguing.</font>

665
00:57:09,015 --> 00:57:10,378
<font color=#FFFF55>Any further intelligence?</font>

666
00:57:10,624 --> 00:57:13,387
<font color=#FFFF55>Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography had no luck.</font>

667
00:57:13,607 --> 00:57:15,546
<font color=#FFFF55>It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages...</font>

668
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:19,340
<font color=#FFFF55>...but as if they failed to
determine which two languages.</font>

669
00:57:19,685 --> 00:57:21,214
<font color=#FFFF55>Ottoman & Sumerian.</font>

670
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:25,894
<font color=#FFFF55>Surely someone else in
this room knew that.</font>

671
00:57:26,174 --> 00:57:27,205
<font color=#FFFF55>Who is this woman?</font>

672
00:57:27,474 --> 00:57:29,156
<font color=#FFFF55>She is my...</font>

673
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,991
<font color=#FFFF55>...secretary, sir.</font>

674
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:33,724
<font color=#FFFF55>And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?</font>

675
00:57:34,127 --> 00:57:35,599
<font color=#FFFF55>She's a very good secretary.</font>

676
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,578
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir, if this woman
can read it...</font>

677
00:57:40,809 --> 00:57:42,635
<font color=#FFFF55>...we should hear
what she has to say.</font>

678
00:57:42,636 --> 00:57:44,532
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, very well.</font>

679
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,361
<font color=#FFFF55>It's a formula...</font>

680
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:55,341
<font color=#FFFF55>...for a new kind of gas.</font>

681
00:57:55,366 --> 00:57:58,099
<font color=#FFFF55>Mustard gas, hydrogen
based instead of sulfur.</font>

682
00:57:58,530 --> 00:57:59,509
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Hydrogen based...</i></font>

683
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,321
<font color=#FFFF55>Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.</font>

684
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:05,332
<font color=#FFFF55>The book says, they plan
to release the gas...</font>

685
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:07,009
<font color=#FFFF55>At the front?</font>

686
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,021
<font color=#FFFF55>When?</font>

687
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:09,389
<font color=#FFFF55>It doesn't say.</font>

688
00:58:09,843 --> 00:58:11,347
<font color=#FFFF55>Wait. In "front" of what?</font>

689
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:12,465
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir...</font>

690
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,121
<font color=#FFFF55>...that is the
evidence we need.</font>

691
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:15,948
<font color=#FFFF55>You have to find out where
they are making that gas.</font>

692
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:17,325
<font color=#FFFF55>You have to burn
it to the ground.</font>

693
00:58:17,545 --> 00:58:18,546
<font color=#FFFF55>Destroy it.</font>

694
00:58:18,622 --> 00:58:21,029
<font color=#FFFF55>Ludendorff was last
seen in Belgium.</font>

695
00:58:21,312 --> 00:58:25,412
<font color=#FFFF55>We can't be seen in sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium...</font>

696
00:58:25,713 --> 00:58:28,870
<font color=#FFFF55>...As we are negotiating
their surrender.</font>

697
00:58:28,895 --> 00:58:30,774
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir, I have seen that
gas with my own eyes.</font>

698
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,667
<font color=#FFFF55>If it is used, it will kill
everyone on both sides.</font>

699
00:58:33,692 --> 00:58:34,538
<font color=#FFFF55>They will all die.</font>

700
00:58:34,785 --> 00:58:37,728
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, that's what
soldiers do, Captain.</font>

701
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:40,497
<font color=#FFFF55>Send me in.. with some
logistical support.</font>

702
00:58:40,547 --> 00:58:43,511
<font color=#FFFF55>At least give me the chance to take
out Ludendorff's operation myself.</font>

703
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:44,637
<font color=#FFFF55>Are you insane?</font>

704
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:47,097
<font color=#FFFF55>I can't introduce rogue
elements this late in the case.</font>

705
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,034
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir, I can take...</font>

706
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,518
<font color=#FFFF55>Now more than ever...</font>

707
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:53,461
<font color=#FFFF55>...the armistice is
off paramount importance.</font>

708
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:57,310
<font color=#FFFF55>It must be negotiated
it must be signed..</font>

709
00:58:58,096 --> 00:59:00,795
<font color=#FFFF55>It's the best way
of stopping the war.</font>

710
00:59:01,011 --> 00:59:02,910
<font color=#FFFF55>Captain, you will do nothing.</font>

711
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,228
<font color=#FFFF55>And that's an order.</font>

712
00:59:06,117 --> 00:59:07,118
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes sir.</font>

713
00:59:08,471 --> 00:59:09,472
<font color=#FFFF55>I understand, sir.</font>

714
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:11,302
<font color=#FFFF55>I don't!</font>

715
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,071
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana, I know this confusing...</font>

716
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:15,485
<font color=#FFFF55>- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
- Who is this woman?</font>

717
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:16,602
<font color=#FFFF55>She is with me, she is with us.</font>

718
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:17,607
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm not.. I am not with you!</font>

719
00:59:17,885 --> 00:59:20,846
<font color=#FFFF55>You would knowingly
sacrifice all those lives.</font>

720
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:22,310
<font color=#FFFF55>...as if they mean
less than yours.</font>

721
00:59:22,335 --> 00:59:24,422
<font color=#FFFF55>- Diana, let's talk about it outside.
- As if they mean nothing?</font>

722
00:59:24,423 --> 00:59:27,457
<font color=#FFFF55>Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.</font>

723
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,704
<font color=#FFFF55>That's enough! They fight
alongside their soldiers.</font>

724
00:59:29,705 --> 00:59:31,533
<font color=#FFFF55>They die with them
on the battlefield!</font>

725
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,258
<font color=#FFFF55>- That's enough! My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.</font>

726
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:34,331
<font color=#FFFF55>- My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.</font>

727
00:59:34,632 --> 00:59:36,405
<font color=#FFFF55>- Diana... Diana!
- All of you should be ashamed!</font>

728
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,528
<font color=#FFFF55>Please slow down!</font>

729
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:40,937
<font color=#FFFF55>Is that your leader?</font>

730
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:43,320
<font color=#FFFF55>How could he say that?
Believe that?</font>

731
00:59:43,638 --> 00:59:44,976
<font color=#FFFF55>And.. and you!</font>

732
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,466
<font color=#FFFF55>Was your duty to simply
give them a book?</font>

733
00:59:47,496 --> 00:59:47,827
<font color=#FFFF55>No!</font>

734
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,648
<font color=#FFFF55>You didn't stand your ground.
You didn't fight.</font>

735
00:59:49,649 --> 00:59:51,321
<font color=#FFFF55>Because there was no chance
of changing anything.</font>

736
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:54,709
<font color=#FFFF55>This is Ares and
he's not going to allow negotiation,</font>

737
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:56,059
<font color=#FFFF55>...nor a surrender!</font>

738
00:59:56,084 --> 00:59:58,786
<font color=#FFFF55>The millions of people you
talked about, they will die.</font>

739
00:59:58,811 --> 01:00:00,171
<font color=#FFFF55>We are going anyway!</font>

740
01:00:02,518 --> 01:00:04,376
<font color=#FFFF55>You mean you were lying?</font>

741
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:06,476
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm a spy!
That's what I do!</font>

742
01:00:06,576 --> 01:00:08,694
<font color=#FFFF55>How do I know you're not
lying to me right now?</font>

743
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,253
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm taking you to the front.</font>

744
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,648
<font color=#FFFF55>We are afraid you're gonna die.</font>

745
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:20,675
<font color=#FFFF55>This is a terrible idea.</font>

746
01:00:25,366 --> 01:00:27,113
<font color=#FFFF55>We're gonna need reinforcements.</font>

747
01:00:37,897 --> 01:00:39,887
<font color=#FFFF55>These are the reinforcements?</font>

748
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:40,913
<font color=#FFFF55>Yep.</font>

749
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:43,003
<font color=#FFFF55>Are these even good men?</font>

750
01:00:43,629 --> 01:00:45,214
<font color=#FFFF55>Well, relatively.</font>

751
01:00:46,362 --> 01:00:50,404
<font color=#FFFF55>Even in Africa gentlemen, we
haven't seen such luxuries.</font>

752
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:54,710
<font color=#FFFF55>The luxury that we have now is like...
is like we can't stop making money!</font>

753
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:57,098
<font color=#FFFF55>So my uncle, the
Prince, and I...</font>

754
01:00:57,659 --> 01:00:59,090
<font color=#FFFF55>Which prince is that?</font>

755
01:00:59,716 --> 01:01:01,858
<font color=#FFFF55>I decided to extend
your profanity...</font>

756
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,481
<font color=#FFFF55>But seriously, which prince?</font>

757
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:06,950
<font color=#FFFF55>Hey, Sultan, Angoora,
Next Kashmir...</font>

758
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:08,900
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...Care to talk for a minute?</i></font>

759
01:01:09,472 --> 01:01:11,604
<font color=#FFFF55>Gentlemen, excuse me one second.</font>

760
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,273
<font color=#FFFF55>- A bar... Well, a pub.
- You hypocrite.</font>

761
01:01:14,473 --> 01:01:17,612
<font color=#FFFF55>I've been racing those peacocks
all night, and you've...</font>

762
01:01:18,025 --> 01:01:19,725
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh my goodness, gracious.</font>

763
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:21,548
<font color=#FFFF55>That's a work of art.</font>

764
01:01:21,549 --> 01:01:23,827
<font color=#FFFF55>Sameer, Diana.
Diana, Sameer!</font>

765
01:01:23,852 --> 01:01:26,105
<font color=#FFFF55>Hi, Diana. You can
call me Sammy please.</font>

766
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:26,939
<font color=#FFFF55>"Sammy".</font>

767
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,480
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh Sameer, I wouldn't...
do that if I were you.</font>

768
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:30,829
<font color=#FFFF55>Sameer is a top undercover man.</font>

769
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,499
<font color=#FFFF55>He can talk the skin off a cabbage
many ways as you can.</font>

770
01:01:33,814 --> 01:01:36,508
<font color=#FFFF55><i>He doesn't look that impressive to me.</i></font>

771
01:01:36,709 --> 01:01:38,161
<font color=#FFFF55><i>You do for me.</i></font>

772
01:01:38,525 --> 01:01:41,446
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Your eyes, as soft as your smile.</i></font>

773
01:01:41,672 --> 01:01:42,623
<font color=#FFFF55><i>And your eyes...</i></font>

774
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:45,526
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...looks like they want something.</i></font>

775
01:01:45,964 --> 01:01:47,884
<font color=#FFFF55><i>I know Chinese too, tricky girl.</i></font>

776
01:01:47,926 --> 01:01:50,168
<font color=#FFFF55><i>But, can you recite Socrates
in ancient Greek?</i></font>

777
01:01:52,529 --> 01:01:53,532
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh, you're done.</font>

778
01:01:53,557 --> 01:01:54,558
<font color=#FFFF55>Where is Charlie?</font>

779
01:01:58,686 --> 01:01:59,687
<font color=#FFFF55>Voila!</font>

780
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:04,825
<font color=#FFFF55>At least this Charlie
is good with his fists.</font>

781
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:07,226
<font color=#FFFF55>That's not Charlie.</font>

782
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:16,310
<font color=#FFFF55>That's Charlie.</font>

783
01:02:20,748 --> 01:02:21,749
<font color=#FFFF55>Steven!</font>

784
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:24,739
<font color=#FFFF55>May god grow a flower
upon your head son.</font>

785
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:25,883
<font color=#FFFF55>Good to see you.</font>

786
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:29,352
<font color=#FFFF55>So what were you fighting about?</font>

787
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:33,086
<font color=#FFFF55>I mistook his glass for mine.
That happens.</font>

788
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,821
<font color=#FFFF55>This man is no fighter.</font>

789
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:37,043
<font color=#FFFF55>Charlie is an expert marksman.</font>

790
01:02:37,613 --> 01:02:38,925
<font color=#FFFF55>Means he shoots people.</font>

791
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:40,515
<font color=#FFFF55>From very far away.</font>

792
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,110
<font color=#FFFF55>You never know what hit 'em.</font>

793
01:02:43,797 --> 01:02:46,340
<font color=#FFFF55>So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?</font>

794
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,703
<font color=#FFFF55>I don't. Trust me
it's better that way.</font>

795
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:50,301
<font color=#FFFF55>You fight without honor.</font>

796
01:02:50,609 --> 01:02:52,458
<font color=#FFFF55>Who gets paid for honor?</font>

797
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:55,225
<font color=#FFFF55>So, what's the job, boss?</font>

798
01:02:56,723 --> 01:02:57,739
<font color=#FFFF55>Two days tops.</font>

799
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,362
<font color=#FFFF55>We need supplies and
passage to Belgium.</font>

800
01:03:00,462 --> 01:03:01,694
<font color=#FFFF55>What's the going rate?</font>

801
01:03:01,794 --> 01:03:02,507
<font color=#FFFF55>Better be a good pay.</font>

802
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:04,719
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah, well, here's the thing.</font>

803
01:03:06,864 --> 01:03:07,834
<font color=#FFFF55>..I told you it was going to be quick.</font>

804
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,529
<font color=#FFFF55>And there's a lot to
be gained by this.</font>

805
01:03:11,804 --> 01:03:13,728
<font color=#FFFF55>It's for a great cause...</font>

806
01:03:15,027 --> 01:03:16,028
<font color=#FFFF55>...Freedom.</font>

807
01:03:16,562 --> 01:03:17,970
<font color=#FFFF55>Friendship...</font>

808
01:03:20,539 --> 01:03:21,736
<font color=#FFFF55>...ending the war, friendship...</font>

809
01:03:21,737 --> 01:03:23,093
<font color=#FFFF55>- Okay, You have no money.
- No.</font>

810
01:03:23,394 --> 01:03:26,371
<font color=#FFFF55><i>All I want now is a picture
of that beautiful face.</i></font>

811
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:29,351
<font color=#FFFF55><i>You will not need a photo...</i></font>

812
01:03:29,736 --> 01:03:30,686
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...because I'll go with you.</i></font>

813
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:32,758
<font color=#FFFF55>What?</font>

814
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:33,883
<font color=#FFFF55>What is this?</font>

815
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:35,244
<font color=#FFFF55>We're gonna drop her up at front!</font>

816
01:03:35,535 --> 01:03:37,137
<font color=#FFFF55>- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.</font>

817
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:39,894
<font color=#FFFF55>Question sweetheart, I am not
gonna get myself killed...</font>

818
01:03:39,995 --> 01:03:41,295
<font color=#FFFF55>...with helping every last human.</font>

819
01:03:41,341 --> 01:03:43,941
<font color=#FFFF55>- That's no I mean.
- Here's the little thief now!</font>

820
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:00,839
<font color=#FFFF55>I am both frightened and aroused.</font>

821
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,012
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh here they are! Sorry I'm late.
Sir Patrick!</font>

822
01:04:09,037 --> 01:04:10,656
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, that's what I
was gonna mention.</font>

823
01:04:12,033 --> 01:04:13,692
<font color=#FFFF55>- Sir Patrick.
- No... No..!</font>

824
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:16,171
<font color=#FFFF55>Gentlemen, sit.
Ms. Prince, sit..</font>

825
01:04:21,008 --> 01:04:22,921
<font color=#FFFF55>I assume you are here
planning something...</font>

826
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:25,968
<font color=#FFFF55>...that's going to get you
either court martial or killed.</font>

827
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,209
<font color=#FFFF55>And I assume,
you are here to stop us.</font>

828
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:29,760
<font color=#FFFF55>No.</font>

829
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:32,051
<font color=#FFFF55>Not at all in fact..</font>

830
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:33,817
<font color=#FFFF55>Well, look.</font>

831
01:04:33,842 --> 01:04:35,009
<font color=#FFFF55>I was an younger man once.</font>

832
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:38,920
<font color=#FFFF55>And had I been in better health,
I like to think that I might do the same.</font>

833
01:04:40,007 --> 01:04:42,454
<font color=#FFFF55>It's very very honorable
thing you're doing.</font>

834
01:04:42,554 --> 01:04:43,181
<font color=#FFFF55>Therefore..</font>

835
01:04:44,232 --> 01:04:45,533
<font color=#FFFF55>...I am here to help.</font>

836
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:47,507
<font color=#FFFF55>Unofficially, of course.</font>

837
01:04:48,648 --> 01:04:49,876
<font color=#FFFF55>What's your plan?</font>

838
01:04:51,407 --> 01:04:54,512
<font color=#FFFF55>If there's another weapon's
facility, find it and destroy it.</font>

839
01:04:54,981 --> 01:04:56,789
<font color=#FFFF55>Along with Ludendorff and Maru.</font>

840
01:04:57,878 --> 01:05:00,462
<font color=#FFFF55>In that case, to
allay suspicion...</font>

841
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,809
<font color=#FFFF55>...our charming Etta could run
the mission from my office.</font>

842
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,164
<font color=#FFFF55>"Run"...</font>

843
01:05:09,308 --> 01:05:10,309
<font color=#FFFF55>Also.</font>

844
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:13,802
<font color=#FFFF55>...There is enough
here for a few days.</font>

845
01:05:19,446 --> 01:05:20,447
<font color=#FFFF55>Thank you sir.</font>

846
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,923
<font color=#FFFF55>You're very welcome.</font>

847
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:24,549
<font color=#FFFF55>Take great care all of you...</font>

848
01:05:24,574 --> 01:05:25,575
<font color=#FFFF55>...and good luck.</font>

849
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:48,785
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Fresh ice-cream.</i></font>

850
01:05:48,886 --> 01:05:50,790
<font color=#FFFF55>Hello miss, would you like
to buy an ice cream?</font>

851
01:05:50,911 --> 01:05:52,330
<font color=#FFFF55>- Me?
- You hungry?</font>

852
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,583
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes.</font>

853
01:05:54,024 --> 01:05:54,762
<font color=#FFFF55>Thank you.</font>

854
01:05:54,787 --> 01:05:56,228
<font color=#FFFF55>Eight pence please, sir.</font>

855
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:57,692
<font color=#FFFF55>There you go, and keep the change.</font>

856
01:05:57,693 --> 01:05:59,235
<font color=#FFFF55>Thank you very much sir.</font>

857
01:06:00,386 --> 01:06:01,888
<font color=#FFFF55>- What you doing?
- It's wonderful!</font>

858
01:06:01,913 --> 01:06:03,065
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah.</font>

859
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,692
<font color=#FFFF55>- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!</font>

860
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:08,094
<font color=#FFFF55>You should be very proud.</font>

861
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:21,375
<font color=#FFFF55>I hope I got niches here.
The chief's expecting us before dark.</font>

862
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:23,628
<font color=#FFFF55>Chief?</font>

863
01:06:24,653 --> 01:06:26,234
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh yeah.
A smuggler.</font>

864
01:06:27,071 --> 01:06:28,428
<font color=#FFFF55>Very reputable.</font>

865
01:06:28,857 --> 01:06:31,834
<font color=#FFFF55>A liar, a murderer,
and now a smuggler.</font>

866
01:06:32,438 --> 01:06:33,439
<font color=#FFFF55>Lovely.</font>

867
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:35,110
<font color=#FFFF55>Careful, I might get offended.</font>

868
01:06:35,134 --> 01:06:36,636
<font color=#FFFF55>I wasn't referring to you.</font>

869
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:38,488
<font color=#FFFF55>Really?</font>

870
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:40,750
<font color=#FFFF55>I wanna recover from pretending
to be somebody else.</font>

871
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,824
<font color=#FFFF55>...I shot people on your
beach, smuggle a notebook.</font>

872
01:06:42,825 --> 01:06:45,430
<font color=#FFFF55>A liar, murderer and smuggler.
You still coming?</font>

873
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:05,984
<font color=#FFFF55>It's awful.</font>

874
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:08,767
<font color=#FFFF55>That's why we're here.</font>

875
01:07:26,906 --> 01:07:28,642
<font color=#FFFF55>The gas will kill everything.</font>

876
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:31,091
<font color=#FFFF55>What kind weapons
kills innocents?</font>

877
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:33,512
<font color=#FFFF55>In this war...</font>

878
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,781
<font color=#FFFF55>...Every kind.</font>

879
01:07:40,827 --> 01:07:43,144
<font color=#FFFF55>You were absent at the
counsel meeting, General.</font>

880
01:07:43,169 --> 01:07:46,026
<font color=#FFFF55>I see you are negotiating the
terms of the armistice without me.</font>

881
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:48,555
<font color=#FFFF55>- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- I'm on your insistence.</font>

882
01:07:49,435 --> 01:07:52,438
<font color=#FFFF55>We could easily win this war if
only you had a little faith.</font>

883
01:07:52,463 --> 01:07:53,694
<font color=#FFFF55>We don't.</font>

884
01:07:54,019 --> 01:07:56,049
<font color=#FFFF55>There are shortages of food...</font>

885
01:07:56,074 --> 01:07:57,919
<font color=#FFFF55>...meds and ammunition.</font>

886
01:07:58,926 --> 01:08:02,810
<font color=#FFFF55>Every hour we delay costs
thousands of German lives.</font>

887
01:08:02,935 --> 01:08:05,667
<font color=#FFFF55>One attack and the
world could be ours.</font>

888
01:08:08,028 --> 01:08:10,059
<font color=#FFFF55>As we speak, my chemistry...</font>

889
01:08:10,084 --> 01:08:12,231
<font color=#FFFF55>We stand against you and your...</font>

890
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:13,495
<font color=#FFFF55>...witch.</font>

891
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:19,410
<font color=#FFFF55>Ludendorff, enough!
24 hours from now...</font>

892
01:08:19,435 --> 01:08:21,407
<font color=#FFFF55>...this war will end.</font>

893
01:08:21,955 --> 01:08:23,591
<font color=#FFFF55>It is over.</font>

894
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:26,208
<font color=#FFFF55>It's over for you.</font>

895
01:08:30,112 --> 01:08:31,421
<font color=#FFFF55>It is over for all of you..</font>

896
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,048
<font color=#FFFF55>But the mask won't help.</font>

897
01:08:50,073 --> 01:08:51,316
<font color=#FFFF55>They don't know that.</font>

898
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:07,528
<font color=#FFFF55>Let's go.</font>

899
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:10,205
<font color=#FFFF55>Time to stage a demonstration
for the Kaiser!</font>

900
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:13,411
<font color=#FFFF55>You're late.</font>

901
01:09:13,712 --> 01:09:14,838
<font color=#FFFF55>Cowboy sneak attack, chief!</font>

902
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:17,182
<font color=#FFFF55>How are you?</font>

903
01:09:18,097 --> 01:09:20,093
<font color=#FFFF55>- Good to see you pal.
- Big mike.</font>

904
01:09:22,606 --> 01:09:24,334
<font color=#FFFF55>- Good to see you.
- Oh yes!</font>

905
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,728
<font color=#FFFF55>Good to see you my friend.</font>

906
01:09:27,495 --> 01:09:28,715
<font color=#FFFF55>Yaa beauty!</font>

907
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,510
<font color=#FFFF55>Who is this?</font>

908
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,066
<font color=#FFFF55>And I am Diana.</font>

909
01:09:40,457 --> 01:09:41,507
<font color=#FFFF55>Where did you find her?</font>

910
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:42,935
<font color=#FFFF55>She found me.</font>

911
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,528
<font color=#FFFF55>- I plucked him from the sea.
- Well. It's a long story.</font>

912
01:09:45,629 --> 01:09:47,141
<font color=#FFFF55>You don't have to talk
about that right now.</font>

913
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:48,543
<font color=#FFFF55>What's there?</font>

914
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:51,834
<font color=#FFFF55>British tea from the Germans...</font>

915
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:54,050
<font color=#FFFF55>...German beer for the British.</font>

916
01:09:54,075 --> 01:09:58,140
<font color=#FFFF55>And Edgar Rice Brurroughs
novels for both.</font>

917
01:09:58,351 --> 01:09:59,652
<font color=#FFFF55>And guns!</font>

918
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:04,421
<font color=#FFFF55>Well...
May we get what we want?</font>

919
01:10:04,446 --> 01:10:05,654
<font color=#FFFF55>May we get what we need.</font>

920
01:10:06,048 --> 01:10:08,049
<font color=#FFFF55>But may we never get
what we deserve.</font>

921
01:10:08,074 --> 01:10:09,075
<font color=#FFFF55>Bang!</font>

922
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:17,923
<font color=#FFFF55>Strange thunder.</font>

923
01:10:19,438 --> 01:10:20,945
<font color=#FFFF55>German 77's.</font>

924
01:10:21,294 --> 01:10:22,716
<font color=#FFFF55>Guns, big ones.</font>

925
01:10:23,831 --> 01:10:25,277
<font color=#FFFF55>It's the front out there.</font>

926
01:10:26,481 --> 01:10:30,505
<font color=#FFFF55>- The evening hay.
- So, who do you fight for in this war?</font>

927
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:31,799
<font color=#FFFF55>I don't fight.</font>

928
01:10:31,824 --> 01:10:33,689
<font color=#FFFF55>You're here for profits then?</font>

929
01:10:34,174 --> 01:10:36,135
<font color=#FFFF55>No better place to be.</font>

930
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:39,607
<font color=#FFFF55>Nowhere better to be than in a
war where you don't take a side.</font>

931
01:10:40,026 --> 01:10:42,183
<font color=#FFFF55>I have no where else.
The last war took</font>

932
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:44,848
<font color=#FFFF55>everything from my people.
We have nothing left.</font>

933
01:10:45,543 --> 01:10:46,913
<font color=#FFFF55>At least here...</font>

934
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,699
<font color=#FFFF55>...I'm free.</font>

935
01:10:49,518 --> 01:10:51,283
<font color=#FFFF55>Who took that from your people?</font>

936
01:10:52,045 --> 01:10:53,226
<font color=#FFFF55>His people.</font>

937
01:10:58,183 --> 01:10:59,231
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Don't go...</i></font>

938
01:11:00,102 --> 01:11:02,881
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Don't go there.
Do not go!</i></font>

939
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,239
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Don't go in there.</i></font>

940
01:11:06,264 --> 01:11:07,362
<font color=#FFFF55>You are safe.</font>

941
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,193
<font color=#FFFF55>You are safe.
Are you okay?</font>

942
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:11,762
<font color=#FFFF55>Shut up, you woman!</font>

943
01:11:11,787 --> 01:11:13,540
<font color=#FFFF55>Stop making a fuss!</font>

944
01:11:13,863 --> 01:11:15,022
<font color=#FFFF55>God!</font>

945
01:11:19,107 --> 01:11:21,482
<font color=#FFFF55>He sees ghosts.</font>

946
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,508
<font color=#FFFF55>Hey, you're gonna get cold.</font>

947
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:28,755
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh I do...</font>

948
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:31,685
<font color=#FFFF55>Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean any, alright?</font>

949
01:11:51,845 --> 01:11:53,864
<font color=#FFFF55>These animals, why are
they hurting them?</font>

950
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:56,007
<font color=#FFFF55>Because they need to move quick!</font>

951
01:11:56,255 --> 01:11:58,452
<font color=#FFFF55>- Like us!
- But this is not the way.</font>

952
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,087
<font color=#FFFF55>I could help them.</font>

953
01:12:00,088 --> 01:12:01,391
<font color=#FFFF55>There is no time.
Come on, woman!</font>

954
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:05,821
<font color=#FFFF55>Mama!</font>

955
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,704
<font color=#FFFF55>That man... he's wounded.</font>

956
01:12:13,005 --> 01:12:15,162
<font color=#FFFF55>There is nothing you can
do about it, Diana.</font>

957
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:16,744
<font color=#FFFF55>We must keep moving.</font>

958
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:38,872
<font color=#FFFF55>What is this?</font>

959
01:12:39,086 --> 01:12:40,979
<font color=#FFFF55>You wanted me to take you to war.
This is it.</font>

960
01:12:41,046 --> 01:12:42,476
<font color=#FFFF55>Then where are the Germans?</font>

961
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,984
<font color=#FFFF55>Couple of 100 yards
across the field.</font>

962
01:12:45,248 --> 01:12:46,671
<font color=#FFFF55>- The trench is...
- Watch out!</font>

963
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:51,358
<font color=#FFFF55>Chief! Oh it's good to see you.</font>

964
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:53,823
<font color=#FFFF55>Oi, chief's back! Chief's back!</font>

965
01:12:55,008 --> 01:12:56,291
<font color=#FFFF55>Alright, let's move.</font>

966
01:12:57,524 --> 01:12:59,265
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Help me please.</i></font>

967
01:12:59,558 --> 01:13:01,430
<font color=#FFFF55><i>They have taken everything...</i></font>

968
01:13:01,431 --> 01:13:03,437
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...houses, food...</i></font>

969
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:05,517
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...and those who
could not escape...</i></font>

970
01:13:05,734 --> 01:13:07,633
<font color=#FFFF55><i>...they were taken
away as slaves.</i></font>

971
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:08,876
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Where did that happen?</i></font>

972
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:12,157
<font color=#FFFF55><i>In Veld... On the other
side of No Man's Land.</i></font>

973
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:13,255
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana, we have to go.</font>

974
01:13:13,256 --> 01:13:14,693
<font color=#FFFF55>We need to help these people.</font>

975
01:13:14,718 --> 01:13:15,865
<font color=#FFFF55>We have to stay on mission!</font>

976
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:17,547
<font color=#FFFF55>Next safe crossing is
at least a day away.</font>

977
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:20,329
<font color=#FFFF55>- What are we waiting for?
- We can not leave without helping them.</font>

978
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,864
<font color=#FFFF55>These people are dying.</font>

979
01:13:22,113 --> 01:13:23,740
<font color=#FFFF55>Nothing to eat and
in the village...</font>

980
01:13:23,953 --> 01:13:25,395
<font color=#FFFF55>- enslaved it there!
- I understand that.</font>

981
01:13:25,396 --> 01:13:26,397
<font color=#FFFF55>Women and children!</font>

982
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,697
<font color=#FFFF55>We need to make our next
position by sunset.</font>

983
01:13:27,698 --> 01:13:29,738
<font color=#FFFF55>How can you say that? What
is the matter with you?</font>

984
01:13:30,401 --> 01:13:32,361
<font color=#FFFF55>This is No Man's Land! Diana!</font>

985
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,885
<font color=#FFFF55>Means no man can
cross it, alright?</font>

986
01:13:35,186 --> 01:13:37,309
<font color=#FFFF55>This battalion has been
here for nearly a year...</font>

987
01:13:37,634 --> 01:13:39,892
<font color=#FFFF55>...and they barely
gained an inch.</font>

988
01:13:40,106 --> 01:13:42,805
<font color=#FFFF55>Alright? Because on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans</font>

989
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:45,632
<font color=#FFFF55>...pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.</font>

990
01:13:45,883 --> 01:13:48,131
<font color=#FFFF55>This is not something you can cross.
This is not possible.</font>

991
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,524
<font color=#FFFF55>So what? So we do nothing?</font>

992
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:51,615
<font color=#FFFF55>No, we are doing something.</font>

993
01:13:51,616 --> 01:13:52,995
<font color=#FFFF55>- We are, we just...
- Steve.</font>

994
01:13:53,242 --> 01:13:54,631
<font color=#FFFF55>We can't save
everyone in this war.</font>

995
01:13:54,858 --> 01:13:56,090
<font color=#FFFF55>Steve...</font>

996
01:13:56,323 --> 01:13:57,980
<font color=#FFFF55>This is not what we
came here to do.</font>

997
01:14:14,429 --> 01:14:15,430
<font color=#FFFF55>No...</font>

998
01:14:15,482 --> 01:14:17,382
<font color=#FFFF55>...but it's what
I'm going to do.</font>

999
01:14:32,656 --> 01:14:33,915
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana!</font>

1000
01:14:56,102 --> 01:14:58,393
<font color=#FFFF55>What the bloody hell she's playing at?</font>

1001
01:15:04,058 --> 01:15:06,058
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Engage, fire!</i></font>

1002
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,086
<font color=#FFFF55>She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!</font>

1003
01:15:20,773 --> 01:15:22,662
<font color=#FFFF55>Sniper! stay down!</font>

1004
01:15:22,663 --> 01:15:24,210
<font color=#FFFF55>Stay down! That's an order!</font>

1005
01:16:17,397 --> 01:16:18,398
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on!</font>

1006
01:16:18,555 --> 01:16:20,302
<font color=#FFFF55>She's done it!
Let's go!</font>

1007
01:16:40,325 --> 01:16:41,326
<font color=#FFFF55>Steve!</font>

1008
01:16:41,757 --> 01:16:42,904
<font color=#FFFF55>Let's go!</font>

1009
01:16:45,651 --> 01:16:47,408
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on, go!</font>

1010
01:17:07,806 --> 01:17:09,417
<font color=#FFFF55>Stay here, I'll go ahead.</font>

1011
01:17:44,956 --> 01:17:46,233
<font color=#FFFF55>- What the...
- Let's move.</font>

1012
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:26,045
<font color=#FFFF55>We need more firepower.</font>

1013
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:43,542
<font color=#FFFF55>Sniper!</font>

1014
01:19:43,606 --> 01:19:44,819
<font color=#FFFF55>Move!</font>

1015
01:19:47,155 --> 01:19:47,920
<font color=#FFFF55>Get in!</font>

1016
01:19:48,221 --> 01:19:49,628
<font color=#FFFF55>Charlie, bell tower.</font>

1017
01:19:57,884 --> 01:19:59,154
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on, Charlie. Shoot him.</font>

1018
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:02,267
<font color=#FFFF55>It's okay.</font>

1019
01:20:07,245 --> 01:20:09,247
<font color=#FFFF55>Follow me.
Give me some cover.</font>

1020
01:20:15,955 --> 01:20:17,009
<font color=#FFFF55>Good!</font>

1021
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:20,089
<font color=#FFFF55>We're gonna put this on our
back and when I say go..</font>

1022
01:20:20,114 --> 01:20:21,275
<font color=#FFFF55>- ...Lift hard!
- All right.</font>

1023
01:20:22,346 --> 01:20:24,459
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana! Shield!</font>

1024
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,157
<font color=#FFFF55>Go!</font>

1025
01:21:31,355 --> 01:21:33,734
<font color=#FFFF55>Stay very very still,
for me my friends.</font>

1026
01:21:33,759 --> 01:21:35,397
<font color=#FFFF55>Please. It's so important.</font>

1027
01:21:39,367 --> 01:21:40,537
<font color=#FFFF55>Thank you very much.</font>

1028
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,431
<font color=#FFFF55>This has been such an honor
for me taking you photograph.</font>

1029
01:21:43,456 --> 01:21:44,522
<font color=#FFFF55>Thank you so much.</font>

1030
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:53,177
<font color=#FFFF55>For obvious talk of shooting...</font>

1031
01:21:53,498 --> 01:21:55,269
<font color=#FFFF55>...you cannot shoot.</font>

1032
01:21:57,916 --> 01:22:00,334
<font color=#FFFF55>Not everyone gets to be where
they want to be all the time.</font>

1033
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,381
<font color=#FFFF55>Me, I'm an actor.</font>

1034
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,843
<font color=#FFFF55>I love acting.</font>

1035
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:06,726
<font color=#FFFF55>I didn't want to be a soldier.</font>

1036
01:22:08,035 --> 01:22:09,376
<font color=#FFFF55>But I'm the wrong color.</font>

1037
01:22:10,389 --> 01:22:12,678
<font color=#FFFF55>Everyone's fighting their
own battle, Diana.</font>

1038
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:15,639
<font color=#FFFF55>Just as you're fighting yours.</font>

1039
01:22:21,391 --> 01:22:23,295
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Oh it's too much. I wish you...</i></font>

1040
01:22:23,296 --> 01:22:24,297
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Thank you.</i></font>

1041
01:22:28,412 --> 01:22:29,989
<font color=#FFFF55>Hi.. I'm on the phone...</font>

1042
01:22:30,407 --> 01:22:33,479
<font color=#FFFF55>Ah, it's "Veld", V-E-L-D.</font>

1043
01:22:33,504 --> 01:22:35,211
<font color=#FFFF55>It's a tiny village.</font>

1044
01:22:35,236 --> 01:22:37,092
<font color=#FFFF55>It may not even be on the map.</font>

1045
01:22:37,117 --> 01:22:38,408
<font color=#FFFF55>Ooh! I found it!</font>

1046
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:40,522
<font color=#FFFF55>Did you find
Ludendorff's operation?</font>

1047
01:22:40,547 --> 01:22:42,261
<font color=#FFFF55>No. No, but I located him.</font>

1048
01:22:42,427 --> 01:22:45,298
<font color=#FFFF55>And oh, lucky you, he's
only a few miles away...</font>

1049
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:47,039
<font color=#FFFF55>...At German High Command.</font>

1050
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:49,039
<font color=#FFFF55>The German High Command?</font>

1051
01:22:49,162 --> 01:22:50,516
<font color=#FFFF55>And to Intel report...</font>

1052
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:53,008
<font color=#FFFF55>...Ludendorff is
hosting a gala..</font>

1053
01:22:53,224 --> 01:22:54,542
<font color=#FFFF55>Sort of a last hara...</font>

1054
01:22:54,867 --> 01:22:57,369
<font color=#FFFF55>...before the Germans
sign the armistice.</font>

1055
01:22:57,394 --> 01:23:00,249
<font color=#FFFF55>And then the Kaiser himself
is going to be there.</font>

1056
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,902
<font color=#FFFF55>As well as Dr. Maru.</font>

1057
01:23:03,653 --> 01:23:05,300
<font color=#FFFF55>Actually the Gala could
be perfect cover.</font>

1058
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:07,287
<font color=#FFFF55>- Captain Trevor.
- Yes sir.</font>

1059
01:23:07,312 --> 01:23:10,516
<font color=#FFFF55>You're under no circumstances
to go anywhere near that...</font>

1060
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:12,078
<font color=#FFFF55>...gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?</font>

1061
01:23:12,129 --> 01:23:14,645
<font color=#FFFF55>You'll be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.</font>

1062
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:16,488
<font color=#FFFF55>You can not compromise
the armistice.</font>

1063
01:23:16,953 --> 01:23:18,424
<font color=#FFFF55>- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!</font>

1064
01:23:18,425 --> 01:23:20,418
<font color=#FFFF55>.. once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.</font>

1065
01:23:20,672 --> 01:23:21,726
<font color=#FFFF55>Hold on one second, sir.</font>

1066
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:24,036
<font color=#FFFF55>We shouldn't be bothered about
setting the peace agreement.</font>

1067
01:23:24,037 --> 01:23:25,713
<font color=#FFFF55>- Why not?
- Ares would never let...</font>

1068
01:23:26,314 --> 01:23:27,315
<font color=#FFFF55>What?</font>

1069
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:28,842
<font color=#FFFF55>What is that?</font>

1070
01:23:29,101 --> 01:23:31,214
<font color=#FFFF55>Of course, it makes
complete sense.</font>

1071
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:35,890
<font color=#FFFF55>Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.</font>

1072
01:23:35,915 --> 01:23:37,592
<font color=#FFFF55>- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.</font>

1073
01:23:38,157 --> 01:23:39,551
<font color=#FFFF55>I mean Ares.</font>

1074
01:23:40,197 --> 01:23:42,355
<font color=#FFFF55>Ludendorff is Ares!</font>

1075
01:23:43,245 --> 01:23:45,287
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir, this is our last chance...</font>

1076
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,062
<font color=#FFFF55>...our final chance to find
out where the gas is...</font>

1077
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,388
<font color=#FFFF55>...and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.</font>

1078
01:23:49,413 --> 01:23:51,290
<font color=#FFFF55>No... No.. No. I forbid it.</font>

1079
01:23:51,315 --> 01:23:52,465
<font color=#FFFF55>Do you hear me? I forbid it.</font>

1080
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:54,216
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir, I am losing you! Sir?</font>

1081
01:23:54,241 --> 01:23:55,671
<font color=#FFFF55>- Hello?
- Sir...</font>

1082
01:23:58,974 --> 01:24:00,651
<font color=#FFFF55>How likely is he to
respect my wishes?</font>

1083
01:24:00,676 --> 01:24:02,960
<font color=#FFFF55>Not very like convinced.</font>

1084
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:10,390
<font color=#FFFF55>Sammy, Sammy, no, no.</font>

1085
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:11,982
<font color=#FFFF55>Sammy, I have to work.</font>

1086
01:24:12,389 --> 01:24:15,792
<font color=#FFFF55>I gotta rustle up with a German uniform
I took to plough the course tomorrow.</font>

1087
01:24:15,892 --> 01:24:17,090
<font color=#FFFF55>That's easy, boss.
Come on.</font>

1088
01:24:17,339 --> 01:24:18,881
<font color=#FFFF55>There's nothing we can
do till tomorrow.</font>

1089
01:24:18,882 --> 01:24:19,923
<font color=#FFFF55>You said yourself, Steve.</font>

1090
01:24:25,842 --> 01:24:27,206
<font color=#FFFF55>- Thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

1091
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:46,639
<font color=#FFFF55>You did this.</font>

1092
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:49,954
<font color=#FFFF55>We did.</font>

1093
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:56,300
<font color=#FFFF55>Do you have dancing on...</font>

1094
01:24:57,349 --> 01:24:58,564
<font color=#FFFF55>...Paradise Island?</font>

1095
01:24:58,589 --> 01:25:00,310
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh, dancing, yeah of course.</font>

1096
01:25:01,291 --> 01:25:04,450
<font color=#FFFF55>These people are just...
swaying.</font>

1097
01:25:05,447 --> 01:25:08,801
<font color=#FFFF55>Okay, if you're gonna be
fighting the God of war...</font>

1098
01:25:08,802 --> 01:25:12,222
<font color=#FFFF55>...I might as well teach you how
to dance, you poor thing.</font>

1099
01:25:12,277 --> 01:25:14,840
<font color=#FFFF55>Alright, probably
without the gun.</font>

1100
01:25:18,967 --> 01:25:20,418
<font color=#FFFF55>If you would...</font>

1101
01:25:21,268 --> 01:25:22,269
<font color=#FFFF55>Well...</font>

1102
01:25:24,118 --> 01:25:26,802
<font color=#FFFF55>If I'm going to the Gala, I'll
need to know how to dance.</font>

1103
01:25:26,827 --> 01:25:27,962
<font color=#FFFF55>- You aren't going to the Gala.
- Of course I am.</font>

1104
01:25:27,963 --> 01:25:30,014
<font color=#FFFF55>- No.
- Why wouldn't I?</font>

1105
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:32,124
<font color=#FFFF55>Well, for one, you don't
know how to dance.</font>

1106
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:35,105
<font color=#FFFF55>I would argue with this, they
don't know how to dance.</font>

1107
01:25:35,354 --> 01:25:36,533
<font color=#FFFF55>Be polite. Be polite.</font>

1108
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,719
<font color=#FFFF55>All right.
Give me your hand.</font>

1109
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,993
<font color=#FFFF55>Like so.</font>

1110
01:25:43,664 --> 01:25:46,885
<font color=#FFFF55>And I'll put my arm...</font>

1111
01:25:46,886 --> 01:25:48,750
<font color=#FFFF55>...around you like so.</font>

1112
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:51,562
<font color=#FFFF55>And we just..</font>

1113
01:25:51,901 --> 01:25:53,304
<font color=#FFFF55>What do you call it? Sway?</font>

1114
01:25:53,329 --> 01:25:54,330
<font color=#FFFF55>We'll just sway.</font>

1115
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:56,588
<font color=#FFFF55>You're awfully close.</font>

1116
01:25:58,822 --> 01:26:00,875
<font color=#FFFF55>Nice ritz.</font>

1117
01:26:03,841 --> 01:26:05,083
<font color=#FFFF55>I see.</font>

1118
01:26:13,848 --> 01:26:16,030
<font color=#FFFF55>I haven't heard him
sing in years.</font>

1119
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:35,321
<font color=#FFFF55>It's started to snowfall.</font>

1120
01:26:39,656 --> 01:26:40,743
<font color=#FFFF55>Touch it.</font>

1121
01:26:44,216 --> 01:26:45,720
<font color=#FFFF55>It's magical!</font>

1122
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,917
<font color=#FFFF55>It is, isn't it?</font>

1123
01:26:50,106 --> 01:26:51,421
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, yeah.</font>

1124
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,486
<font color=#FFFF55>Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?</font>

1125
01:27:02,457 --> 01:27:03,458
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah.</font>

1126
01:27:04,496 --> 01:27:07,499
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah, this... and other things.</font>

1127
01:27:07,741 --> 01:27:09,172
<font color=#FFFF55>What things?</font>

1128
01:27:16,682 --> 01:27:18,225
<font color=#FFFF55>They have breakfast.</font>

1129
01:27:18,846 --> 01:27:20,435
<font color=#FFFF55>They really love a breakfast.</font>

1130
01:27:20,463 --> 01:27:23,298
<font color=#FFFF55>And they love to wake up...</font>

1131
01:27:24,269 --> 01:27:26,442
<font color=#FFFF55>...read the paper
and go to work.</font>

1132
01:27:27,521 --> 01:27:29,139
<font color=#FFFF55>They get married.</font>

1133
01:27:29,935 --> 01:27:31,628
<font color=#FFFF55>Makes some babies and
grow old together.</font>

1134
01:27:32,139 --> 01:27:33,172
<font color=#FFFF55>I guess.</font>

1135
01:27:37,164 --> 01:27:38,715
<font color=#FFFF55>What is that like?</font>

1136
01:27:42,845 --> 01:27:44,279
<font color=#FFFF55>I have no idea.</font>

1137
01:29:19,386 --> 01:29:20,718
<font color=#FFFF55>The villagers gave them to us.</font>

1138
01:29:21,518 --> 01:29:24,106
<font color=#FFFF55>- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.</font>

1139
01:29:24,683 --> 01:29:25,684
<font color=#FFFF55>You are.</font>

1140
01:29:26,349 --> 01:29:28,046
<font color=#FFFF55>Hey, fellas, I know that...</font>

1141
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,235
<font color=#FFFF55>...I said this job
was 2 day's...</font>

1142
01:29:33,277 --> 01:29:34,478
<font color=#FFFF55>...and a deal is a deal.</font>

1143
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:38,083
<font color=#FFFF55>You can't last without us.</font>

1144
01:29:38,971 --> 01:29:39,972
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah.</font>

1145
01:29:40,186 --> 01:29:42,348
<font color=#FFFF55>We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.</font>

1146
01:29:42,909 --> 01:29:44,682
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm worried that
you won't make it.</font>

1147
01:29:45,387 --> 01:29:46,212
<font color=#FFFF55>No more money.</font>

1148
01:29:46,237 --> 01:29:47,629
<font color=#FFFF55>We have been paid enough.</font>

1149
01:29:51,503 --> 01:29:53,007
<font color=#FFFF55>No, Charlie.</font>

1150
01:29:54,385 --> 01:29:56,342
<font color=#FFFF55>Who will sing for us?</font>

1151
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:59,349
<font color=#FFFF55>- Yeah.
- Oh no, please.</font>

1152
01:30:00,389 --> 01:30:01,455
<font color=#FFFF55>Sing?</font>

1153
01:30:02,844 --> 01:30:03,845
<font color=#FFFF55>You asked for it.</font>

1154
01:30:04,026 --> 01:30:06,370
<font color=#FFFF55><i>The reeds are green.</i></font>

1155
01:30:06,847 --> 01:30:10,471
<font color=#FFFF55><i>The reeds are green.</i></font>

1156
01:30:10,734 --> 01:30:14,261
<font color=#FFFF55><i>The sweetest hours I could live.</i></font>

1157
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:17,497
<font color=#FFFF55>You must think I was
born yesterday.</font>

1158
01:30:17,714 --> 01:30:19,421
<font color=#FFFF55>I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.</font>

1159
01:30:19,686 --> 01:30:20,777
<font color=#FFFF55>Every word.</font>

1160
01:30:21,267 --> 01:30:22,531
<font color=#FFFF55>Wait...wait.</font>

1161
01:30:22,532 --> 01:30:24,670
<font color=#FFFF55>There is a whole island
of women like her?</font>

1162
01:30:24,872 --> 01:30:26,476
<font color=#FFFF55>And not a single man among them?</font>

1163
01:30:27,947 --> 01:30:28,817
<font color=#FFFF55>How do we get there?</font>

1164
01:30:30,097 --> 01:30:31,018
<font color=#FFFF55>And she thinks..</font>

1165
01:30:31,019 --> 01:30:33,171
<font color=#FFFF55>...that Ludendorff is
Ares, the god of war?</font>

1166
01:30:33,202 --> 01:30:34,989
<font color=#FFFF55>And only by killing
him will the war end.</font>

1167
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:38,342
<font color=#FFFF55>Don't be daft.
You saw what happened out there.</font>

1168
01:30:38,536 --> 01:30:40,439
<font color=#FFFF55>The way she dropped
that machine gun next.</font>

1169
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,535
<font color=#FFFF55>The way she took out the tower?</font>

1170
01:30:44,294 --> 01:30:45,693
<font color=#FFFF55>May be it's true.</font>

1171
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:48,083
<font color=#FFFF55>I think it's true.</font>

1172
01:30:48,705 --> 01:30:49,719
<font color=#FFFF55>I believe it's true.</font>

1173
01:30:50,804 --> 01:30:54,408
<font color=#FFFF55>Steven son, you don't really
believe those rubbish thing?</font>

1174
01:31:17,735 --> 01:31:19,859
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana, Diana, hide in..</font>

1175
01:31:22,225 --> 01:31:24,050
<font color=#FFFF55>How the hell do
we get into that?</font>

1176
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:27,267
<font color=#FFFF55>I see only a couple of guards
in the door to distract.</font>

1177
01:31:27,522 --> 01:31:28,848
<font color=#FFFF55>Yeah, it won't look
suspicious...</font>

1178
01:31:29,049 --> 01:31:30,614
<font color=#FFFF55>...when I wanna come
sauntering out of the woods.</font>

1179
01:31:30,615 --> 01:31:31,406
<font color=#FFFF55>I could get in.</font>

1180
01:31:31,582 --> 01:31:33,592
<font color=#FFFF55>You are not going in
there, it's too dangerous.</font>

1181
01:31:33,617 --> 01:31:35,099
<font color=#FFFF55>- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.</font>

1182
01:31:35,113 --> 01:31:36,383
<font color=#FFFF55>And you are too distracting.</font>

1183
01:31:36,608 --> 01:31:38,660
<font color=#FFFF55>Look, I will go in there, follow them to..</font>

1184
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:41,389
<font color=#FFFF55>...where ever they are working on the gas or
better yet, where it is.</font>

1185
01:31:41,604 --> 01:31:43,806
<font color=#FFFF55>- I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not coming with me.</font>

1186
01:31:43,863 --> 01:31:45,795
<font color=#FFFF55>What you're wearing isn't
exactly undercover.</font>

1187
01:31:46,321 --> 01:31:46,911
<font color=#FFFF55>I don't know.</font>

1188
01:31:46,912 --> 01:31:49,711
<font color=#FFFF55>I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.</font>

1189
01:31:49,736 --> 01:31:53,244
<font color=#FFFF55>It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
It's all scouted out, we'll put back...</font>

1190
01:31:53,269 --> 01:31:55,071
<font color=#FFFF55>But as long as he's still
alive, it doesn't...</font>

1191
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,467
<font color=#FFFF55>You cannot go into German high command
and kill anyone.</font>

1192
01:31:58,012 --> 01:31:59,821
<font color=#FFFF55>You just can't.
You have to trust me.</font>

1193
01:32:01,188 --> 01:32:02,745
<font color=#FFFF55>- Oh, Wow!
- Where did that come from?</font>

1194
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:05,095
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh, can I drive it?
Please let me drive it!</font>

1195
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:06,291
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, I'll be your chauffeur.</font>

1196
01:32:06,393 --> 01:32:07,637
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on... come on.</font>

1197
01:32:08,115 --> 01:32:09,116
<font color=#FFFF55>Stay put!</font>

1198
01:32:11,062 --> 01:32:11,937
<font color=#FFFF55>Where this come from?</font>

1199
01:32:12,137 --> 01:32:13,618
<font color=#FFFF55>A field over there.
It is full of them!</font>

1200
01:32:18,133 --> 01:32:19,553
<font color=#FFFF55>Chief, I think you and
me scope out the area...</font>

1201
01:32:19,554 --> 01:32:21,423
<font color=#FFFF55>...in case we need to
beat the haste and retreat.</font>

1202
01:32:21,424 --> 01:32:23,000
<font color=#FFFF55>- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?</font>

1203
01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:29,326
<font color=#FFFF55>Colonel.</font>

1204
01:32:33,513 --> 01:32:36,028
<font color=#FFFF55>Steve, they have invitations.</font>

1205
01:32:37,579 --> 01:32:39,857
<font color=#FFFF55>Don't worry. Play it cool,
you go this, you got this.</font>

1206
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,582
<font color=#FFFF55>Your invitation, please.</font>

1207
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:47,793
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Thank you sir.</i>
The Colonel and I wish...</font>

1208
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:50,165
<font color=#FFFF55>...many blessings and all my
love to fall up in your head.</font>

1209
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:53,925
<font color=#FFFF55>Your head must be empty.
Find the invitation, you idiot.</font>

1210
01:32:54,225 --> 01:32:54,826
<font color=#FFFF55>I am sorry.</font>

1211
01:32:54,964 --> 01:32:57,566
<font color=#FFFF55>I am so sorry, I must apologize
a thousand times, my master.</font>

1212
01:32:58,582 --> 01:33:01,549
<font color=#FFFF55>I made the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.</font>

1213
01:33:01,841 --> 01:33:03,867
<font color=#FFFF55>- I lost the Colonel's invitation.
- What?</font>

1214
01:33:04,168 --> 01:33:06,780
<font color=#FFFF55>You saying we travelled all the way
through the mud and rain...</font>

1215
01:33:07,073 --> 01:33:10,269
<font color=#FFFF55>- ...Only for you to loose my invitation?
- No, I am a bug.</font>

1216
01:33:10,294 --> 01:33:12,440
<font color=#FFFF55>Not even a bug, I'm
a dung of a bug.</font>

1217
01:33:12,465 --> 01:33:13,685
<font color=#FFFF55>And you're right master...</font>

1218
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:15,482
<font color=#FFFF55>Blessing will up on us.</font>

1219
01:33:26,025 --> 01:33:27,383
<font color=#FFFF55>This is ridiculous.</font>

1220
01:33:27,617 --> 01:33:29,633
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm not gonna be spending
my evening out here.</font>

1221
01:33:29,721 --> 01:33:32,138
<font color=#FFFF55>You stupid idiots!
Move your car!</font>

1222
01:33:53,339 --> 01:33:55,226
<font color=#FFFF55>What are you supposed to be?</font>

1223
01:33:58,523 --> 01:34:00,397
<font color=#FFFF55>What are you doing?</font>

1224
01:34:25,087 --> 01:34:26,107
<font color=#FFFF55>Excuse me.</font>

1225
01:34:28,653 --> 01:34:30,349
<font color=#FFFF55>I don't drink.</font>

1226
01:34:38,476 --> 01:34:39,501
<font color=#FFFF55>Have we met?</font>

1227
01:34:39,526 --> 01:34:41,286
<font color=#FFFF55>No, but I have
been watching you.</font>

1228
01:34:42,679 --> 01:34:44,028
<font color=#FFFF55>Following your career.</font>

1229
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:47,641
<font color=#FFFF55>You are Dr. Isabel Maru.</font>

1230
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:50,208
<font color=#FFFF55>The most talented chemist
in the German army.</font>

1231
01:34:50,724 --> 01:34:52,144
<font color=#FFFF55>I am a friend.</font>

1232
01:35:03,218 --> 01:35:05,296
<font color=#FFFF55>I hope I'm not causing any...</font>

1233
01:35:07,031 --> 01:35:09,295
<font color=#FFFF55>I know you and General
Ludendorff are...</font>

1234
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:10,286
<font color=#FFFF55>...very close.</font>

1235
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:13,831
<font color=#FFFF55>We work well together..
Yes.</font>

1236
01:35:14,409 --> 01:35:17,398
<font color=#FFFF55>Tell me some one like
me behind you...</font>

1237
01:35:18,154 --> 01:35:20,055
<font color=#FFFF55>I could provide a lot more.</font>

1238
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,848
<font color=#FFFF55>And who are you?</font>

1239
01:35:22,054 --> 01:35:26,138
<font color=#FFFF55>A man who shows you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.</font>

1240
01:35:32,828 --> 01:35:35,399
<font color=#FFFF55>I love fire. Don't you?</font>

1241
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:39,437
<font color=#FFFF55>It is like...</font>

1242
01:35:41,091 --> 01:35:43,193
<font color=#FFFF55>...a living act of entropy.</font>

1243
01:35:43,218 --> 01:35:45,833
<font color=#FFFF55>The ultimate weapon
of destruction.</font>

1244
01:35:46,518 --> 01:35:48,744
<font color=#FFFF55>Reminding us that in the end...</font>

1245
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:52,582
<font color=#FFFF55>...everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.</font>

1246
01:35:55,088 --> 01:35:58,352
<font color=#FFFF55>There is something reassuring about it.</font>

1247
01:36:02,953 --> 01:36:05,066
<font color=#FFFF55>I see all of that in your eyes.</font>

1248
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:10,754
<font color=#FFFF55>Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.</font>

1249
01:36:26,789 --> 01:36:28,407
<font color=#FFFF55>I hear it is...</font>

1250
01:36:30,685 --> 01:36:32,690
<font color=#FFFF55>I hear it is extraordinary.</font>

1251
01:36:33,655 --> 01:36:37,279
<font color=#FFFF55>I appreciate your
interest in my work...</font>

1252
01:36:37,304 --> 01:36:39,660
<font color=#FFFF55>...but I'm loyal to
General Ludendorff.</font>

1253
01:36:40,447 --> 01:36:41,468
<font color=#FFFF55>Besides...</font>

1254
01:36:41,493 --> 01:36:44,133
<font color=#FFFF55>...Now I see your
attention is...</font>

1255
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:48,611
<font color=#FFFF55>...elsewhere.</font>

1256
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:14,647
<font color=#FFFF55>Enjoying the party?</font>

1257
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:19,474
<font color=#FFFF55>I confess I'm not sure what
it is we're celebrating.</font>

1258
01:37:19,499 --> 01:37:22,395
<font color=#FFFF55>A German victory, of course.</font>

1259
01:37:22,696 --> 01:37:23,403
<font color=#FFFF55>Victory?</font>

1260
01:37:23,424 --> 01:37:26,125
<font color=#FFFF55>When I hear peace
could be so close.</font>

1261
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,429
<font color=#FFFF55>Peace?</font>

1262
01:37:27,447 --> 01:37:29,316
<font color=#FFFF55>It's only an armistice...</font>

1263
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:31,123
<font color=#FFFF55>...and an endless war.</font>

1264
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:33,246
<font color=#FFFF55>Thucydides.</font>

1265
01:37:33,653 --> 01:37:35,292
<font color=#FFFF55>You know your ancient Greeks?</font>

1266
01:37:35,556 --> 01:37:37,300
<font color=#FFFF55>They understood...</font>

1267
01:37:37,321 --> 01:37:38,764
<font color=#FFFF55>...that war was a god.</font>

1268
01:37:39,305 --> 01:37:41,985
<font color=#FFFF55>A god that requires human sacrifices.</font>

1269
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:43,250
<font color=#FFFF55>And in exchange...</font>

1270
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:46,015
<font color=#FFFF55>...war gives man purpose...</font>

1271
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,987
<font color=#FFFF55>...meaning, a
chance to rise...</font>

1272
01:37:48,012 --> 01:37:50,390
<font color=#FFFF55>...above his petty,
mortal little self...</font>

1273
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,440
<font color=#FFFF55>...and be courageous...</font>

1274
01:37:53,263 --> 01:37:54,654
<font color=#FFFF55>...Noble!</font>

1275
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:59,105
<font color=#FFFF55>Only one of the many
gods believed in that.</font>

1276
01:38:00,102 --> 01:38:01,688
<font color=#FFFF55>And he was wrong.</font>

1277
01:38:02,985 --> 01:38:04,370
<font color=#FFFF55>You know nothing of the gods.</font>

1278
01:38:04,395 --> 01:38:05,902
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Herr General.</i></font>

1279
01:38:09,032 --> 01:38:10,586
<font color=#FFFF55>Enjoy the fireworks.</font>

1280
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:17,260
<font color=#FFFF55>What are you doing?</font>

1281
01:38:17,285 --> 01:38:18,726
<font color=#FFFF55>- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.</font>

1282
01:38:18,856 --> 01:38:20,693
<font color=#FFFF55>If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas...</font>

1283
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:22,105
<font color=#FFFF55>...we won't be able to stop anything.</font>

1284
01:38:22,106 --> 01:38:23,285
<font color=#FFFF55>I will stop Ares!</font>

1285
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:24,843
<font color=#FFFF55>What if you're wrong?</font>

1286
01:38:26,413 --> 01:38:28,015
<font color=#FFFF55>What if there's no Ares?</font>

1287
01:38:29,778 --> 01:38:31,229
<font color=#FFFF55>You don't believe me.</font>

1288
01:38:31,331 --> 01:38:33,066
<font color=#FFFF55>I can not let you do this.</font>

1289
01:38:33,728 --> 01:38:35,186
<font color=#FFFF55>What I do is not up to you.</font>

1290
01:38:41,992 --> 01:38:43,145
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana!</font>

1291
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:48,421
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana...</font>

1292
01:38:48,922 --> 01:38:49,923
<font color=#FFFF55>The gas.</font>

1293
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:52,938
<font color=#FFFF55>The villagers!</font>

1294
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:56,740
<font color=#FFFF55>What they cheering for?</font>

1295
01:38:59,288 --> 01:39:00,367
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana!</font>

1296
01:39:02,758 --> 01:39:04,366
<font color=#FFFF55>What did they fire?</font>

1297
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:05,680
<font color=#FFFF55>The gas.</font>

1298
01:39:05,711 --> 01:39:07,751
<font color=#FFFF55>- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him, he was in the tower.</font>

1299
01:39:07,752 --> 01:39:09,221
<font color=#FFFF55>Wherever he goes you follow.</font>

1300
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:11,455
<font color=#FFFF55>How will you find us?</font>

1301
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,375
<font color=#FFFF55>I know how.</font>

1302
01:40:31,184 --> 01:40:32,532
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana!</font>

1303
01:40:35,527 --> 01:40:38,189
<font color=#FFFF55>They are dead.
They are all dead.</font>

1304
01:40:39,105 --> 01:40:40,756
<font color=#FFFF55>I could have saved them.</font>

1305
01:40:41,086 --> 01:40:43,429
<font color=#FFFF55>I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.</font>

1306
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:45,647
<font color=#FFFF55>You stopped me
from killing Ares!</font>

1307
01:40:45,848 --> 01:40:48,236
<font color=#FFFF55>- No!
- Get away from me!</font>

1308
01:40:48,431 --> 01:40:49,928
<font color=#FFFF55>I understand everything now.</font>

1309
01:40:49,953 --> 01:40:51,739
<font color=#FFFF55>It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.</font>

1310
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,057
<font color=#FFFF55>It's you too.</font>

1311
01:40:53,743 --> 01:40:54,770
<font color=#FFFF55>All of you.</font>

1312
01:40:55,965 --> 01:40:57,271
<font color=#FFFF55>I'll find Ares...</font>

1313
01:40:57,492 --> 01:40:59,056
<font color=#FFFF55>...and I'll kill him.</font>

1314
01:41:02,377 --> 01:41:03,512
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana!</font>

1315
01:41:04,555 --> 01:41:05,663
<font color=#FFFF55>That smoke...</font>

1316
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:07,802
<font color=#FFFF55>...it's the chief!</font>

1317
01:41:07,823 --> 01:41:09,270
<font color=#FFFF55>He followed Ludendorff.</font>

1318
01:41:10,761 --> 01:41:12,344
<font color=#FFFF55>Follow the smoke!</font>

1319
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:40,359
<font color=#FFFF55>Hey! Diana, Over there!</font>

1320
01:41:56,775 --> 01:41:57,976
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on. Let's go!</font>

1321
01:42:20,056 --> 01:42:21,666
<font color=#FFFF55>Ooh! what a surprise.</font>

1322
01:42:22,292 --> 01:42:23,584
<font color=#FFFF55>Strange.</font>

1323
01:42:24,963 --> 01:42:27,068
<font color=#FFFF55>Unfortunately, I have
another matter...</font>

1324
01:42:28,126 --> 01:42:29,127
<font color=#FFFF55>...to attend to.</font>

1325
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:36,795
<font color=#FFFF55>What are you?</font>

1326
01:42:36,796 --> 01:42:38,035
<font color=#FFFF55>You will soon find out.</font>

1327
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:16,357
<font color=#FFFF55>As magnificent as you are, you
are still no match for me.</font>

1328
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:22,191
<font color=#FFFF55>We'll see about that.</font>

1329
01:43:46,546 --> 01:43:48,529
<font color=#FFFF55>I am Diana Temiscira...</font>

1330
01:43:50,434 --> 01:43:52,291
<font color=#FFFF55>...daughter of Hippolyta...</font>

1331
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:55,696
<font color=#FFFF55>...Queen of the Amazons.</font>

1332
01:43:58,419 --> 01:44:01,167
<font color=#FFFF55>And your wrath upon
this world is over.</font>

1333
01:44:18,652 --> 01:44:21,151
<font color=#FFFF55>In the name of all that it
is good in this world...</font>

1334
01:44:21,402 --> 01:44:24,003
<font color=#FFFF55>...I hereby complete the
mission of the Amazons...</font>

1335
01:44:24,289 --> 01:44:26,091
<font color=#FFFF55>...by ridding this
world of you...</font>

1336
01:44:26,346 --> 01:44:27,348
<font color=#FFFF55>...forever!</font>

1337
01:45:34,915 --> 01:45:35,916
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana?</font>

1338
01:45:41,653 --> 01:45:42,654
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana!</font>

1339
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:48,469
<font color=#FFFF55>I killed him.</font>

1340
01:45:50,098 --> 01:45:52,288
<font color=#FFFF55>I killed him, but nothing stops.</font>

1341
01:45:53,735 --> 01:45:56,409
<font color=#FFFF55>You kill the god of
war, you stop the war.</font>

1342
01:45:56,685 --> 01:45:58,675
<font color=#FFFF55>Exactly what we have to do now.</font>

1343
01:45:58,857 --> 01:46:00,258
<font color=#FFFF55>We need to stop the gas.
Come on.</font>

1344
01:46:00,471 --> 01:46:01,932
<font color=#FFFF55>No. All this should
have stopped.</font>

1345
01:46:02,041 --> 01:46:02,989
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana...</font>

1346
01:46:03,033 --> 01:46:05,020
<font color=#FFFF55>The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they?</font>

1347
01:46:05,021 --> 01:46:07,096
<font color=#FFFF55>I don't know! I don't know.</font>

1348
01:46:07,317 --> 01:46:08,179
<font color=#FFFF55>Ares is dead.</font>

1349
01:46:08,418 --> 01:46:11,410
<font color=#FFFF55>They can now stop fighting.
Why are they still fighting?</font>

1350
01:46:11,618 --> 01:46:13,311
<font color=#FFFF55>Because maybe it's them!</font>

1351
01:46:13,731 --> 01:46:14,732
<font color=#FFFF55>Maybe...</font>

1352
01:46:16,568 --> 01:46:19,123
<font color=#FFFF55>Maybe people aren't always good.</font>

1353
01:46:20,196 --> 01:46:22,044
<font color=#FFFF55>Ares or no Ares...</font>

1354
01:46:23,346 --> 01:46:26,661
<font color=#FFFF55>...Maybe it's just,
who they are.</font>

1355
01:46:29,597 --> 01:46:30,888
<font color=#FFFF55>- Diana...
- No.</font>

1356
01:46:31,219 --> 01:46:32,671
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana, we can talk
about this later.</font>

1357
01:46:32,876 --> 01:46:34,215
<font color=#FFFF55>- I need you to come with me.
- No, no!</font>

1358
01:46:34,216 --> 01:46:35,981
<font color=#FFFF55>After everything I
saw, it can't be!</font>

1359
01:46:36,205 --> 01:46:37,412
<font color=#FFFF55>Can not be!</font>

1360
01:46:37,862 --> 01:46:39,943
<font color=#FFFF55>They were killing each other.</font>

1361
01:46:40,195 --> 01:46:42,726
<font color=#FFFF55>Killing people they cannot see.
Children...</font>

1362
01:46:43,006 --> 01:46:44,592
<font color=#FFFF55>Children!</font>

1363
01:46:44,827 --> 01:46:47,173
<font color=#FFFF55>No, it had to be him.
It can not be them!</font>

1364
01:46:47,421 --> 01:46:49,748
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana, people... I...</font>

1365
01:46:50,006 --> 01:46:51,550
<font color=#FFFF55>She was right.</font>

1366
01:46:52,077 --> 01:46:53,086
<font color=#FFFF55>My mother was right.</font>

1367
01:46:53,087 --> 01:46:55,132
<font color=#FFFF55>She said the world of
men do not deserve you.</font>

1368
01:46:55,334 --> 01:46:57,028
<font color=#FFFF55>They don't deserve
our help, Steve.</font>

1369
01:46:57,274 --> 01:46:59,831
<font color=#FFFF55>- It's not about deserve!
- They do not deserve our help.</font>

1370
01:46:59,856 --> 01:47:01,726
<font color=#FFFF55>Maybe we don't!</font>

1371
01:47:03,387 --> 01:47:05,555
<font color=#FFFF55>But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.</font>

1372
01:47:06,552 --> 01:47:09,366
<font color=#FFFF55>You don't think I get it, after
what I've seen out there?</font>

1373
01:47:10,851 --> 01:47:14,333
<font color=#FFFF55>You don't think I wish I could tell
you that I was one bad guy to blame?</font>

1374
01:47:14,964 --> 01:47:16,638
<font color=#FFFF55>It's not!</font>

1375
01:47:18,809 --> 01:47:20,489
<font color=#FFFF55>We are all to blame.</font>

1376
01:47:20,763 --> 01:47:21,764
<font color=#FFFF55>I am not.</font>

1377
01:47:23,373 --> 01:47:24,975
<font color=#FFFF55>But maybe I am!</font>

1378
01:47:28,852 --> 01:47:29,853
<font color=#FFFF55>Please.</font>

1379
01:47:30,214 --> 01:47:32,073
<font color=#FFFF55>If you believe that this
war should stop...</font>

1380
01:47:32,074 --> 01:47:33,890
<font color=#FFFF55>...if you want to stop it...</font>

1381
01:47:34,222 --> 01:47:35,663
<font color=#FFFF55>...help me stop it right now.</font>

1382
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:36,972
<font color=#FFFF55>Because...if.</font>

1383
01:47:38,371 --> 01:47:43,676
<font color=#FFFF55>If you don't, there will be thousands
more. Please, please come with me.</font>

1384
01:47:43,701 --> 01:47:45,184
<font color=#FFFF55>I have to go.</font>

1385
01:47:51,705 --> 01:47:53,318
<font color=#FFFF55>I have to go.</font>

1386
01:48:05,141 --> 01:48:06,177
<font color=#FFFF55>Hey!</font>

1387
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:12,025
<font color=#FFFF55>- Where is Diana?
- We are on our own.</font>

1388
01:48:12,168 --> 01:48:14,980
<font color=#FFFF55>- What?
- What did you see, Charlie?</font>

1389
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,007
<font color=#FFFF55>Seems like a bunch
of gas pumps...</font>

1390
01:48:17,269 --> 01:48:19,603
<font color=#FFFF55>...but I can't see where
they're taking them.</font>

1391
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:21,240
<font color=#FFFF55>How are we gonna get in there?</font>

1392
01:48:21,971 --> 01:48:24,074
<font color=#FFFF55>I have got an idea.
Come on guys.</font>

1393
01:48:24,303 --> 01:48:25,304
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on!</font>

1394
01:48:38,905 --> 01:48:40,650
<font color=#FFFF55>Who's there?</font>

1395
01:48:53,123 --> 01:48:55,033
<font color=#FFFF55>Sir Patrick.</font>

1396
01:48:55,742 --> 01:49:00,073
<font color=#FFFF55>You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.</font>

1397
01:49:01,236 --> 01:49:05,101
<font color=#FFFF55>They only deserve destruction.</font>

1398
01:49:06,464 --> 01:49:07,932
<font color=#FFFF55>You...</font>

1399
01:49:09,606 --> 01:49:11,565
<font color=#FFFF55>You are him.</font>

1400
01:49:15,033 --> 01:49:16,437
<font color=#FFFF55>I am.</font>

1401
01:49:16,824 --> 01:49:21,450
<font color=#FFFF55>But I'm not what
you thought I was.</font>

1402
01:49:42,094 --> 01:49:43,659
<font color=#FFFF55>What is that?</font>

1403
01:49:44,952 --> 01:49:46,270
<font color=#FFFF55>Future.</font>

1404
01:49:50,985 --> 01:49:52,991
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm not your enemy, Diana.</font>

1405
01:49:55,021 --> 01:49:58,760
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm the only one who
truly knows you.</font>

1406
01:49:58,995 --> 01:50:03,519
<font color=#FFFF55>And who truly knows
them, as you now do.</font>

1407
01:50:05,834 --> 01:50:09,505
<font color=#FFFF55>They always been and
always will be...</font>

1408
01:50:09,685 --> 01:50:13,646
<font color=#FFFF55>...weak, cruel, selfish...</font>

1409
01:50:13,746 --> 01:50:17,020
<font color=#FFFF55>...and capable of the
greatest horrors.</font>

1410
01:50:26,306 --> 01:50:27,756
<font color=#FFFF55>All I ever wanted was...</font>

1411
01:50:27,757 --> 01:50:32,816
<font color=#FFFF55>...for the Gods to see how
evil my father's creation was.</font>

1412
01:50:34,793 --> 01:50:35,938
<font color=#FFFF55>But they refused.</font>

1413
01:50:36,264 --> 01:50:37,505
<font color=#FFFF55>I am Diana of Temiscira...</font>

1414
01:50:37,666 --> 01:50:39,164
<font color=#FFFF55>So I destroyed them.</font>

1415
01:50:39,198 --> 01:50:41,197
<font color=#FFFF55>...daughter of Hippolyta...</font>

1416
01:50:41,235 --> 01:50:43,267
<font color=#FFFF55>...and I am here
to complete her...</font>

1417
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:52,871
<font color=#FFFF55>The God Killer...</font>

1418
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:57,592
<font color=#FFFF55>My dear Child..</font>

1419
01:50:58,919 --> 01:51:01,441
<font color=#FFFF55>...that's not the God Killer.</font>

1420
01:51:03,935 --> 01:51:05,436
<font color=#FFFF55>You are.</font>

1421
01:51:08,025 --> 01:51:11,163
<font color=#FFFF55>Only a God can kill another God.</font>

1422
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:16,104
<font color=#FFFF55>Zeus left the child he had
with the queen of the Amazon.</font>

1423
01:51:16,331 --> 01:51:18,604
<font color=#FFFF55>...As a weapon to
use against me.</font>

1424
01:51:18,629 --> 01:51:20,502
<font color=#FFFF55>No. You liar.</font>

1425
01:51:22,286 --> 01:51:24,599
<font color=#FFFF55>I compel you to
tell me the truth.</font>

1426
01:51:26,902 --> 01:51:28,389
<font color=#FFFF55>I am.</font>

1427
01:51:54,793 --> 01:51:57,139
<font color=#FFFF55>I'm not the god of war, Diana.</font>

1428
01:51:57,347 --> 01:51:59,815
<font color=#FFFF55>I am the God of truth.</font>

1429
01:52:01,348 --> 01:52:02,671
<font color=#FFFF55>Mankind...</font>

1430
01:52:03,305 --> 01:52:06,322
<font color=#FFFF55>...Stole this world from us.</font>

1431
01:52:08,330 --> 01:52:11,826
<font color=#FFFF55>They ruined it, day by day.</font>

1432
01:52:11,827 --> 01:52:16,103
<font color=#FFFF55>And I, the only one wise
enough to see it...</font>

1433
01:52:17,559 --> 01:52:20,325
<font color=#FFFF55>...was left too weak to stop them.</font>

1434
01:52:21,252 --> 01:52:24,878
<font color=#FFFF55>All these years I have
struggled alone...</font>

1435
01:52:24,879 --> 01:52:27,031
<font color=#FFFF55>...whispering into their ears.</font>

1436
01:52:27,032 --> 01:52:31,851
<font color=#FFFF55>Ideas, inspiration
for formulas...</font>

1437
01:52:32,765 --> 01:52:34,361
<font color=#FFFF55>...weapons...</font>

1438
01:52:37,023 --> 01:52:39,560
<font color=#FFFF55>...but I don't
make them use them.</font>

1439
01:52:40,619 --> 01:52:42,568
<font color=#FFFF55>They start these
wars on their own.</font>

1440
01:52:43,564 --> 01:52:47,382
<font color=#FFFF55>All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep...</font>

1441
01:52:47,656 --> 01:52:49,901
<font color=#FFFF55>...in the hope they
will destroy themselves.</font>

1442
01:52:51,959 --> 01:52:54,055
<font color=#FFFF55>But it has never been enough.</font>

1443
01:52:55,493 --> 01:52:56,592
<font color=#FFFF55>Until you.</font>

1444
01:52:59,242 --> 01:53:03,496
<font color=#FFFF55>When you first arrived I
was going to crush you.</font>

1445
01:53:04,074 --> 01:53:07,206
<font color=#FFFF55>But I knew that if
only you could see...</font>

1446
01:53:07,411 --> 01:53:11,283
<font color=#FFFF55>...what the other
gods could not...</font>

1447
01:53:12,657 --> 01:53:17,170
<font color=#FFFF55>...then you would join me, and
with our powers combined...</font>

1448
01:53:17,443 --> 01:53:21,375
<font color=#FFFF55>...we could finally end all the
pain, all the suffering...</font>

1449
01:53:21,596 --> 01:53:24,161
<font color=#FFFF55>...destruction they bring.</font>

1450
01:53:24,614 --> 01:53:29,747
<font color=#FFFF55>And we could return this world to
the paradise it was before them.</font>

1451
01:53:31,351 --> 01:53:33,081
<font color=#FFFF55>Forever.</font>

1452
01:53:35,972 --> 01:53:37,455
<font color=#FFFF55>I...</font>

1453
01:53:42,251 --> 01:53:44,985
<font color=#FFFF55>I can never be a part of that.</font>

1454
01:53:48,107 --> 01:53:50,883
<font color=#FFFF55>My dear, I don't
want to fight you.</font>

1455
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:53,263
<font color=#FFFF55>But if I must...</font>

1456
01:54:02,856 --> 01:54:04,711
<font color=#FFFF55>- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!</font>

1457
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:06,484
<font color=#FFFF55>Sammy, let's go!</font>

1458
01:54:06,924 --> 01:54:08,412
<font color=#FFFF55>Get these things out of here.</font>

1459
01:54:38,347 --> 01:54:42,791
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh my dear, you have
so much to learn.</font>

1460
01:55:07,821 --> 01:55:10,306
<font color=#FFFF55>Oh my God!</font>

1461
01:55:10,779 --> 01:55:12,207
<font color=#FFFF55>What are we gonna do?</font>

1462
01:55:13,965 --> 01:55:16,058
<font color=#FFFF55>There is not much we can do...</font>

1463
01:55:16,205 --> 01:55:17,834
<font color=#FFFF55>...if that's who I think it is.</font>

1464
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:25,058
<font color=#FFFF55>But we can stop that plane.</font>

1465
01:55:38,264 --> 01:55:40,160
<font color=#FFFF55>If we could get on the radio...</font>

1466
01:55:40,161 --> 01:55:42,746
<font color=#FFFF55>...we can ask flying
corp to shoot her down.</font>

1467
01:55:42,771 --> 01:55:46,047
<font color=#FFFF55>No. If it crashes, it will wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles.</font>

1468
01:55:46,072 --> 01:55:46,991
<font color=#FFFF55>We gotta ground it!</font>

1469
01:55:47,216 --> 01:55:48,807
<font color=#FFFF55>Bad news. It's on a timer.</font>

1470
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:51,267
<font color=#FFFF55>If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.</font>

1471
01:55:58,301 --> 01:56:00,244
<font color=#FFFF55>Is it flammable, Chief?</font>

1472
01:56:00,269 --> 01:56:03,747
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, you said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.</font>

1473
01:56:10,888 --> 01:56:13,318
<font color=#FFFF55>I need you guys to clear
me a path to that plane.</font>

1474
01:56:13,343 --> 01:56:15,495
<font color=#FFFF55>- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!</font>

1475
01:56:17,517 --> 01:56:18,518
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on!</font>

1476
01:57:01,132 --> 01:57:03,556
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on! This way! Steve!</font>

1477
01:57:13,122 --> 01:57:14,969
<font color=#FFFF55>- Come on, Steve.
- Ahead! Go!</font>

1478
01:57:15,383 --> 01:57:16,857
<font color=#FFFF55>Steve!</font>

1479
01:57:59,775 --> 01:58:02,901
<font color=#FFFF55>Let's see what kind of
god you really are.</font>

1480
01:58:29,361 --> 01:58:32,705
<font color=#FFFF55>You will help me
destroy them, Diana.</font>

1481
01:58:36,013 --> 01:58:37,769
<font color=#FFFF55>Or you will die.</font>

1482
01:58:47,832 --> 01:58:50,184
<font color=#FFFF55>Come on! Let's move, let's go!
Go. Go. Go.</font>

1483
01:58:53,366 --> 01:58:55,364
<font color=#FFFF55>- Now!
- Go! Run!</font>

1484
01:59:20,424 --> 01:59:23,169
<font color=#FFFF55>Is that all you have to offer?</font>

1485
01:59:39,465 --> 01:59:43,386
<font color=#FFFF55>It is futile to
imagine you can win.</font>

1486
01:59:44,223 --> 01:59:45,932
<font color=#FFFF55>Give up, Diana.</font>

1487
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:51,622
<font color=#FFFF55>Chief! Anything left?</font>

1488
01:59:51,647 --> 01:59:52,582
<font color=#FFFF55>I got nothing.</font>

1489
01:59:52,607 --> 01:59:53,913
<font color=#FFFF55>- Anything!
- No!</font>

1490
02:00:11,753 --> 02:00:12,754
<font color=#FFFF55>Steve.</font>

1491
02:00:59,229 --> 02:01:00,681
<font color=#FFFF55>Steve.</font>

1492
02:01:03,730 --> 02:01:07,579
<font color=#FFFF55>No!</font>

1493
02:01:40,799 --> 02:01:43,401
<font color=#FFFF55>Yes, Diana!</font>

1494
02:01:43,803 --> 02:01:46,369
<font color=#FFFF55>Take them all!</font>

1495
02:01:46,714 --> 02:01:49,800
<font color=#FFFF55>Finally you see.</font>

1496
02:01:50,224 --> 02:01:52,799
<font color=#FFFF55>Look at this world.</font>

1497
02:01:53,098 --> 02:01:55,914
<font color=#FFFF55>Mankind did this, not me.</font>

1498
02:01:57,699 --> 02:01:59,772
<font color=#FFFF55>They are ugly...</font>

1499
02:01:59,797 --> 02:02:01,611
<font color=#FFFF55>...filled with hatred...</font>

1500
02:02:01,912 --> 02:02:02,995
<font color=#FFFF55>...weak...</font>

1501
02:02:03,396 --> 02:02:06,120
<font color=#FFFF55>...Just like your
captain Trevor.</font>

1502
02:02:06,688 --> 02:02:12,402
<font color=#FFFF55>Gone and left you nothing.
And for what?</font>

1503
02:02:12,789 --> 02:02:14,374
<font color=#FFFF55>Pathetic!</font>

1504
02:02:15,748 --> 02:02:17,491
<font color=#FFFF55>He deserved to burn!</font>

1505
02:02:28,501 --> 02:02:32,637
<font color=#FFFF55>Look at her and
tell me I'm wrong.</font>

1506
02:02:41,044 --> 02:02:45,043
<font color=#FFFF55>She is the perfect example
of these humans...</font>

1507
02:02:46,799 --> 02:02:50,706
<font color=#FFFF55>...and unworthy of your
sympathy in every way.</font>

1508
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:54,357
<font color=#FFFF55>Destroy her, Diana.</font>

1509
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:58,799
<font color=#FFFF55>You know that she deserves.
That they all do.</font>

1510
02:03:02,021 --> 02:03:03,382
<font color=#FFFF55>Do it!</font>

1511
02:03:08,190 --> 02:03:09,892
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana!</font>

1512
02:03:13,101 --> 02:03:14,535
<font color=#FFFF55>Diana...</font>

1513
02:03:24,065 --> 02:03:25,066
<font color=#FFFF55>What?</font>

1514
02:03:25,566 --> 02:03:27,170
<font color=#FFFF55>We have to go.</font>

1515
02:03:29,916 --> 02:03:31,409
<font color=#FFFF55>What are you saying?</font>

1516
02:03:31,975 --> 02:03:33,021
<font color=#FFFF55>Steve...</font>

1517
02:03:33,853 --> 02:03:35,985
<font color=#FFFF55>...Whatever it is, I can do it.</font>

1518
02:03:36,311 --> 02:03:37,159
<font color=#FFFF55>No.. No..</font>

1519
02:03:37,286 --> 02:03:38,675
<font color=#FFFF55>- Let me do it.
- No.</font>

1520
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:40,552
<font color=#FFFF55>It has to be me.</font>

1521
02:03:40,577 --> 02:03:42,231
<font color=#FFFF55>It has to be me.</font>

1522
02:03:42,551 --> 02:03:45,799
<font color=#FFFF55>I could save today.
You can save the world.</font>

1523
02:03:54,617 --> 02:03:57,057
<font color=#FFFF55>I wish we had more time.</font>

1524
02:03:57,302 --> 02:04:00,081
<font color=#FFFF55>What?
What are you saying?</font>

1525
02:04:02,989 --> 02:04:03,990
<font color=#FFFF55>I love you!</font>

1526
02:04:15,932 --> 02:04:17,415
<font color=#FFFF55>You are wrong about them.</font>

1527
02:04:27,187 --> 02:04:28,850
<font color=#FFFF55>They are everything you say...</font>

1528
02:04:29,718 --> 02:04:31,307
<font color=#FFFF55>...but so much more.</font>

1529
02:04:31,577 --> 02:04:32,874
<font color=#FFFF55>Lies!</font>

1530
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:02,750
<font color=#FFFF55>They do not deserve
your protection!</font>

1531
02:05:04,526 --> 02:05:05,613
<font color=#FFFF55>It's not about deserving.</font>

1532
02:05:10,488 --> 02:05:12,392
<font color=#FFFF55>It's about what you believe.</font>

1533
02:05:16,028 --> 02:05:17,408
<font color=#FFFF55>And I believe in love.</font>

1534
02:05:17,442 --> 02:05:22,689
<font color=#FFFF55>Then I will destroy you!</font>

1535
02:05:49,907 --> 02:05:51,636
<font color=#FFFF55><i>Goodbye brother.</i></font>
