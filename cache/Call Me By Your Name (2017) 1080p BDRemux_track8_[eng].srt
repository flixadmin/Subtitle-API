1
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,172
The usurper.

2
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,426
<i>Caro?</i> He's here.

3
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,199
- Professor Perlman.
- Welcome, welcome.

4
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,368
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Oh, my goodness.

5
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,911
You're bigger than your picture.

6
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,496
Well, I couldn't get
all of me in the photo.

7
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,331
That's the problem.

8
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,333
He seems very confident.

9
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,794
- Mrs. Perlman.
- Annella.

10
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,254
Oliver. Very nice to meet you.

11
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,755
- Thank you for having me in your home.
- Welcome.

12
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,090
Where's Elio?

13
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,633
I'll go down.

14
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,968
Elio?

15
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,263
- You must be exhausted.
- What gave me away?

16
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,942
Hey.

17
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,486
Darling, come help Oliver
take his things up to his room.

18
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,988
- He's already here?
- Yes!

19
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,241
Every single one of these will.

20
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,201
Elio, Oliver. Oliver, Elio.

21
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,036
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you. Elio.

22
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,830
You must be exhausted.

23
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,040
- A little bit.
- Come, come, come.

24
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,876
May I bring your things up to your room?

25
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,044
- Sure. Yeah.
- My room?

26
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,090
Follow him.

27
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,384
- You're very welcome here.
<i>- Si.</i>

28
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,386
Our home is your home.

29
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,935
You're leaving?

30
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,063
- Hello.
- Hi.

31
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,024
Nice to meet you.

32
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,677
My room is now your room.

33
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,596
I'll be next door.

34
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,894
We have to share the bathroom.

35
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,104
It's my only way out.

36
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,157
We're being called for dinner.

37
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,743
Sorry.

38
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,412
Yeah.

39
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,289
We're being called for dinner.

40
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,834
Yeah, I'm probably gonna pass.

41
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,587
Will you make an excuse for me
to your mom, though?

42
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,382
Thanks, man.

43
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,720
So, this is your old room, huh?

44
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,474
Thanks.

45
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,977
Later.

46
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,443
I'll take care of the tart.

47
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,991
Look at this.

48
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,409
Good morning, Professor.

49
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,952
- Good morning.
- Back from the dead.

50
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,037
- Was I out that long?
- It seemed like it, huh?

51
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,498
- How are you?
- I... Well, rested now.

52
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,041
- Thank you.
- I'm glad.

53
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,418
Would you like some espresso?

54
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,503
I would love some. Thank you very much.

55
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,922
This looks amazing.
I didn't take your seat, did I?

56
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,717
No, no, no. It's okay. Please.

57
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,760
Did you...
Did you recover from your trip?

58
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,220
I did. Yeah, big time.

59
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,014
- Thank you.
- Good.

60
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,682
I could show you around.

61
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,392
That'd be great. Thank you.

62
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,394
Is there a... Is there a bank in town?

63
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,771
I'd love to start
an account while I'm here.

64
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,441
Let me do it.

65
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,734
Sorry.

66
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,279
- It happens to the best of us.
- Yeah, well...

67
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,282
None of our residents has ever
had a local bank account.

68
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,825
Really?

69
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,702
Should I take him to Montodine?

70
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,996
I think they're closed
for summer vacation.

71
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,457
You try Crema.

72
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,875
Crema?

73
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,460
Thank you.

74
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,086
Is this your orchard?

75
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,588
These are Annella's trees.

76
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,550
Peaches, cherries, apricots...

77
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,386
Pomegranate.

78
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,935
Have another egg.

79
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,437
Oh, stupid.

80
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,314
No, no, no. I know myself too well.

81
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,982
If I have a second,
I'm just gonna have a third,

82
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,901
and then a fourth, and then you're just
gonna have to roll me out of here.

83
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,988
- Delicious.
- Darling?

84
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,490
Thank you.

85
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,992
Shall I give him Anchise's bike?

86
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,115
So, what does one do around here?

87
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,826
Wait for the summer to end.

88
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,327
Yeah?

89
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,620
What do you do in the winter?

90
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,915
- Wait for summer to come?
- Well, we only come here for Christmas

91
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,583
and some other vacations.

92
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,043
- Christmas? I thought you...
- And Easter as well.

93
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,628
- Thought you were Jewish.
- Well, we are Jewish,

94
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,964
but also American, Italian, French.

95
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,299
Somewhat atypical combination.

96
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,261
Besides my family, you're probably

97
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,263
the only other Jew
to set foot in this town.

98
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,224
I'm from a small town in New England.

99
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,475
I know what it's like
to be the odd Jew out.

100
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,396
So, what do you do around here?

101
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,732
Just read books.

102
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,902
Transcribe music. Swim at the river.

103
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,654
- Yeah?
- Go out at night.

104
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,948
- I don't know.
- That sounds fun.

105
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,745
All right, buddy, thanks for the help.

106
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,506
Sorry. Sorry about that.

107
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,049
It's all right.

108
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,135
All right, later.

109
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,771
<i>What do you have there?</i>

110
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,773
That should all be...

111
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,695
What is this?

112
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:40,283
These are the continuation
of these archaeology department...

113
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,951
These are archaeology?

114
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,745
Yeah, those are archaeology.
The rest of these should be history.

115
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,913
Okay.

116
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,373
- More apricot juice?
- Yeah.

117
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,876
- Here, <i>tesoro.</i>
- Thank you.

118
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,336
Help yourself, darling.

119
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,712
Thanks.

120
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,305
Help yourself to some more.

121
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,477
The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.

122
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,147
It's like the words "algebra,"
"alchemy," "alcohol."

123
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,815
It derives from an Arabic noun

124
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,817
combined with the Arabic article "al"
before it.

125
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,821
The origin of our Italian <i>albicocca</i>

126
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,531
is <i>al-barquq.</i>

127
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,034
It's amazing that today in Israel
and many Arab countries,

128
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,788
the fruit's referred to
by a totally different name, <i>mismish.</i>

129
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,749
I may have to disagree
with you there, Professor.

130
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,544
I'm gonna talk etymology,
so just bear with me a second.

131
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,005
You're right in the case
that most Latin words

132
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,341
do find their origins in Greek words.

133
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,759
However, in the case of "apricot,"

134
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,636
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.

135
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,179
How so?

136
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,224
Well, here, the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.

137
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,269
Latin word being
<i>praecoquum</i> or <i>precoquere.</i>

138
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,104
So it's, "precook" or "pre-ripen,"
as you know.

139
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,855
To be precocious or premature.

140
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,777
And the Byzantines, to go on,
then borrowed <i>praecox,</i>

141
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,197
which became <i>prekokkia,</i>
which then became <i>berikokki,</i>

142
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,116
which is how the Arabs got <i>al-barquq.</i>

143
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,795
That's courtesy of Philology 101.

144
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,464
Flying colors.

145
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,761
He does this every year.

146
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,071
It's about drink time. Let's go here.

147
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,241
- Ciao, Romano.
- Ciao, Oliver.

148
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,910
- How are you?
- All good.

149
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,709
Ciao, boys!

150
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,627
All good?

151
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,379
All good!

152
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,964
Let's see. What have we got?

153
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,884
- Can you start please?
- Of course!

154
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,822
Good morning, gentlemen.

155
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,871
How do you know about this place?

156
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,041
Okay.

157
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,876
Go, Chiara!

158
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,964
No, no, no, no, no!

159
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,221
He's better than the guy
who came last year.

160
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,680
Remember?

161
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,599
Get in there!

162
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,560
Much better!
See how cute he is.

163
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,782
Elio, water!

164
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,576
Perfect timing.

165
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,665
What's the matter? Are you all right?

166
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,584
- What, pinch a nerve?
- I'm okay.

167
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,545
Here. Hold this.

168
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,630
Trust me. I'm about to be a doctor.

169
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,465
Hey, hey, come here.
See? That's the problem.

170
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,800
You're too stressed.

171
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,344
- You just gotta relax a little bit.
- I am relaxing.

172
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,179
Marzia, come here for a minute.

173
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,640
Back me up here.

174
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,559
- Feel that. Right there?
- Oliver.

175
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,893
- It's too tight, right?
- Yeah.

176
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,186
- He needs to relax.
- Oliver!

177
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,521
Later.

178
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,064
You should relax more.

179
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,484
Okay, guys, ready?

180
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,785
Okay, our ball, our ball, our ball.

181
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,163
Twelve serving 11.

182
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,039
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

183
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,417
Go, go, go. Yeah, good.
It's yours, it's yours.

184
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,380
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and
the others are coming over for dinner.

185
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,884
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

186
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,302
Don't know.

187
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,679
What a movie star!

188
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,474
Yes, those Americans...

189
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,707
Sparkling wine!

190
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,043
He's late.

191
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,712
Don't you think...

192
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,716
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?

193
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,511
Arrogant.

194
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,930
I don't think he's arrogant.

195
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,181
Just watch.

196
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,600
This is how he'll say good-bye
to us when the time comes.

197
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,894
With his... "Later."

198
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,898
Meanwhile, we'll have to put up with him
for six long weeks.

199
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,108
Won't we, darling?

200
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,528
I think he's shy.

201
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,279
You'll grow to like him.

202
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,405
What if I grow to hate him?

203
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,657
Oh, no, sweetheart.

204
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,453
- Take his plates away.
- Very well, madam.

205
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,625
Darling?

206
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,647
Elio, play something.

207
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't want to.

208
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,484
Why not?

209
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,027
Because I don't want to.

210
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,446
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

211
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,240
Because I don't want to.

212
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,450
You're spoiling everyone's fun.

213
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,586
Play well, darling.

214
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,597
- Hey.
- Hey.

215
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,973
What are you doing?

216
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,266
Reading.

217
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,728
How come you're not with everyone else
down by the river?

218
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,274
- I have an allergy. It's...
- Yeah, me too.

219
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,527
Maybe we have the same one.

220
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,073
Why don't you and I go swimming?

221
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,075
- Right now?
- Yeah.

222
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,369
Come on. Let's go.

223
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,705
Do we have to go right now?

224
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,708
- I'll go get changed.
- Okay.

225
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,251
Meet you downstairs.

226
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,438
See you downstairs.

227
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,850
Elio, what are you doing?

228
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,518
Reading my music.

229
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,979
No, you're not.

230
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,231
- Thinking, then.
- Yeah?

231
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,736
About what?

232
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,782
It's private.

233
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,617
You're not gonna tell me?

234
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,452
I'm not gonna tell you.

235
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,454
He's not gonna tell me
what he's thinking about.

236
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,622
Elio.

237
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,373
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.

238
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,543
More apricot juice, please.

239
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,630
That's a good boy.

240
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,256
Thank God you're helping me.

241
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,364
Sounds nice.

242
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,658
Thought you didn't like it.

243
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,040
Play it again, will you?

244
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,385
Follow me.

245
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,711
That sounds different.
Did you change it?

246
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,463
- Well, I changed it a little bit.
- Why?

247
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,632
I just played it the way Liszt
would have played it

248
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,010
if he'd altered Bach's version.

249
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,012
Play that again.

250
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,097
- Play what again?
- The thing you played outside.

251
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,474
You want me to play
the thing I played outside?

252
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,519
- Please.
- Of course.

253
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,628
I can't believe you changed it again.

254
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,255
- I changed it a little bit.
- Yeah. Why?

255
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,716
I just played it the way
Busoni would've played it

256
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,301
if he'd altered Liszt's version.

257
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,303
And what is wrong with Bach
the way Bach would've played...

258
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,930
Bach never wrote it for the guitar.

259
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,348
In fact, we're not even sure

260
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,308
- Bach wrote it at all.
- Forget I asked.

261
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,465
It's young Bach.

262
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,425
He dedicated it to his brother.

263
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,711
Hey, Professor.

264
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:04,920
Hello.

265
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,131
Here, please.

266
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,799
I need help.

267
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,302
Just be honest.

268
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,595
How bad is it?

269
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,266
I think your insights here
are persuasive, but...

270
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,771
Have you been to the river?

271
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,454
Mafalda!

272
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,372
Isn't she beautiful?

273
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,268
Elio.

274
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,979
You sleeping?

275
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,774
I was.

276
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,526
Listen to this drivel.
Tell me what you think.

277
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,821
- Wait.
- What?

278
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,615
Can't hear you.

279
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,542
"For the early Greeks,

280
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,252
"Heidegger contends,
this underlying hiddenness

281
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,129
"is constitutive of the way beings are,

282
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,547
"not only in relation to themselves

283
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,258
"but also in relation
to other entities generally.

284
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,052
"In other words,
they do not construe hiddenness

285
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,639
"merely or primarily in terms of
entities' relations to human beings."

286
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,059
Does that make any sense to you?

287
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,520
Doesn't make any sense to me.

288
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,563
I don't think it makes
any sense to your dad, either.

289
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,608
Maybe it did when you wrote it.

290
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,407
That might be the kindest thing
anybody has said to me in months.

291
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,119
"Kind"?

292
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,204
Yep. Kind.

293
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:31,066
- Hey, Elio.
- Hey.

294
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,526
Hey!

295
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,530
Come here.

296
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,284
What's going on?

297
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,161
Is he trying to get it on with her?

298
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,413
Elio, he already succeeded?

299
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,749
What do I know?

300
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,501
I'd love to be in his shoes.

301
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,503
Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?

302
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,216
She wants him, no matter what!

303
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,637
Coming?

304
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,307
I'll come later.

305
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,593
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?

306
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,345
Why would I be mad at Chiara?

307
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,056
Because of him.

308
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,599
Because of who?

309
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,019
Of Oliver.

310
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,906
Turn around.

311
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,381
Meet me here tomorrow night?

312
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,557
Wait for me!

313
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,184
Come on.

314
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,616
We almost had sex last night...

315
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,077
Marzia and me.

316
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,580
Well, why didn't you?

317
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,874
I don't know.

318
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,711
Well, you know, it's better
to have tried and failed, right?

319
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,590
All I had to do was find the courage
to reach out and touch.

320
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,217
She would have said yes.

321
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,094
Well, try again later.

322
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,929
Try what later?

323
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,680
I just heard
from the people in Sirmione.

324
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,599
They say they've come up with something.

325
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,976
Fantastic.

326
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,603
Going there today.

327
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,022
- Would you like to come along?
- I would love to. Thank you.

328
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,609
- Smell this.
- Can I come, too?

329
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,278
On the condition you remain silent.

330
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,197
Silent as in,
"He has too many opinions,"

331
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,865
or silent as in,
"Just not telling anybody

332
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,617
"what an amazing thing you've dug up"?

333
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,244
Well, nothing has been dug up.

334
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,955
It's what has been brought out,
out of the water.

335
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,215
What are you doing?

336
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,217
Going to Lake Garda with my dad.

337
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,302
He wants to show Oliver
where he's dredging.

338
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,638
Can you tell him I came by?

339
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,474
He's inside with my dad, helping him.

340
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,729
You were amazing last night,
on the dance floor.

341
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,690
- He's a good dancer.
- A good dancer.

342
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,735
He's good-looking too.

343
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,989
- Want to get us together?
- No.

344
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,409
Come in.

345
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,698
Dad always sits up front
with Anchise to navigate.

346
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,750
She seems to like you a lot.

347
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,503
She's more beautiful
than she was last year.

348
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,382
I saw her naked on a night swim once.

349
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,426
Great body.

350
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,220
Trying to get me to like her?

351
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,388
What would be the harm in that?

352
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:36,640
No, no harm.

353
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,767
Just typically like to go at those
things on my own, if you don't mind.

354
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,940
I'll drive today!

355
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,321
Just don't play at being the good host.

356
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,618
Anchise, take the afternoon off.

357
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,455
What's going on, boys?

358
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:07,087
Oliver, come. Sit up front.
Be my navigator.

359
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,631
What? What?

360
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,856
-Dr Roseburg.
-Samuel!

361
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,900
<i>- Benvenuto.</i>
- Look who's here.

362
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,237
- He's grown a bit, eh?
- And this is Oliver.

363
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,518
Sammy! Come on!

364
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,033
Truce?

365
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,328
Hey, boys.

366
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:32,297
The ship went down in 1827
on the way to Isola del Garda

367
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,509
Gossip has it this statue
was a gift from Count Lechi

368
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,763
to his lover,
contralto Adelaide Malanotte.

369
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:46,561
There are four known sets,
after the Praxiteles originals.

370
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,188
This fellow's at number three.

371
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,857
The Emperor Hadrian had a pair,
dug up at Tivoli,

372
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,861
but one of the more philistine
of the Farnese Popes melted them down

373
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,782
and had them recast as a
particularly voluptuous Venus.

374
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,681
Who'd like to go for a swim
before we head back?

375
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:28,061
We're all such pros. If I got my own
statue, it would probably be on there.

376
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,569
Elio!

377
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,613
Oliver!

378
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,952
- I have to go. I have to go.
- Hey! Hey!

379
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,745
I have to go.

380
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,082
Goodness.

381
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,171
- Are you going, too?
- No, no.

382
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,340
I should stay
and do some work on my book.

383
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,009
Come on. How about a drink
to celebrate the day?

384
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,304
- Okay, maybe just one.
- All right!

385
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,025
Marzia?

386
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,635
<i>The Cosmic Fragments</i> by Heraclitus.

387
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:35,104
<i>The meaning of the river flowing
is not that all things are changing</i>

388
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,190
<i>so that we cannot encounter them twice,</i>

389
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,401
<i>but that some things
stay the same only by changing.</i>

390
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,035
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.

391
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,584
Leave the door open.

392
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,378
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

393
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,090
Darling, have you seen my <i>Heptaméron?</i>

394
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,344
Mafalda.

395
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,642
It's in German.

396
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:44,896
Okay.

397
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,444
I can't remember where we left off,
but I think you'll like this one.

398
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,616
Come here, darling.

399
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,369
So, I'll translate, huh?

400
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:13,800
"A handsome young knight
is madly in love with a princess.

401
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,885
"And she, too, is in love with him,

402
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,598
"though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it.

403
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,392
"Despite the friendship..."

404
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,981
"...that blossoms between them,

405
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,902
"or perhaps because of
that very friendship,

406
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,489
"the young knight finds himself so..."

407
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,994
"...so humbled and speechless

408
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:47,083
"that he's totally unable to bring up
the subject of his love.

409
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,671
"Till one day, he asks the princess
point-blank..."

410
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,184
"Is it better to speak or to die?"

411
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,609
I'd never have the courage
to ask a question like that.

412
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,445
I doubt that.

413
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,578
Hey, Elly-Belly.

414
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,540
You do know that
you can always talk to us.

415
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,341
My mom's been reading
this 16th-century French romance.

416
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,677
She read some of it to my dad and I
the day the lights went out.

417
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:43,139
Yeah, about the knight that doesn't know
whether to speak or die?

418
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,307
Right.

419
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,976
So, does he or doesn't he?

420
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,771
"Better to speak," she said.

421
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:54,483
But she's on her guard.

422
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,778
She senses a trap somewhere.

423
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,037
So, does he speak?

424
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,372
No.

425
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,792
He fudges.

426
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,255
It figures. He's French.

427
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,889
I gotta go to town in a little bit
to pick some things up.

428
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:28,434
I can go. I'm not doing anything today.

429
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,187
Then why don't we go together?

430
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,438
Right now?

431
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,732
Yeah. Right now.

432
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:38,194
That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on.

433
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,613
"That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on."

434
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:53,960
Mind if I put this in your bag?

435
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,044
Yes, please.

436
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,140
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

437
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,642
Perfect. Thanks.

438
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:16,190
I fell. I was coming home the other day,
and I scraped myself pretty badly.

439
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,068
Anchiese insisted on applying
some sort of witches' brew.

440
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,695
I think it helped.

441
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,429
Hold this for a second, will you?

442
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,658
- Want one?
- Sure.

443
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,601
Not bad, huh?

444
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,519
Not bad at all.

445
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,857
I thought you didn't smoke.

446
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,568
I don't.

447
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,202
- So, World War II, huh?
- No. This is World War I.

448
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,455
You'd have to be at least 80 years old
to have known any of them.

449
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,666
I never even heard
of the Battle of Piave.

450
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,419
Battle of Piave was one of the most
lethal battles of World War I.

451
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:02,797
Hundred and seventy thousand
people died.

452
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,175
Is there anything you don't know?

453
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,597
I know nothing, Oliver.

454
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,354
Well, you seem to know
more than anybody else around here.

455
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,898
Well, if you only knew how little
I know about the things that matter.

456
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,486
What things that matter?

457
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,953
You know what things.

458
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,503
Why are you telling me this?

459
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,134
'Cause I thought you should know.

460
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,887
Because you thought I should know?

461
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,016
'Cause I wanted you to know?

462
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,564
Because I wanted you to know.

463
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,278
Because I wanted you to know.

464
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,493
'Cause I wanted you to know.

465
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,257
Because there's no one else
I can say this to but you.

466
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,765
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

467
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,442
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here.

468
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,528
You know I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,518
They mixed up all of my pages.

470
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,728
I'm gonna have to
retype this whole thing.

471
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,605
I'm not gonna have anything to work on
this afternoon.

472
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,232
This is gonna set me back a whole day.

473
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,108
Damn it.

474
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,320
Shouldn't have said anything.

475
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,780
Just pretend you never did.

476
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,115
Does that mean we're on speaking terms
but not really?

477
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,955
It means we can't talk
about those kinds of things.

478
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,332
Okay?

479
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,293
We just can't.

480
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,601
Hey.

481
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,354
Let's go, American!

482
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,085
- Ready?
- Let's go.

483
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:04,872
Pretty much.

484
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,673
Oh, my God.

485
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,800
- Thirsty?
- Yeah.

486
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,679
Good morning, ma'am.

487
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,557
Excuse me.

488
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,186
Could I ask for a glass of water?

489
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,198
Il Duce.

490
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,075
"People of Italy!"

491
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,577
That's Italy.

492
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,083
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

493
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:28,914
Come on!

494
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,355
This is my spot. It's all mine.

495
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,692
Come here to read.

496
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,112
Can't tell you the number of books
I've read here.

497
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,200
Oh, my God, it's freezing.

498
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,786
Spring is in the mountains.

499
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,038
The Alpi Orobie.

500
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,750
The water comes
straight down from there.

501
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,944
I like the way you say things.

502
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,197
I don't know why you're always
putting yourself down, though.

503
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,657
So you won't, I guess.

504
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,997
You really that afraid of what I think?

505
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,470
You're making things
very difficult for me.

506
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,151
I love this, Oliver.

507
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,033
What?

508
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,497
Everything.

509
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,920
Us, you mean?

510
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,048
It's not bad.

511
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,175
It's not bad.

512
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,231
Better now?

513
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,867
No, no, no.

514
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,578
- We should go.
- Why?

515
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,956
I know myself. Okay?
And we've been good.

516
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,291
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of,

517
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,667
and that's a good thing.

518
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:02,461
I wanna be good.

519
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,212
Okay?

520
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,846
Am I offending you?

521
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:20,896
Just don't.

522
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,197
I think it's starting to get infected.

523
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,825
We can stop by the pharmacist's
on the way back.

524
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,827
Excellent idea.

525
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,421
So we got the government
of Bettino Craxi...

526
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,049
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.

527
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,051
Let me speak.

528
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,638
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.

529
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,474
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.

530
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,477
I'd like to know what they think too.

531
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,438
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!

532
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:06,692
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...

533
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:10,862
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

534
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,740
You've changed
since you inherited this place.

535
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,534
What's that got to do with it?

536
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,411
What are you saying?

537
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,788
You're mad, darling.

538
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,832
You asshole!

539
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,794
- She's right.
- And you don't say anything to her.

540
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,547
Say something.

541
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,340
You're resigned.

542
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,010
Why don't we talk
about the death of Buñuel?

543
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:36,138
Buñuel was a genius.

544
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,848
- Know him?
- Cinema isn't the answer.

545
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,226
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.

546
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:45,063
They broadcast <i>The Phantom of Liberty</i>
with constant interr...

547
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,607
Everyone loves Buñuel!

548
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,276
Let's hear his opinion.

549
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,820
He doesn't know anything about Italy!

550
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,864
Say something. Give us your impression.

551
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,574
Do you have an impression?

552
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,743
Darling, he's American.

553
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,161
That doesn't mean stupid!

554
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,252
Just stop.

555
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,256
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.

556
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,176
She didn't say that.

557
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,219
I'm going to go mad.

558
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,138
What's the matter?

559
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,183
What's wrong?

560
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,268
It's nothing. It happens all the time.

561
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,563
- Mafalda, ice?
- It's in the fridge.

562
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,316
You get used to absolutely everything.

563
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,897
Don't you realise
you're mixing everything up?

564
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,649
What are you talking about?

565
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,485
There's no more politics, nothing.
He's left too.

566
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,154
Elio?

567
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,201
Elio.

568
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,161
You all right?

569
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,705
Sit for a second.

570
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,167
If you insist.

571
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,174
- That wasn't my fault, right?
- No.

572
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,011
I'm a mess.

573
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,101
Well, the kitchen table sure is.

574
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,525
Where did you learn to do that?

575
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,945
My bubbe used to do this for us
when we were sick.

576
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:58,697
Trust me, it helps.

577
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,537
I used to have one of these.

578
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,205
- You used to?
- Yeah.

579
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,207
How come you never wear it?

580
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,377
My mother says
we are Jews of discretion.

581
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,087
Well...

582
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,174
I guess that works for your mother.

583
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,718
Funny witch.

584
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,100
Fuck, you'll kill me if you do that.

585
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,019
I hope not.

586
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,031
Hey, are you leaving?

587
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,908
- Where's Elio?
- He's inside.

588
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,202
He had a bit of a nosebleed
during lunch, and he's just resting.

589
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:46,953
- Really?
- Yeah.

590
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,663
- Okay. Bye.
- I'll be back in a minute.

591
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,373
Don't go anywhere.

592
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,845
You okay?

593
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:12,979
Are we going out?

594
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,318
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.

595
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,487
- She will?
- Yeah, she's a pain.

596
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,410
Where's Oliver?

597
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,037
Don't ask me.

598
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,973
Where's Oliver?

599
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:51,685
- Didn't he go out?
- Would you like a smoothie?

600
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,437
No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.

601
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:55,814
All right.

602
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,232
I'm going out tonight.

603
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,652
- Don't make me worry.
- What are you talking about?

604
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,404
This is no good, madam.

605
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,656
- Let him do his own thing.
- Fine.

606
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,741
Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.

607
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,451
She's worried about you.

608
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,750
You like him, don't you? Oliver?

609
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,586
Everyone likes Oliver.

610
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,089
I think he likes you too.

611
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,465
More than you do.

612
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,970
Is that your impression?

613
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,931
- No, he told me.
- When did he say that?

614
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,309
A while ago.

615
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,127
Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?

616
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,670
I have no idea.

617
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,380
Traitor.

618
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:19,642
Traitor.

619
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,368
This is Craxi.
I draw the center of Craxi...

620
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,886
- Hey.
<i>- Hi!</i>

621
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,723
It's me. Is that Marzia?

622
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,600
<i>Sure it is! Can't you tell?</i>

623
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,726
Sorry.

624
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,081
Is that for me?

625
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,750
Thanks.

626
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,644
Do you really read a lot?

627
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,480
I love reading too,
but I don't tell anyone.

628
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,732
Why not?

629
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,150
I don't know.

630
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,571
I think...

631
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,615
people who read are...

632
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,367
kind of secretive.

633
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,204
They hide who they really are.

634
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,416
Do you hide who you really are?

635
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,751
No, not with you.

636
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,003
Not with me?

637
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,301
Well, maybe a bit.

638
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:17,802
What do you mean?

639
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,472
You know exactly what I mean.

640
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,266
Why do you say that?

641
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,018
Why?

642
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,521
Because...

643
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,857
I think...

644
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,900
you're going to hurt me,

645
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,777
and I don't want to be hurt.

646
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,546
You're so hard.

647
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,346
Wait.

648
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:02,805
Kiss me.

649
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:11,898
- Is that good?
- Yes.

650
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,400
Are you lying?

651
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,581
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

652
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,875
Are you mad at me? Are you angry?

653
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,097
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

654
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,432
Leave me alone.

655
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,268
Fuck, that felt good.

656
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,903
<i>Please don't avoid me.</i>

657
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:01,072
<i>It kills me.
Can't stand thinking you hate me.</i>

658
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,533
<i>Your silence is killing me.
I'd sooner die than know you hate me.</i>

659
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,909
<i>I am such a pussy.</i>

660
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,455
Way over the top.

661
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,342
<i>Can't stand the silence.</i>

662
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,678
<i>Need to speak to you.</i>

663
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,786
Did someone have a good night
last night?

664
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,663
Not really.

665
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,878
Well, you must be tired, then.

666
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,839
Or were you playing poker, too?

667
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,883
I don't play poker.

668
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:05,094
Several hundred color slides
of our boxer and the others like him

669
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,054
arrived yesterday from Berlin.

670
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,640
We should start cataloguing them.

671
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,476
That'll keep us busy till lunch,
I imagine.

672
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:12,643
Sure.

673
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,148
Beautiful, aren't they?

674
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,402
They're all so incredibly sensual.

675
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:24,489
Because these are more Hellenistic
than 5th century Athenian.

676
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:28,534
Most likely sculpted
under the influence of Praxiteles.

677
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,245
Right.

678
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,875
Greatest sculptor in antiquity.

679
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,567
<i>Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.</i>

680
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:15,039
<i>Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.</i>

681
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:21,462
<i>Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach, for example.</i>

682
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,841
Not a straight body in these statues.
They're all curved.

683
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:28,427
Sometimes impossibly curved.
And so nonchalant.

684
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,305
Hence their ageless ambiguity.

685
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,309
As if they're daring you to desire them.

686
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,206
Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir
are coming for dinner.

687
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,084
- Also known as Sonny and Cher.
- Okay.

688
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,337
I'd like you to wear that shirt
they gave you for your birthday.

689
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:04,422
No.

690
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:08,175
- Darling, they got it for you in Miami.
- I'm sorry. It's too big. It's too big.

691
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:10,136
- Come on. It will make them so happy.
- It looks ridiculous on me.

692
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,220
I'll try it on for Oliver.

693
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,805
If Oliver thinks
I look like a scarecrow in it,

694
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,265
I'm not wearing it.

695
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,474
Oliver?

696
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,561
Hey, what time you got?

697
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,771
It's 2:00.

698
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:28,279
- Well... Later.
- Later.

699
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:41,792
Mafalda.

700
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,339
I won't be here for dinner.

701
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,174
Okay, Mr Oliver.

702
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,832
Hello, Mafalda.

703
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:22,917
Marzia.

704
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,338
Where are we going?

705
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,673
You'll see.

706
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:44,897
Stop it!

707
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:23,013
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey!

708
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,057
- It's been ages.
- It has, yes.

709
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,601
- How are you?
- You've grown.

710
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,145
- How are you.
- I'm good.

711
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,437
Good to see you.

712
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,565
Remember Marzia from last year.

713
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,691
Hello.

714
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,110
- Marzia, remember Issac?
- The girl from Paris?

715
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,611
Good to meet you.

716
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,155
Want to eat with us tonight?

717
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:40,531
No, no. I have to go.

718
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,324
- You're sure?
- Yes.

719
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,410
- Okay.
- Have a nice evening.

720
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,619
Goodbye.

721
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:55,629
This right here is the brand-new china
that you guys so kindly sent to us.

722
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,215
It looks wonderful.
Come here, Mounir, Mounir.

723
01:17:58,299 --> 01:17:59,592
- Come, come, come.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

724
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,596
I can't put it on now.
They've already met me.

725
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,972
- Yes, you can.
- It'll look like a put-up job.

726
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,056
- Papa, it'll...
- Yes.

727
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,976
- Papa, it'll look like a put-up job.
- No misbehaving tonight.

728
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:12,021
No... No laughing.
When I tell you to play, you'll play.

729
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,607
You're too old not to accept
people for who they are.

730
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,567
What's wrong with them?
What's wrong with them?

731
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,569
You call them Sonny and Cher
behind their backs.

732
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,030
- That's what Mom calls them...
- Then you accept gifts from them.

733
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:24,033
The only person that reflects badly on
is you.

734
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,744
Is it because they're gay
or because they're ridiculous?

735
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,999
If you know as much about economics
at Mounir's age,

736
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,376
you'll be a very wise man, indeed.

737
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,087
And a credit to me.

738
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:40,174
Now, just get into this, you.

739
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:52,645
These are unbelievable. I just...

740
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:56,941
Hey, look who's here.

741
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,408
Sorry. I have to go to bed.
I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

742
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:48,867
Thank you.

743
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:52,204
Elio. Elio.

744
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,749
- Thank you.
- Good night.

745
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,501
Good night.

746
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:03,090
Do I know you?

747
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,985
Thank you again for everything.

748
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,618
- They're never gonna make it.
- No, no. They're fine.

749
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:13,786
I'm glad you came.

750
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,298
Yeah, I'm nervous.

751
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,005
I like what you've done with the place.

752
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,426
It's nice.

753
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,079
You okay?

754
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:45,752
Me okay.

755
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,198
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, please.

756
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,717
What are you doing?

757
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:17,803
Nothing.

758
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,441
Does this make you happy?

759
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:34,903
You're not gonna get
a nosebleed on me, are you?

760
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:36,822
I'm not gonna get...

761
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,562
Off, off, off, off, off.

762
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:13,442
Yeah. Just pull it.

763
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:17,154
Or I'll pull it.

764
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:49,728
Oliver.

765
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:33,522
Call me by your name,
and I'll call you by mine.

766
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:38,485
Elio.

767
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,531
Oliver.

768
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:46,493
Elio.

769
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,539
- Oliver.
- Elio.

770
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,137
Did we make noise?

771
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,139
Nothing to worry about.

772
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:09,850
I don't know.
Mafalda always looks for signs.

773
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,810
Well, she's not gonna find any.

774
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:21,737
You wore that shirt
the first day you were here.

775
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:24,698
Will you give it to me when you go?

776
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:37,437
Let's go swimming.

777
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:33,076
Are you gonna hold
what happened last night against me?

778
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,536
No.

779
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:46,107
Elio. Come here.

780
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,073
Take your trunks off.

781
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:10,173
Well, that's promising.

782
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:11,549
You're hard again.

783
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:12,968
Good.

784
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,639
Professor, I got your note.
Thank you for reminding me.

785
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,516
I'm gonna go into town and pick
up those typed pages today,

786
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:03,435
so maybe this afternoon
would be a good time to...

787
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:05,812
Later.

788
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:09,941
We'll look them over later,
before you leave.

789
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,902
Okay. So later.

790
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:14,362
Later.

791
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:27,584
Oliver.

792
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:39,971
You're not sick of me yet?

793
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:42,766
No, I just...
I just wanted to be with you.

794
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:49,064
I'll... I'm gonna... I'll go.

795
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,525
Do you know how happy I am
that we slept together?

796
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,112
I don't know.

797
01:32:57,739 --> 01:32:59,157
Of course, you don't know.

798
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:03,244
I don't want you to regret anything.

799
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:06,873
And I hate the thought that maybe
I may have messed you up or...

800
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:09,250
I don't want either of us
to pay for this,

801
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,543
- one way or another.
- No, I...

802
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:12,837
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.

803
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:15,381
You're not gonna be, like,
getting in trouble.

804
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:17,509
That's not what I'm talking about.

805
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:30,939
Are you happy I came here?

806
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,572
I would kiss you if I could.

807
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:52,919
Times change.

808
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:54,796
Thank God we had the partisans.

809
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:59,092
I know, but times have changed.
It's different.

810
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:01,261
What do you think of Bettino?

811
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,222
- I don't like him.
- I like him.

812
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,766
I'm happy, actually.

813
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,813
I don't know. We'll see.

814
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:16,818
Anyway, they make the rules.

815
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,031
Pasquina!

816
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,408
Hello.

817
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,826
Hello, ma'am.

818
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,871
- Tortelli cremaschi.
- Yes.

819
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:52,789
Oh, fuck.

820
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:28,384
Fuck.

821
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,318
Fuck.

822
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:45,420
What did you do?

823
01:38:46,379 --> 01:38:47,797
- Nothing.
- No?

824
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:58,433
Oh, I see.

825
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:01,185
You've moved on
to the plant kingdom already.

826
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:02,520
What's next? Minerals?

827
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:04,272
I suppose you've already
given up animals.

828
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,398
You know that's me.

829
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,067
I'm sick, aren't I?

830
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:13,030
I wish everybody was as sick as you.

831
01:39:14,407 --> 01:39:15,408
Please don't do that.

832
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:17,326
- You want to see something sick?
- Please don't do that.

833
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,494
You want to see something sick?

834
01:39:18,578 --> 01:39:19,662
Please don't do this.

835
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:20,872
Hey. Please don't do it.

836
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,253
Why are you doing this to me?

837
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:30,047
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

838
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:32,133
- You're fucking hurting me.
- Then don't fight.

839
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:56,407
Sorry.

840
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,034
It's okay.

841
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:05,666
It's okay.

842
01:40:18,221 --> 01:40:19,347
It's okay.

843
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:21,974
I don't want you to go.

844
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:28,189
God, we wasted so many days.

845
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:29,857
Why didn't you give me a sign?

846
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:31,817
- I did. I did.
- You didn't give me a sign.

847
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:32,985
When?

848
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,780
You remember
when we were playing volleyball

849
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:37,657
and I touched you?

850
01:40:39,325 --> 01:40:43,037
Just to show you that I liked you?

851
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:46,582
And the way you reacted
made me feel like I'd molested you.

852
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:47,959
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

853
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,086
I just decided
I should keep my distance.

854
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,297
I don't know.

855
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,929
I come out here for hours
almost every night.

856
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:02,431
I didn't know that.

857
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:06,561
That's funny, I...

858
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:08,980
I thought that...

859
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:11,274
Yeah, I know what you thought.

860
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:13,359
Stop. Stop.

861
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:52,189
"For Oliver.

862
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:54,650
"From Elio."

863
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,203
Elio?

864
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:20,009
You disappeared for three days.

865
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:26,182
I had to work.

866
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,769
You completely disappeared.

867
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:33,189
Yeah, I don't know. I just...

868
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:37,568
I had a lot to do.

869
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:48,913
Am I your girl?

870
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:14,647
Oliver has to go to Bergamo
for a few days.

871
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:15,856
Oh?

872
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,525
Research at the university.

873
01:43:18,818 --> 01:43:21,529
Then he'll fly home from Linate.

874
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:23,906
But what about Elio?

875
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:29,161
Maybe it could be nice
for the two of them

876
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:31,080
to get away for a couple of days, no?

877
01:43:35,418 --> 01:43:36,669
What do you think?

878
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:41,006
You know you've been
our favorite student?

879
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,426
- You must come back.
- You sure you're not just saying that?

880
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:45,553
- Oliver.
- Thank you very much, Professor.

881
01:43:47,513 --> 01:43:49,181
Oh, man.

882
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:52,476
Please, please come back soon.

883
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,395
Come back? I'm just going home to pack.
I'm moving here.

884
01:43:56,021 --> 01:43:57,148
You're welcome.

885
01:43:58,315 --> 01:43:59,400
Oh, well...

886
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:02,153
- Thank you guys so much.
- Of course.

887
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:03,571
Oliver, Oliver.

888
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:06,282
- Come back.
- It's been...

889
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:07,908
Come here, come here.

890
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,369
It's been amazing. Thank you guys.

891
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,539
Well, later, Perlmans.

892
01:44:13,622 --> 01:44:16,000
Later. Later, later, later.

893
01:44:26,051 --> 01:44:28,262
Tell Elio to call when you get there.

894
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:33,684
Oh, no.

895
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,952
Come for dinner tonight.

896
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,287
Bring Marzia.

897
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:56,123
Bye, darling.

898
01:45:04,173 --> 01:45:05,716
- What?
- Nothing.

899
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,134
- What?
- Nothing.

900
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:21,023
<i>Oh, to see without my eyes</i>

901
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:26,487
<i>The first time that you kissed me</i>

902
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:29,865
<i>Boundless by the time I cried</i>

903
01:45:31,033 --> 01:45:34,912
<i>I built your walls around me</i>

904
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,163
Yes!

905
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,791
<i>White noise
What an awful sound</i>

906
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:41,210
Oliver!

907
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:43,170
Elio!

908
01:45:43,963 --> 01:45:45,548
Elio!

909
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:52,805
<i>Hand of God, deliver me</i>

910
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:56,851
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

911
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:59,562
<i>The first time that you touched me</i>

912
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:02,398
- Oliver!
- Elio!

913
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:05,442
<i>Oh, will wonders never cease?</i>

914
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:11,824
<i>Blessed be the mystery of love</i>

915
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:26,839
<i>Lord, I no longer believe</i>

916
01:46:28,465 --> 01:46:29,675
Yes!

917
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:33,262
<i>Drowned in living waters</i>

918
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:36,599
<i>Cursed by the love that I received</i>

919
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:42,146
<i>From my brother's daughter</i>

920
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:45,441
<i>Like Hephaestion who died</i>

921
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:51,155
<i>Alexander's lover</i>

922
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:55,284
<i>Now I'm prone to misery</i>

923
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:57,494
<i>The birthmark on your...</i>

924
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:12,718
Oh, God.

925
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:41,872
<i>And I'm feeling low</i>

926
01:47:41,956 --> 01:47:46,961
<i>Understand I'm feeling low</i>

927
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,149
You hear that?

928
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:12,194
Wait, wait, wait.

929
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:16,198
No, no, no, it's this way.

930
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:18,367
Come on. Come on. You're missing it.

931
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:20,327
Come on.

932
01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:29,795
Don't stop.

933
01:48:29,878 --> 01:48:32,798
<i>A kiss is not enough...</i>

934
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:34,717
This. This.

935
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,343
This. You.

936
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:37,761
You are...

937
01:48:37,845 --> 01:48:39,596
<i>Love my way</i>

938
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,766
<i>It's a new road</i>

939
01:48:43,809 --> 01:48:46,186
<i>I follow...</i>

940
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:47,813
If you'll excuse me...

941
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:49,898
Just one second.

942
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,234
One second!

943
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:56,864
<i>They'd dearly make us pay</i>

944
01:48:56,947 --> 01:49:00,409
<i>For laughing in their faces</i>

945
01:49:00,492 --> 01:49:03,620
<i>And making it our way</i>

946
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:08,500
<i>There's emptiness behind their eyes</i>

947
01:49:08,584 --> 01:49:11,628
<i>There's dust in all their hearts</i>

948
01:49:11,837 --> 01:49:13,839
I saw them last year.

949
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:17,176
Richard Butler... fantastic!

950
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:21,013
Really? We saw them in concert too.

951
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:23,932
We hitchhiked to London.

952
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:26,351
What'd she say?

953
01:49:26,435 --> 01:49:29,605
<i>It's a new road</i>

954
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:32,691
<i>I follow</i>

955
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:36,028
<i>Where my mind goes</i>

956
01:49:38,155 --> 01:49:39,990
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

957
01:51:22,092 --> 01:51:23,468
Did you get your passport?

958
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:26,722
You get your passport?

959
01:53:49,323 --> 01:53:50,532
Mafalda?

960
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:52,659
Mom?

961
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:55,203
Yeah, it's me.

962
01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:58,915
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...

963
01:53:59,624 --> 01:54:00,959
in Clusone.

964
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,546
Listen, Mom, can you...

965
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:08,133
Can you come get me, Mom?

966
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:00,060
How are you?

967
01:55:00,727 --> 01:55:01,895
Good.

968
01:55:06,858 --> 01:55:09,111
I read the book you bought me.

969
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:11,571
The poems...

970
01:55:11,655 --> 01:55:13,156
They're really beautiful.

971
01:55:13,281 --> 01:55:16,326
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

972
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:21,498
I'm sorry, excuse me...

973
01:55:21,623 --> 01:55:23,333
that you're sad.

974
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:27,546
I'm saying that because
I wanted to tell you

975
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:29,339
I'm not mad at you.

976
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:32,259
Not at all.

977
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:41,184
I love you, Elio.

978
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:47,941
Stay friends?

979
01:55:49,985 --> 01:55:51,319
For life?

980
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:53,405
For life?

981
01:57:01,389 --> 01:57:02,599
Missed you at dinner.

982
01:57:26,748 --> 01:57:28,208
So...

983
01:57:30,001 --> 01:57:31,044
Welcome home.

984
01:57:31,545 --> 01:57:32,546
Thanks.

985
01:57:34,089 --> 01:57:35,882
- Oliver enjoyed the trip?
- Yeah.

986
01:57:36,925 --> 01:57:37,968
I think he did.

987
01:57:39,344 --> 01:57:40,804
You two had a nice friendship.

988
01:57:43,098 --> 01:57:44,266
Yeah.

989
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:53,191
You're too smart not to know how rare,

990
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:58,071
how special what you two had was.

991
01:58:00,824 --> 01:58:02,867
Oliver was Oliver.

992
01:58:06,371 --> 01:58:08,290
Because it was him.

993
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:11,293
Because it was me.

994
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:13,545
Oliver may be very intelligent but...

995
01:58:14,462 --> 01:58:16,047
He was more than intelligent.

996
01:58:18,258 --> 01:58:19,301
What you two had,

997
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:24,222
had everything and nothing
to do with intelligence.

998
01:58:24,889 --> 01:58:25,974
He was good.

999
01:58:28,310 --> 01:58:31,229
You're both lucky
to have found each other

1000
01:58:32,314 --> 01:58:33,898
because you, too, are good...

1001
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:42,616
I think he was better than...

1002
01:58:44,576 --> 01:58:46,202
I think he was better than me.

1003
01:58:49,331 --> 01:58:51,207
I'm sure he'd say
the same thing about you.

1004
01:58:51,291 --> 01:58:53,668
Yeah. He'd say the same thing.

1005
01:58:54,628 --> 01:58:55,879
It flatters you both.

1006
01:58:59,883 --> 01:59:01,259
And when you least expect it,

1007
01:59:03,428 --> 01:59:06,723
nature has cunning ways
of finding our weakest spot.

1008
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:13,063
Just remember, I am here.

1009
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:23,031
Right now,
you may not wanna feel anything,

1010
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:26,534
maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

1011
01:59:30,372 --> 01:59:33,166
And maybe it's not to me
you'd want to speak about these things

1012
01:59:35,585 --> 01:59:38,380
but feel something you obviously did.

1013
01:59:42,676 --> 01:59:44,803
Look, you had a beautiful friendship.

1014
01:59:46,513 --> 01:59:48,014
Maybe more than a friendship.

1015
01:59:49,724 --> 01:59:51,017
And I envy you.

1016
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:57,524
In my place, most parents would hope
the whole thing goes away.

1017
01:59:58,358 --> 02:00:00,610
Pray their sons land on their feet,

1018
02:00:03,071 --> 02:00:04,614
but I am not such a parent.

1019
02:00:07,826 --> 02:00:11,329
We rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster,

1020
02:00:12,455 --> 02:00:14,708
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.

1021
02:00:16,418 --> 02:00:19,587
And have less to offer,
each time we start with someone new.

1022
02:00:22,132 --> 02:00:24,008
But to make yourself feel nothing

1023
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:26,678
so as not to feel anything.

1024
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:29,889
What a waste.

1025
02:00:37,856 --> 02:00:39,190
Have I spoken out of turn?

1026
02:00:44,195 --> 02:00:45,613
And I'll say one more thing,

1027
02:00:49,492 --> 02:00:50,702
it'll clear the air.

1028
02:00:53,705 --> 02:00:55,123
I may have come close

1029
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:58,209
but I never had what you two have.

1030
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:04,382
Something always held me back

1031
02:01:05,759 --> 02:01:07,594
or stood in the way.

1032
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,684
How you live your life is your business.

1033
02:01:14,976 --> 02:01:17,520
Just remember,

1034
02:01:19,606 --> 02:01:22,859
our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once,

1035
02:01:25,987 --> 02:01:28,823
and before you know it,
your heart's worn out.

1036
02:01:29,574 --> 02:01:31,659
And as for your body,

1037
02:01:32,035 --> 02:01:34,162
there comes a point
when no one looks at it

1038
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:37,499
much less wants to come near it.

1039
02:01:41,169 --> 02:01:47,467
Right now, there's sorrow, pain.

1040
02:01:48,009 --> 02:01:49,344
Don't kill it,

1041
02:01:51,012 --> 02:01:53,681
and with it, the joy you felt.

1042
02:02:05,777 --> 02:02:07,153
Does Mom know?

1043
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:14,494
I don't think she does.

1044
02:03:19,309 --> 02:03:21,895
- Have you been to the Gaverine?
- Yes.

1045
02:03:29,193 --> 02:03:30,528
Latkes.

1046
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:33,489
- May I?
- Happy Hanukkah!

1047
02:03:33,615 --> 02:03:34,699
To you too.

1048
02:03:55,386 --> 02:03:56,846
She looks a bit weak.

1049
02:04:04,729 --> 02:04:06,981
She comes highly recommended by...

1050
02:04:08,066 --> 02:04:12,070
Her special area of study is...

1051
02:04:15,490 --> 02:04:16,741
I'll get it.

1052
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:21,663
Hello?

1053
02:04:21,746 --> 02:04:23,456
<i>Elio, you there?</i>

1054
02:04:24,582 --> 02:04:26,668
- Hi.
<i>- Hey.</i>

1055
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:29,045
- How are you.
<i>- I'm good.</i>

1056
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:30,797
<i>I'm good. How are you?</i>

1057
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,548
<i>- How are your parents?</i>
- I'm good. They're fine.

1058
02:04:33,132 --> 02:04:34,258
<i>Good.</i>

1059
02:04:36,094 --> 02:04:37,220
I miss you.

1060
02:04:38,638 --> 02:04:39,806
<i>I miss you too.</i>

1061
02:04:41,057 --> 02:04:42,100
<i>Very much.</i>

1062
02:04:46,312 --> 02:04:48,982
<i>- I have some news.</i>
- News?

1063
02:04:51,818 --> 02:04:53,403
What, you're getting married?

1064
02:04:53,903 --> 02:04:55,071
I suppose.

1065
02:04:57,448 --> 02:04:59,993
<i>I might be getting married
next spring, yeah.</i>

1066
02:05:03,579 --> 02:05:05,248
You never said anything.

1067
02:05:07,375 --> 02:05:09,544
<i>Been off and on for three years.</i>

1068
02:05:13,589 --> 02:05:14,924
That's wonderful news.

1069
02:05:17,135 --> 02:05:18,261
<i>Do you mind?</i>

1070
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:26,769
- Oliver.
- Oliver.

1071
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:28,855
- Oliver.
<i>- Hey, hey, hey.</i>

1072
02:05:28,938 --> 02:05:30,231
Darling, when are you coming back?

1073
02:05:30,857 --> 02:05:32,150
<i>I wish I was.</i>

1074
02:05:32,483 --> 02:05:35,903
You caught us in the process of choosing
the new you for next summer.

1075
02:05:36,154 --> 02:05:38,656
- And guess what? He's a she.
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

1076
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:41,451
<i>Speaking of she's, I'm calling
to tell you guys I got engaged.</i>

1077
02:05:43,411 --> 02:05:45,538
Wonderful!

1078
02:05:45,621 --> 02:05:47,498
- Congratulations.
- Mazel tov!

1079
02:05:47,582 --> 02:05:49,667
- Congratulations, Oliver.
<i>- Thank you, thank you, thank you.</i>

1080
02:05:49,751 --> 02:05:53,129
Listen, we'll leave you...
We'll let you speak to Elio.

1081
02:05:53,337 --> 02:05:55,423
- Happy Hanukkah!
<i>- Happy Hanukkah!</i>

1082
02:05:55,506 --> 02:05:56,632
Bye, sweetheart.

1083
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:05,808
They know about us.

1084
02:06:07,268 --> 02:06:08,436
<i>I figured.</i>

1085
02:06:10,897 --> 02:06:12,148
How?

1086
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:15,777
<i>Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.</i>

1087
02:06:17,195 --> 02:06:19,113
<i>He made me feel
like I was a part of the family.</i>

1088
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:20,990
<i>Almost like a son-in-law.</i>

1089
02:06:23,201 --> 02:06:24,327
<i>You're so lucky.</i>

1090
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:28,706
<i>My father would have carted me off
to a correctional facility.</i>

1091
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,502
Elio.

1092
02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:40,176
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.

1093
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:45,348
<i>Oliver.</i>

1094
02:06:48,226 --> 02:06:49,769
<i>I remember everything.</i>

1095
02:10:54,638 --> 02:10:55,931
Elio.

1096
02:10:58,184 --> 02:10:59,185
Elio.
