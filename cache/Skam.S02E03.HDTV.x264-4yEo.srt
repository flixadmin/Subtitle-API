1
00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:06,661
Did you hear William beat up
someone from Hansen this weekend?

2
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:09,144
You're going on a date with
William... for Vilde's sake?

3
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:11,759
for Vilde's sake?

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,724
It was good that you
apologised to Vilde.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,560
About her not being good enough for you.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,053
I hope it was a smart plan.

7
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:26,108
Because now she's keen on me again.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm not keen on her.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,821
Where are you?

10
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,145
We have to go.

11
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:43,439
SATURDAY, 11:05 AM

12
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:00,231
Eva?

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,407
Eva!

14
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:13,985
Noora!

15
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,575
Hi.

16
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:17,493
Hi.

17
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,751
I slept here.

18
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:24,900
I can see, you know.

19
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:31,655
Who is he?

20
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:36,975
- His name is Håvard.
- Halvor.

21
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:43,706
How was your date yesterday?

22
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,669
Eh... fine.

23
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,021
How was he?

24
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,885
- Nice.
- Nice? You have to tell me more!

25
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:06,276
- Good morning!
- Hey birthday boy!

26
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:09,830
You know what?

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,452
I think I'm still drunk. A little.

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,017
Could you be a little bit more quiet?

29
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:27,457
Okay, Linn! We'll be quiet all day!

30
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,810
I need some water.

31
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:44,376
Eskild!

32
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,267
What did you say to Eva?

33
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,212
I didn't say anything.

34
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,463
I said you'd gone on a
Tinder date with a guy.

35
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,309
Tinder?!

36
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:01,180
Hello, what world do you live in?

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,213
I had to say something about

38
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:06,090
why you weren't out
celebrating my birthday with me.

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,496
Eskild, it wasn't your birthday.

40
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,820
You can't just hang out with
my friends when I'm not here.

41
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,700
We chatted a little on Facebook.
She said she wanted to party.

42
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:20,981
I wanted to party too, so...

43
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:25,438
Eskild, you...

44
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,467
Are you jealous?

45
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,868
Jealous that I'm
taking all your friends?

46
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,480
Because I'm popular? Because I'm hot?

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,900
Because...

48
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,888
- I won't take your place in your friends gang.
- I'm trying to be serious!

49
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:46,803
You are hugely popular and
so funny! Pretty! Smart! Good!

50
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,465
- Do you need a hug?
- No! I don't need a hug.

51
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,408
Bear hug.

52
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,466
Is it better now? Do you want a hug?

53
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,816
You... Are you okay now?

54
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,540
- Just take me serioulsy!
- Yes, I am taking you seriously!

55
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:11,771
- MONDAY, 11:45 AM
- The Yakuza-boys were like:

56
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,663
Hey, guys! Stop, you're killing him!

57
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:19,120
He sat on top and hit and
hit him, but he screamed:

58
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,973
Haven't you had enough now?!

59
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:25,049
He just lay there and
wasn't even able to respond.

60
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:26,969
He just spit up blood.

61
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:28,960
Did you see the video?

62
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:33,540
It was so rough!

63
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,154
The Yakuza-guys fought with a knife.

64
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:43,608
He found his mother dead in the bathtub.

65
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:47,502
After that something snapped in him.

66
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:50,656
And so I wrote to him:

67
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:54,310
Heard there was a fight
on Friday. Are you okay?

68
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,560
He didn't answer. I
was terribly worried.

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,880
I heard that he wasn't even there.

70
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:05,291
- Who did you hear that from?
- I was talking to Iben,

71
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:08,653
and he told me it was only Chris

72
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:11,036
and a few others who were there.

73
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,149
That's why it was really unfair.

74
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,020
Because the Yakuza-boys were around 20.

75
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,780
They were looking for William,
but William wasn't there.

76
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:22,660
So they were beaten up...

77
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,020
While William was at
home fucking some girl.

78
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,249
What girl?

79
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:35,148
It's just a rumor. I
don't know if it's true.

80
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:40,308
- Did William reply?
- No, he didn't reply. So I sent:

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,701
"William, could you answer,
so I know you're alive?

82
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,589
I'm terribly worried."

83
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:49,913
Then he replied at
11.33: "Alive. I'm alive."

84
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,120
Has anyone seen them?

85
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,332
Chris is definitely
still at the hospital.

86
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,480
Isn't that William's car?

87
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:55,035
Did Iben say more about
the girl William was with?

88
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:03,308
- WEDNESDAY, 12:55 PM
- It could be Olivia from the third year.

89
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:07,158
Or Marte from 1STA.

90
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,540
No, she's a bit strange.

91
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,602
What's the name of the girl
that came out of the cafeteria?

92
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,400
She's quite pretty.

93
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,722
Or maybe the dark girl?

94
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:24,400
Isabel?

95
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,895
- Wasn't she with Jonas...
- Hey!

96
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,607
It could be Anja from 2STB,

97
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:34,880
but she isn't really his type.

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,844
She is a bit...

99
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,420
- thick.
- Huh?

100
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,340
You have to stop now. She's fat?!

101
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,757
Not fat-fat. I'm just saying
William likes skinny girls.

102
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,360
That's the dumbest
thing I've heard, Vilde.

103
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,440
I'm just saying that boys
like different things.

104
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,472
Some like small butts,
others like big ones.

105
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,278
Not everyone has to be super skinny, but

106
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:03,226
William likes girls who are model thin.

107
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,978
Like you.

108
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,592
If it's true that
William's dating a girl,

109
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:13,580
she's definitely really skinny.

110
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,007
It's not to diss Anja.

111
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:17,642
Gum?

112
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,111
I'm going to find out
who it is on Friday.

113
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,660
Friday... ?

114
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,282
If William's actually dating someone,

115
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:47,508
she's definitely coming to his party.

116
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,740
Party... ?

117
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,040
Oh yeah! We can't drink at my place.

118
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,800
Mom's coming home.

119
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,980
Can we do it at your place?

120
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,516
Eh, yeah. But I won't
be at William's party.

121
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,132
Why not?

122
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,160
Because I can't on Friday.

123
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:13,719
You never want to go out anymore.

124
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,060
You didn't go out last weekend, either.

125
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,733
There was no one who
could go out last weekend.

126
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,031
Is there someone you're hiding from us?

127
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:33,267
A little girlfriend, maybe?

128
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,146
Bring her to William's party.

129
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:40,478
Seriously? I can?

130
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:44,883
- That's so amazing, Vilde!
- Maybe she can come to the cabin?

131
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,782
A lesbian couple in Hemsedal.
That would be so cozy!

132
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,540
Right, Eva?

133
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,120
Yeah!

134
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,360
- What do you have now?
- Chemistry.

135
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,667
I have class in the B-building.

136
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:02,660
Bye!

137
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,733
Vilde...

138
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,915
Fucking hell, it's you! Isn't it?

139
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,312
You're dating William!

140
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:26,037
Eva, before you freak out here...

141
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:27,714
Fucking hell.

142
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,306
Fucking hell!

143
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:34,067
Hallo, okay. We've been on one
date and I did it for Vilde.

144
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,843
Why for Vilde?

145
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,200
Because the stuff he said
to her during Christmas,

146
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:44,017
he just said it because I
promised I'd go on a date with him.

147
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,100
Are you kidding me?

148
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:51,740
Am I on an episode of Gossip Girl?

149
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,732
Eva, you know I hate that show.

150
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,335
***

151
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,020
This is totally sick!

152
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:11,400
But you don't like him at all, right?

153
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,520
Eva, it's William we're
talking about here.

154
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,993
- So how was your date then?
- Weird!

155
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,620
Do you realise now why
I can't go to the party?

156
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:31,855
If William starts to
make a move on me...

157
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,409
Vilde will start to realise it.

158
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:36,205
***

159
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,040
I just hope she doesn't
start asking him about it.

160
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,915
I don't trust him at all.

161
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:47,436
Fucking hell.

162
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:49,055
This is Gossip Girl.

163
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,021
Okay, maybe a budget version.
But it's fucking Gossip Girl!

164
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,880
I've had it with all the
Gossip Girl references now.

165
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,600
Funny!

166
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:03,240
Noora, you're impressive.

167
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,803
Thanks.

168
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,852
FRIDAY, 9:22 PM

169
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:23,040
I don't understand how
Eskild can party so much.

170
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,412
I think it's lovely to
just be at home and relax.

171
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,713
Don't you agree?

172
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,890
Hm-hm.

173
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:38,819
Does school suck?

174
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:52,929
I hated high school.

175
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:55,754
It truly sucked.

176
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,640
The teachers had no sympathy.

177
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,170
"The curriculum is
the same for everyone."

178
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,205
Easy for them to say.

179
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,634
***

180
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,782
We are the performance generation.

181
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,920
We have it a little worse than they had.

182
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,677
At first I was like that as well.

183
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,520
"Fuck this shit."

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,833
"I need a year off."

185
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:49,402
<i>Drama between Vilde and William.</i>

186
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:52,221
<i>Vilde is crying in the bathroom.</i>

187
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,920
Since you're already standing up...

188
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:40,280
could you hand me a Fun light?

189
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:10,193
Noora! Hi!

190
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,153
What happened? Where's Vilde?

191
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,335
She ran away.

192
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:23,517
But you're here now!

193
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,834
But... what happened?

194
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,777
You said there was some drama
between Vilde and William.

195
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,738
Shit!

196
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:39,511
She's so in love with William,

197
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:42,478
but I don't think he's in love with her.

198
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,153
They didn't say anything about me?

199
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:50,293
They said nothing?

200
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,156
- No.
- No?

201
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,100
Shhh. Shhh!

202
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,169
You were on a date!

203
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,875
***

204
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:07,281
I don't know, but I have to...

205
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:09,587
Yeah, you have to go say hi!

206
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:12,610
Halvor... and Jacob!

207
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:18,980
He is so sweet. He's
almost my boyfriend.

208
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,770
No! Jonas! You came!

209
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:36,840
We are best forever, right?

210
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:39,678
I love you so fucking
much. Did you know that?

211
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,601
I've said it a few times already.

212
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:54,078
Drink a little, guys.

213
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,644
You should meet girls.

214
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:02,116
***

215
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,080
Where are you going?

216
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,400
- To the toilet.
- You can't leave her.

217
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,444
It'll take two seconds.

218
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:22,153
***

219
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,363
I'll be back soon, okay?

220

***

221
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,996
- You came.
- What did you say to Vilde?

222
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:17,556
- What?
- She walked out crying.

223
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:21,405
She wanted to hook up,
but I wasn't interested.

224
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,551
You didn't say anything about me?

225
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,556
About you? Who are you?

226
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,560
I'm kidding. Of course I
didn't say anything about you.

227
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,357
Fuck off!

228
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,065
What the hell is going on here?

229
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:49,317
- Who are you?
- William.

230
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:51,471
William? Axel.

231
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:55,407
The party you're having here...
You have to put an end to it.

232
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,478
We've gotten complaints
from your neighbors.

233
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:05,307
Music off, and people out.

234
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:08,423
Everyone. Great.

235
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,148
Eva?

236
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:16,411
Hello!

237
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,736
The party is over, ladies and gentlemen.

238
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:29,319
William, I have to
borrow your cellphone.

239
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,615
Eva left with all my stuff.

240
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:20,640
Hi Eskild. I have lost
everything. My phone and keys.

241
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:23,809
Call me when you get this message.

242
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:25,734
On this number.

243
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,179
Chris.

244
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,708
It's time to leave.

245
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,391
***

246
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:15,013
***

247
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:18,596
Are you coming with me?

248
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,690
Kidding...

249
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,360
Did you get to her?

250
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:33,800
No.

251
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,422
But I left a message on the voice mail

252
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:39,440
of someone I live with so...

253
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,845
He'll definitely call back soon.

254
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,363
When are your parents coming home?

255
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,051
They're not coming home.

256
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,592
Where are they?

257
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,175
Dad lives in London and mom
lives on Snarøya with a new man.

258
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:09,161
You live here by yourself?

259
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,776
More or less.

260
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:13,183
I don't drink.

261
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:15,520
Shocking...

262
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:20,777
Don't you have siblings?

263
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,181
My brother studies in Stockholm.

264
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:29,173
Do you want something else?

265
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:34,983
Do you have... cocoa?

266
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,509
Baking cocoa?

267
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:43,946
Yeah, I don't know why I got it.

268
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:47,906
The lady at the check out
got it for me so it was okay.

269
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,500
It says something about
dark cocoa drink here.

270
00:22:50,712 --> 00:22:52,945
Extra dark and powerful cocoa.

271
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,088
Five tablespoons

272
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:03,600
of Freia baking cocoa.

273
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,817
Four to five tablespoons of sugar.

274
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,625
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

275
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,388
- Don't you remember how to make it?
- I do,

276
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:15,158
but I just want to do it right.

277
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,008
Okay.

278
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:58,243
Why don't you live with your mom?

279
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,831
Because my mom is a cunt.

280
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,760
Hey...

281
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:06,964
What?

282
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,067
- It's still your mom.
- So what?

283
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:14,040
Should I not be honest?

284
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,927
Sure, but you don't need to be

285
00:24:16,952 --> 00:24:20,271
a complete misogynist about it.

286
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:23,700
So you only want me to be honest
if it's politically correct?

287
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,580
Has Eskild called?

288
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,280
No.

289
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,420
You have to check your cellphone.

290
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,267
Fuck.

291
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:12,459
Do you want one?

292
00:25:13,237 --> 00:25:15,390
Oh my god, seriously?

293
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,968
Can I have it?

294
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:23,101
Do I look good?

295
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:28,572
It's the sweater of all sweaters.
Many at school have acquired it.

296
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:30,719
Insanely popular.

297
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:34,040
Then I would've been just like
you. That's the dream, right?

298
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,837
A guitar too?

299
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,360
Have we really come to this point?

300
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:43,877
There's nothing missing
then, so to speak.

301
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,060
Do you play for girls?

302
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,521
So sweet.

303
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,960
- Sweet, indeed.
- Yeah.

304
00:25:57,263 --> 00:26:00,880
Do you play for them
before you take them to bed?

305
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:02,877
You have to, right?

306
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:04,981
You have to do something.

307
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,080
- What do you play?
- I don't play for girls.

308
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,580
Yes you do. What else? Oof.

309
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,761
There's sound! It's a real one, then?

310
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,840
You obviously play for girls.
I know it. What do you play?

311
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,963
Is it country?

312
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:28,454
I know what you play.

313
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:30,436

I think it's for you.

348
00:29:19,697 --> 00:29:22,820
- Hello, where are you?
- At home. What's up?

349
00:29:22,843 --> 00:29:27,360
I lost all my stuff. Keys,
cellphone, everything.

350
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:31,117
- Okay, so... That sucks.
- It really sucks!

351
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,656
At least I'm at home now.

352
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,031
Just call from downstairs
and I'll let you in.

353
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,859
Yeah...

354
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,298
Yeah okay. Bye.

355
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,961
Is he home?

356
00:29:56,495 --> 00:30:00,412
Eh, no. No. He...

357
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:06,149
he is in the city with some people.

358
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,195
So...

359
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,240
I can sleep on the couch.

360
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,654
Oh, no.

361
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,756
This works, right? Just...

362
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:39,614
just stick to your
side of the bed, okay?

363
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,140
It's my bed, so both sides are mine.

364
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,560
No. That's not how it
works here now, William.

365
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,419
You may not be used to this, but...

366
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,660
There are sides to this bed.

367
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,179
This is your side. This is my side.

368
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,107
I suggest that we build a little border.

369
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:06,687
So don't come over

370
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:10,442
and invade my personal space.

371
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:21,715
Are you going to sleep
with all your clothes on?

372
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,249
Yes.

373
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:27,583
Okay.

374
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,660
What do you want for breakfast tomorrow?

375
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,088
I won't be eating breakfast here.

376
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,746
Eggs and bacon? Great.

377
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,880
You are the biggest cliché I've met.

378
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,088
Ever!

379
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,424
I was never validated as a child.

380
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,671
Mom never came to graduation.

381
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:09,999
Dad never complimented my drawings.

382
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,378
Okay.

383
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,485
But you like me for it.

384
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,743
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do. You like me.

385
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,191
What is it?

386
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:44,789
Is there someone you have to beat up?

387
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:48,760
It's a message from Eskild.

388
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,988
He doesn't want to stay up and
wait for you any longer and wonders

389
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:56,047
when you're coming home.

390
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,786
I'll answer: Noora is

391
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:10,027
so keen on me... that
she failed to get away.

392
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:16,480
- Excuse me? No! You're not writing that!
- Excuse me, you're on my side now!

393
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,019
- Can you... please get over on your side?
- Can I?

394
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,580
That's your side of the bed.

395
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,260
And this is my side of the bed.

396
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:35,187
***

397
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:37,438
***

398
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:42,539
So we're going to let the
cellphone and pillows be.

399
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,149
Let go, let go, let go!

400
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,322
Just write that I'm
coming home tomorrow.

401
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,600
You like me.

402
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,360
Goodnight, Willhelm.

403
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,241
Goodnight, Noora.

404
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:42,112
