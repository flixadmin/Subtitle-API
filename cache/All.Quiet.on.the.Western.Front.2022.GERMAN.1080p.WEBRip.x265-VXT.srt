Attack!

3
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,083
Attack!

4
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,750
Go! Come on! Faster!

5
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,000
Heinrich, come on! Forwards! Come now!

6
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,791
To the ladders!

7
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,291
On my command!

8
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,583
Forwards!

9
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,250

-So?

25
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,875
Mhm.

26
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,375
-Well then?
-I don't know.

27
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,375
-Does he know we're all going?
-Yes, of course.

28
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,458
Staying at home?

29
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,916
My God, you're tied
to your mother's apron strings, my friend.

30
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,291
Give me it, I'll scribble something.

31
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,291
-It has to be signed by his parents.
-Well, someone. Come on, pass it here.

32
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,583
-That won't work, they'll find out.
-How will they?

33
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,083
Well?

34
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,875
Is his mother a pen pal of theirs?

35
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,541
-Give me your pen.
-Ah, I'm sorry.

36
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,458
Oh!

37
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,375
Ludwig.

38
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,125
You mustn't. Your father will hit you.

39
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,125
Have you got a better idea?
I'm not being left behind here.

40
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,583
<i>Jawohl!</i>

41
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,833
Congratulations, Private Bäumer.
We're going to the front.

42
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,083
A dead man walking.

43
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,458
You stand here
on the threshold of existence.

44
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,375
Remember this moment.

45
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,791
It is a great moment.

46
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:03,000
For in years to come, you will be judged
based on what you dared to become today.

47
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,875
The iron youth of Germany.

48
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,875
My friends,

49
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,166
we are fortunate
to be alive at a great time.

50
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,708
Your deeds will be the water

51
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,791
nourishing the growth
of a strong and noble route.

52
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,000
Stand still and listen up, Leinemann!

53
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,958
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

54
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,458
I am certain that I will see
most of you again soon, here at home.

55
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,750
Your sword returned to its scabbard
with honour and respect.

56
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,541
A cross crafted from iron
proudly displayed upon your chest.

57
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,791
However, take heed of this.

58
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,458
In the darkest of hours,
let me assure you it will happen,

59
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,208
that prior to an attack,
you will harbour doubts.

60
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,666
But this is not the time
to concede to any mental weakness.

61
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:56,875
Any unsteadiness, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the fatherland!

62
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,833
For modern war is like a game of chess.

63
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,416
It is never about an individual soldier.

64
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,833
Our only care
is for the entirety of the body.

65
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,541
You have the chance to earn the right
to wear the uniforms you have been given.

66
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,625
And by going to the front line
in Flanders, we'll pierce the enemy.

67
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:17,416
And then you will, in a few short weeks,

68
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,125
finally march on Paris!

69
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,666
Yeah!

70
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,041
Our future,

71
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,333
the future of <i>Deutschland</i>,

72
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,125
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

73
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,833
My friends, that is you, you see!

74
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,875
Yeah!

75
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,916
Therefore, off to the camps

76
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,666
for the Kaiser, God, and the fatherland!

77
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,250
Yeah!

78
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,166
Next.

79
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,250
Next.

80
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,791
Next.

81
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,208
-Next.
-Next.

82
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,041
Bäumer, Paul.
53 Wiesengrund.

83
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,708
Born November 18th, 1899. Correct?

84
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,666
<i>Jawohl</i>, sir.

85
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,375

86
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:16,958
Paul.

87
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,291
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

88
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,208
Yes.

89
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,125
Is everything alright?

90
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,708
Yes. I'm eager to get on with it.

91
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,458
Move along.

92
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,583
Here he comes.

93
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,375
-Emil Hermann.
-Name and address.

94
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,833
-And the next.
-Excuse me.

95
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,541
It already belongs to someone.

96
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:44,083
Ah, yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

97
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,791
Here. It's yours.

98
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,583
Thank you.

99
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,416
I remember it, you were.

100
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,833
Oh, Ludwig, will you be snatching away
all the ladies from us now?

101
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah.

102
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,000
My concern is that you don't shoot us.

103
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,375
She won't wait, Franz.

104
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:28,875
She won't do it.

105
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,291
You lady killer, you.

Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in a godforsaken shithole.

114
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,833
And you'll kindly do so with a clean G98.

115
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,458
You will pamper it.

116
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,000
You will love it.

117
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,208
And damn it,
you will keep it as immaculate

Welcome

-Go on! Over there on the right!
-Damn it, what happened?

129
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,291
I have orders to hand over the company
to the front by 6:00 p.m.

130
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,875
That you may, but on foot.

131
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,916
You must give us the trucks, lieutenant.

132
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,458
With all due respect, I have orders--

133

Take the orders
and stick them up your arse.

134

I have 40 men here
who are dying in the mud.

135
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,875
Get out right now, will you?

136
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,000
Everyone, get up.

137
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,291
Come on, get on with it.

138
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,125
You heard the staff surgeon.

139
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,166
Faster, soldiers. Don't fall asleep here.

140
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,708
Keep moving.

141
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,541
-Franz Müller, correct?
-Yes.

142
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,125
The supreme army command

143
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,916
expects you to survive
at least six weeks of being here.

144
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Would you like that,
in six weeks, to still be alive?

145
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,375
-<i>Jawohl</i>, sir.
-Then walk quicker

146
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,541
and stop dragging your feet
like you would do at home.

147
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,958
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

148
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,125
Hurry up.

149
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,708
We're not at a tea party here.

150
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,125
Gas!

151
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,958
-Gas!
-Gas!

152
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,666
Gas!

153
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,958
Gas!

154
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,833
Gas masks on!

155
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,458
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

156
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,875
If the French could aim better,

157
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:18,291
you could scrape us all off the road
with a spoon and bury us in a saucepan.

158
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,250
But one thing
that's as certain as amen in church.

159
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,083
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

160
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,125
Eyes straight ahead.

161
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,666
-Are you deaf?
-No, sir.

162
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,458
I was just trying to put my mask on.

163
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,500
Paul Bäumer,
you will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

164
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,041
You should eat something, man.

165
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,375
Attention! Gas masks off!

166
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,333
Gas masks off!

167
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,500
Not you.

168
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,041
You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

169
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,708
Both you and that useless pig.

170
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,583
Fall in line. March.

171
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,875
Fall in line!

172
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,375
Stay together and keep moving!

173
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,166
Come on, hurry up!

174
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,083
Go!

175
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,166
Come on. Paul, come on.
Give me your knapsack.

176
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,000
Next time, you carry mine.

177
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,250
Congratulations, soldiers.

178
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,166
This is your home now.

179
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,250
Helmets off.

180
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,541
I see the men have been enjoying
themselves in my absence, Steinberger.

181
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,416
We were under barrage all night.

182
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,583
The men are a mess.

183
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,666
I think dry boots
would be a good place to begin.

184
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,791
Oh, you'd rather we all drown then?

185
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,833
Everyone pitch in!
Come on, bail out the trench.

186
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,375
Get in line
to bail the water!

187
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,208
What are you waiting for, Bäumer?

188
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,083
Why are you still loitering here?
Go and help bail out the trenches.

189
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,666
Throw a dog a piece of meat.

190
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,291
Come on, all of you!

191
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,958
It will always snap it up.

192
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,875
Give a man power…

193
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,333
Man is a beast.

194
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,458
Drink.

195
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,375
Katczinsky, come over here.
Give us a hand.

196
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,125
Tonight, it'll be even worse.

197
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,041
Sorry.

198
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:32,875
Forget it.

199
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,458
Somehow, this isn't how I imagined it.

200
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,541
Just shut up, Ludwig.

201
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,375
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

202
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,750
Stick them down your underwear.

203
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,458
It always works for me.

204
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,541
That will make it shoot better,
will it?

205
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,750
-Did you hear that?
-Hear what?

206
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,708
That sound. Listen.

207
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,041
There's nothing there.

208
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,291
Our first French to shoot.

209
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,291
Calm down, Paulchen.

210
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,666
There's someone out there.

211
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:27,791
Who's there?

212
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,250
Hey.

213
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:33,875
Show yourself!

214
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,416
Oh, no, no, no!

215
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,333
I'm hit! I'm hit! I've been hit! Get off!

216
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,375
-No, Paul. No.
-What's going on?

217
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,541
You're fine.

218
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:08,750
What is it?

219
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,333
The others, over there. They shot at me.

220
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,875
They saw the flash of your muzzle.

221
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,208
Huh?

222
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,791
From now on, keep your heads down.

223
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,125
If you don't want to catch
the next bullet with your teeth,

224
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,291
move ten meters to the left.

225
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,125
Shoot, change cover.
Shoot, change cover. Understand?

226
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,708
Yeah.

227
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,291
Come on. Paul.

228
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,083
Take cover! Take cover! Alarm!

229
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,083
Here!

230
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:48,333
Bäumer, come here. Quickly, come on.

231
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,916
Into the bunker!

232
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,875
Inside! Inside! Inside!

233
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,458
"Be careful what you eat."

234
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,000
That's what my mother said.

235
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,125
-We'll always be together, won't we?
-Yeah.

236
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,791
We'll stick together. We'll always be.

237
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:30,166
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I need to go home.

238
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,458
I need to go home.

239
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,208
Creeping barrage.

240
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,208
What?

241
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,416
Every couple of minutes,

242
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,416
the artillery barrage
makes an advance forward.

243
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:04,916
And directly after that,

244
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,583
the infantry moves forward.

245
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,458
What are you saying, exactly?

246
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,250
That's how they come.

247
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,291
Where are you going?

248
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,333
I'll come back.

249
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,125
It's nearly over.

250
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:41,041
-No! Let me go.
-Stay where you are.

251
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,625
-Let me out of here. I want to get out.
-Calm down.

252
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,083
Calm yourself.

253
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,458
No!

254
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,208
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

255
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,875
Out!

256
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,791

258
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,666
Come here, we found Paul!

259
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,333
Paul!

260
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:18,708
Are you alright?

261
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,333
Is everything alright, Paul?

262
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,583
Come on. Paul, come on.

263
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:24,833
I'll help you.

264
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,458
Come on. Get up, will you? Sit down.

265
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,625
Are you injured?

266
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,541
Paul, are you injured?

267
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,583
-Can you hear me?
-We need help over here!

268
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:34,541
-See you later, Paul.
-We'll see you later, Paul.

269
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,250
Go on! Go on!

270
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,208
Here's another one.

271
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,125
We need help!

272
00:28:58,708 --> 00:28:59,541
Steady.

273
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,375
Steady.

274
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:07,541
That's it.

275
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,541
I've got you.

276
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,041
Careful, careful.

277
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,375
Now we're in camp. Sit down.

278
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,291
You're alright.

279
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,166
Nice one. Let's have a look at you.

280
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,500
Hold still, hold still.

281
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:34,958
Yeah, you're going to be alright.

282
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,958
Right, put pressure on it.
Don't let him get up.

283
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,666
Katczinsky, back to work.

284
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,291
And you? Are you injured?

285
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:56,625
No.

286
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,666
Then start gathering.

287
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,416
Man, man, man!

288
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,416
No rest for the wicked.

289

It's the same every day.

290
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,791
Come on! Keep working!

291
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,791

00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,791
<i>-Rends-moi l'oie, ordure!</i>
-Run!

332
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,166
<i>Fumier!</i>

333
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,666
-Just right.
-I told you.

334
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,958
Men, you are heroes.

335
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,666
Shut the door or the others will smell it.

336
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,083
Nice work.

337
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,208
I don't know. How am I
supposed to remember anything?

338
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,625
Come on, use your Prussian brain.

339
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,375
Here. Open-eyed and long-fingered.

340
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,833
Help me with the goose.

341
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:34,875
A piece of goose from the goose.
From France to Franz.

342
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:35,958
I want a wing.

343
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,041
Do I have to share?
Then I'll take the rest.

344
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,041
Fill up my bowl.

345
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,416
Come here, you blind hen.
Wide-mouth frog…

346
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,791
-Rest in peace in the drumfire.
-Ooh.

347
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,916
Oh, God.

348
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,625
You know I'll owe you forever for this.

349
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,291
Mm.

350
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,583
It's not bad, is it?

351
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,583
Yes. Mm.

352
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,375
-And you?
-Yes. Yes, good.

353
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,541
It's good, Paul.

354
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,666
Good, Kat.

355
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,833
Life is short.

356
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:33,041
-Where's Emil when you need him?
-Emil, bring in coffee and caviar!

357
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:36,083
Yes, and draw my foot bath as well.
I need a foot bath.

358
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,750
-Kat?
-What is it?

359
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,750
-The farmer! The farmer!
-The farmer! Yes!

360
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,416
Tjaden sits very quietly and says…

361
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,208
"Where is he?"
"Cross." I keep hearing, "Cross."

362
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,333
"My father was leader of Nazareth."

363
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:31,416
"Leader of Nazareth?"
enquires the teacher.

364
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,041
"What?" "Never heard of it."

365
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,083
"Tjaden, go back home
and ask again, will you?"

366
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,875
Next morning, Tjaden springs into school
and says to everybody,

367
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:42,166
"Please forgive me."
"My father wasn't the leader of Nazareth."

368
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,375
"My father was last seen with Nadja Roth."

369
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:49,375
Brilliant.

370
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:56,541
Look.

371
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:57,916
Mhm?

372
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,875
<i>Regarder! </i>

373
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:21,833
Hey! Hello!

374
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,166
Come here!

375
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,333
Fresh baguette!

376
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,125
For you!

377
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,208
Liverwurst, love!

378
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,875
Lots of love!

379
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:47,875
Franz. What are you doing?

380
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:52,333
-Take me with you.
-Come on!

381
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:58,833
I'd go over.

382
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,541
But he's making a fool of himself.

383
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:05,541
Oh, my.
You are very beautiful, my love.

384
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,208
Franz!

385
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,166
The dark-haired beauty
is for me!

386
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:21,375
What is he doing?

387
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,000
Franz!

388
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,041
Goodbye!

389
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,708
Goodbye, my friends!

390
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,375
Damn it.

391
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,500
If it was all over,
you know what I'd be doing?

392
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:52,291
There's no peace,
so it doesn't matter.

393
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,541
No, but if there was…

394
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,208
-We'd be surrounded by women again.
-Yeah, that's true.

395
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,541
I wouldn't put trousers on
for eight days.

396
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:03,833
I should really be spanking your backside
for talking about something like that.

397
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,000
What about you, Paul?

398
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:09,666
-No idea. Can't think.
-I'd stay with the Prussians.

399
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:11,500
You're an idiot, Tjaden.

400
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,916
Have you ever done
any peat digging?

401
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,125
Try it sometime.

402
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,500
Can't be worse
than digging trenches in Champagne.

403
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:19,541
It takes longer
than digging trenches in Champagne.

404
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,250
And you can't get away with not doing it.

405
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:24,500
In peacetime military life,
you have no concerns.

406
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,541
Mornings, food's there
or else you're not there.

407
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,000
And then you have the softest bed.

408
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:31,875
Every week with fresh sheets over it.

409
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:32,791
And then…

410
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,083
And before you know it, I'm a corporal.

411
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:40,166
Imagine that.
Me becoming a military policeman.

412
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,083
A Cognac here, a pint there.

413
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:45,250
A military policeman
is everyone's good friend. Everyone.

414
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:46,916
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

415
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:49,416
What's that?

416
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,666
You'll never be a corporal though,
will you?

417
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:03,416
You always make such useless comments.

418
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,125
What does it matter what you think anyway?

419
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,000
-Kat! Kat!
-Here!

420
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,125
-Kat!
-Here!

421
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,125
Kat!

422
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:22,333
"Darling one."

423
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,291
"You asked us
for a package of food to be sent."

424
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,458
"Four portions of sausage
are on their way with lard."

425
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,125
"A couple of pieces of cake."

426
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,000
"Sauerkraut and smoked wurst."

427
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:37,833
"Some more…"

428
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,791
-Hing? Hingfong?
-Hingfong.

429
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,416
"…and a cup of sugar."

430
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,083
"Eggs and a glass of plum jam in there."

431
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:49,666
"Don't eat too quickly as I don't want
to have to send more right away."

432
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:52,833
"I'd keep it away
from your comrades if I were you."

433
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:55,250
"My dear one."

434
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,875
"I must also ask a question of you."

435
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,375
"Have you started to save up any money?"

436
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,375
"Could you send some home
would you think?"

437
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:06,875
"People are saying the war
will be over soon." "Some people."

438
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,833
"And so it would be helpful
to have some saved up."

439
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,750
"You're probably thinking,
'What is she after?'"

440
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,541
"'How cheeky of her to ask.'"

441
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,333
"But I mean not to offend you."

442
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:19,708
"You know me, I can never get enough."

443
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:22,958
"But more, more." "I can't help it,
I always want some more."

444
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,875
"So make sure not to fall over
before you can come home."

445
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:31,000
"Karl Lemmer is in a hospital bed
somewhere in the East."

446
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,625
"Something with his stomach."

447
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,458
"And he was out there
for barely three weeks in total."

448
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,500
"Can't you also be sick,
with your rheumatism?"

449
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,750
"You've already played your role."

450
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:47,291
If only she could see
how you're sitting there, with your cigar.

451
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,083
"This Sunday, I'll visit the gra…"

452
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,291
"This Sunday,
I'll visit the grave of our boy."

453
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:08,791
"I'll make sure to read to him
as you remember he loved that."

454
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:14,375
"By next year, we'll be able to celebrate
his tenth birthday together."

455
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:18,833
"That's all I have to tell you this time."

456
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:21,833
"Sending kisses from your wife, for you."

457
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:23,458
"<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>."

458
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,916
I had no idea.

459
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,666
Oh, Paul.

460
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,375
How is all this going to work out, hmm?

461
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:51,666
Returning to a home,

462
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,916
having to go back to our normal being.

463
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:59,125
Where all everyone wants to know about
are the battles we've been in.

464
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:05,291
We'll be like travellers
who belong in another country elsewhere.

465
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:09,666
Sometimes I wonder…

466
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:11,708
Would…

467
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:15,166
Would I be happier with you here at camp?

468
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,000
Tjaden and Kropp.

469
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,083
And with Müller. He'd be sat with us.

470
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,333
And be eating fried potatoes.

471
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,083
Unpeeled.

472
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,125
Well…

473
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:46,041
That's enough of that.

474
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:51,208
How long until we finally get going again?

475
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,833
How long
until we finally get going again?

476
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,250
Franz?

477
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,833
Yes?

478
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,250
Tomorrow, we're up at six o'clock.

479
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,875
To look for some children.

480
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:22,625
What happened?

481
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,833
They should have arrived today.

482
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,375
A whole company.

483
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,083
How was it?

484
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,666
-Good.
-Yeah?

485
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:40,250
Yes.

486
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:43,541
Here.

487
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:49,833
Have a smell.

488
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:03,750
What's her name?

489
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:04,833
Eloise.

490
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:08,500
Eloise.

491
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:12,708
She had skin as white as milk.

492
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,666
Breasts…

493
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,500
-Hey.
-Huh?

494
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,333
I want to smell it too.

495
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:26,208
Kropp, let me have it.

496
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:28,791
-Here.
-Oh, my.

497
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:29,750
Give it to me.

498
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,708
A girl like that
never has dirt under her nails.

499
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:35,083
-No.
-At worst, some sand from the seashore.

500
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:36,958
Tjaden.

501
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:39,583
-Come on, pass it here.
-I bet she bathes twice a day.

502
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:46,166
Tjaden, give it back to me.

503
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,250
Sir.

504
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:11,875
Call the others.

505
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,333
There must have been a huge explosion.

506
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,875
Mine thrower cannons.

507
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,666
He's been blasted
right out of his uniform.

508
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:04,625
Was he one of those we've come here for?

509
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,583
No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

510
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:10,375
He's been hanging there
for some time.

511
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,125
Not pleasant.

512
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,375
Don't get soft now, men.

513
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,416
How many are we looking for?

514
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,041
Sixty young recruits.

515
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:26,958
Breakfast is turnip bread.

516
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,916
Same at lunchtime, it's turnip bread.

517
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,583
I'm surrounded by turnip bread.
I can't face it any more.

518
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,958
Let me know when you find them.
I'm not going any further.

519
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:36,750
Gas.

520
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:41,083
There was gas here.

521
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,000
Shit!

522
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:01,666
Hello, madam.

523
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:06,291
I'm Kropp.

524
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:11,708
And you?

525
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:19,458
Mm.

526
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:24,916
Do you want to…

527
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:30,916
Do you want to come with me?

528
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:33,916
Not a problem.

529
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,250
Kat?

530
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:33,000
Kat.

531
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,583
Kat!

532
00:56:45,583 --> 00:56:46,583
Shit.

533
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:54,666
-Flipping idiots.
-Uh huh.

534
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,208
Stupid boys.
They took their masks off too soon.

535
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,166
Germany will soon be empty.

536
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:24,791
<font color="#ffff80">‎COMPIÈGNE, FRANCE
8 NOVEMBER, 1918</font>

537
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:27,208
General.

538
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,333
Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

539
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:33,041
The French are increasing the pressure.

540
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,833
Early this morning,
our reconnaissance intercepted orders

541
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:38,250
summoning entire divisions to Latierre.

542
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:41,083
A tank fleet is still reportedly
still stuck at Fernancourt.

543
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,875
Must mean an attack is likely.

544
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:47,416
The social democrats
will be the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

545
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:50,875
General?

546
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:58,333
I have just put a German delegation
to the armistice negotiations

547
00:58:58,416 --> 00:58:59,916
on the train to Compiègne.

548
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:10,500
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling out our fatherland.

549
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:13,583
My orders are war.

550
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:18,333
And all the while that is the case,
I shall fight for every meter.

551
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:23,083
We have to hold on now
and wait for fresh troops.

552
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:25,916
In a few months, the incoming class
of recruits will be here.

553
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:28,958
The French are trying everything they can

554
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:31,583
to force
their completely unacceptable terms on us.

555
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,875
I will not capitulate.

556
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,666
We must strike without delay.
With all our might.

557
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,916
General.

558
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,500
From our position,

559
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,791
I have to be clear…

560
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,333
We all have to be clear…

561
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:19,875
For God's sake.

562
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,375
Shit.

563
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:54,708
Sir!

564
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,125
Soldiers, pack your bags,

565
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:09,958
roll up your bedding,
and wash your mess kits.

566
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,333
The whole regiment will advance
to the front firing position.

567
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:16,583
And I mean everyone
who's able to stand on two legs is going.

568
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,791
Line up, for God's sake.

569
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:23,583
You think the Frenchies will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

570
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:25,333
-Here we go again.
-Get moving!

571
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:28,041
-Where to?
-Where to? Where to?

572
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:29,541
Into battle.

573
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,666
Monsieur le Maréchal is awaiting you.

574
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,541
I'll come back for you.

575
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,166
Envious, huh?

576
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:51,541
I stand before you

577
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:56,000
in the hope that you will take
our presence here today as an opportunity

578
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:58,750
to take action to suspend all hostilities.

579
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,750
In the name of humanity,

580
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:05,541
I'm here asking you for an agreement
to an immediate cease-fire

581
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:08,708
for the entire duration
of our negotiating time

582
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:12,166
in order to spare
our nation's unnecessary depletion.

583
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:17,416
Matthias Erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

584
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,250
Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

585
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,666
I don't know.

586
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,625
Marshal Foch asks
what brings you gentlemen to him.

587
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,666
We are here looking forward to hearing

588
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,250
your proposal for an enduring cease-fire

589
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:47,458
that will include all those on the water,
on land, as well as in the sky.

590
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:53,666
I have no proposal
of this kind to make.

591
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:57,791
What does he mean by that?

592
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,791
I think he disliked the phrasing
of what you said.

593
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,250
Yes.

594
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:05,958
Good, then…

595
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:10,625
Monsieur Le Maréchal,

596
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:14,375
If you please,
we would like to know the conditions--

597
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:25,500
He wants you
to ask for it, formally.

598
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,375
Monsieur le Maréchal,

599
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,708
I am asking you for an armistice.

600
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,041
We are asking
for an armistice.

601
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:50,791
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

602
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:53,000
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

603
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:55,000
They are non-negotiable.

604
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:56,458
Seventy-two hours?

605
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:58,166
The war will continue until you sign them.

606
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,333
Monsieur le Maréchal,

607
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:03,125
in God's name,
don't let 72 hours pass us by here.

608
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:07,000
Thousands of lives depend on it.

609
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:13,958
Sign then.

610
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:30,875
Understood.

611
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,583
-Soldiers, we'll march.
-Sir.

612
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,041
Soldiers, march.

613
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,333
March, soldiers.

614
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:02,416
Soldiers, march.

615
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,166
Off you go, get out of here.

616
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,250
March, soldiers.

617
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:09,791
March.

618
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:11,791
Soldiers, march.

619
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,958
March, soldiers. Off you go.

620
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,250
Go, go, go!

621
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,666
<i>Atención aux arbalètes…</i>

622
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:02,750
<i>Allez! Allez les gars!</i>

623
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,208
<i>Allez! Allez!</i>

624
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:38,208
Keep going, Paul. Come on. Paul!

625
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:46,625
<i>Allez!</i>

626
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:56,791
<i>Au renfort!</i>

627
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,500
<i>Putain, putain, non, non!</i>

628
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:02,333
Get out!

629
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:09,250
What is that?

630
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:11,250
Get out!

631
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:15,250
-Here!
-Quick, quick, quick! Move it!

632
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:16,541
Get out!

633
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,458
There, there, look!

634
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,541
-What is it?
-Down there.

635
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,458
What is it?

636
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,291
Open fire!

637
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:57,916
Open fire!

638
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,166
All down!

639
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,375
Get down!

640
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:09,833
Boys, think fast! Be smart!

641
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,708
Get the hand grenades out!

642
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:36,916
Throw them in the vehicle
when they're on top of us.

643
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,166
Get out!

644
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:07,125
Get up!

645
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:16,500
Franz!

646
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,083
Follow me. Come on, follow me!

647
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:21,083
Franz!

648
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:23,291
Paul!

649
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:08,625
Paul.

650
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:09,708
Paul!

651
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:26,750
Open fire!

652
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:41,583
Retreat!

653
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:43,916
Retreat!

654
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:02,250
No, no, no! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No!

655
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:05,125
Please, please, no! No, no, no!

656
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:08,250
No, wait, wait, don't shoot.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. No.

657
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:09,250
-No, no!
-Albert.

658
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,708
Come on, come on.

659
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,166
Come on!

660
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:27,833
Keep going!

661
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:55,333
Where is Franz?

662
01:18:55,416 --> 01:18:56,666
I've left Franz alone!

663
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:05,291
Katczinsky!

664
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,750
Take the machine gun and retreat.

665
01:19:07,833 --> 01:19:10,583
We'll regroup in Eguisac,
two kilometres northeast.

666
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,666
I miss my comrades, sir. I miss them all!

667
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,041
I miss my mother, for God's sake.

668
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,666
Grenades, ammunition! Come on!

669
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:23,666
Paul, come on!

670
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:33,875
Get out of here! Let's go!

671
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:54,250
These aren't negotiations,
this is a dictate.

672
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,666
Maybe we should return to Spa
to consult with the general staff.

673
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,708
And what expectations
do you have for that?

674
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:02,166
Even if we end up
losing definitively after all,

675
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,583
we won't be worse off
than we are with this surrender.

676
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,666
Except for
a few hundred thousand extra deaths.

677
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,583
Alsace-Lorraine,
occupation of the Rhineland,

678
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:10,833
cannons, locomotives,
trains, and whatever else.

679
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:13,041
You are aware,
this is a total capitulation.

680
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:17,458
250,000 Americans
are landing each month in Europe.

681
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:21,083
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai.
All of those lost.

682
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:24,125
All that's left
separating us from an armistice

683
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:25,791
is false pride, as I see it.

684
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:27,208
Thanks to you and your commanders,

685
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,458
we're here dealing with the mess
left by them.

686
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:32,000
I'm happy for you to depart here,
it's down to you.

687
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:33,208
We are remaining here.

688
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:40,750
It is winter.

689
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,041
Without trains and provisions,
Bolshevism will take over.

690
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,875
On their way home,
the men will die of hunger

691
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:50,375
instead of dying
with honour on the battlefield.

692
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:52,500
Honour?

693
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:57,291
My son was killed in the war.
He doesn't feel any honour.

694
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:04,708
Von Helldorf.

695
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:08,125
Please get a few copies
of the conditions of their proposal

696
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:10,375
and telegraph them to headquarters.

697
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:11,791
You inform the government.

698
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,333
We have 72 hours left here, gentlemen,

699
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:19,750
and during every minute
we waste by talking about it,

700
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,291
there dies another soldier.

701
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:25,666
Let us gain mercy where we can,
but for God's sake,

702
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,583
let's make peace.

703
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:15,250
Retreat! Retreat!

704
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,333
Run! Run!

705
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:25,083
Keep firing!

706
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:25,125
Shut up!

707
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:10,458
Shut up!

708
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:14,791
That's enough!

709
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,708
No, no, no.

710
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,166
Comrade.

711
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,208
Comrade, comrade.

712
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:19,541
So sorry.

713
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:22,041
So sorry.

714
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,208
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

715
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:05,291
<font color="#ffff80">‎DUVAL, GÉRARD
TYPOGRAPHER</font>

716
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:20,875
Your wife…

717
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,000
Your wife…

718
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:27,291
I promise… I promise…

719
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:29,666
I promise…

720
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,125
When were you born, Brixdorf?

721
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,291
1877, in June.

722
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:26,708
A summer child.

723
01:30:27,791 --> 01:30:28,625
Yes.

724
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:33,083
What about your father?

725
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:37,625
My family live in Holstein
and he has a factory there.

726
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:40,541
Producing what?

727
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:43,708
Riding saddles, general.

728
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:45,375
Riding saddles.

729
01:30:47,083 --> 01:30:50,458
Something that will always sell.
Your future is secure then.

730
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:53,458
I am indeed fortunate.

731
01:30:55,833 --> 01:30:56,708
And?

732
01:30:57,666 --> 01:30:59,250
Are you looking forward to going home?

733
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:02,916
-When we are no longer needed here?
-Yes.

734
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:07,750
After the war,
a position of responsibility awaits me.

735
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:10,666
-I will take over the business.
-Mhm.

736
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:12,958
Congratulations.

737
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:14,500
And you?

738
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:18,000
I'm a soldier.

739
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:22,083
My father was an officer in this regiment.

740
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:25,541
He fought in the three wars
under Bismarck.

741
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,708
He won all three of them.

742
01:31:28,291 --> 01:31:30,583
In 1871, he marched on Paris

743
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:33,083
and when he returned, he was a hero.

744
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:39,125
I was too late in being born, Brixdorf.

745
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:42,750
It's been 50 years of no war.

746
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:45,708
What is a soldier without war?

747
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:54,500
Were you and your father close?

748
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,458
As a child, maybe.

749
01:31:59,708 --> 01:32:01,875
A man is alone when born.

750
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,583
He lives alone

751
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,208
and on his deathbed is alone.

752
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,291
<font color="#ffff80">‎THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED</font>

753
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:39,000
Come in.

754
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:43,500
-Von Helldorf. How can I help you?
-Hindenburg.

755
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:44,875
Open it immediately.

756
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:52,791
He urges us to sign.

757
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:58,541
-It's over!
-We're going home!

758
01:32:58,625 --> 01:33:00,833
We're going home!

759
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:03,083
Back to our families.

760
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:15,958
In the name of all
who are living in a world of sin.

761
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:19,666
We are surrounded by it now in the filth.

762
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:23,250
Knock on the monastery's door

763
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:26,500
and you'll find
only thieves and scoundrels.

764
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:29,375
It's finally over.
The fat pigs finally get it.

765
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:33,625
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, do you hear that?

766
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,916
Are there any sergeants left?

767
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:51,250
Chloroform the man,
for God's sake.

768
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:06,458
Bäumer.

769
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:08,458
Bäumer.

770
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,833
Bäumer.

771
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:16,541
Tjaden? Tjaden.

772
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:19,791
What happened?

773
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:21,458
Where have you been hit?

774
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:22,625
Above the knee.

775
01:34:23,875 --> 01:34:25,333
Or somewhere down there.

776
01:34:25,416 --> 01:34:26,791
I can't feel anything.

777
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:29,291
How far up is the shot?

778
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:31,666
I can't raise my head.

779
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:35,125
Ten centimetres, it seems.

780
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:41,083
You're going home soon, Tjaden.

781
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:43,125
-You think so?
-Yes, you are.

782
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:50,166
It's unlikely the police force
will have me, though.

783
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:53,291
God damn shit.

784
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:55,875
You can still do it.

785
01:34:58,041 --> 01:34:59,166
Just wait and see.

786
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:01,875
I'm not going to let them amputate me.

787
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:05,250
I'm not living as a cripple in this world.

788
01:35:05,791 --> 01:35:07,041
You won't have to.

789
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:09,375
There are others who are worse off
that they've patched up.

790
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,250
Oh, dear Paul.

791
01:35:15,958 --> 01:35:17,416
I have something to give you.

792
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,291
Is he dead?

793
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:57,708
You must show braveness.

794
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,625
You're alive, remember?

795
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:02,541
For that, you have to be grateful.

796
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:04,375
For us.

797
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:06,750
-For those who didn't make it.
-That's enough.

798
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:09,333
Look here. You mustn't say that. Not you.

799
01:36:24,791 --> 01:36:26,083
Good feeling, right?

800
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:28,375
Have a bit of that, then.

801
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,666
Yeah,
dry your socks out there.

802
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:32,750
The way the last summer was…

803
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,583
Right, none…

804
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:41,875
You see?

805
01:36:41,958 --> 01:36:43,375
Not like the last one.

806
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,500
That was too…

807
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:51,583
You always blame me.

808
01:36:51,666 --> 01:36:54,500
-We saw you!
--What did you see me doing?

809
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:56,666
Come on!

810
01:36:57,791 --> 01:36:59,166
Nah, we know it was you.

811
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:00,875
Why is it always on me?

812
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,916
Do you have shit for brains?
Why won't you listen?

813
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,583
You have been given
a second company's provisions.

814
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:23,791
We are that second company!

815
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:25,958
So dish it out! Give it to us!

816
01:37:26,041 --> 01:37:26,958
Kat?

817
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:28,916
-Kat!
-Paul?

818
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:29,833
Kat!

819
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:31,625
Paul!

820
01:37:32,208 --> 01:37:33,833
-Paul!
-Kat, you were alive.

821
01:37:33,916 --> 01:37:35,541
-Paul!
-You're alive!

822
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:36,541
Paul.

823
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:46,125
Tjaden was hit.

824
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:47,500
He's lying inside the church.

825
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,666
He'll get a double portion from us.

826
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:51,625
Yes.

827
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,791
Another one. In here.

828
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,583
-I thought you were dead.
-Ha!

829
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:05,916
At some point, we'll all die.

830
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,333
But not on the home stretch.

831
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:12,333
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

832
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:15,583
Ha!

833
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:19,666
Tjaden.

834
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:22,708
Tjaden.

835
01:38:26,916 --> 01:38:27,750
Yes.

836
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:29,750
-Kat?
-Yes.

837
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:35,833
Kat.

838
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:37,416
I've soup here for you.

839
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,916
Have you brought cutlery?

840
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,125
Yes, we brought cutlery as well.

841
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,916
There you go. Eat up.

842
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:14,833
Stop, stop, Tjaden, Tjaden!

843
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:16,333
Stop!

844
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:21,625
We need help over here!

845
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,291
What made you do that?

846
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:25,291
Why would you?

847
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:27,958
It's over for me.

848
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:29,416
He's bleeding out!

849
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:35,250
Tjaden.

850
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,291
Tjaden.

851
01:41:15,875 --> 01:41:16,791
What is it?

852
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:20,125
I've lost something.

853
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,375
Kat, do you speak French?

854
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:29,291
Mm.
<i>S'il vous plaît. S'il vous plaît.</i>

855
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:35,666
My mother always said
it was French I should learn.

856
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:36,625
Aha.

857
01:41:40,041 --> 01:41:41,000
And the piano.

858
01:41:43,541 --> 01:41:45,083
She also warned me of war.

859
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:46,708
She didn't want me to go.

860
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:49,666
"That's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

861
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:53,708
I wanted to show that I could do it.

862
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,125
What use is that now?

863
01:41:59,708 --> 01:42:01,583
"A couple of weeks, we'll be in Paris."

864
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:07,375
These past two years of grenades
can't be shed like an item of clothing.

865
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:10,125
-Paul.
-The stench will remain on us forever.

866
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:12,125
-Enough.
-Ludwig is dead. Franz is dead. Albert--

867
01:42:12,208 --> 01:42:13,541
Is that to do with us?

868
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:16,333
They don't suffer any more.

869
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:17,791
Peace for them.

870
01:42:19,958 --> 01:42:21,458
We're still alive.

871
01:42:25,875 --> 01:42:27,541
Everything here is like a fever.

872
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:30,416
Not one person wants it
but suddenly it's there.

873
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:33,791
We didn't ask for it.
The others didn't ask for it.

874
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:35,083
But nonetheless it happened

875
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:37,166
and nonetheless half the world
is involved, mind you.

876
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:38,375
God looks down

877
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:41,083
at us murderers.

878
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,500
Yeah, well.

879
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:51,375
But what do I know?

880
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:52,875
Nothing.

881
01:42:53,666 --> 01:42:55,208
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

882
01:42:57,458 --> 01:42:59,416
Get some rest. We're the lucky ones.

883
01:42:59,916 --> 01:43:00,750
Yes.

884
01:43:18,791 --> 01:43:19,666
Kat?

885
01:43:20,625 --> 01:43:21,708
Mm.

886
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:25,166
What did your son die of?

887
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:31,416
The pox.

888
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:41,708
I'm afraid of what's to come.

889
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:50,000
Don't be.

890
01:44:22,208 --> 01:44:23,125
Henri.

891
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:27,833
Taste it.

892
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:32,916
Were they made today?

893
01:44:35,916 --> 01:44:37,875
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

894
01:44:38,875 --> 01:44:39,708
Hmm.

895
01:45:02,291 --> 01:45:03,458
Monsieur le Maréchal.

896
01:45:10,875 --> 01:45:12,000
I'm listening.

897
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:14,041
The Kaiser
has abdicated.

898
01:45:14,125 --> 01:45:18,666
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

899
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:21,250
The new government
will do everything it can

900
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:23,875
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

901
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:27,708
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

902
01:45:28,375 --> 01:45:30,750
faces hunger and anarchy setting in.

903
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:34,041
This is a disease
of the defeated, not of the victorious.

904
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:35,500
I don't fear it.

905
01:45:35,583 --> 01:45:37,208
I reject any compromise.

906
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:38,875
I reject any compromise.

907
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:41,041
Monsieur le Maréchal, please.

908
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:45,500
Be fair to your opponent
or else this peace will be hated.

909
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:46,541
Fair?

910
01:45:49,875 --> 01:45:51,458
You speak of fairness?

911
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:06,750
Sign it.

912
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,666
Let the minutes record.

913
01:47:14,291 --> 01:47:18,083
The armistice here signed
shall take effect in six hours from now

914
01:47:18,166 --> 01:47:21,916
at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day
of the eleventh month.

915
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:25,666
Very good.

916
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:27,416
The war is over.

917
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:43,583
What are you going to do now?

918
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:47,000
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

919
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:51,041
The plains of Latierre, general.

920
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:52,000
Eguisac.

921
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,250
I see them too.

922
01:47:55,458 --> 01:47:58,166
But also German soldiers
running away like cowards.

923
01:48:00,041 --> 01:48:02,333
The French troops are farting
on our position in Latierre

924
01:48:02,416 --> 01:48:04,958
and outside there's a train
crammed full of horse fuckers

925
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:06,333
who are selling the homeland off.

926
01:48:10,541 --> 01:48:12,458
See to it that all recruits are withdrawn.

927
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:15,083
Have them all report here.

928
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:18,291
We're going to sort out this pile of shit!

929
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:33,416
<i>Any communication</i>
<i>with the enemy remains prohibited.</i>

930
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:38,416
<i>Firstly, hostilities on the entire front</i>
<i>will be ceased this morning,</i>

931
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,666
<i>November 11th at eleven o'clock.</i>

932
01:48:41,416 --> 01:48:44,083
<i>Secondly, the troops</i>
<i>will not cross the line reached</i>

933
01:48:44,166 --> 01:48:46,291
<i>on this day at this hour.</i>

934
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:50,500
<i>The front line</i>
<i>shall remain unchanged past this hour.</i>

935
01:48:50,583 --> 01:48:53,625
<i>All troops are to return to their station.</i>

936
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,541
What time is it?

937
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:03,416
-Why aren't you asleep?
-Listen a minute.

938
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,125
It's so still.

939
01:49:10,666 --> 01:49:12,041
I must be going deaf.

940
01:49:18,416 --> 01:49:19,791
They've signed, Paul.

941
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:25,583
The war's over.

942
01:49:27,541 --> 01:49:28,500
It's over.

943
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:35,250
Are you hungry?

944
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:37,375
I'm hungry.

945
01:49:42,375 --> 01:49:43,791
Where are you going?

946
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:46,000
Come on,
before the bastard wakes up.

947
01:49:48,125 --> 01:49:51,208
-What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
-I don't know.

948
01:49:51,291 --> 01:49:53,041
I'm gonna roast a goose.

949
01:49:53,625 --> 01:49:55,333
Red cabbage, potatoes…

950
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:58,041
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

951
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:00,750
My God, Paul, she is beautiful.

952
01:50:00,833 --> 01:50:01,875
Yeah?

953
01:50:01,958 --> 01:50:04,250
-What does she look like?
-Well…

954
01:50:04,833 --> 01:50:07,166
Long curly hair, dark.

955
01:50:07,833 --> 01:50:10,083
And she's buxom and strong.

956
01:50:10,166 --> 01:50:11,000
Yeah?

957
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,416
Christmas.

958
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:16,625
It's all so far away still.

959
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:18,916
No, it's not. It's really close.

960
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,583
We want another child. Or children, Paul.

961
01:50:25,666 --> 01:50:29,125
Because what is Christmas
without children? It's nothing, really.

962
01:50:29,208 --> 01:50:30,041
Ah?

963
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:32,875
You know when…

964
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:35,416
Once we're back home, then we will…

965
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:38,000
-Yeah?
-We must do something together.

966
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,791
The two of us together.
Something big, yeah?

967
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:41,708
Yeah, yeah.

968
01:50:43,791 --> 01:50:44,666
What is it?

969
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:48,000
I'm a shoemaker, Paul. I repair shoes.

970
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:52,083
Ah? You know how to read, write.
You finished school.

971
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:54,333
Hasn't done me any good, though.

972
01:50:55,541 --> 01:50:56,625
What are we gonna do?

973
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:58,750
Sole shoes together?

974
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,791
Are you trying to insult me?

975
01:51:02,125 --> 01:51:03,833
I can't read my wife's letters even now.

976
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:06,500
You're going to university, Paul.

977
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:08,875
Or I'll shoot you right here.

978
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:12,458
My trousers are loose.

979
01:51:15,333 --> 01:51:16,541
My trousers are loose.

980
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,875
You'll just have to eat something.

981
01:51:21,791 --> 01:51:24,000
Soon we'll be home
then we can eat whatever we want.

982
01:51:25,291 --> 01:51:26,166
Whatever we want.

983
01:51:51,416 --> 01:51:52,416
It's your go.

984
01:51:53,083 --> 01:51:55,083
If the farmer catches me again,

985
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:57,041
then he's bound
to shoot me down where I stand.

986
01:52:01,458 --> 01:52:03,291
Just be careful of the damn dog too.

987
01:52:03,375 --> 01:52:04,250
Yeah.

988
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:37,291
Ah?

989
01:52:55,708 --> 01:52:57,791
Shh, shh… Hey, hey, hey.

990
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:19,166
Look.

991
01:53:22,208 --> 01:53:23,541
It's really good.

992
01:53:26,916 --> 01:53:27,750
Want some?

993
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:31,166
Shit.

994
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Piece of garbage…

995
01:54:22,208 --> 01:54:23,208
Stop!

996
01:54:24,166 --> 01:54:25,291
Thief!

997
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:35,500
Kat! Run!

998
01:54:36,375 --> 01:54:37,375
Run!

999
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:40,250
Asshole!

1000
01:54:45,958 --> 01:54:46,791
God damn!

1001
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:50,041
We'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

1002
01:55:07,291 --> 01:55:08,666
Oh, crap.

1003
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:10,166
-Look at this.
-What is it?

1004
01:55:11,125 --> 01:55:13,083
-A lucky shot.
-He hit the eggs!

1005
01:55:14,958 --> 01:55:16,041
Stop the flow.

1006
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,791
Come on, get it in there.

1007
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:24,916
There you go.

1008
01:55:27,875 --> 01:55:29,208
We can have an omelette.

1009
01:55:29,291 --> 01:55:31,416
No, we'll eat them now.

1010
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:32,416
They're just as good.

1011
01:55:51,333 --> 01:55:52,416
Better than ever.

1012
01:55:54,208 --> 01:55:55,125
I won't be long.

1013
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,416
Kat?

1014
01:57:38,333 --> 01:57:39,500
Kat?

1015
01:57:43,875 --> 01:57:44,750
Kat!

1016
01:57:46,958 --> 01:57:48,000
What happened?

1017
01:57:48,916 --> 01:57:49,750
We should leave.

1018
01:57:51,625 --> 01:57:52,666
Who fired the shot?

1019
01:57:53,166 --> 01:57:54,541
That little shit from the farm.

1020
01:57:55,666 --> 01:57:56,833
The farmer's son.

1021
01:57:58,875 --> 01:58:00,291
Kat, Kat.

1022
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:02,208
What a mess.

1023
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:11,208
How big is it?

1024
01:58:11,708 --> 01:58:14,000
Little finger.
I'll get the bullet out.

1025
01:58:14,083 --> 01:58:16,333
No. Give me a cigarette.

1026
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:18,708
Let the medic do that.

1027
01:58:37,125 --> 01:58:39,208
They stuck me in a class
with seven-year-olds.

1028
01:58:41,125 --> 01:58:42,750
I'd begun shaving already.

1029
01:58:44,458 --> 01:58:45,541
Find me a word.

1030
01:58:47,666 --> 01:58:49,208
That trifle can rhyme with.

1031
01:58:50,375 --> 01:58:51,208
Mhm.

1032
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:55,583
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1033
01:59:02,166 --> 01:59:03,541
Fucking shit.

1034
01:59:04,958 --> 01:59:07,083
Why the hell did this have to happen now?

1035
01:59:10,916 --> 01:59:12,541
-Come on, we need to move.
-Yeah.

1036
01:59:19,708 --> 01:59:20,625
Alright?

1037
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:22,875
Kat?

1038
01:59:22,958 --> 01:59:24,083
Rifle.

1039
01:59:24,166 --> 01:59:25,333
Mhm?

1040
01:59:25,416 --> 01:59:27,125
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1041
01:59:37,083 --> 01:59:40,791
When we get home, you're going
to make a new pair of boots for me.

1042
01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:42,708
I'm walking my feet to the bone.

1043
01:59:57,291 --> 01:59:58,166
Hey!

1044
02:00:01,625 --> 02:00:02,750
Wait!

1045
02:00:04,333 --> 02:00:05,291
Pull over!

1046
02:00:05,875 --> 02:00:06,750
Let us on!

1047
02:00:07,916 --> 02:00:09,541
Hey! Let us on!

1048
02:00:20,666 --> 02:00:21,750
Come on, will you?

1049
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,375
This man needs care.

1050
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:01,916
Where is the medic?

1051
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,708
Could've spared yourself
the trouble.

1052
02:01:33,875 --> 02:01:34,708
Huh?

1053
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:36,583
He's dead.

1054
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:44,541
But it's… It's just a small bullet wound.

1055
02:01:45,166 --> 02:01:47,833
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

1056
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:49,458
The organs are poisoned.

1057
02:01:56,416 --> 02:01:57,416
Unconscious.

1058
02:01:58,541 --> 02:01:59,375
No.

1059
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:00,958
He's dead.

1060
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:02,625
I know what I'm doing.

1061
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,791
Impossible. I was…
I was just talking to him.

1062
02:02:08,375 --> 02:02:09,500
He's unconscious.

1063
02:02:11,375 --> 02:02:12,458
He's unconscious.

1064
02:02:19,875 --> 02:02:20,708
See?

1065
02:02:22,625 --> 02:02:25,416
He simply had bad luck.
Right before the end.

1066
02:04:14,125 --> 02:04:15,750
Go on, keep going!

1067
02:04:15,833 --> 02:04:17,208
Keep going!

1068
02:04:17,708 --> 02:04:19,333
Keep going, come on!

1069
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,083
This is it.

1070
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:32,750
I'm going to tell him I'm going home.

1071
02:04:34,708 --> 02:04:35,708
It's over.

1072
02:04:37,541 --> 02:04:39,208
Attention!

1073
02:04:45,416 --> 02:04:46,375
Soldiers.

1074
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,166
We stand here as brothers

1075
02:04:50,125 --> 02:04:51,833
in a world of enemies

1076
02:04:51,916 --> 02:04:54,833
and are forced to watch
as German social democrats

1077
02:04:54,916 --> 02:04:57,875
render our beloved people defenseless

1078
02:04:59,166 --> 02:05:02,083
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

1079
02:05:04,125 --> 02:05:05,041
Comrades.

1080
02:05:06,083 --> 02:05:07,916
Soon you will be going home

1081
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,416
to your parents, wives and children.

1082
02:05:11,375 --> 02:05:12,541
The war is over.

1083
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:18,083
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

1084
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:22,916
To the reward of admiration
for all you have achieved here.

1085
02:05:24,416 --> 02:05:26,000
Ah, but comrades,

1086
02:05:27,416 --> 02:05:30,250
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes on your return

1087
02:05:32,291 --> 02:05:33,166
or as weaklings

1088
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:36,416
and cowards who tucked their tails in
when it really counted?

1089
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:37,541
We're going home.

1090
02:05:37,625 --> 02:05:38,500
Soldiers.

1091
02:05:39,333 --> 02:05:43,250
We are about to attack them
with the utmost force and vehemence.

1092
02:05:43,958 --> 02:05:47,500
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1093
02:05:47,583 --> 02:05:52,541
We will seize the plains before 11:00 a.m.
and end this war with a merciless strike.

1094
02:05:52,625 --> 02:05:53,958
and make them see…

1095
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,500
…we were victorious.

1096
02:05:56,583 --> 02:06:01,583
Onwards, with God on our side
as he was with our fathers before us.

1097
02:06:01,666 --> 02:06:04,333
I'm not going back
into battle. Not me!

1098
02:06:04,416 --> 02:06:05,583
Shut up!

1099
02:06:06,875 --> 02:06:09,333
-Let me go!
-Follow your orders!

1100
02:06:09,416 --> 02:06:11,208
Do as your told!

1101
02:06:11,291 --> 02:06:12,375
All of you, get back.

1102
02:06:13,083 --> 02:06:15,458
-Please, I didn't do anything!
-Aim!

1103
02:06:15,541 --> 02:06:18,291
-No! No!
-Fire!

1104
02:06:42,583 --> 02:06:43,791
Keep moving!

1105
02:06:46,666 --> 02:06:47,500
Come on!

1106
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:57,666
Company, halt!

1107
02:07:01,958 --> 02:07:04,125
Rifle off!

1108
02:07:04,208 --> 02:07:07,375
-Fix bayonets!
-Fix bayonets and load!

1109
02:07:22,416 --> 02:07:23,875
What time is it?

1110
02:07:23,958 --> 02:07:25,291
Fifteen minutes to go.

1111
02:08:02,625 --> 02:08:04,000
It belonged to Lefèvre.

1112
02:08:05,291 --> 02:08:07,083
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

1113
02:08:07,791 --> 02:08:10,083
-He won't need it anymore.
-Thank you, sir.

1114
02:08:14,375 --> 02:08:16,208
Here's to you and to Lefèvre.

1115
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:23,583
Well, it's good.

1116
02:08:27,208 --> 02:08:28,208
The nightmare is over.

1117
02:09:28,375 --> 02:09:31,333
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

1118
02:09:31,416 --> 02:09:33,083
-In position!
-In position!

1119
02:09:35,666 --> 02:09:37,083
Fire!

1120
02:09:37,958 --> 02:09:39,166
Fire!

1121
02:10:14,375 --> 02:10:16,083
Throw the grenades!

1122
02:10:26,791 --> 02:10:27,958
Charge!

1123
02:11:24,208 --> 02:11:26,125
Please, no! No, no!

1124
02:13:16,625 --> 02:13:18,333
Cease fire!

1125
02:13:18,416 --> 02:13:19,958
It is 11:00 a.m.!

1126
02:13:20,625 --> 02:13:22,041
Cease fire!

1127
02:13:22,541 --> 02:13:24,541
Cease fire!

1128
02:13:25,541 --> 02:13:27,625
It is eleven o'clock.

1129
02:16:02,708 --> 02:16:05,583
A light!
Bring me a light! A light please!

1130
02:16:24,875 --> 02:16:26,458
Are you alright?

1131
02:16:27,875 --> 02:16:28,833
Yeah.

1132
02:16:29,666 --> 02:16:32,125
Well, then.
Start gathering, please.
