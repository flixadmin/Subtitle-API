1
00:00:00,948 --> 00:00:03,726
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:07,185
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:09,521
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,523 --> 00:00:12,691
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:16,945
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:22,250
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:26,972
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:29,068
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:32,487
The defendant
is found not guilty.

10
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,323
Hello, Moira.

11
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,607
What do you want, Malcolm?

12
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,776
Thea is my daughter.

13
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:41,380
What do these guys want
with a seven year old sub?

14
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:43,315
What's on it,
it'll save the human race.

15
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:44,883
Will it save him?

16
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:46,551
Sir, there's been
a development.

17
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:50,288
Brother Cyrus...

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,792
How do you feel?

19
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:55,627
Stronger.

20
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,162
What was that?

21
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:59,043

23
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:08,704
Mrs. Queen, welcome back
to the company.

24
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:10,404
Thank you.
You look fabulous.

25
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:12,457
Really, better than ever.
Did you do something to your hair?

26
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,209
Yes, I shampooed it
without eight women

27
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:16,577
and a guard
watching me.

28
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,880
Is it ok to laugh?
Because I was ordered

29
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:21,633
not to say anything about you being
in prison, just to avoid any awkward...

30
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,102
exchanges.
Like that one.

31
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:28,523
Right.

32
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:32,510
We need to drill down on these
numbers before the earnings call.

33
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:34,245
Oliver. I didn't realize

34
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:36,281
your mother was stopping by
for a visit today.

35
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:39,600
Well, it's not a visit.
This is her company, too.

36
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:41,820
Of course.

37
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:44,105
How are you, Moira?

38
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:46,825
Back, Isabel.

39
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:49,794
Mr. Queen, may I speak
to you for a minute?

40
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,848
What sort of message
does it send

41
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,084
to the investment
committee, to the city,

42
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:59,087
if we hand Queen Consolidated right
back to your mother?

43
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:00,638
She was acquitted.
By a jury.

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,308
Not by the city.
Oliver.

45
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,809
Stop thinking
like a son

46
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,612
and start thinking
like a CEO.

47
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,984
Oliver.

48
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,320
There's been a break-in.

49
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:26,647
Damn!

50
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:35,323
This door was made of expanded
reinforced titanium.

51
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:37,342
What did they use
to do this?

52
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,844
Not sure yet.
No sign of any explosives.

53
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,880
Maybe a crane,
maybe a forklift.

54
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:44,498
I'm guessing there was
at least three of them, maybe four.

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,335
And given how quick
they got in and out of here...

56
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:50,605
They were fast.

57
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:54,025
Whoa, hey, stop, wait!

58
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,727
You don't even
have a fare!

59
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:04,552
Any idea what these guys
were so hot to break in here for?

60
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:06,354
You didn't happen to leave
a spare earthquake machine

61
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:09,490
lying around, did you?

62
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:11,242
Sorry.

63
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:16,297
This is what we're able to
pull off the security cameras.

64
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,871
He was the only guy
we got on video.

65
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:25,990
The rest of the crew
must have come in after him.

66
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:28,092
Actually, it was
only one guy.

67
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:30,378
Ah, sorry I'm late.

68
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,564
But actually, my train was late.
Well, the second one.

69
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,733
The first one I did miss, but
that was my cab driver's fault.

70
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,936
I've got this great
traffic app, and...

71
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:41,239
But he thought
that he was right.

72
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,224
I'm here now,
though. So.

73
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,642
Great. Who the hell are you?

74
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:46,194
And do your parents
know that you're here?

75
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:47,946
I'm Barry Allen.

76
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:50,214
I'm from the Central
City police department.

77
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:52,917
I'm with the crime scene
investigation unit.

78
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,453
We're working on a case
with some similar

79
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,922
unexplained elements
in Central City,

80
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,458
so when the report of your robbery
came over the wire,

81
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,910
my captain
sent me up here.

82
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,631
And you think one guy ripped
through this door

83
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,299
like it was
tin foil?

84
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:11,352
One very
strong guy, yeah.

85
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:15,223
Uh, it takes about 1,250 foot
pounds of torque

86
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:17,108
to break someone's neck.

87
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,860
You see the marks
on the guard's neck?

88
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:22,981
The bruising pattern suggests
the killer used only one hand.

89
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:25,483
I'm guessing you don't know
how hard it is

90
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:26,701
to break someone's neck.

91
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,936
Hmm? No. No idea.

92
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:31,906
Uh, we're going to need
a list of the entire inventory here

93
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:34,292
to figure out exactly
what was stolen.

94
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:37,078
Actually, I think
I know what was stolen.

95
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,081
A centrifuge.
An industrial centrifuge.

96
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,051
Probably the Cord
Enterprises 2BX 900.

97
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:44,636
Maybe the six series.

98
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:47,388
Both have
a three column base.

99
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,641
Here, you can see
the three sets of broken bolts

100
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:53,511
where the thief just...
ripped it out of the ground.

101
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:56,314
And what exactly
is a centrifuge?

102
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:57,949
It separates liquids.

103
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:00,018
The centripetal acceleration
causes denser substances

104
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,487
to separate out
along the radial direction.

105
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:04,605
And lighter objects
move to the top.

106
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,541
What did you say
your name was again?

107
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:08,076
Barry. Allen.

108
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:11,045
Felicity. Smoak.

109
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,982
Um, you can
see the cracks

110
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:17,835
heading towards
the door. Footsteps.

111
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:21,372
One guy.

112
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:23,441
Anyway,
it's just a theory.

113
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:26,310
One backed by
a lot of evidence.

114
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,596
There has to be
another explanation.

115
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:31,799
Yeah. I'm sure
you're right.

116
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:35,053
You might want to fill
our mutual friend in on this.

117
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:37,271
Yeah. Don't worry.

118
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm sure
he's already on it.

119
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,867
We need to change
directions

120
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,520
10 degrees north.
We need to rest.

121
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,872
If Ivo and any of his men
survived that blast,

122
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,157
they'll be tracking us.

123
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,544
We keep moving.

124
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:02,080
Five minutes.

125
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,701
You watch him,
please.

126
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,087
Of course.

127
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:14,092
Do you believe them?

128
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:16,594
That this Hosen will lead us
to a wrecked Japanese sub?

129
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:18,429
Ivo seems to think so.

130
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,782
I just hope whatever
miracle serum

131
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:22,550
they're after
is actually onboard.

132
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:25,553
For his sake.

133
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:28,389
How do you know that girl?

134
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:31,576
Sara was on
my father's boat...

135
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:34,612
with me.

136
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,332
What about the girl
in the picture?

137
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,900
Laurel?

138
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:43,454
The girl you told me
you were in love with.

139
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:46,257
Sara is her sister.

140
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,913
I feel like
taking a walk.

141
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:56,968
Anyone care to join me?

142
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,021
I guess a lot's happened
in the last year.

143
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:05,426
Oliver.

144
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:07,895
Got the final inventory
from applied sciences.

145
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:09,947
That CSI from Central City
was right.

146
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,266
The only thing missing
is a centrifuge.

147
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:14,768
You have to see this.
I pulled up CC traffic camera footage

148
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,071
from across the street
of applied sciences.

149
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,373
This is three minutes
after the alarm went off.

150
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:28,132
Can we help you
with something, Detective?

151
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:31,652
Oh, CSIs aren't
actually detectives.

152
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:32,837
We don't even carry guns.

153
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,723
Just some plastic baggies.

154
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,594
Uh, where should I
set up my equipment?

155
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:40,845
I'll show you.
What's going on?

156
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,181
Your assistant said
that you preferred

157
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:45,650
to keep
the investigation in house,

158
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:47,801
so I cleared it with my captain
to give you a hand.

159
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,491
What are you doing?

160
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,443
We need to find this intruder.

161
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,978
And he seems to know
more about it than any of us.

162
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,532
Forensic science
isn't exactly my forte, so...

163
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,288
I'd say we need him.

164
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,923
Wouldn't you?

165
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:12,510
Mm-hmm.

166
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:14,996
I'll show you around.

167
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,201
Why am I getting the feeling

168
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:24,419
you know more about this
than Felicity's new friend?

169
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:28,726
Pray I'm wrong.

170
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:39,707
Hi. I'm sorry
about what happened

171
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,039
at the office
this morning.

172
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,874
There are a lot of people who think
I got away with murder, Oliver.

173
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,208
Maybe I did.

174
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,711
Mom, the trial,
the Undertaking,

175
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,730
Malcolm Merlyn,
all of that is behind us now.

176
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:51,265
And we need everyone
to see that.

177
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:54,268
How are we going to do that?
We throw a party.

178
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,387
Thea.

179
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,089
Roy.

180
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,858
Did I hear you guys say
something about a party?

181
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,743
A welcome back to Queen Consolidated
party for mom.

182
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:04,044
I don't think so.

183
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:06,080
If things are going to get
back to normal,

184
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:08,315
then we need
to start acting normal.

185
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,517
Normal for us is
a lavish party.

186
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,039
Oh. I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen,
I can't stay for brunch.

187
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,291
I guess
we got to go.

188
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,428
Bye.

189
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,298
I'll take care
of everything.

190
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:37,277
What exactly
are you looking for?

191
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,929
Your thief's shoes
touched the ground,

192
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,699
which means he tracked
in dozens of clues

193
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:44,535
as to where he's been
the past few days.

194
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:48,288
Got ya.

195
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:58,382
Shouldn't take long.

196
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:03,220
So you've seen him, right?

197
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:05,272
The Vigilante?

198
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:07,975
I read that he saved you.

199
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,044
What was he like?

200
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,346
Green.

201
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,014
Green.

202
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:16,116
That's interesting, right?

203
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:18,018
I mean, why green?

204
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,653
Black would be better
for stealth,

205
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,238
and urban camouflage.

206
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,806
Me, personally,

207
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,993
I think that he trained
in some sort of like forest

208
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,661
or jungle environment,

209
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,847
and the green
is a nod to that.

210
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:32,082
I don't give the vigilante
much thought.

211
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:35,169
Police reports show that
he uses carbon arrows,

212
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,204
but if he switched
to an aluminum carbon composite,

213
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:40,424
he would have
far better penetration.

214
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,659
Maybe he thinks
he penetrates just fine.

215
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,861
Do you want
to know something else?

216
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:46,430
I think that he has partners.

217
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:50,551
Definitely someone with
a background in computer sciences.

218
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:52,853
Yeah.

219
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:56,073
Why are you
so interested in the Vigilante?

220
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:04,598
When I was 11,
my mom was murdered.

221
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,917
I'm so sorry.

222
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,736
They never caught
the guy who did it.

223
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:12,689
Maybe he would have.

224
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:21,415
The soil...there's
a crystalline structure in it.

225
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,651
That's weird.

226
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,387
What's weird?

227
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,740
It's sugar.

228
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:37,815
Sin, you said
this was an emergency.

229
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:41,351
No offense, but Thea,
you shouldn't be here.

230
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:44,004
In the alleyway
of the club I own?

231
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:46,223
It's my friend Max.

232
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,575
He's missing. I haven't seen him
for a week, no one has.

233
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:50,444
Something happened to him.

234
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:54,414
I figured you knew
someone who could help.

235
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,917
Roy can help you.

236
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,369
I thought you wanted me
to stay out of trouble.

237
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:01,434
I kind of like that you never

238
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:02,939
turn away from someone
who needs help.

239
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,258
I'll just get someone
to cover the club.

240
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,810
What do you mean?

241
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:09,146
Oh, I'm coming with you.

242
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:17,720
I hear you're
throwing a party.

243
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:20,040
I didn't get my invite.

244
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,493
Where exactly
should I have addressed it?

245
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,428
Starling City cemetery?

246
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,764
I know that's where you wish
I was right now.

247
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,232
Lying beside my son.

248
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:32,052
Am I supposed to feel sorry
for you, Malcolm?

249
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:34,588
You killed Tommy.

250
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,524
You killed your son.

251
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,494
You cannot have my daughter.
Our daughter.

252
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:43,597
I think we both
needed someone that night.

253
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:47,801
I felt so bad about betraying
Rebecca's memory

254
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:50,520
that I left
Starling.

255
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:54,140
Left Tommy behind.

256
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,662
That's when I made my way
to Nanda Parbat,

257
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:01,281
where I found
my new purpose.

258
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:03,450
In a way, Moira,

259
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:06,486
you made me the man
I am today.

260
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:09,122
Thea is innocent.

261
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:10,657
She loved Robert.

262
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:12,158
Please don't
take that away from her,

263
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,627
I'm begging you.

264
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,829
Thea is all
I have left.

265
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:18,498
Tell her the truth,

266
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,001
and tell her soon.

267
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:26,662
You found something?

268
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:27,648
We found something.

269
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,315
There were
trace amounts of sucrose

270
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:31,851
and a spec of dirt the killer
dragged in here on his boot.

271
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:33,820
Which got me thinking.
There is a sugar refinery

272
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,371
two miles from here.
The land around it

273
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,206
is suffused in waste sugar.
So I checked.

274
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,908
They had a delivery truck
stolen a few days ago.

275
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,610
Their truck matches
the make and model

276
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:43,045
of the truck the thief used
to steal the centrifuge.

277
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,697
Can you track the vehicle?
We've been trying.

278
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,749
What was that?

279
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:51,921
You're not going
to believe this.

280
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:54,039
The truck, it was just
used to rob a blood bank.

281
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,541
Are you sure?
Yeah. Our guy

282
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:57,543
just made off with 30,000 ccs
of O-negative.

283
00:14:57,545 --> 00:14:59,879
What, he has super
strength, likes blood?

284
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:02,381
Please don't tell me
we suddenly believe in vampires.

285
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,901
We should give this information
to the local police.

286
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,303
I'll...take care of that.

287
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:08,328
Did you say that you were
working a similar case

288
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,722
in Central City?

289
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,240
Oh, yeah, um...

290
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:12,725
Yeah, you know,
it's similar.

291
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:14,059
Has similar
elements.

292
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:17,563
A lot of
similarities.

293
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:19,231
Right. Yeah.

294
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,370
I want you to look into
this Allen kid.

295
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:26,088
There's more to him
than he's letting on.

296
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,591
His intentions seem
pretty clear to me.

297
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:33,245
Just do it, please.

298
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:34,747
Oliver, when are you
going to tell me

299
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,300
what exactly
we're up against?

300
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:57,849
Yeooww!

301
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,930
Sorry.

302
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:00,347
Ahh.

303
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,910
Thank you.

304
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:08,098
You were right to ask if
I knew more than I was letting on.

305
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,084
I've seen men
with abilities like that before.

306
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:13,270
You have?

307
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:15,973
Where?

308
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:18,091
The island.

309
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:20,544
My second year
marooned there, we--

310
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:23,380
I came across
the remains

311
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:26,834
of a Japanese World War II
military project.

312
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:30,671
It was a serum designed
to create human weapons.

313
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,874
Human weapons. My God,
what's next, aliens?

314
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:36,160
This is real, Diggle.

315
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:37,811
Those five years
that I was away,

316
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,847
I came across things
that just...

317
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,466
defy explanation.

318
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:45,469
There's a doctor,
his name is Ivo,

319
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,304
and he came to the island

320
00:17:47,306 --> 00:17:50,908
to test the serum on people.

321
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,644
The ones that survived,
their endurance,

322
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:56,847
reflexes and strength
were all enhanced.

323
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,899
And you think this Ivo's
in Starling City?

324
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,135
He's dead.

325
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:04,354
And so is everyone that he
injected with the serum.

326
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:07,007
The last of which...I burned.

327
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:08,609
You think someone
found the recipe.

328
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:10,310
The centrifuge
and a large supply of blood.

329
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:12,145
I think someone
wants to make more of it.

330
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:14,398
A lot more.

331
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,650
Why couldn't you have
been marooned on Aruba?

332
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:20,871
There's a third component--
a strong sedative.

333
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:22,372
I think I preferred it

334
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,491
when you left these
in people.

335
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:26,159
I need you to analyze
the blood on the arrowhead.

336
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:28,295
If we can figure out
which sedative they're using...

337
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:31,498
We can figure out
where the next robbery will be.

338
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,001
Barry and I will
get right on it.

339
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:39,273
I think our Miss Smoak
is smitten.

340
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:42,359
Diggle, what did you
find out about Mr. Allen?

341
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:44,778
He's not who he says he is.

342
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,187
How are you holding up?

343
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:57,875
I could do with
a better looking crutch.

344
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:01,378
You two seem
like you've gotten pretty chummy.

345
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,197
We're here.

346
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:10,637
There must be
a fissure in the island

347
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:15,392
below the waterline
for it to come that far inland.

348
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:18,278
Unbelievable.

349
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,399
They have nitric acid
next to hydrazine?

350
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:25,218
Permanganates
on top of acetone?

351
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,704
This is the definition
of dangerous.

352
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:30,991
If it's so dangerous, maybe you
shouldn't be touching them.

353
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:36,530
Barry.

354
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:38,532
I managed
to get a sample

355
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:40,033
of the perpetrator's blood
from the police department.

356
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,735
We need to isolate
a sedative in the blood.

357
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:42,920
It could lead us
to the thief.

358
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:44,371
How did the police get it?

359
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:46,790
Apparently the Vigilante
shot him with an arrow.

360
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,126
You're kidding.

361
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:52,462
You know what
this means, right?

362
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:55,232
This means the Vigilante's
working the same case we are!

363
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:57,751
Heh. Go figure.

364
00:19:57,753 --> 00:19:59,586
How did you get it?

365
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:01,588
Oliver has a lot
of connections.

366
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,740
Wow.

367
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:06,593
Pays to work for a billionaire.

368
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:08,946
Actually my take home's
nothing special.

369
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:11,365
Especially given
I am rarely at home,

370
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,483
since I'm with him
every night.

371
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:16,620
Ah. Well, I didn't
realize you and he were...

372
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:17,788
Oh, no.

373
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,957
Work. He...and I

374
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:24,177
are not, no, I do
not like Oliver.

375
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:27,781
Um, I was invited

376
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:30,167
to a work function.

377
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:32,135
It's a party.

378
00:20:32,137 --> 00:20:35,923
And I have
a plus-one.

379
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:37,424
I was thinking
you would make

380
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:40,611
a really good...
plus one.

381
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:47,284
There's not going to be
dancing, is there?

382
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:50,971
I'm not just not
too good on my feet.

383
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:59,579
Ohh.

384
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:01,365
It reeks in here.

385
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:05,318
I guess your friend wasn't too
into painting seascapes.

386
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:14,211
Max is like
any starving artist...

387
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:16,847
starving.

388
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:20,968
But I could always crash here
when I didn't have a place to stay.

389
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,020
Hey, this blood drive
was a week ago.

390
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:25,672
When did you say
he went missing?

391
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,993
That day.

392
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:42,689
It's Daily.

393
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:45,025
Someone's looking
for Maxwell Stanton.

394
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:47,260
And they should
find him.

395
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:49,362
Yes, brother blood.

396
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:56,887
Blood provides life.

397
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:59,873
Blood provides power.

398
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,142
And with power...

399
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:05,479
There's no limit
to what I can do.

400
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,767
Central City is just a day away
from making history

401
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,737
when the controversial
S.T.A.R. Lab's particle accelerator

402
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:15,856
is finally turned on.

403
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:17,607
Pretty cool,
right?

404
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:19,576
You know there's been
a hundred percent increase

405
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:22,029
in earthquakes since they've turned on
the Large Hadron Collider.

406
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:25,248
That data is misleading.
Oh, do tell.

407
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,233
You know about
misleading, don't you?

408
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:28,902
What are you
talking about?

409
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:30,454
He's not from CSI,
he's an assistant.

410
00:22:30,456 --> 00:22:32,572
Whose bosses don't know
you're in Starling.

411
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:34,124
And there is no similar case
in Central City.

412
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:36,727
So tell me, Barry...

413
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:40,764
What are you really
doing here?

414
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:47,788
I told you my mom
was murdered.

415
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,556
By your father.

416
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:51,441
He didn't do it.

417
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:54,694
You said that the police
didn't find the man who killed her.

418
00:22:56,297 --> 00:22:59,583
The police
think they did.

419
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:03,353
My dad has been serving
a life sentence.

420
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,608
They didn't believe me.

421
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,277
About what?

422
00:23:12,363 --> 00:23:15,515
I was 11.

423
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,305
One night...

424
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:26,610
something just came
into our house, like a tornado.

425
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:29,112
A blur.

426
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:34,351
Somewhere inside The Blur,
I saw a person.

427
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:37,487
My dad went to fight it.

428
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:41,341
I tried to get 'em
when suddenly...

429
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:48,865
I was 20 blocks
away from our house.

430
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,418
Nobody believed me.

431
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:56,006
They thought I was trying
to cover for my father.

432
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:58,258
But what I saw that night

433
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,293
was real.

434
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:02,179
As real as the man
that ripped down

435
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,764
that metal door
with his bare hands.

436
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:12,139
That's why I look
into cases like this.

437
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:17,394
The ones nobody
believes are possible.

438
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:20,330
Maybe if I can just
make sense of one,

439
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:25,018
I might be able to find out
who really killed my mother.

440
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,705
And free my dad.

441
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:36,696
I am sorry I lied to you.

442
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:41,718
Better find
another plus one.

443
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,545
He did like about
who he really was.

444
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:59,269
And what do we do every day?

445
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,750
Hey.

446
00:25:15,752 --> 00:25:16,885
How's everything
going in there?

447
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:18,553
Good evening,
Queens.

448
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:21,606
Can I have a word?
Yeah.

449
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:26,027
I'm sorry if I overreacted
a little bit earlier.

450
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,946
Oh, you think?

451
00:25:27,948 --> 00:25:30,932
Look, right now you need to apologize
to your mother. Not me.

452
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:32,300
For what?

453
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:33,685
Your being wrong.

454
00:25:41,294 --> 00:25:44,880
I guess these days,
I only draw a crowd

455
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:46,715
when I'm on trial
for murder.

456
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:48,450
Mom, you don't have to...

457
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:49,768
We have guests.

458
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:53,054
However few of them
there are.

459
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,626
This is not your fault, Ollie.

460
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:08,270
How's your mom doing?

461
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:11,857
Oh, you know us Queen women--
nothing gets to us.

462
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:13,474
You must take
after your dad.

463
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:15,777
Sorry.

464
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,196
Sin. What's up?

465
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:20,649
I found Max.
Where?

466
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:24,502
I'm on my way.
They find Max?

467
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:25,921
Um, no.

468
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:27,822
She just wants me
to stop by.

469
00:26:27,824 --> 00:26:29,124
I can come with you.

470
00:26:29,126 --> 00:26:31,793
You should stay here.
Your mom needs you.

471
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:33,494
Ok, I'll call you later.

472
00:26:46,325 --> 00:26:48,894
Time for a dance?

473
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:51,947
Not really feeling like
dancing with you, Oliver.

474
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:53,148
I know.

475
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,785
And that is why
I called him.

476
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:01,706
Fyi--

477
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:05,243
they will card him
at the bar.

478
00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:11,066
Hi.
Hi.

479
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:14,719
I was serious
about not being able to dance.

480
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:18,506
But I'll hold
your hands and sway.

481
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:20,809
Sold.
Ok.

482
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:42,948
I tried to warn you.

483
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,400
I tried to ignore you.

484
00:27:51,874 --> 00:27:55,260
I am sorry,
Oliver.

485
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:01,132
Yeah.

486
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:12,527
Oliver threw you
a lovely party.

487
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,062
Oliver's a good son,

488
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:16,731
if not the best
judge of character.

489
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:19,767
Is everything ok?

490
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:23,455
Everything's going perfectly.

491
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:50,238
He doesn't have long.

492
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:54,936
If this miracle drug is onboard,
then we need to find it now.

493
00:28:54,938 --> 00:28:58,473
Slade, be back
in a few minutes, ok?

494
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:00,975
I'll just get comfortable.

495
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:03,661
Come on.

496
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:11,036
There.

497
00:29:17,043 --> 00:29:18,877
Mirakuru.

498
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:21,963
Miracle.

499
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:25,266
I was never sure
it was real.

500
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:26,885
What happens
if we give it to Slade?

501
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:29,270
He needs a sedative
in his bloodstream first.

502
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:32,390
They might have
potassium bromide or barbital.

503
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:35,026
Ohh.

504
00:29:35,028 --> 00:29:37,695
It's empty.

505
00:29:37,697 --> 00:29:39,981
What happens if we give it
to him without the sedative?

506
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,901
Sarah!

507
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:44,702
He'll die, for sure.

508
00:29:44,704 --> 00:29:46,020
He's going
to die anyway.

509
00:29:46,022 --> 00:29:49,407
What was that?

510
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:53,428
Ivo and his men.
They're on the sub.

511
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:59,073
Have you made contact?
Yes.

512
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:00,856
He said to tell you that

513
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:03,469
your information was
gratefully accepted.

514
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:07,915
Thank you.

515
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,587
Who was that?

516
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:15,223
Nothing to worry about.

517
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:18,726
Thank you for tonight, Oliver.
It was a lovely party.

518
00:30:18,728 --> 00:30:21,129
I'm so sorry that
I put you through that.

519
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:23,555
Oh, listen, I don't care

520
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,433
what anyone else in
this city thinks of me.

521
00:30:25,434 --> 00:30:27,268
I only care
what you two think.

522
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:32,097
And I have to get
back to the office.

523
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,589
Excuse me.

524
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:39,680
Thea.

525
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:42,116
There's something
I need to tell you.

526
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:44,685
Sure. What is it?

527
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:51,676
I love you.

528
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,181
I love you, too.

529
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:04,689
Yes.

530
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:06,924
Yes, sir. I--

531
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:10,778
yes, director, I know that this is
not the first time.

532
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,615
Yes, sir, I do value
my job, very much.

533
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:17,135
Look, I will be on
the next train.

534
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:20,655
Mm-hmm. I'll be back
tonight. Ok.

535
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:23,508
Thank--

536
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:28,262
Well, my boss found out I don't
have food poisoning.

537
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:29,764
I need to get back
to Central City

538
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:31,799
if I still want
to be employed.

539
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:34,018
Which I do.

540
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,305
Tell the SCPD that
the sedative in the thief's blood

541
00:31:37,307 --> 00:31:39,173
is Ketamine. It's a schedule
three controlled substance.

542
00:31:39,175 --> 00:31:40,558
It shouldn't be
too hard to track.

543
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,109
Yeah, I'll make sure
they get it.

544
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:43,978
Thank you.
It was really nice--

545
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,614
thank you for--
working with you.

546
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:48,316
everything,
We couldn't have done it...

547
00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:50,168
Without you.

548
00:31:57,993 --> 00:32:00,161
Good-bye, Felicity.

549
00:32:02,764 --> 00:32:05,750
Good-bye.

550
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:10,037
Max!

551
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:12,673
Get off, let go!
Max! Get off of me!

552
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:13,674
Hey! Let her go.

553
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:15,092
Cut it out!

554
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:17,628
Stupid cops.

555
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,729
They're saying
Max ODed.

556
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:20,047
Was he using?
No!

557
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:22,483
He made extra cash
donating blood.

558
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:23,734
You really think
the hospital would let him

559
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:25,937
be a donor
if he was an addict?

560
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:39,333
Hey. Can't be here, kid.

561
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:41,752
Let's go.

562
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:48,626
They found trace amounts of
Ketamine in the thief's blood.

563
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:52,013
It's a common surgical anesthesia
derived from hydrochloric salt.

564
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:54,632
Can you use that
to track him?

565
00:32:54,634 --> 00:32:57,518
With the current concentration ratio
in the blood sample, there's only

566
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,205
one possible location with
a large enough quality of the sedative

567
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,673
that correlates
with the amount of blood

568
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:04,976
the stolen centrifuge
can process.

569
00:33:06,061 --> 00:33:08,362
What is it?
There's no sign.

570
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:10,781
A.R.G.U.S. doesn't
like to advertise.

571
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:12,783
It's a disaster bunker.
Right on the edge of the Glades.

572
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:14,402
A.R.G.U.S. has them
all over the country.

573
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:15,703
They store relief supplies--

574
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:17,872
food, clothing...
Medicine.

575
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:20,458
I'm on my way.

576
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:24,996
Oliver...

577
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:26,747
I can't believe
I'm actually saying this.

578
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:29,884
The way this arrowhead
is bent...

579
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:31,552
It means our thief's
muscle density

580
00:33:31,554 --> 00:33:35,456
is at least 120 pounds
per cubic foot.

581
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:38,225
That's almost the same
density as common concrete.

582
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:41,595
Your arrows may cut this guy,
but they will not stop him.

583
00:33:41,597 --> 00:33:44,849
Well, I've beat someone like
this before, Felicity.

584
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:46,884
I can do it again.

585
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:48,419
What if you can't?

586
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,525
Oliver.

587
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:03,868
Now this, it could save you...

588
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,003
Or it could kill you.

589
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:08,706
By the looks
on your faces,

590
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:12,510
I'm going to die anyway.

591
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,841
Sorry.

592
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:29,627
For what?

593
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:37,902
For not telling you
how I really feel.

594
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,978
Do it.

595
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:07,064
No!

596
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:13,053
What?

597
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:15,055
I need your help.

598
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:16,907
A friend of mine's
friend, well,

599
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:17,992
the cops think
he ODed, but we think

600
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:20,261
he was murdered.
Why?

601
00:35:20,263 --> 00:35:22,613
Well, he wasn't an addict,
for starters. And this...

602
00:35:22,615 --> 00:35:25,383
This doesn't look like
any OD I've ever seen.

603
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:29,236
Stay away from that.

604
00:35:29,238 --> 00:35:30,921
You know something?

605
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,940
What happened to him?

606
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,173
You're the one who told

607
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,510
me to be your eyes
and ears on the streets.

608
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,762
You know what, that is not
good enough for me anymore.

609
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:40,798
Fine. Then we're done
altogether.

610
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,716
I don't need you!

611
00:35:42,718 --> 00:35:44,918
I have friends
that can help me.

612
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,388
You can't stop us.

613
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,723
Slow you down.

614
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:52,309
Ah!

615
00:36:10,131 --> 00:36:13,532
And I thought it couldn't hurt
to add extra security guards.

616
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:16,185
It hurt them.

617
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:17,970
Badly.

618
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:20,139
Have you prepared Thea?

619
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:22,258
No.

620
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,678
You will not go near Thea,
you will not speak to her

621
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,147
and you will never
set foot in this house again.

622
00:36:28,149 --> 00:36:29,799
I set you free, Moira.

623
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,701
Your life belongs to me.

624
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:37,523
I am through
being afraid of you.

625
00:36:37,525 --> 00:36:40,493
You think
you can stop me?

626
00:36:40,495 --> 00:36:43,562
Even the Vigilante
couldn't kill me.

627
00:36:43,564 --> 00:36:46,198
No, he couldn't.

628
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,301
But I know someone who can.

629
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:51,304
Ra's al Ghul.

630
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:53,572
How do you know
that name?

631
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:55,474
Well, I didn't.

632
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:59,328
Until you mentioned
Nanda Parbat.

633
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,149
The League of Assassins,
however twisted their aims,

634
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:07,903
believes very deeply
in a code of honor.

635
00:37:07,905 --> 00:37:11,624
Your undertaking
betrayed that code.

636
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:13,058
You told Ra's
I'm still alive?

637
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,494
He was so grateful to hear it.

638
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:19,898
Because he so very much
wants to kill you himself.

639
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,753
So my advice to you, Malcolm...

640
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:26,555
Run.

641
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:34,213
This isn't
finished, Moira.

642
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,621
Who are you?

643
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:00,039
Merely a follower.

644
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,807
Of who?!
My brother.

645
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:03,442
Did he give you
the mirakuru?

646
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:04,777
Did he inject you with it?!

647
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:07,963
No. He saved me with it.

648
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:21,520
No.

649
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:23,856
Please.

650
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:26,826
Please!

651
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:29,044
Please.

652
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:46,479
Oliver!
Oliver!

653
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:48,898
Oliver!
Oliver!

654
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:53,719
Is he alive?

655
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:55,387
His pulse is weak,
but it's there. Oliver!

656
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:57,239
Can you hear me?

657
00:39:57,241 --> 00:39:59,992
His pupils are dilated!

658
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:01,827
What the hell
was that?

659
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:03,929
I don't know,
it's coded.

660
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:08,117
Damn it. Damn it!

661
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:10,503
I can't break into
the dispensary files.

662
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:12,087
I have no idea
what he was injected with!

663
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:13,923
Poisoned with.

664
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:15,774
All right, we have no choice.
What are you doing?

665
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:17,293
Calling 9-1-1.

666
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:18,427
Dig, wait!
Can't wait!

667
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:20,596
How are we supposed
to explain this?

668
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:22,080
Everyone's going to find out
Oliver's the Vigilante!

669
00:40:22,082 --> 00:40:23,516
Which won't matter
if he's dead.

670
00:40:23,518 --> 00:40:25,417
Felicity, we can't save him!

671
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:26,802
I know, you're right...

672
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:29,772
We can't.

673
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:40,533
One way to Central City.

674
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:42,651
It left
ten minutes ago.

675
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:44,737
Of course it did.

676
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:46,155
When is the next one?

677
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:47,590
In the morning.

678
00:41:04,674 --> 00:41:06,508
Ahh.

679
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,144
Ohh.

680
00:41:56,643 --> 00:42:00,145
Please save my friend.

681
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,170
