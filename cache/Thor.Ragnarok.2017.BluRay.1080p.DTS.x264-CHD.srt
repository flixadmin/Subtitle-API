1
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,449
Now, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,999
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,869
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

4
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,899
just to get a straight
answer out of somebody.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,440
It's a long story, but
basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

6
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,126
See, I spent some time on Earth...

7
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,719
Fought some robots, saved the
planet a couple of times.

8
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,429
Then I went searching through the cosmos

9
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,649
for some magic, colorful
Infinity Stone things.

10
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,809
Didn't find any.

11
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,019
That's when I came across a
path of death and destruction,

12
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,964
which led me all the way
here into this cage,

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,823
where I met you.

14
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,720
How much longer do you think we'll be here?

15
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,637
Thor, son of Odin.

16
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,269
Surtur, son of a bitch.

17
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,472
You're still alive.

18
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,859
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

19
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,649
I cannot die.

20
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,569
Not until I fulfill my destiny

21
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,989
and lay waste to your home.

22
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,644
It's funny you should mention that.

23
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,119
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

24
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,539
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

25
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,499
And you, Surtur, are at the
center of all of them.

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,499
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

27
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,562
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.

28
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,893
Hang on.

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,299
I'll be back around shortly.

30
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,431
I really feel like we
were connecting there.

31
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,179
Okay, so Ragnarok. Tell me about that.
Walk me through it.

32
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,349
My time has come.

33
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,649
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame,

34
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,479
I shall be restored to my full might.

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,899
I will tower over the mountains,

36
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,659
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

37
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,369
Hang on. Give it a second.

38
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,449
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.

39
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,192
I'm really sorry.

40
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,829
Okay, so let me get this straight.

41
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,629
You're going to put your
crown into the Eternal Flame

42
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,169
and then you'll suddenly
grow as big as a house?

43
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,449
A mountain!

44
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,719
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,429
Odin is not on Asgard.

46
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,519
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,519
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,883
This is my crown, the source of my power.

49
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,479
Oh, that's a crown. I thought
it was a big eyebrow.

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,770
It's a crown.

51
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,489
Anyway, it sounds like all I
have to do to stop Ragnarok

52
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,475
is rip that thing off your head.

53
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,249
But Ragnarok has already begun.

54
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,367
You cannot stop it.

55
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,009
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

56
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,759
All will suffer, all will burn.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,639
That's intense.

58
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,639
To be honest, seeing you grow really big

59
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,396
and set fire to a planet would
be quite the spectacle.

60
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,149
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B,

61
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,069
where I bust out of these chains,

62
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,109
knock that tiara off your head, and
stash it away in Asgard's vault.

63
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,239
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

64
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,619
Why fight it?

65
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,515
Because that's what heroes do.

66
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,435
Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't time that right.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,610
And, now!

68
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,809
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

69
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,710
I make grave mistakes all the time.

70
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,134
Everything seems to work out.

71
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,771
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,
but I could really use a fast exit.

72
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,466
Heimdall?

73
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,359
Heimdall was an idiot.

74
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,521
This job should have made him rich.

75
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,894
Now, the job ain't easy

76
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,989
but it does have its benefits.

77
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,409
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.

78
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,935
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.

79
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,499
Behold...

80
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,007
My stuff.

81
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,879
I'm particularly fond of these.

82
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,599
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

83
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,952
I even named them. Des and Troy.

84
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,069
You see, when you put them together,

85
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,229
they destroy.

86
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,277
Heimdall, come on.

87
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,388
Stay!

88
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,195
Heimdall? I'm running short on options.

89
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,907
Heimdall?

90
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,423
Skurge?

91
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,101
Is that important?

92
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,037
You girls are in for a treat.

93
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,044
Girls!

94
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,769
Well, well, well. Look
who decided to pop in.

95
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,729
Thanks for scaring away my company and
drenching my workplace in brains.

96
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,819
Who are you?

97
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,149
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
We fought together on Vanaheim.

98
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,631
Right. Where is Heimdall?

99
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,854
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

100
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,499
Traitor?

101
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,289
Yeah. You see, Odin charged
Heimdall with negligence of duty

102
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,369
but he disappeared before the trial.

103
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,749
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.

104
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,839
Sure.

105
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,640
Hold on. I'm supposed to
announce your arrival.

106
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,202
What the hell is that?

107
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,919
Oh, brother. This is it.

108
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,441
I take my leave.

109
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,339
You fool, you didn't listen!

110
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,498
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,697
Lady Sif, get help!

112
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,006
Somebody, help!

113
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,246
Sorry for all I've done.

114
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,130
It's all right. Hold on.

115
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,769
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

116
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,247
They'd be lucky to have you.

117
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,401
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

118
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,229
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.

119
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,553
I'm a trickster.

120
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,639
So mischievous.

121
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,489
Sorry about that time I
turned you into a frog.

122
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,056
It was a wonderful joke.

123
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,369
'Twas indeed hilarious.

124
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,739
You are the savior of Asgard.

125
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,749
- Tell my story.
- I will.

126
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,129
Build a statue for me.

127
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,039
We will build a big statue for you.

128
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,215
With my helmet on, with
the big bendy horns.

129
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,277
I will tell Father what you did here today.

130
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,070
I didn't do it for him.

131
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,119
I didn't do it for him.

132
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,875
No!

133
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,239
And so, Loki died of his wounds,

134
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,319
giving his life for ours.

135
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,159
He fought back those disgusting elves,

136
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,119
he brought peace to the realm.

137
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,656
Loki, my boy...

138
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,314
'Twas many moons ago I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.

139
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,339
On that day, I did not yet see in you

140
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,799
Asgard's savior. No.

141
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,773
You were merely a little blue baby icicle

142
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,630
that melted this old fool's heart.

143
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,548
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

144
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,167
Father.

145
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,268
Shit.

146
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,989
My son, Thor, has returned!

147
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,644
Greetings, my boy.

148
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,029
It's an interesting play. What's it called?

149
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,289
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The
people wanted to commemorate him.

150
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,723
Indeed they should.

151
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,227
I like the statue.

152
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,589
A lot better looking than he
was when he was alive, though.

153
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,663
A little less weaselly, less greasy, maybe.

154
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,728
Do you know what this is?

155
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,599
The skull of Surtur. That's
a formidable weapon!

156
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,309
Do me a favor. Lock this away in a vault

157
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,850
so it doesn't turn into a giant
monster and destroy the whole planet.

158
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,336
Thank you, dear.

159
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,809
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

160
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,957
Nope.

161
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,239
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

162
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,199
Every night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.

163
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,446
That's just a silly dream,

164
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,619
signs of an overactive imagination.

165
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,699
Possibly.

166
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,869
But then I decide to go out
there and investigate.

167
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,079
And what do I find, but the Nine
Realms completely in chaos.

168
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,209
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,

169
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,299
all while you, Odin, the
protector of those Nine Realms,

170
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,219
are sitting here in your
bathrobe, eating grapes.

171
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,639
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbors' freedom.

172
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,948
Yes, of course, the
freedom to be massacred.

173
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,639
Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself.

174
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,743
Watching theater.

175
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,899
Board meetings, and security
council meetings...

176
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,929
- You're really gonna make me do it?
- Do what?

177
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,859
You know that nothing will stop
Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.

178
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,470
Not even your face.

179
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,909
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

180
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,678
Then I'll see you on the
other side, brother.

181
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,437
All right, I yield.

182
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,483
Behold!

183
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,675
Thor...

184
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,871
- Odinson.
- No.

185
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,931
You had one job. Just the one.

186
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,005
Where's Odin?

187
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,029
You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Everything was fine without you.

188
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,974
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

189
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,029
- Ask them.
- Where's Father? Did you kill him?

190
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,852
You had what you wanted. You had
the independence you asked for.

191
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,748
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

192
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,835
I swear I left him right here.

193
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,139
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?

194
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,349
Great planning.

195
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,639
How was I supposed to know?

196
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,107
Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.

197
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,427
No? Then why do you dress like one?

198
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,769
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.

199
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,078
I saw you die. I mourned
you, I cried for you.

200
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,631
I'm honored.

201
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,753
Ask him.

202
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,649
Hi. Would you mind taking
a picture with us?

203
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,753
Sure.

204
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,604
Start figuring out where he is.

205
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,539
Oh, my God.

206
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,084
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

207
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,680
She didn't dump me, you know.

208
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,987
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.

209
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,901
What's this? What are you doing?

210
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,244
This isn't me.

211
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,573
Loki.

212
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,739
Thor Odinson.

213
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,808
God of Thunder.

214
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,514
You can put down the umbrella.

215
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,255
So, Earth has wizards now?

216
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,249
The preferred term is "Master
of the Mystic Arts."

217
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,353
You can leave that now.

218
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,408
All right, wizard. Who are you?
Why should I care?

219
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,879
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.

220
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,983
Take a seat.

221
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,161
Tea?

222
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,935
I don't drink tea.

223
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,315
What do you drink?

224
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,685
Not tea.

225
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,689
So, I keep a watch list of individuals
and beings from other realms

226
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,149
that may be a threat to this world.

227
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:55,239
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

228
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,126
He's a worthy inclusion.

229
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,459
Then why bring him here?

230
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,258
We're looking for my father.

231
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,959
So, if I were to tell you where Odin was,

232
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,459
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

233
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,563
Promptly.

234
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,097
Great! Then I'll help you.

235
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,545
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

236
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,509
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.

237
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,759
Your father said he had
chosen to remain in exile.

238
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,056
And you don't have a phone.

239
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,056
No, I don't have a phone,

240
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,819
but you could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.

241
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,849
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?

242
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,819
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.

243
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,739
So if you could tell me where
he is, I can take him home.

244
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,802
Gladly. He's in Norway.

245
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,449
I'm just seeing whether this incantation
requires any Asgardian modifications.

246
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,727
Nope.

247
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,836
We don't need that.

248
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,105
Will you stop doing that?

249
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,139
I need just one strand of your hair.

250
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,217
Let me explain something. My
hair is not to be meddled with.

251
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,073
We could have just walked.

252
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,579
He's waiting for you.

253
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,915
All right.

254
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,560
Don't forget your umbrella.

255
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,870
Yes.

256
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,752
Sorry.

257
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,060
There we go.

258
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,522
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

259
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,964
Yeah. Right.

260
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,500
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

261
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,609
You can handle him from here.

262
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,739
Yes. Of course. Thank you
very much for your help.

263
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,819
Good luck.

264
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,113
Handle me? Who are you?

265
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,829
Loki.

266
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,239
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

267
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,938
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

268
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,053
Bye-bye.

269
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,642
Father?

270
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,034
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

271
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,812
Father, it's us.

272
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,696
My sons.

273
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,959
I've been waiting for you.

274
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,798
I know. We've come to take you home.

275
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,717
Home, yes.

276
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,773
Your mother, she calls me.

277
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,153
Do you hear it?

278
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,798
Loki, lift your magic.

279
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,099
Took me quite a while to
break free from your spell.

280
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,754
Frigga would have been proud.

281
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,755
Come and sit with me. I
don't have much time.

282
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,788
I know we failed you.

283
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,341
But we can make this right.

284
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,347
I failed you.

285
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,681
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

286
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,068
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

287
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,618
No.

288
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,333
It has already begun. She's coming.

289
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,915
My life was all that held her back.
But my time has come.

290
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,254
I cannot keep her away any longer.

291
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,378
Father, who are you talking about?

292
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,149
Goddess of Death. Hela.

293
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,649
My firstborn.

294
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,713
Your sister.

295
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,620
Your what?

296
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,041
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

297
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:12,640
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.
Locked her away.

298
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,821
She draws her strength from Asgard,

299
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,713
and once she gets there, her
powers will be limitless.

300
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,299
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.

301
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,403
No, we won't.

302
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,769
I'm on a different path now.

303
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,380
This you must face alone.

304
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,484
I love you, my sons.

305
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,674
Look at that.

306
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,292
Remember this place.

307
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,314
Home.

308
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,192
Brother.

309
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,858
This was your doing.

310
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,507
So he's gone.

311
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,630
That's a shame. I would've
liked to have seen that.

312
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,538
You must be Hela.

313
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,483
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

314
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,352
Really? You don't look like him.

315
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,399
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

316
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,473
You sound like him.

317
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,461
Kneel.

318
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,007
Beg your pardon?

319
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,909
Kneel.

320
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,880
Before your queen.

321
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,521
I don't think so.

322
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,427
It's not possible.

323
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,397
Darling, you have no idea what's possible.

324
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,240
Bring us back!

325
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,393
No!

326
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,571
Loki!

327
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,402
Who are you? What have you done with Thor?

328
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,589
I'm Hela.

329
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm just a janitor.

330
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,315
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

331
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,935
How would you like a job?

332
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,862
Are you a fighter?

333
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,011
Or are you food?

334
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,129
I'm just passing through.

335
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,196
It is food.

336
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,466
On your knees.

337
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,679
He's mine.

338
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,016
Wait!

339
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,035
Wait!

340
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,362
He's mine.

341
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,789
So if you want him, you go through me.

342
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,356
But we've already got him.

343
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,131
All right, then. I guess I go through you.

344
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,990
More food.

345
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,654
Thank you.

346
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,739
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

347
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,789
I've got something special.

348
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,359
Hey! Where are you taking me?

349
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,897
Answer me!

350
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,385
Hey!

351
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,309
I am Thor, son of Odin. I
need to get back to Asgard.

352
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,247
Many apologies, your majesty.

353
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,007
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

354
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,299
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,

355
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,849
the commander of the Legions of Asgard,

356
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,576
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.

357
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,569
My father is dead.

358
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,643
As are the princes. You're welcome.

359
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,699
We were once the seat of
absolute power in the cosmos.

360
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,029
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

361
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,289
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

362
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,061
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

363
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,980
And I am here to restore that power.

364
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,839
Kneel before me

365
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,306
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

366
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,179
Whoever you are,

367
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,349
whatever you've done, surrender now!

368
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,729
Or we will show you no mercy.

369
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,109
Whoever I am? Did you
listen to a word I said?

370
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,371
This is your last warning!

371
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,837
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

372
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,623
Fine.

373
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,355
Charge!

374
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,815
I've missed this.

375
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,870
Still, it's a shame.

376
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,359
Good soldiers dying for nothing,

377
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,885
all because they couldn't see the future.

378
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,427
Sad.

379
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,712
Look, still alive.

380
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,959
Change of heart?

381
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,672
Go back to whatever cave you crept out of.

382
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,240
You evil demoness!

383
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,401
Let's go see my palace.

384
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,630
Fear not, for you are found.

385
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,631
You are home, and there is no going back.

386
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,979
No one leaves this place.

387
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,809
But what is this place?

388
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:29,350
The answer is Sakaar.

389
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,510
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,

390
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,239
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.

391
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,949
It is the collection point for
all lost and unloved things.

392
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,829
Like you.

393
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,749
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.

394
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,404
You are valuable.

395
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,931
Here you are loved.

396
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,063
What the hell?

397
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,419
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.

398
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,759
He is the original, the first
lost and the first found.

399
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,050
The creator of Sakaar,

400
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,509
and father of the Contest of Champions.

401
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,979
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.

402
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,309
You are the property of the Grandmaster.

403
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,920
Congratulations!

404
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,810
You will meet the Grandmaster
in five seconds.

405
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,341
Prepare yourself.

406
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,329
Prepare yourself.

407
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,618
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.

408
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,509
He's wonderful. It is a he?

409
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,899
It is a he.

410
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,099
I love when you come to visit, 142.

411
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,889
You bring me the best stuff.

412
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,599
Whenever we get to talking,
Topaz, about Scrapper 142,

413
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,309
what do I always say? "She is
the..." And it starts with a "B."

414
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,457
Trash.

415
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,433
No, not trash.

416
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,239
Were you waiting just to call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."

417
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,486
Booze hag.

418
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,539
I'm so sorry. No, "best." I
was thinking about "best."

419
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,875
'Cause I always say you're the best.

420
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,999
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

421
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,959
You say that every time she's here.

422
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,589
What have you brought today? Tell me.

423
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,693
A contender.

424
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,941
A what?

425
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,169
I need to go closer. I want
to get a closer look at this.

426
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,331
Can you take us closer? Thank you.

427
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,793
Pay this lady.

428
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,769
Just wait a damn minute.

429
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,438
I'm not for sale.

430
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,239
Man, he's a fighter.

431
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,707
I take 10 million.

432
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,897
Tell her she's dreaming.

433
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,111
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.

434
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,662
You'll pay for this.

435
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,181
No, I got paid for this.

436
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,588
Here's what I wanna know.

437
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,179
Who are you?

438
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,778
I am the God of Thunder.

439
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,375
I didn't hear any thunder, but out
of your fingers, was that sparkles?

440
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,771
We've located your cousin.

441
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,692
Good!

442
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,069
Yeah, come on. I think
you're gonna like this.

443
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,159
There he is.

444
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,539
Hey, cuz.

445
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,449
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

446
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,553
Hi.

447
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,505
So...

448
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,731
Please.

449
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,943
I'm sorry.

450
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,290
Yeah.

451
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,719
Carlo...

452
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,055
I pardon you.

453
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,601
Thank you.

454
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,743
Thank you.

455
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,145
You're officially pardoned. From life.

456
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,939
Help me.

457
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,439
Oh, my God!

458
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,645
I'm stepping in it. I'm
stepping in it. Look!

459
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,562
The smell.

460
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,155
What does it smell like?

461
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,535
Burnt toast.

462
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,424
What happened to my manners?

463
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,249
I haven't properly introduced myself.

464
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,367
Come on. Follow me.

465
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,749
My name is Grandmaster.

466
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,339
I preside over a little harlequinade
called the Contest of Champions.

467
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,219
People come from far and wide to
unwillingly participate in it.

468
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,089
And you, my friend, might
just be part of the new cast.

469
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,179
What do you say to that?

470
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,429
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

471
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,897
I'm going back to Asgard.

472
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,580
Ass-gard.

473
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,243
One, two, three, four.

474
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,819
There was a wormhole in
space and time beneath me.

475
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,039
At that moment, I let go.

476
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,446
Loki?

477
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,489
Loki! Loki!

478
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,552
Over here. Over here.

479
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,461
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!

480
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,401
- What?
- You're alive?

481
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,419
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?

482
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,589
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

483
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,288
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.

484
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,049
- Get me out of this one. Get me out.
- I can't.

485
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,385
- I can't.
- What?

486
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,118
I've made friends with this man.
He's called the Grandmaster.

487
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,639
- He's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.

488
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,389
The Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago.

489
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,636
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.

490
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,783
I just got here.

491
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,173
What are you whispering about?

492
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,059
Time works real different
around these parts.

493
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,269
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

494
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,056
But here on Sakaar...

495
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,159
In any case, you know this...

496
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,579
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

497
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,079
God of Thunder. Tell him.

498
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,909
I've never met this man in my life.

499
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,696
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.

500
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,956
Is he any kind of a fighter?

501
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,289
You take this thing out of
my neck and I'll show you.

502
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,169
Now, listen to that. He's threatening me.

503
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,299
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

504
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,629
If you wanna get back to
Ass-place, Assberg...

505
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,719
Asgard.

506
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,889
Any contender who defeats my champion,

507
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,889
their freedom they shall win.

508
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,269
Fine. Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

509
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,979
That's what I call, contender.

510
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,648
Direction would be this way, Lord.

511
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,213
Loki!

512
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,110
Hey. Take it easy, man.

513
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,723
Over here.

514
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,539
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

515
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,249
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.

516
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,329
Allow me to introduce myself.

517
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,499
My name is Korg. I'm kind
of like the leader in here.

518
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,089
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.
But don't let that intimidate you.

519
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,169
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.

520
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,639
Just a little rock-paper-scissor
joke for you.

521
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,559
This is my very good
friend over here, Miek.

522
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,592
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

523
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,540
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

524
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,309
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

525
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,439
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

526
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,779
So hardly anyone turned up, except for
my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.

527
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,779
As punishment, I was forced to be
in here and become a gladiator.

528
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,409
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

529
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,289
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

530
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,369
I don't know if you'd be
interested in something like that.

531
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,487
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

532
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,662
How did you...

533
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,589
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.

534
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,929
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

535
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,759
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here, man.

536
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,929
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.

537
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,429
Has anyone here fought the
Grandmaster's champion?

538
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,621
Doug has.

539
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,793
Doug!

540
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,140
Our luck, Doug's dead.

541
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,269
That's right.

542
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,779
Everyone who fights the
Grandmaster's champion perishes.

543
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,609
What about you? You're made of rocks.

544
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,449
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

545
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,449
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

546
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,369
Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?

547
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,980
Yes, I am.

548
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,584
Gonna fight him, win, and get
the hell out of this place.

549
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,959
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

550
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,989
See you later, new Doug.

551
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,530
Does no one remember me?

552
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,732
Has no one been taught our history?

553
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,680
Look at these lies.

554
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,840
Goblets and garden parties?

555
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,742
Peace treaties?

556
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,749
Odin...

557
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,566
Proud to have it,

558
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,101
ashamed of how he got it.

559
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,469
We were unstoppable.

560
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:48,531
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.

561
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,359
One by one, the realms became ours.

562
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,739
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his,

563
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,659
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

564
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,619
Before that, Asgard's
warriors were honored,

565
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,623
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

566
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,375
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.

567
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,162
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

568
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,815
Or weak.

569
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,975
Smaller than I thought it would be.

570
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,899
That's not bad.

571
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,323
But this...

572
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,129
The Eternal Flame.

573
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,541
Want to see what true
power really looks like?

574
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,204
Fenris, my darling, what
have they done to you?

575
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:49,900
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

576
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,187
I've missed you.

577
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,947
I've missed you all.

578
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,607
Odin,

579
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,209
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,

580
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,823
where the brave shall live forever.

581
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,589
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,

582
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,578
for those that have died
the glorious death.

583
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,916
Hurts, doesn't it?

584
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,043
Being lied to.

585
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,751
Being told you're one thing and
then learning it's all a fiction.

586
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,409
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

587
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,350
This place is disgusting.

588
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,079
Does this mean you don't want my help?

589
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,249
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

590
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,379
It took me time to win his trust. He's
a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

591
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,799
What I'm telling you is, you could
join me at the Grandmaster's side.

592
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,905
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

593
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,213
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

594
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,824
Our sister destroyed your
hammer like a piece of glass.

595
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,279
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.

596
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,835
You don't stand a chance.

597
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:30,263
Do you understand what I'm saying here?

598
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,651
Fine.

599
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,026
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

600
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,773
Like I've always done.

601
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,103
Would you say something?

602
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,349
Say something!

603
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,747
What would you like me to say?

604
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:57,269
You faked your own death,

605
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,939
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,

606
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,578
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.

607
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,466
Have I said enough or would you like me to
go back further than the past two days?

608
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,489
You know, I haven't seen this
beloved champion he talks of,

609
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,695
but I've heard he is astonishingly savage.

610
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,154
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

611
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,376
Don't let me down.

612
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,864
Piss off, ghost!

613
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,934
He's freaking gone.

614
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,163
Yuck!

615
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,439
There's still someone's hair
and blood all over this.

616
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,319
Guys, can you clean up the weapons
once you finish your fight?

617
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,423
Disgusting slobs.

618
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,240
Thor,

619
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,497
wanna use a big wooden fork?

620
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,869
No.

621
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,159
Yeah, not really useful.

622
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,030
Unless you're fighting off three
vampires that were huddled together.

623
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,172
I really wish I had my hammer.

624
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,499
Hammer?

625
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,579
Quite unique.

626
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,568
It was made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.

627
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,799
And when I spun it really, really
fast, it gave me the ability to fly.

628
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,046
You rode a hammer?

629
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,788
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

630
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,255
The hammer rode you on your back?

631
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,809
No. I used to spin it really fast,
and it would pull me off the...

632
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,979
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?

633
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,859
The ground. It would pull me off the
ground, up into the air, and I would fly.

634
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,019
Every time I threw it, it
would always come back to me.

635
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,859
Sounds like you had a pretty special and
intimate relationship with this hammer

636
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,300
and that losing it was almost
comparable to losing a loved one.

637
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,347
That's a nice way of putting it.

638
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,251
I said they're mine.

639
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,619
See her, that's the one
that put me in here.

640
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,959
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

641
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,169
Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.

642
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,009
They are hard to perish.

643
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,620
Asgardian?

644
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,113
Hey.

645
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,323
Hey.

646
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:53,993
Hey.

647
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,018
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

648
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,086
Asgard is in danger.

649
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,154
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

650
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,319
I used to wanna be a
Valkyrie when I was younger,

651
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,819
until I found out that you were all women.

652
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,159
There's nothing wrong with
women, of course. I love women.

653
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,869
Sometimes a little too much.

654
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,039
Not in a creepy way, just more
of a respectful appreciation.

655
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,669
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.

656
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,324
It's about time.

657
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:27,839
Are you done?

658
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,919
Lord of Thunder, you're up.

659
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,049
Please, help me. I need your help.

660
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,153
Bye.

661
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,549
Fine, then you must be
a traitor or a coward.

662
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,119
Because the Valkyrie is sworn
to protect the throne.

663
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,059
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

664
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,089
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

665
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,269
Bring him in for processing.

666
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:51,548
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

667
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,789
Now, don't you move.

668
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,589
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

669
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:10,759
By Odin's beard, you shall not cut my hair,

670
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,428
lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.

671
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,356
Please. Please, kind
sir, do not cut my hair.

672
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,871
Please! No!

673
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,125
No!

674
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,739
Look at all of you. What a show!
What a night!

675
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,843
Who's having fun?

676
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:45,039
Please, I'm your host.

677
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,419
Big round of applause for all
of our undercard competitors,

678
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,379
who today died so gruesomely.

679
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,715
Good sports.

680
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,602
What a show! What a night!

681
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,151
This is what you've come
for, and so have I.

682
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,649
And now, without further ado,

683
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,406
it's main event time.

684
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,359
Making his first appearance,
though he looks quite promising,

685
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,378
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.

686
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:20,579
I'll say no more, see what you think.

687
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,124
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

688
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,517
Lord of Thunder.

689
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,479
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.

690
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,715
Okay, this is it.

691
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,891
Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.

692
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,150
He is a creature.

693
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,039
What can we say about him?

694
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,079
Well, he's unique. There's none like him.

695
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,112
I feel a special connection with him.

696
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,759
He's undefeated.

697
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,786
He's the reigning.

698
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,391
He's the defending.

699
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,846
Ladies and gentlemen...

700
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,048
I give you...

701
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,035
Your Incredible...

702
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,286
Hulk!

703
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,327
Yes!

704
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,281
I have to get off this planet.

705
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,783
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

706
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,059
We know each other.

707
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,595
He's a friend from work.

708
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,126
Where have you been?

709
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,439
Everybody thought you were dead.

710
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,645
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

711
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,806
I lost my hammer.

712
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:25,029
Like, yesterday, so that's
still pretty fresh.

713
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,539
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?

714
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,731
He's up there.

715
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:31,051
Loki! Look who it is!

716
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,289
Banner, I never thought I would say this,

717
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,709
but I'm happy to see you.

718
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,466
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

719
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,283
Banner.

720
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,661
Hey, Banner!

721
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:52,267
No Banner. Only Hulk.

722
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,094
What are you doing?

723
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,754
It's me. It's Thor!

724
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,213
Banner, we're friends.

725
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,014
This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

726
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,389
Here we go.

727
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,265
What?

728
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,284
Hey, big guy.

729
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,209
The sun's getting real low.

730
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,905
That's it. The sun's going down.

731
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,479
I won't hurt you anymore.

732
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,178
No one will.

733
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:36,919
Yes!

734
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,166
That's how it feels!

735
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,489
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

736
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,678
All right. Screw it.

737
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:05,595
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out!

738
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,749
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

739
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,085
I told them we were friends!

740
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,423
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

741
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:59,390
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

742
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,448
Another day, another Doug.

743
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,519
What is that noise?

744
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,439
The common folk aren't
exactly falling in line.

745
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,630
There's a resistance trying to
knock down the front gates.

746
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,829
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

747
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:01,539
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

748
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:05,579
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.
What I meant was,

749
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,366
what's your ambition?

750
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:12,101
I just want a chance to prove myself.

751
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,586
Recognition.

752
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:15,141
When I was young,

753
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:18,969
every great king had an executioner.

754
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,179
Not just to execute people,

755
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,024
but also to execute their vision.

756
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:27,769
But mainly to execute people.

757
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:29,975
Still, it was a great honor.

758
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,697
I was Odin's executioner.

759
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:40,187
And you shall be my executioner.

760
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,415
Let's begin our conquest.

761
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,376
Skurge, where's the sword?

762
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,727
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

763
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:13,689
Those people you mentioned, the ones
who aren't falling into line...

764
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,315
Round them up.

765
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,983
Excuse me.

766
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,708
Sorry about that. These
bloody things are everywhere.

767
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:57,812
Come on.

768
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,492
You'll be safe here.

769
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,983
Are we cool?

770
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,402
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

771
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,274
So how long have you been like that?

772
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,953
Like what?

773
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,055
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

774
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,253
Hulk always Hulk.

775
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,226
How'd you get here?

776
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:10,017
Winning.

777
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,847
You mean cheating?

778
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:14,289
Were they wearing one
of these when you won?

779
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,723
How'd you arrive here?

780
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,749
Quinjet.

781
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,594
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

782
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,219
That's naked.

783
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,106
He's very naked.

784
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,073
It's in my brain now.

785
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,859
Quinjet.

786
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,721
Yes!

787
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,394
I'm getting us out of here.

788
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,999
This terrible, awful place.

789
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,879
You're gonna love Asgard. It's big.
It's golden. Shiny.

790
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,401
Hulk stay.

791
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:04,191
No, no, no. My people need
me to get back to Asgard.

792
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:06,509
We must prevent Ragnarok.

793
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:07,800
Ragnarok?

794
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,566
The prophesied death of my home world.
The end of days, it's the end of...

795
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,599
If you help me get back to Asgard,

796
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,939
I can help you get back to Earth.

797
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,043
Earth hate Hulk.

798
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,842
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.

799
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,848
You're one of the Avengers. One
of the team, one of our friends.

800
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,149
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

801
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:27,429
You're Banner's friend.

802
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,859
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

803
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,949
Banner's friend.

804
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,079
I don't even like Banner.

805
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,255
"I'm into numbers and science and stuff."

806
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,249
Thor go. Hulk stay.

807
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,353
Fine.

808
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,206
Stay here.

809
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,339
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.

810
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,155
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.

811
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:48,969
Smash you.

812
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:51,469
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

813
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:53,759
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

814
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,679
- Baby arms.
- What?

815
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,783
Baby.

816
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,628
Moron! You big child.

817
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,729
Thor go!

818
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:01,109
I am going.

819
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:07,300
Thor go again.

820
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,243
Thor home.

821
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,992
Hulk trains.

822
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,259
That's great. Have fun.

823
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,049
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.

824
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:30,483
What have you been up to?

825
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:31,613
Winning.

826
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,440
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

827
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,645
I need you to help me.

828
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:52,047
Help me see.

829
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,836
I see you, but you're far away.

830
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,879
What's going on here?

831
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,441
Come see for yourself.

832
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:13,969
I'm providing refuge in a
stronghold built by our ancestors.

833
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:17,559
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

834
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,809
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

835
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:25,039
We won't last long if we stay.

836
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:28,149
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.

837
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,396
Come on.

838
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,894
Hela is ravenous.

839
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:38,159
If I let her leave, she'll consume
Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

840
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,274
We need you.

841
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:41,869
I'm working on it. But I don't
even know where the hell I am.

842
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:44,209
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways.
Go through one.

843
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:46,327
- Which one?
- The big one.

844
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,713
Thor sad.

845
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,075
Shut up.

846
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,030
Thor sad.

847
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,884
I'm not sad, you idiot.

848
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,499
I'm pissed off!

849
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:30,730
Angry. I lost my father.

850
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:33,063
I lost my hammer.

851
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:37,255
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
- You're not even listening.

852
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:39,132
Don't kick stuff.

853
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,599
You're being a really bad friend.

854
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,935
You bad friend!

855
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,349
- You know what we call you?
- No.

856
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:47,309
We call you the stupid Avenger.

857
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,427
You're tiny Avenger!

858
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:53,219
What, are you crazy?

859
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,359
Yes.

860
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,160
You know what? Earth does hate you.

861
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:18,668
No.

862
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:24,914
I'm sorry I said those things.

863
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:29,393
You're not the stupid Avenger.
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

864
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,210
It's okay.

865
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:33,819
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.

866
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,689
I know. I'm sorry. I just
get so angry all the time.

867
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:38,989
Hulk always, always angry.

868
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:41,570
I know. We're the same, you and I.

869
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:43,579
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

870
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:47,946
Yeah, same. Hulk like
fire, Thor like water.

871
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,329
We're kind of both like fire.

872
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,535
But Hulk like real fire.

873
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,879
Hulk like raging fire.

874
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,361
Thor like smoldering fire.

875
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,669
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.

876
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,714
Angry girl.

877
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:20,381
What's going on? What are you...

878
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,209
You're so thick-headed that you can't tell

879
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:34,209
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone?

880
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:37,099
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.

881
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:38,748
I need her to stay.

882
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,903
Stay?

883
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:41,676
Block.

884
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,334
Stay.

885
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,959
- Please.
- Please.

886
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,743
All right.

887
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:54,679
Here's the deal.

888
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,946
I'll listen to you

889
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,991
till this is empty.

890
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,739
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.

891
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,680
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

892
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:08,487
Finished. Bye.

893
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:11,421
Odin is dead.

894
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,151
Hela, the Goddess of
Death, has invaded Asgard.

895
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:20,469
If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.

896
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:22,124
I'm going to stop her.

897
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,922
- Alone?
- Nope.

898
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,491
I'm putting together a team.

899
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:28,542
It's me, you, and the big guy.

900
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,019
No. No team. Only Hulk.

901
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,849
It's me and you.

902
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,085
I think it's only you.

903
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:36,519
Please, listen. The Valkyrie are legend.

904
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,232
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

905
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:42,569
I'm not getting dragged into another
one of Odin's family squabbles.

906
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,489
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.

907
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,569
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.

908
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:49,239
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace

909
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,894
and tried to seize the throne.

910
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,039
When she tried to escape her banishment

911
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,664
he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.

912
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,929
I only survived because...

913
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:03,839
Look, I already faced her once back
when I believed in the throne,

914
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,219
and it cost me everything.

915
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,389
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

916
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,599
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

917
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,033
I agree.

918
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,376
Don't get familiar.

919
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:15,211
I agree.

920
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,884
That's why I turned down the throne.

921
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,189
But this isn't about the crown.
This is about the people.

922
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:22,359
They're dying and they're your people, too.

923
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,463
Forget it.

924
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:26,171
I have.

925
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,535
- Okay.
- Okay.

926
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:28,905
- Good. Great.
- Great.

927
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,029
Thank you.

928
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:31,872
- For what?
- For this.

929
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,375
Didn't see that, did you?

930
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:39,099
There... That's better.

931
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,549
You know, go ahead.

932
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:47,219
Stay here and enslave
people for that lunatic.

933
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,741
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

934
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,095
But me...

935
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:55,511
I choose to run toward my
problems and not away from them.

936
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:57,659
Because that's what...

937
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,919
Because that's what heroes do.

938
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,726
Friend stay!

939
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:31,057
Yes!

940
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:51,553
Come on.

941
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:56,499
Welcome. Voice activation required.

Welcome, Point Break.

955
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,071
Friend stay!

956
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,189
No, no, no!

957
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:24,319
Stop!

958
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,423
Stay!

959
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:27,751
Hulk, stop breaking everything!

960
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,434
Don't go!

961
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:33,993
Nice work, big guy.

962
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:37,659
We don't know where Ultron's headed,
but you're going very high, very fast.

963
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:39,689
So, I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?

964
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,789
We can't track you in stealth mode,

965
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,676
so I need you to help me out. Okay?

966
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,868
I need you to...

967
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,696
No! No, Banner!

968
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,097
Oh, jeez.

969
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:19,480
Banner.

970
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,964
You all right, Banner?

971
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:28,272
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.

972
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,066
That's it, breathe.

973
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,696
I won't hurt you.

974
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,321
Sun's going down.

975
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:35,956
- Thor.
- Yeah.

976
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,161
What happened to your hair?

977
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:39,647
Some creepy old man cut it off.

978
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,290
- It looks good.
- Thanks.

979
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,890
Where are we? How's Nat?

980
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,979
- Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?

981
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,899
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?

982
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,565
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?

983
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,860
- Banner, listen.
- What?

984
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:54,069
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.

985
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,724
What are you saying?

986
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,975
What?

987
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,226
I've been Hulk for two years?

988
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:01,064
I'm afraid so.

989
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,215
What the hell happened?

990
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,362
Banner, there's something you should know.

991
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:16,741
Voice activation required.

992
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,903
Banner.

993
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,668
Welcome, strongest Avenger.

994
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,769
What?

995
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:21,917
Ship's log.

996
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,989
Thor, where are we?

997
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,148
Yeah, about that.

998
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,489
Sakaar, hear ye. Attention please.
I have some bad news.

999
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:42,449
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.

1000
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:45,039
Take to the streets. Celebrate my champion.

1001
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,119
Who's that?

1002
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,918
He kind of runs the place.

1003
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,937
You actually lived at his house for awhile.

1004
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,107
- I did?
- Yeah.

1005
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:53,596
Quite a lot's happened. You
and I had a fight recently.

1006
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,839
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.

1007
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,929
Doesn't sound right.

1008
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:58,049
Well, it's true.

1009
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:02,889
It seems that that criminally seductive
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.

1010
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:05,646
Seductive God of Thunder. We need to move.

1011
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:07,243
Oh, no.

1012
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,255
This is bad.

1013
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,569
This is really, really bad.

1014
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:19,171
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.

1015
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,329
No, no, no.

1016
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,409
Don't freak out. You're okay. Put these on.

1017
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:23,557
These are Tony's clothes.

1018
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,053
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?

1019
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,119
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

1020
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,846
The sun's going down. The sun's
getting really low. Sun's going down.

1021
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:40,152
I'm upset!

1022
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:45,019
I'm very upset.

1023
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,269
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.

1024
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:50,809
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.
And you know who I'm blaming?

1025
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,508
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!

1026
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,649
Don't interrupt me!

1027
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:54,852
Here you go.

1028
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,029
Why are you handing me the melt stick?

1029
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:59,029
He was interrupting.

1030
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:00,949
That's not a capital violation.

1031
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:02,471
Where was I?

1032
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:05,329
My precious champion has come up missing,

1033
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:08,749
and it's all because of that Lord of
Thunder. It's all because of him.

1034
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,829
Your brother.

1035
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:12,919
Whatever the story is. Adopted,
or complicated, or you know.

1036
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,023
I'm sure there's a big history.

1037
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,380
And your contender...

1038
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:17,153
My dear friend,

1039
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,679
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could
bring them both back to you. Alive.

1040
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,334
I could do it in two.

1041
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,241
I could do it in one.

1042
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:25,457
Let's stop there.

1043
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,567
You know what? I woke up this morning
thinking about a public execution.

1044
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,295
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little

1045
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,527
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1046
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,049
So, you're on the clock.

1047
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:40,942
What have you done?

1048
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:42,369
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1049
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:43,489
It's Loki.

1050
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,320
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

1051
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:51,329
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1052
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:52,841
I don't help anyone.

1053
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,466
You're a Valkyrie.

1054
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,697
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1055
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,519
Choose your next words wisely.

1056
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:14,158
I'm terribly sorry. Must
be a very painful memory.

1057
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:09,306
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1058
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,869
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low.

1059
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:13,249
Oh, shoot.

1060
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:15,579
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?

1061
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:16,870
I just need you to stay calm.

1062
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,999
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1063
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,919
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1064
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,067
Yeah. One.

1065
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:23,929
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1066
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:25,265
It's a new experience.

1067
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,379
My neurons, they're firing
faster than my brain

1068
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:29,559
can handle the information.

1069
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,979
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1070
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:35,439
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.

1071
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,019
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.

1072
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,029
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.

1073
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:42,221
No, it's not what matters.

1074
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,199
What I'm trying to tell you, is
that if I turn into the Hulk again,

1075
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,854
Banner may never come back.

1076
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:50,329
And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.

1077
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:53,142
We're not stranded. I'm gonna
figure out a way to get us home.

1078
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:54,409
Thank you.

1079
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:56,789
Not your home, though. Asgard. My home.

1080
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:57,937
What?

1081
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,974
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1082
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:02,629
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,

1083
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:04,629
who also happens to be my sister.

1084
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:06,509
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

1085
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:09,179
I don't wanna fight your sister.
That's a family issue.

1086
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,701
No, she's an evil being.

1087
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,231
I don't care what she is.

1088
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,769
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.

1089
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:15,972
- What?
- I just told you.

1090
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,979
If I turn into the Hulk, I am
never gonna come back again.

1091
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,138
And you don't care.

1092
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,149
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

1093
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,627
The Hulk is the fire.

1094
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:25,569
Wait, you're just using
me to get to the Hulk.

1095
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:27,279
- What? No!
- It's gross.

1096
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,199
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1097
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,449
No! I don't even like the Hulk.
He's all like...

1098
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:34,104
"Smash, smash, smash."

1099
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,443
I prefer you.

1100
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:37,473
Thanks.

1101
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:41,129
But if I'm being honest, when it
comes to fighting evil beings,

1102
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,696
he is very powerful and useful.

1103
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:44,839
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

1104
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,086
Is he though?

1105
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:48,429
How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.

1106
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,547
How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.

1107
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,259
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1108
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,421
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1109
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:00,399
What are you doing with that?

1110
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,479
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

1111
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,498
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

1112
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,859
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

1113
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,779
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1114
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:10,409
No, no, you're not Tony. You're Bruce.
Bruce Banner.

1115
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:11,833
Then why did you dress me up like Tony?

1116
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:12,973
Because you were naked.

1117
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:14,551
Okay, I'll give you that.

1118
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,326
What are you doing? Stop doing that!

1119
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:17,980
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1120
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,119
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

1121
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,419
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

1122
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,919
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years

1123
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,669
inside of a monster made me a little weird.

1124
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:28,509
Hey. It's okay.

1125
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,049
You're good. Calm down. Come on.

1126
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:32,660
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard

1127
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,029
and you're not gonna have to think
about the Hulk ever again. All right?

1128
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,323
All right.

1129
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,531
This is bad.

1130
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:51,016
Banner! Banner!

1131
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,116
Banner!

1132
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,867
Banner!

1133
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:12,515
Thor!

1134
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:25,019
Hi.

1135
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:26,109
Hi.

1136
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:27,445
I was gonna do that.

1137
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,903
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1138
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:31,145
That's good. What are you doing here?

1139
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:33,606
What are you doing here? I
thought you were leaving.

1140
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:34,723
I got sidetracked.

1141
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,450
What's with the...

1142
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,869
It's my disguise.

1143
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:39,101
But I can see your face.

1144
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:41,270
Not when I do this, you can't.

1145
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:45,525
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did
with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?

1146
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:54,089
What are those things on her eyes?
Are those people that she's killed?

1147
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:55,788
She's so beautiful and
strong and courageous.

1148
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:56,889
Who is this guy?

1149
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:58,009
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?

1150
01:23:58,010 --> 01:23:59,599
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

1151
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,037
I feel like I know you, too.

1152
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:09,641
Look, I've spent years in a
haze, trying to forget my past.

1153
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:13,989
Sakaar seemed like the best place to
drink and forget, and to die one day.

1154
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:17,449
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1155
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:18,773
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1156
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:21,016
But I don't wanna forget.

1157
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,838
I can't turn away anymore,

1158
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:25,249
so if I'm gonna die,

1159
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:28,589
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.

1160
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,339
- Good.
- Yeah.

1161
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:33,659
So, I'm saying that I wanna be on the team.

1162
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:35,309
Has it got a name?

1163
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:38,299
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1164
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,403
Revengers?

1165
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:42,226
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

1166
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:45,207
Do you want revenge?

1167
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:47,609
I'm undecided.

1168
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:48,713
Okay.

1169
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:51,208
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1170
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,497
Surprise.

1171
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,810
Just had to be sure.

1172
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:09,580
Hello, Bruce.

1173
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,049
So, last time I saw you, you
were trying to kill everybody.

1174
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:15,385
Where are you at these days?

1175
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,793
It varies from moment to moment.

1176
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,389
Is that a Dragonfang?

1177
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:21,592
It is.

1178
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,930
My God.

1179
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,939
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1180
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:29,309
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as
far apart as any two known systems.

1181
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:32,109
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1182
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:35,899
Refuel on Xandar, and we can be
back in Asgard in 18 months.

1183
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:39,319
Nope. We are going through the big one.

1184
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,555
The Devil's Anus?

1185
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:41,866
Anus?

1186
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,024
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1187
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,119
For the record, I didn't know it
was called that when I picked it.

1188
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,119
That looks like a collapsing neutron star

1189
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,749
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1190
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,629
We need another ship. That
will tear mine to pieces.

1191
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,759
She's right. We need one that can

1192
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,719
withstand the geodetic
strain from the singularity.

1193
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,629
And has an offline power steering system

1194
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:00,549
that could also function
without the onboard computer.

1195
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:03,809
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

1196
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,889
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.

1197
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,939
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

1198
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,186
What do you say?

1199
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,859
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1200
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:13,195
Talk about an adventure.

1201
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:15,489
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.

1202
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:17,739
There are one or two ships.
Absolute top of the line models...

1203
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,350
I don't mean to impose...

1204
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:24,346
But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.

1205
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:28,459
I may even have stolen the access
codes to his security system.

1206
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,919
And suddenly you're overcome with
an urge to do the right thing.

1207
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,039
Heavens, no.

1208
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,694
I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster,

1209
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:35,839
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,

1210
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,259
I'm asking for safe
passage through the Anus.

1211
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,009
You're telling us that you can
get us access into the garage

1212
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:43,929
without setting off any alarms?

1213
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:45,769
Yes, brother. I can.

1214
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:48,689
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

1215
01:26:48,690 --> 01:26:50,519
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago

1216
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,189
and he was totally ready to kill any of us.

1217
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:54,480
He did try to kill me.

1218
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,529
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.

1219
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:58,279
There was one time when we were children,

1220
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,199
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.

1221
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,199
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it,

1222
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:06,079
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

1223
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,399
And he stabbed me. We
were eight at the time.

1224
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:10,771
If we're boosting a ship

1225
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:12,572
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

1226
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:14,089
Why not set the beast loose?

1227
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:15,237
Shut up.

1228
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,491
You guys have a beast?

1229
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:19,129
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1230
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:20,784
We're going to start a revolution.

1231
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:22,872
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.

1232
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:25,415
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.

1233
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:29,639
Is that some sort of protoplasm, all
the stuff that's coming out of you,

1234
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,063
or are they eggs?

1235
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:33,609
Looks like eggs.

1236
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:44,426
I'm looking for Korg.

1237
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:45,883
Who's asking?

1238
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:47,200
I know you're asking.

1239
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,409
Is there anyone else
asking, or is it just you?

1240
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:51,847
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1241
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,435
The revolution has begun.

1242
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,669
Revolution? How did this happen?

1243
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:01,324
Don't know.

1244
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:04,679
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated

1245
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,753
and the slaves have armed themselves.

1246
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,962
I don't like that word.

1247
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:10,393
Which? Mainframe?

1248
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:12,689
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

1249
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,899
No, the "S" word.

1250
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,932
Sorry, the prisoners with
jobs have armed themselves.

1251
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:20,547
Okay, that's better.

1252
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:28,571
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.

1253
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:30,988
I disagree.

1254
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:34,329
Open communication was
never our family's forte.

1255
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:35,565
You have no idea.

1256
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:38,459
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1257
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,563
Hello.

1258
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,403
Hi.

1259
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,398
Odin brought us together.

1260
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:54,151
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

1261
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,189
We might as well be strangers now.

1262
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,685
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

1263
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:10,090
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1264
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:12,593
Here's the thing.

1265
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:14,619
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

1266
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,506
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1267
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:19,776
Did you just agree with me?

1268
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:21,532
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1269
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:23,379
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1270
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:25,210
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1271
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:27,106
Do you truly think so little of me?

1272
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:30,940
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1273
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:34,599
I thought we were gonna
fight side by side forever.

1274
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,721
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1275
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:40,769
I don't know, maybe there's
still good in you.

1276
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:44,629
But let's be honest, our paths
diverged a long time ago.

1277
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:50,108
Yeah.

1278
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,699
It's probably for the best that
we never see each other again.

1279
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,123
It's what you always wanted.

1280
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:01,089
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1281
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:02,419
- What?
- "Get Help."

1282
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:03,499
No.

1283
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,629
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.

1284
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:06,299
- It's great. It works every time.
- It's humiliating.

1285
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,629
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.

1286
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:08,733
We're doing it.

1287
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,774
We are not doing "Get Help."

1288
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,019
Get help! Please!

1289
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,207
My brother, he's dying.

1290
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:16,475
Get help! Help him!

1291
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:19,689
Classic.

1292
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:21,142
Still hate it.

1293
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:23,689
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.

1294
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:25,989
Now, which one's the
ship she told us to get?

1295
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:27,093
The Commodore.

1296
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:28,753
Right.

1297
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:34,334
Though I feel it won't
make much of a difference.

1298
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,174
Loki.

1299
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:40,637
I know I've betrayed you many times before,

1300
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:42,499
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

1301
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,759
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.

1302
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,549
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1303
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:49,160
Easier to let it burn.

1304
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,443
I agree.

1305
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:00,608
That looks painful.

1306
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:04,149
Dear brother, you're becoming predictable.

1307
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:06,319
I trust you, you betray me.

1308
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,529
Round and round in circles we go.

1309
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:10,699
See, Loki, life is about...
It's about growth.

1310
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,035
It's about change.

1311
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:15,610
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

1312
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:17,619
I guess what I'm trying to say

1313
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:20,749
is that you'll always
be the God of Mischief,

1314
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,404
but you could be more.

1315
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:26,879
I'll just put this over here for you.

1316
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,750
Anyway, all got places to be, so good luck.

1317
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,731
All right, I can figure this out.

1318
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:39,931
It's just another spaceship.

1319
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:54,471
Loyal Sakaarians,

1320
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:58,393
Lord of Thunder has stolen my
ship and my favorite champion.

1321
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:02,789
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.

1322
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:04,764
Do not let him leave this planet.

1323
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,170
- Good shot!
- Thanks.

1324
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:23,065
Open the doors.

1325
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:24,666
Okay.

1326
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:31,689
I hope that you're tougher than you look.

1327
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:32,837
Why?

1328
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:47,209
Shouldn't we be shooting back or something?

1329
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:48,339
Yes, we should.

1330
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:50,379
Where are the guns on this ship?

1331
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:51,901
There aren't any.

1332
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,662
- It's a leisure vessel.
- What?

1333
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,679
Grandmaster uses it for his
good times, orgies and stuff.

1334
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,429
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?

1335
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:00,753
Yeah.

1336
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:02,376
Don't touch anything.

1337
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:23,643
No!

1338
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:27,977
- No!
- No!

1339
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,031
Get inside!

1340
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:37,932
In a minute.

1341
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:51,149
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1342
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:52,819
No. I don't know how to fly one of these.

1343
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,689
You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.

1344
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:58,318
None of them are for
flying alien spaceships!

1345
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,529
Okay, come on.

1346
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:35,819
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

1347
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:36,978
That looks like a gun.

1348
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:40,890
It's my birthday It's my birthday

1349
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:44,038
It's my birthday

1350
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:51,893
Yeah!

1351
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,541
Guys, we're coming up on the Devil's Anus!

1352
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:19,184
There she is.

1353
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,501
Our ticket out of here.

1354
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,173
Hey, what's this?

1355
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,159
Thank you.

1356
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,749
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1357
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:32,864
You wanna come?

1358
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:37,759
You do seem like you're in
desperate need of leadership.

1359
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,458
Why, thank you.

1360
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:44,241
Here we go.

1361
01:35:50,730 --> 01:35:51,833
Shit.

1362
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,119
Asgardians...

1363
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,964
Some misguided soul

1364
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,629
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1365
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:19,169
Tell us where it is

1366
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:22,059
or there will be consequences.

1367
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:26,955
Bad ones.

1368
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:31,123
Well?

1369
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:39,400
You.

1370
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:19,992
Well? Executioner?

1371
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:25,865
Wait!

1372
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:27,013
Wait!

1373
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:30,656
I know where the sword is.

1374
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:15,931
I never thought I'd be back here.

1375
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:21,032
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1376
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:24,509
I mean, not that it's not nice.
It's just, it's on fire.

1377
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:25,877
Here, up here in the mountains.

1378
01:38:25,970 --> 01:38:28,339
Heat signatures. People clustered together.

1379
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:29,443
She's coming for them.

1380
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:31,509
Okay, drop me off at the
palace and I'll draw her away.

1381
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:32,889
And get yourself killed?

1382
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:34,849
The people trapped down
there are all that matters.

1383
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:37,639
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you
two to help get everyone off Asgard.

1384
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,614
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1385
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:41,738
I have a man on the ground.

1386
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:48,633
Asgard.

1387
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:53,427
She's here.

1388
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,709
Now the ship has a gun.

1389
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:08,000
I'll take it from here.

1390
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:12,171
I found this in the armory.

1391
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:16,345
Good luck.

1392
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:19,246
Your Majesty...

1393
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,295
Don't die.

1394
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:26,954
You know what I mean.

1395
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:27,787
We must keep moving!

1396
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:30,184
Go to the Bifrost!

1397
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:14,101
Sister.

1398
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:17,929
You're still alive.

1399
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:21,559
I love what you've done with the place.
Redecorating, I see.

1400
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:26,577
It seems our father's solution to
every problem was to cover it up.

1401
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:29,556
Or to cast it out.

1402
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:35,509
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

1403
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:37,261
You see?

1404
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:40,117
You never knew him.

1405
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,289
Not at his best.

1406
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:46,999
Odin and I drowned entire
civilizations in blood and tears.

1407
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,089
Where do you think all this gold came from?

1408
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:52,009
And then, one day,

1409
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:55,169
he decided to become a benevolent king.

1410
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:58,070
To foster peace, to protect life.

1411
01:41:58,930 --> 01:42:00,684
To have you.

1412
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:03,519
I understand why you're angry.

1413
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,599
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.

1414
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,609
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

1415
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:10,945
But it can't be you.

1416
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:15,027
You're just the worst.

1417
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:18,069
Okay, get up.

1418
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:20,319
You're in my seat.

1419
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,239
You know, Father once told me

1420
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:25,959
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1421
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:28,760
But must always be ready for it.

1422
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:02,230
Go back!

1423
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:08,677
Go!

1424
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:46,306
To be honest, I expected more.

1425
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,473
Heimdall!

1426
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:54,470
The sword!

1427
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,509
Here's the difference between us.

1428
01:44:00,510 --> 01:44:02,259
I'm Odin's firstborn,

1429
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:04,849
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

1430
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:06,780
And you're nothing.

1431
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:20,035
So simple, even a blind man could see it.

1432
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:25,942
Now you remind me of Dad.

1433
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,930
The stupid dog won't die!

1434
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:02,779
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.

1435
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:05,085
You wanted to know who I am?

1436
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:07,618
What the hell are you talking about?

1437
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:09,186
You'll see!

1438
01:45:57,710 --> 01:46:00,089
You see? No one's going anywhere.

1439
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:01,611
I'll get that sword,

1440
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:04,629
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1441
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:32,093
Hey, man.

1442
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:35,106
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1443
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:38,075
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?

1444
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:51,534
Your savior is here.

1445
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:00,399
Did you miss me?

1446
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,010
Everyone, on that ship now.

1447
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:08,569
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

1448
01:47:08,570 --> 01:47:09,761
Of course you did.

1449
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:28,876
It's a valiant effort, but
you never stood a chance.

1450
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,827
You see...

1451
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:34,729
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1452
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:38,152
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1453
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:41,713
What were you the god of, again?

1454
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:54,893
Even when you had two eyes,

1455
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:57,483
you'd see only half the picture.

1456
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:02,178
She's too strong. Without
my hammer, I can't.

1457
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,874
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?

1458
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:13,651
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.

1459
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:16,024
It was never your source of strength.

1460
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,140
It's too late. She's already taken Asgard.

1461
01:48:19,930 --> 01:48:22,874
Asgard is not a place. Never was.

1462
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:25,283
This could be Asgard.

1463
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:28,625
Asgard is where our people stand.

1464
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:34,682
Even now, right now, those
people need your help.

1465
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,269
I'm not as strong as you.

1466
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:47,857
No...

1467
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:50,593
You're stronger.

1468
01:48:59,470 --> 01:49:00,991
Tell me, brother.

1469
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:03,732
What were you the god of, again?

1470
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:21,199
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.

1471
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,865
This isn't over.

1472
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:31,716
I think we should disband the Revengers.

1473
01:51:33,130 --> 01:51:34,419
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1474
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:36,879
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.

1475
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:37,983
It did nothing.

1476
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:44,790
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1477
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:46,750
It won't end there.

1478
01:51:46,770 --> 01:51:50,349
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1479
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:52,229
She'll hunt us down.

1480
01:51:52,230 --> 01:51:53,939
We need to stop her here and now.

1481
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,275
So what do we do?

1482
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:57,642
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1483
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:13,248
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1484
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:16,169
Loki,

1485
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:18,299
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

1486
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:20,509
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1487
01:52:20,510 --> 01:52:22,308
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1488
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,330
It's the only way.

1489
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:27,290
Bold move, brother.

1490
01:52:28,430 --> 01:52:30,172
Even for me.

1491
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:34,388
Shall we?

1492
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:36,503
After you.

1493
01:53:01,930 --> 01:53:03,584
This is madness.

1494
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:18,762
Go! Go, now!

1495
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:21,240
For Asgard.

1496
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:36,817
Hela!

1497
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:05,804
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

1498
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:18,319
Hela, enough!

1499
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:24,899
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1500
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:28,489
Whatever game you're
playing, it won't work.

1501
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:30,332
You can't defeat me.

1502
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:32,247
No, I know.

1503
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:34,977
But he can.

1504
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:40,691
No.

1505
01:55:49,130 --> 01:55:52,719
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1506
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:55,057
I am your reckoning!

1507
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:05,268
The people are safe.

1508
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:07,803
That's all that matters.

1509
01:56:09,450 --> 01:56:10,927
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1510
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,791
I hate this prophecy.

1511
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:14,779
So do I, but we have no choice.

1512
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:16,739
Surtur destroys Asgard,

1513
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:19,249
he destroys Hela, so that
our people may live.

1514
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:22,282
But we need to let him
finish the job, otherwise...

1515
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,943
No!

1516
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:29,351
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1517
01:56:38,220 --> 01:56:39,367
Hulk, stop.

1518
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:42,782
Just for once in your life, don't smash.

1519
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:45,536
Big monster!

1520
01:56:45,690 --> 01:56:47,113
Let's go!

1521
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:49,883
Fine.

1522
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:17,015
I am Asgard's doom!

1523
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:41,959
The damage is not too bad.

1524
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:44,119
As long as the foundations
are still strong,

1525
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:45,918
we can rebuild this place.

1526
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:48,289
It will become a haven

1527
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:51,553
for all peoples and aliens of the universe.

1528
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:00,968
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.

1529
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:17,727
What have I done?

1530
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:21,289
You saved us from extinction.

1531
01:58:21,290 --> 01:58:23,319
Asgard is not a place...

1532
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:26,682
It's a people.

1533
01:58:55,570 --> 01:58:57,235
It suits you.

1534
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:02,532
Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.

1535
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:04,187
Maybe not.

1536
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:06,580
Thank you.

1537
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:09,966
If you were here, I might
even give you a hug.

1538
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:15,179
I'm here.

1539
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:40,787
Your throne.

1540
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:59,442
So, King of Asgard.

1541
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:10,835
Where to?

1542
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:13,426
I'm not sure.

1543
02:00:13,650 --> 02:00:15,083
Any suggestions?

1544
02:00:17,570 --> 02:00:19,699
Miek, where are you from?

1545
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:21,699
Miek's dead.

1546
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:24,989
Yeah, no, I accidentally
stomped on him on the bridge.

1547
02:00:24,990 --> 02:00:27,934
I've just felt so guilty, I've
been carrying him around all day.

1548
02:00:30,210 --> 02:00:31,820
Miek, you're alive!

1549
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:34,399
He's alive, guys. What was
your question again, bro?

1550
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:37,296
Earth it is.

1551
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:56,939
Do you really think it's a
good idea to go back to Earth?

1552
02:02:56,940 --> 02:03:00,578
Yes, of course. The people of
Earth love me. I'm very popular.

1553
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:02,899
Let me rephrase that.

1554
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:06,440
Do you really think it's a good
idea to bring me back to Earth?

1555
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:08,869
Probably not, to be honest.

1556
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:14,294
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like
everything's gonna work out fine.

1557
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:43,823
Oh, boy.

1558
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:56,439
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.

1559
02:09:56,440 --> 02:10:00,029
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

1560
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:02,649
Pat on the back. Pat on the back.

1561
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:05,274
Come on. No?

1562
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:07,489
Me too. 'Cause I've been a big part of it.

1563
02:10:07,490 --> 02:10:10,449
Can't have a revolution without
somebody to overthrow.

1564
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:12,659
So, you're welcome.

1565
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:15,229
And it's a tie.
