Well, my dad was a farmer.

Um... Like everybody else
back then.

3
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:24,715
Of course,
he didn't start that way.

says you're too tight.

Nah, I got this.

YOUNG MURPH: Dad?

13
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:58,515
Sorry, Murph.
Go back to bed, babe.

14
00:01:58,548 --> 00:01:59,817
I thought you were the ghost.

15
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,851
No.

16
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:05,155
There are no such things
as ghosts, babe.

17
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,857
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

18
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:10,636
Yeah, maybe that's 'cause
Grandpa's a little too close

19
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,630
to being one himself.
Back to bed.

20
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,332
Were you dreaming
about the crash?

21
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:18,903
Get your butt back in bed,
Murph. (LAUGHS)

22
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:47,531
OLD MURPH: The wheat had died.

23
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:50,668
The blight came
and we had to burn it.

24
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:54,638
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

25
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:56,607
But, uh, mostly we had dust.

26
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,653
OLD WOMAN 1:
I guess I can't describe it.

27
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:02,112
It was just constant.

28
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:04,414
Just that steady blow

29
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:05,816
of dirt.

30
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:11,454
OLD WOMAN 2: We wore
little strips of sheet

31
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,358
sometimes over
our nose and mouth

32
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:16,560
so that we wouldn't breathe
so much of it.

33
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:19,539
OLD MAN: Well,
when we set the table,

34
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:20,897
we always set the plate

35
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:22,198

Dad, can you fix this?

45
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,033
COOPER: What the heck
did you do to my lander?

46
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,425
Wasn't me.

47
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,492
Let me guess.
It was your ghost?

48
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:51,694
It knocked it off my shelf.

49
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,263
It keeps on knocking books off.

50
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:54,574
TOM: No such thing as ghosts,
dumb-ass.

51
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:55,733
- Hey.
- I looked it up.

52
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,034
It's called a poltergeist.

53
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,434
Dad, tell her.

54
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,737
Well, it's not
very scientific, Murph.

55
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:03,273
You said science was about
admitting what we don't know.

56
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:04,746
- She's got you there.
- COOPER: Hey.

57
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,710
Start looking after our stuff.

58

Coop.

59
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:14,517
All right, Murph,
you want to talk science?

60
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,596
Don't just tell me that
you're afraid of some ghost.

61
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,255
No, you got to go further.

62
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,700
You got to record
the facts, analyze,

63
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,392
get to the how and the why,

64
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:25,029
then present your conclusions.
Deal?

65
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,097
- Deal.
- All right.

66

Murphy's Law doesn't mean that

What it means is whatever
can happen will happen.

- 10 years ago.

So for 10 years?

145

Why did it come down so low?

I don't know.

147
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:01,571
Maybe the sun cooked its brain

148
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:02,649
or it was looking for something.

149
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:03,873
What?

150
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:05,775
Give me a large flatblade.

00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:27,131
It wasn't hurting anybody.

157
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:31,735
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt, Murph,

158

They'll tell you about it
when you get in there.

164
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,185
Am I gonna be mad?

165
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:50,420
Not with me.

166
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:51,788
Just please try not to.

167
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,322
Hey, relax.

168
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:56,160
I got this.

169
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,199
Little late, Coop.

170
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:03,900
Yeah, we had a flat.

171
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,568
And I guess you had to stop off

172
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:07,704
at the Asian
fighter plane store.

173
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:11,374
No, actually, sir, that's a...
That's a surveillance drone.

174
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,911
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian.

175
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:15,579
Take a seat.

176
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:18,248
So, uh...

177
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:22,318
We got Tom's scores back.

178
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:24,888
He's going to make
an excellent farmer.

179
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:28,224
Yeah, he's got
a knack for it.
What about college?

180
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:30,694
Well, the university
only takes a handful.

181
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:31,871
They don't really have
the resources to...

182
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:34,297
I still pay my taxes.

183
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,000
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

184
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:40,003
Well, it doesn't go
to the university.

185
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:41,871
Look, Coop,
you have to be realistic.

186
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:44,274
You're ruling my son out
for college now?

187
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,275
The kid's 15.

188
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:48,312
Tom's score simply
isn't high enough.

189
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:51,448
What's your waistline?
About 32?

190
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:53,983
About a 33 inseam?

191
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:55,885
I'm not sure I see
what you're getting at.

192
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:56,996
You're telling me
it takes two numbers

193
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,288
to measure your own ass,

194
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:00,157
but only one to measure
my son's future?

195
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:02,659
(SIGHS) Come on.

196
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:04,594
You're a well-educated man,
Coop.

197
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:05,863
And a trained pilot.

198
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,097
And an engineer.

199
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,302
Okay, well, right now
we don't need
more engineers.

200
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,838
We didn't run out of
television screens
and planes.

201
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,973
We ran out of food.

202
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,077
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

203
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,378
And Tom.

204
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:22,412
Uneducated farmers.

205
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,748
We're a caretaker
generation, Coop.

206
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:27,817
And things are getting better.

207
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:29,429
Maybe your grandkids
will get to be engineers...

208
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,520
Are we done here, sir?

209
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,123
No.

210
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:36,960
Ms. Hanley's here
to talk about Murph.

211
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:39,495
MS. HANLEY: Murph is a great
kid. She's really bright.

212
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,963
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

213
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:43,676
She brought this in
to show the other students.

214
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,268
The section
on the lunar landings.

215
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:48,204
Yeah, it's one
of my old textbooks.

216
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:50,540
She always loved the pictures.

217
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:51,975
It's an old federal textbook.

218
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:54,210
We've replaced them
with the corrected versions.

219
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:55,978
Corrected?

220
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,747
Explaining how
the Apollo missions
were faked

221
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,416
to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

222
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,158
You don't believe
we went to the moon?

223
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,995
I believe it was a brilliant
piece of propaganda.

224
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:14,397
That the Soviets bankrupted
themselves pouring resources

225
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,900
into rockets
and other useless machines.

226
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:18,301
"Useless machines."

227
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:20,136
And if we don't want
a repeat of the excess

228
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,806
and wastefulness
of the 20th century, then

229
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,641
we need to teach our kids
about this planet,

230
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:26,143
not tales of leaving it.

231
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,778
You know, one of those
useless machines

232
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,681
they used to make
was called an MRI.

233
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,416
And if we had any of those left,

234
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:34,951
the doctors would've
been able to find

235
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,787
the cyst in my wife's brain

236
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,089
before she died
instead of afterwards.

237
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,333
And then she'd have been
the one sitting here,

238
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:42,192
listening to this instead of me,

239
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:43,536
which would have
been a good thing,

240
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,095
'cause she was always

241
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:47,197
the calmer one.

242
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,967
I'm sorry about your wife,
Mr. Cooper.

243
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:53,803
But Murph got into a fistfight

244
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,081
with several of
her classmates over this

245
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:57,039
Apollo nonsense.

246
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:58,117
So we thought it would be best

247
00:12:58,141 --> 00:12:59,543
to bring you in
and see what ideas

248
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:01,020
you might have for
dealing with her behavior

249
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:02,078
on the homefront.

250
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:03,645
All right. (INHALES)

251
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,949
Yeah, you know what? Um...
There's a game tomorrow night.

252
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,285
She's going through
a bit of a baseball phase.

253
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,364
Her favorite team is playing,
and there's gonna be candy

254
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:13,090
and soda...

255
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:18,028
I think I'll take her to that.

256
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:22,466
(WHISTLING)

257
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:24,500
How'd it go?

258
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,970
I got you suspended.

259
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:29,284
- What?
- BOOTS ON RADIO: Cooper.

260
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:32,509
This is Cooper, go.

261
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,311
Coop, those combines
you rebuilt went haywire.

262
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:38,115
Uh, just reset the controllers.

263
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,283
I did that.
You should
come take a look.

264
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:02,415
BOOTS: One by one they've been
peeling off the fields

265
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:03,607
and heading over.

266
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,308
Something's interfering
with the compass.

267
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:09,212
Magnetism or some such.

268

(CLATTERING)

269
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:54,255
YOUNG MURPH: Nothing special
about which book.

270
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:56,593
I've been working on it,
like you said.

271
00:14:57,661 --> 00:14:58,728
I counted the spaces.

272
00:14:58,761 --> 00:14:59,796
Why?

273
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:04,012
In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.

274
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,336
I'm trying Morse.

275
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:08,205
Morse?

276
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:10,139
Yeah.

277
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:11,474
Dots and dashes, used...

278
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:13,075
I know what
Morse code is, Murph.

279
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,543
I just don't think
your bookshelf's

280
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,645
trying to talk to you.

281
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,093
COOPER: Had to reset every
compass clock and GPS

282
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:32,028
to offset for the anomaly.

283

DONALD: Which is?

284
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:34,498
I don't know.

285

If the house was built
on magnetic ore,

286

we'd have seen this
the first time

we switched on the tractor.

I hear your meeting at
the school didn't go so well.

(SCOFFS) You heard?

290
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,617

who we are, Donald.

00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:03,727
it felt like they made

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,327
something new every day.

295
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,997
Some gadget or idea.

or 40 years too early.

My daughter knew it,
God bless her.

And your kids know it.
Especially Murph.

307
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:45,168
Well, we used to look up
in the sky and wonder

308
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:47,404
at our place in the stars.

309
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,641
Now we just look down

310
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:54,978
and worry about
our place in the dirt.

311

Cooper,
you were good at something

312
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,383
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

I'm sorry.

314

You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food

00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:12,395
to turn on you like that
and destroy you.

to even play baseball.

It's kind of hard to explain.

441
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:18,000
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

442
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:20,302
What sort of anomaly?

443
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:22,338
I hesitate to
term it supernatural,

444
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:23,982
(CHUCKLES) but it definitely
wasn't scientific.

445
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,408
You're going to have to be
specific, Mr. Cooper.

446
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:27,743
Right now.

447
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:28,945
It was gravity.

448
00:27:32,448 --> 00:27:33,448
DOYLE: Um...

449
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:35,818
What sort of
gravitational anomaly?

450
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,286
- Where was this?
- COOPER: Hey.

451
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,486
Now I'm real happy

452
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,889
'cause you're excited
about gravity, bud,

453

but you're not getting
any answers from us

- Assurances?
- Yeah.

456
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:47,963
Like that we're
getting out of here.

00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:55,971
No, Professor, I don't.

461
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:57,685

Professor Brand.

462
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,508
We're NASA.

The same NASA you flew for.

466
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,926
COOPER: I heard
they shut you down, sir,

467
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:21,063
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere

468
00:28:21,097 --> 00:28:23,165
onto starving people.

469
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,601
When they realized that
killing other people was

470
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:28,671
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

471
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:29,805
In secret.

472
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:30,906
Why secret?

473
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,641
Because public opinion
wouldn't allow

474
00:28:32,674 --> 00:28:35,077
spending on space exploration.

475
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,150
Not when you're struggling
to put food on the table.

476
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,349
Blight.

477
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:44,020
Wheat seven years ago.
Okra this year.

478
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:47,156
Now there's just corn.

479
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:49,090
And we're growing
more than we ever have.

480
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:51,226
But like the potatoes in Ireland

481
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,061
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl,

482
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:56,165
the corn will die.

483
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:58,034
Soon.

484
00:29:03,873 --> 00:29:08,110
We'll find a way, Professor.
We always have.

485
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:11,579
Driven by the unshakeable
faith the Earth is ours.

486
00:29:12,448 --> 00:29:14,150
Well, not just ours, no.

00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:21,190
Earth's atmosphere
is 80% nitrogen.

489
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,991
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

490
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:25,327
Blight does.
And as it thrives,

491
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,597
our air gets
less and less oxygen.

492
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,065
The last people to starve

493
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:32,233
will be the first to suffocate.

494
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:34,203
And your daughter's generation

495
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:38,373
will be the last
to survive on Earth.

496
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:40,175
BRAND: Murph is feeling
a little tired.

497
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:42,289
I was wondering if she could
take a nap in my office.

498
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:43,646
Yeah. Thank you.

499
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:47,583
Okay.

500
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:50,152
Now you need to tell me

501
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:53,021
what your plan is
to save the world.

502
00:29:53,055 --> 00:29:55,123
We're not meant
to save the world.

503
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:56,325
We're meant to leave it.

504
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,799
COOPER: Rangers.

505
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,210
PROFESSOR BRAND:
The last components

506
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:08,870
of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the Endurance.

507
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:10,373
Our final expedition.

508
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,110
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

509
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,645
The Lazarus missions.

510
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:17,879
Oh, that sounds cheerful.

511
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:19,982
Lazarus came back from the dead.

512
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:21,695
Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

513
00:30:22,484 --> 00:30:24,053
There's not a planet
in our solar system

514
00:30:24,086 --> 00:30:25,520
that could sustain life

515
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:28,223
and the nearest star's
over 1,000 years away.

516
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:30,493
And that doesn't even
qualify as futile.

517
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,462
Where'd you send 'em?

518
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:35,897
Cooper,

519
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:38,567
I can't tell you any more
unless you agree

520
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,836
to pilot this craft.

521
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,270
You're the best pilot
we ever had.

522
00:30:42,304 --> 00:30:44,272
I barely left the stratosphere.

523
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:46,541
This team never
left the simulator.

524
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,077
We need a pilot,

525
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,679
and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

526
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:51,814
Without even knowing it?

527
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:55,617
An hour ago, you didn't even
know I was alive.

528
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:57,253
You were going anyway.

529
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,721
We had no choice.

530
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:01,223
But something sent you here.

531
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:02,924
They chose you.

532
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,126
Who's "they"?

533
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,836
How long would I be gone?

534
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:16,105
Hard to know.

535
00:31:16,572 --> 00:31:17,573
Years?

536
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:19,708
I've got kids, Professor.

537
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:22,378
Get out there and save them.

538
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:27,683
Who's "they"?

539
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:29,985
We started detecting
gravitational anomalies

540
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,920
almost 50 years ago.

541
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:33,888
Mostly small distortions
to our instruments

542
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,557
in the upper atmosphere.

543
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:38,461
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

544
00:31:39,261 --> 00:31:41,196
Yeah, over the Straits.

545
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,432
My crash.

546
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:44,800
Something tripped
my fly-by-wire.

547
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,534
Exactly.

548
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,441
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

549
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:53,475
Out near Saturn,

550
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,679
a disturbance of spacetime.

551
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,682
Is that a wormhole?

552
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:02,217
It appeared 48 years ago.

553
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,320
And it leads where?

554
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,489
Another galaxy.

555
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,759
A wormhole's not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

556
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:11,861
Someone placed it there.

557
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:14,996
- "They"?
- Mmm-hmm.

558
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,965
And whoever they are,

559
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:19,501
they appear to be
looking out for us.

560
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:22,337
That wormhole
lets us travel
to other stars.

561
00:32:22,371 --> 00:32:24,406
It came along
right as we needed it.

562
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,008
They've put potentially
habitable worlds

563
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,541
right within our reach.

564
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:29,912
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

565
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:31,063
You sent probes into that?

566
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:32,181
Mmm-hmm.

567
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:34,849
We sent people into it.
Ten years ago.

568
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:38,520
The Lazarus missions.

569
00:32:38,553 --> 00:32:40,121
PROFESSOR BRAND:
Twelve possible worlds,

570
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:41,790
12 Ranger launches carrying

571
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:45,260
the bravest humans ever to live,

572
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:48,163
led by the remarkable
Dr. Mann.

573
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:49,598
Each person's landing pod

574
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:51,533
had enough life support
for two years.

575
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:53,535
But they could
use hibernation
to stretch that,

576
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,369
making observations on organics

577
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:57,071
over a decade or more.

578
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,307
Their mission was
to assess their world,

579
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:01,176
and if it showed potential,

580
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:02,778
then they could
send out a signal,

581
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:05,680
bed down for the long nap,
wait to be rescued.

582
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:07,616
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

583
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:09,585
Hence the bravery.

584
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:12,887
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

585
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:14,388
No.

586
00:33:15,658 --> 00:33:18,394
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

587
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:20,562
Simple binary pings
on an annual basis

588
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:23,499
give us some clue as to
which worlds have potential.

589
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:25,767
And one system shows promise.

590
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,970
One. That's a bit of
a long shot, isn't it?

591
00:33:29,204 --> 00:33:32,273
One system with
three potential worlds?

592
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:33,709
(CHUCKLES)
No long shot.

593
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:36,944
Okay.

594
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:39,982
So if we find a home,

595
00:33:42,817 --> 00:33:44,053
then what?

596
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,921
That's the long shot.

597
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:50,458
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

598
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:52,060
Did you notice anything strange

599
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,093
about the launch chamber?

600
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:08,410
COOPER: This entire facility's
a centrifuge.

601
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:11,013
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?

602
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:13,181
PROFESSOR BRAND: Both. Plan A.

603
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:15,484
How do you get it
off the ground?

604
00:34:15,517 --> 00:34:19,521
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

605
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:24,057
Suddenly we knew that
harnessing gravity was real.

606
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:26,628
So I started working on a theory

607
00:34:26,662 --> 00:34:29,097
and we started
building this station.

608
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:30,899
But you haven't solved it yet.

609
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:33,569
That's why there's Plan B.

610
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:36,370
The problem is gravity.

611
00:34:36,404 --> 00:34:39,074
How to get a viable amount of
human life off the planet.

612
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:40,841
This is one way.

613
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,445
Plan B: a population bomb.

614
00:34:43,477 --> 00:34:46,080
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs

615
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:48,283
weighing in at
just under 900 kilos.

616
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:50,886
Well, how would you raise 'em?

617
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,354
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

618
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:55,390
After that, with surrogacy,

619
00:34:55,423 --> 00:34:56,992
the growth becomes exponential.

620
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,494
Within 30 years,

621
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:01,363
we could have
a colony of hundreds.

622
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:03,164
The real difficulty
with colonization

623
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:04,466
is genetic diversity.

624
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,536
This takes care of that.

625
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:09,471
But what about
the people here?
You just...

626
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:11,073
You give up on 'em?

627
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:12,941
My kids?

628
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:16,945
That's why Plan A
is a lot more fun.

629
00:35:19,348 --> 00:35:20,949
How far have you got?

630
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:22,350
Almost there.

631
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:24,620
You're asking me
to hang everything

632
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:27,556
on an almost.

633
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:29,758
I'm asking you to trust me.

634
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:33,061
(SIGHS)

635
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:34,595
Find us a new home.

636
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,266
And by the time you return,

637
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,568
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

638
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,105
I give you my word.

639
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,119
YOUNG MURPH: Go away!

640
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:06,628
(SIGHING)

641
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,464
Murph.

642
00:36:09,497 --> 00:36:12,368
Go! If you're leaving,
just go.

643
00:36:15,637 --> 00:36:17,940
DONALD: This world was never
enough for you, was it, Coop?

644
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:20,608
What, because heading out there

645
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:22,611
is what I feel like
I was born to do?

646
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:25,380
And it excites me?

647
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:28,817
No, that does not make it wrong.

648
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,619
DONALD: It might.

649
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:33,155
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

650
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:36,591
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

651
00:36:36,624 --> 00:36:38,627
And the foundation's solid.

652
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:44,432
We farmers,
we sit here every year

653
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:47,101
when the rains fail and we say,

654
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:48,170
"Next year."

655
00:36:49,404 --> 00:36:51,006
Well, next year
ain't gonna save us,

656
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,674
nor the one after that.

657
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:55,077
This world's a treasure, Donald,

658
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,646
but it's been telling us
to leave for a while now.

659
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,318
Mankind was born on Earth,

660
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,121
it was never meant to die here.

661
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:10,825
Tom will be all right,

662
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:12,728
but you got to
make things right
with Murph.

663
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:13,762
I will.

664
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:17,865
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

665
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:30,546
You have to talk to me, Murph.

666
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:35,650
I need to fix this before I go.

667
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:38,086
Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

668
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:42,524
After you kids came along,
your mom,

669
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:44,827
she said something to me
I never quite understood.

670
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,829
She said, "Now,

671
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,101
"we're just here to be
memories for our kids."

672
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,809
And I think now I understand
what she meant.

673
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,912
Once you're a parent,

674
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:08,217
you're the ghost
of your children's future.

675
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,854
(SNIFFLES) You said
ghosts didn't exist.

676
00:38:18,693 --> 00:38:20,028
That's right, Murph.

677
00:38:23,398 --> 00:38:24,666
Murph, look at me.

678
00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:30,038
I can't be your ghost right now.

679
00:38:32,174 --> 00:38:33,942
I need to exist.

680
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,579
They chose me.

681
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:39,947
Murph, they chose me.

682
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:42,117
You saw. You're the one
who led me to 'em.

683
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:47,222
That's exactly why you can't go.

684
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:53,161
I figured out the message.

685
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:55,597
One word. Know what it is?

686
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:57,766
"Stay."

687
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,568
It says, "Stay," Dad.

688
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:00,736
(WHISPERS) Murph.

689
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:03,704
You don't believe me.

690
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:06,674
Look at the books!
Look at this. It says, "Stay."

691
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,311
Why... You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

692
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:11,879
No, I'm coming back.

693
00:39:11,913 --> 00:39:13,081
When?

One for you, one for me.

697
00:39:29,631 --> 00:39:32,834
When I'm up there
in hypersleep, or...

698
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:35,070
Or traveling
near the speed of light,

699

or near a black hole,

700
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,145
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

When we get back,

702
00:39:47,816 --> 00:39:49,617
we're gonna compare.

703
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,062
YOUNG MURPH: Time will
run differently for us?

704
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:52,086
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

705
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:54,555
By the time I get back,

706
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:57,726
we might even be
the same age, you and me.

"What?" Imagine that!

708
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:06,635
Aw, Murph...

709
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:08,936
You have no idea
when you're coming back.

710
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:12,174
- No idea at all!

Come on, Murph!

I love you forever.
And I'm coming back.

I'm coming back.

00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:18,738
Yeah.

00:41:18,773 --> 00:41:20,453
You look after our place
for me, all right?

728
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:22,175
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

90%?

Absolute honesty isn't
always the most diplomatic,

790

nor the safest form
of communication
with emotional beings.

00:47:58,406 --> 00:48:00,275
All right, we're all set.

818
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:02,243
Let's do it.

819
00:48:20,928 --> 00:48:22,230
(CHUCKLES)

820
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:32,640
COOPER: 30% of spin.

821
00:48:39,613 --> 00:48:40,748
One G.

822
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:43,618
How's gravity
treating you back there?

823
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:45,253
Well.

824
00:48:48,656 --> 00:48:50,591
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

825
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:52,126
- Yeah.
- You all right?

826
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,529
Mmm. Yeah,
I just need a minute.

827
00:48:54,562 --> 00:48:56,173
BRAND: Okay, I think
we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod.

828
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:57,731
I'm just gonna go get that.

829
00:48:57,765 --> 00:48:58,942
Might be in
the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec.

830
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:00,067
Hey, Brand?

831
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:01,669
Yeah?

832
00:49:01,703 --> 00:49:02,770
- Bring a lot.
- (LAUGHS)

833
00:49:12,113 --> 00:49:15,149
Amelia... Be safe.

834
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:16,817
Give my regards to Dr. Mann.

835
00:49:16,851 --> 00:49:18,719
I will, Dad.

836
00:49:18,753 --> 00:49:21,088
It looks good
for your trajectory.

837
00:49:21,122 --> 00:49:23,925
We've calculated
two years to Saturn.

838
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:26,327
That's a lot of Dramamine.

839
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:30,298
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

840
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:33,467
We'll be waiting for you
when you get back.

841
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,870
A little older, a little wiser,

842
00:49:35,903 --> 00:49:37,205
but happy to see you.

843
00:49:40,274 --> 00:49:44,245
"Do not go gentle
into that good night

844
00:49:44,278 --> 00:49:47,916
"Old age should burn and rave
at close of day

845
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:54,189
"Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

846
00:49:55,456 --> 00:49:59,459
"Though wise men at their end
know dark is right

847
00:49:59,493 --> 00:50:02,663

forked no lightning they

848

849
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:10,905

850
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:29,622
- DOYLE: (WHISPERS) You good?
- ROMILLY: Yeah.

851
00:50:30,324 --> 00:50:31,659
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

852
00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:36,531
Here. Pills.

853
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,402
So alone.

854
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:43,571
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

855
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:44,805
No, I mean them.

856
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:46,240
Hmm?

857
00:50:46,274 --> 00:50:47,641
COOPER: It's a perfect planet,

858
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:50,378
and we're not gonna
find another one like her.

859
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:53,248
No, it's not like
looking for a new condo.

860
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:56,551
The human race is going to be

861
00:50:56,951 --> 00:50:58,552
adrift,

862
00:50:58,586 --> 00:51:00,354
desperate for a rock
it can cling to

863
00:51:00,387 --> 00:51:01,722
while it catches its breath.

864
00:51:02,456 --> 00:51:04,758
We need to find that rock.

865
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:07,461
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what

866
00:51:07,494 --> 00:51:10,097
might sustain human life.

867
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,599
Laura Miller's planet is first.

868
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:13,968
Laura started
our biology program.

869
00:51:14,002 --> 00:51:15,002
COOPER: Mmm-hmm.

870
00:51:19,974 --> 00:51:21,408
BRAND: Uh,
Wolf Edmunds is here.

871
00:51:21,442 --> 00:51:22,677
Tell me about Edmunds.

872
00:51:23,878 --> 00:51:26,347
Oh, uh...
Wolf's a particle physicist.

873
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:30,852
None of them had families, huh?

874
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:35,189
No. No attachments.
My father insisted.

875
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:37,057
They all knew the odds against

876
00:51:37,091 --> 00:51:38,892
ever seeing
another human being again.

877
00:51:38,926 --> 00:51:40,894
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

878
00:51:40,928 --> 00:51:41,963
How about Mann?

879
00:51:41,964 --> 00:51:42,997
Dr. Mann?

880
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,232
Well, he's remarkable.
He's the best of us.

881
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:47,601
He inspired 11 people
to follow him

882
00:51:47,635 --> 00:51:49,737
on the loneliest journey
in human history.

883
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:51,305
Scientists, explorers.

884
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:53,374
That's what I love.

885
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:55,410
You know, out there
we face great odds.

886
00:51:55,943 --> 00:51:57,078
Death, but...

887
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:00,715
Not evil.

888
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:03,050
You don't think
nature can be evil?

889
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:05,453
No. Formidable.
Frightening. But...

890
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:07,689
No, not evil.

891
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:13,461
Well, is a lion evil because
it rips a gazelle to shreds?

892
00:52:13,494 --> 00:52:15,095
Just what we take
with us, is that it?

893
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:16,830
Yeah.

894
00:52:17,698 --> 00:52:19,400
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

895
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:21,168
Even me, huh?

896
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:23,137
You know what?
We agreed, 90%.

897
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,170
There you go.

898
00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:26,006
Don't stay up.

899
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,241
I'll be there in a minute.

900
00:52:27,274 --> 00:52:29,277
Just remember, Coop,

901
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,045
you are literally
wasting your breath.

902
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:39,519
COOPER: Hey, TARS?

903
00:52:39,553 --> 00:52:41,455
Let's go over that trajectory
one more time.

904
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:43,657
TARS: Eight months to Mars.

905
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,726
Counter-orbital
slingshot around.

906
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,295
Fourteen months to Saturn.
Nothing's changed on that.

907
00:52:48,328 --> 00:52:49,997
Just let me ask you something.

908
00:52:52,633 --> 00:52:53,910
(WHISPERING)
Dr. Brand and Edmunds...

909
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:55,894
TARS: Why are you whispering?
They can't hear you.

910
00:52:57,605 --> 00:52:59,106
(NORMAL VOICE)
Dr. Brand and Edmunds.

911
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,508
They close?

912
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:02,176
I wouldn't know.

913
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:05,345
Is that 90% "wouldn't know"
or 10% "wouldn't know"?

914
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:07,081
I also have
a discretion setting, Cooper.

915
00:53:07,114 --> 00:53:08,383
Oh.

916
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:11,886
But not a poker face, Slick.

917
00:53:24,297 --> 00:53:25,566
Hey, guys.

918
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:29,603
Dad's about to go down
for the long nap.

919
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:32,272
So I wanted to
give you an update.

920
00:53:32,305 --> 00:53:34,275
Uh...

921
00:53:34,308 --> 00:53:36,644
The Earth looks
amazing from here.

922
00:53:36,677 --> 00:53:38,345
Um...

923
00:53:38,379 --> 00:53:40,114
You can't see any of the dust.

924
00:53:40,147 --> 00:53:41,449
(CHUCKLES)

925
00:53:42,716 --> 00:53:45,786
I really hope
you guys are doing great.

926
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:47,259
I know you're gonna
get this message.

927
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:49,791
Professor Brand's assured me
that he's gonna get it to you.

928
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:52,193
Know that I love you.

929
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:55,329
Is it him?

930
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:56,602
DONALD:
I don't think so, Murph.

931
00:54:03,203 --> 00:54:04,705
You must be Donald.

932
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:08,007
Hello, Murph.

933
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:10,812
Why are you in my dad's truck?

934
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:13,648
He wanted me
to bring it for your brother.

935
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:16,584
He sent you a message.

936
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,055
She's pretty upset
with him for leaving.

937
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:23,724
If you record any messages,

938
00:54:23,757 --> 00:54:25,860
I can get them
to transmit it to Cooper.

939
00:54:27,194 --> 00:54:29,697
Murph is a bright spark.

940
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:33,700
Maybe I should fan the flame.

941
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:36,570
She's already making fools
of her teachers.

942
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:38,973
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

943
00:54:40,107 --> 00:54:41,509
So where are they?

944
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:42,844
Heading for Mars.

945
00:54:43,811 --> 00:54:45,746
The next time
you hear from Cooper,

946
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:47,715
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

947
00:55:27,788 --> 00:55:29,123
YOUNG TOM: school goes,

948
00:55:29,156 --> 00:55:31,491
the administration wants me
to repeat plant pathology.

949
00:55:31,525 --> 00:55:32,660
Which sucks.

950
00:55:33,394 --> 00:55:34,795
But they said I could start

951
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:36,197
advanced agriculture
a year early.

952
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:42,036
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.

953
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,542
DONALD: I'm sorry, Coop.

954
00:55:48,175 --> 00:55:50,110
I asked Murph to say hi,

955
00:55:50,144 --> 00:55:53,313
but she's as stubborn
as her old man.

956
00:55:53,346 --> 00:55:54,916
I'll try again next time.

957
00:56:10,197 --> 00:56:11,332
COOPER: You all right, Rom?

958
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:15,936
This gets to me, Cooper.

959
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,238
This. This.

960
00:56:18,272 --> 00:56:21,374
Millimeters of aluminum,
that's it, and then nothing

961
00:56:21,408 --> 00:56:23,276
out there for millions of miles

962
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,046
won't kill us in seconds.

963
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,316
You know that some of the finest

964
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:32,385
solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

965
00:56:32,419 --> 00:56:33,754
They don't know how.

966
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:35,308
And if they go overboard,
they're done.

967
00:56:37,491 --> 00:56:39,160
We're explorers, Rom.

968
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:42,597
This is our boat.

969
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:43,931
Here.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

973
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:13,093
COOPER: This is
from the relay probe?

974
00:57:13,127 --> 00:57:14,929
It was in orbit
around the wormhole.

975
00:57:15,496 --> 00:57:16,664
This is the wormhole,

976
00:57:16,697 --> 00:57:18,199
and every time we'd come around,

977
00:57:18,765 --> 00:57:20,500
we would receive images

978
00:57:20,534 --> 00:57:22,570
from the other side
of the foreign galaxy.

979
00:57:22,603 --> 00:57:24,505
Oh, yeah. Like swinging
a periscope around.

980
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:25,906
Exactly.

981
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,773
So we got a pretty good idea

982
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:30,144
what we're gonna find
on the other side, huh?

983
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:32,713
Navigationally.

984
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:35,859
BRAND ON INTERCOM:
Guys? Looks like we'll be

985
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:37,885
approaching the wormhole
in about three hours.

986
00:57:44,357 --> 00:57:45,357
Hey, Coop?

987
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:48,228
Can we stop the spinning?

988
00:57:48,262 --> 00:57:49,662
- Why?
- Um...

989
00:57:49,696 --> 00:57:51,732
Because we're close enough
to see it now?

990
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:54,267
All right.

991
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:56,069
(WHISPERS) Thanks.

992
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:04,278
There, that's it!
That's the wormhole!

993
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:05,446
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

994
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:07,848
It's a sphere.

995
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:11,284
Of course it is. You thought
it would just be a hole?

996
00:58:12,753 --> 00:58:14,821
No, it's just that
all the illustrations

997
00:58:14,854 --> 00:58:16,390
I've ever seen, they...

998
00:58:16,423 --> 00:58:17,791
ROMILLY: The illustrations

999
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:20,193
are trying to show you
how it works.

1000
00:58:20,226 --> 00:58:24,396
So they say you want to
go from here to there.

1001
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:25,566
But it's too far, right?

1002
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,100
Mmm-hmm.

1003
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:29,570
So a wormhole
bends space like this,

1004
00:58:29,603 --> 00:58:31,738
so you can take
a shortcut through

1005
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:33,674
a higher dimension.

1006
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:35,742
Okay, so,

1007
00:58:35,776 --> 00:58:37,144
to show that, they've turned

1008
00:58:37,177 --> 00:58:39,979
three-dimensional space
into two dimensions,

1009
00:58:40,013 --> 00:58:43,851
which turns a wormhole into
two dimensions... A circle.

1010
00:58:43,884 --> 00:58:45,920
What's a circle
in three dimensions?

1011
00:58:47,487 --> 00:58:48,789
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

1012
00:58:49,323 --> 00:58:51,592
A spherical hole.

1013
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:54,028
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

1014
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:56,695
I'm not thanking anybody

1015
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,100
until we get out of here
in one piece, Rom.

1016
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:07,807
Any trick to this, Doyle?

1017
00:59:09,409 --> 00:59:10,811
No one knows.

(SIGHING)

1019
00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:19,453
The others made it, right?

1020
00:59:21,722 --> 00:59:23,124
At least some of them.

1021
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:38,873
COOPER: Oh...

1022
00:59:55,523 --> 00:59:58,325
Everybody ready to say
good-bye to our solar system?

1023
00:59:59,392 --> 01:00:01,228
To our galaxy.

1024
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:04,397
Here we go.

01:00:16,076 --> 01:00:17,945
(RATTLING)

Your controls won't work here.

1028
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:40,834
We're passing through the bulk.

1029
01:00:40,868 --> 01:00:43,036
It's space beyond
our three dimensions.

1030

All you can do
is record and observe.

(BREATH TREMBLING)

What is that?

1033
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,821
I think it's them.

1034
01:01:01,855 --> 01:01:03,457
Distorting spacetime.

1035
01:01:05,826 --> 01:01:06,826
Don't! Don't!

What was that?

1040
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:40,427
The first handshake.

1041
01:01:42,196 --> 01:01:43,196
We're...

1042
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,066
We're here.

1043
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:08,821
So the lost communications
came through.

1044
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:10,257
BRAND: How?

1045
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,225
The relay on this side
cached them.

1046
01:02:12,259 --> 01:02:16,663
So years of basic data.
No real surprises.

1047
01:02:16,696 --> 01:02:20,266
Miller's site has kept
pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's.

1048
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,336
Edmunds' went down
three years ago.

1049
01:02:22,902 --> 01:02:24,337
Transmitter failure?

1050
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:26,039
Maybe. He was sending
the thumbs up

1051
01:02:26,072 --> 01:02:27,440
right until it went dark.

1052
01:02:27,474 --> 01:02:29,709
But Miller's still looks good,
though, right?

1053
01:02:29,743 --> 01:02:30,786
Because she's coming up fast.

1054
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,011
Mmm-hmm.

1055
01:02:32,045 --> 01:02:34,715
With one complication.

1056
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:37,650
The planet is much closer to
Gargantua than we thought.

1057
01:02:37,684 --> 01:02:39,019
COOPER: Gargantua?

1058
01:02:39,052 --> 01:02:40,563
It's what we're calling
the black hole.

1059
01:02:40,587 --> 01:02:42,956
Miller's and Dr. Mann's
planets both orbit it.

1060
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:44,925
And Miller's is on the horizon?

1061
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:46,435
ROMILLY: As a basketball
around a hoop.

1062
01:02:46,459 --> 01:02:48,662
Landing there takes us
dangerously close.

1063
01:02:48,695 --> 01:02:51,498
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

1064
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:55,935
Look, I could swing around

1065
01:02:55,969 --> 01:02:57,537
that neutron star to decelerate.

1066
01:02:57,571 --> 01:02:59,573
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's time.

1067
01:02:59,606 --> 01:03:01,642
The gravity on that planet
will slow our clock

1068
01:03:01,675 --> 01:03:03,744
compared to Earth's drastically.

1069
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:06,212
How bad?

1070
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:09,416
Every hour we spend
on that planet will be

1071
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:12,452
seven years back on Earth.

1072
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,022
(WHISPERS) Jesus!

1073
01:03:15,055 --> 01:03:16,390
Well, that's relativity, folks.

1074
01:03:18,191 --> 01:03:20,694
Well, we can't just
drop down there without...

1075
01:03:20,727 --> 01:03:22,762
Cooper, we have a mission.

1076
01:03:22,795 --> 01:03:23,973
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,

1077
01:03:23,997 --> 01:03:25,565
and our mission Plan A is

1078
01:03:25,598 --> 01:03:27,400
to find a planet that
can habitate the people

1079
01:03:27,433 --> 01:03:29,035
that are living
on the Earth right now.

1080
01:03:29,068 --> 01:03:30,446
You can't just think
about your family.

1081
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:31,881
Now, you have to think
bigger than that, all right?

1082
01:03:31,905 --> 01:03:33,307
I am thinking about my family

1083
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,175
and millions of
other families, okay?

1084
01:03:35,209 --> 01:03:37,343
Plan A does not work
if the people on Earth

1085
01:03:37,377 --> 01:03:39,046
are dead by the time
we pull it off.

1086
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,782
No. It doesn't.

1087
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:44,051
That's why there's a Plan B.

1088
01:03:46,086 --> 01:03:48,054
Okay. Cooper's right.

1089
01:03:48,088 --> 01:03:49,632
We need to think about time
as a resource,

1090
01:03:49,656 --> 01:03:50,891
just like oxygen and food.

1091
01:03:50,924 --> 01:03:52,244
Going down there
is gonna cost us.

1092
01:03:54,027 --> 01:03:55,195
All right, look.

1093
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,698
Dr. Mann's data
is promising, right,

1094
01:03:58,732 --> 01:04:00,476
but it's going to take us
months to get there.

1095
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,703
And Edmunds', it's even further.

1096
01:04:02,736 --> 01:04:03,904
Now Miller hasn't sent much,

1097
01:04:03,937 --> 01:04:05,247
but what she has sent
is very promising.

1098
01:04:05,271 --> 01:04:06,906
It's water, it's organics...

1099
01:04:06,939 --> 01:04:07,984
You don't find that every day.

1100
01:04:08,008 --> 01:04:09,576
No, you don't.

1101
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:12,079
And just think
about the resources,
including time,

1102
01:04:12,112 --> 01:04:14,181
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

1103
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:17,083
- Romilly?
- Yeah.

1104
01:04:17,117 --> 01:04:19,285
How far off from Miller's
planet do we have to be

1105
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:21,555
to stay out of the time shift?

1106
01:04:21,588 --> 01:04:22,823
Just back from the cusp.

1107
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,858
Which is here,

1108
01:04:24,892 --> 01:04:26,102
just outside of Miller's planet.

1109
01:04:26,126 --> 01:04:27,694
- ROMILLY: Right.
- Okay.

1110
01:04:29,129 --> 01:04:32,232
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

1111
01:04:32,265 --> 01:04:33,933
Instead of taking the Endurance

1112
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:35,210
into orbit
around Miller's planet,

1113
01:04:35,234 --> 01:04:36,736
which would conserve fuel,

1114
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:38,471
but we would lose a lot of time,

1115
01:04:38,505 --> 01:04:41,407
what if we take a wider orbit
around Gargantua,

1116
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:42,909
parallel with Miller's planet,

1117
01:04:42,943 --> 01:04:45,278
outside of this time shift,
to here?

1118
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,780
Then we take the Ranger down,

1119
01:04:46,813 --> 01:04:48,382
we get Miller,
we get her samples.

1120
01:04:48,415 --> 01:04:49,950
We come back,
we analyze, we debrief.

1121
01:04:49,983 --> 01:04:51,351
We're in, we're out.

1122
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:53,753
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a lot of time.

1123
01:04:53,787 --> 01:04:55,555
- That'll work.
- That's good.

1124
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:56,966
There's not gonna be time
for monkey business

1125
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,358
or chit-chat down there.

1126
01:04:58,392 --> 01:05:01,328
So, TARS, you should
definitely stay here.

1127
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:03,964
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

1128
01:05:03,997 --> 01:05:05,932
If we're talking
about a couple years,

1129
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:07,510
I could use the time
to research gravity.

1130
01:05:07,534 --> 01:05:09,169
Observations from the wormhole,

1131
01:05:09,202 --> 01:05:10,804
that's gold to Professor Brand.

1132
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:12,539
TARS, factor an orbit
of Gargantua.

1133
01:05:12,572 --> 01:05:14,775
Conserve fuel,
minimize thrusting,

1134
01:05:14,808 --> 01:05:17,043
but make sure we stay
in range of Miller's planet.

1135
01:05:17,077 --> 01:05:18,378
You got it?

1136
01:05:18,411 --> 01:05:19,912
TARS: I wouldn't
leave you behind,

1137

Is there any possibility...

1300
01:14:58,357 --> 01:14:59,859
I don't know...

1301
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:02,161
Some kind of way we can maybe
all jump in a black hole?

1302
01:15:02,194 --> 01:15:03,263

Don't shake your head at me.

1305
01:15:06,432 --> 01:15:08,435
Time is relative, okay?

1306
01:15:08,468 --> 01:15:11,071
It can stretch
and it can squeeze, but

1307
01:15:11,971 --> 01:15:14,406
it can't run backwards.
It just can't.

1308
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,476
The only thing that can move
across dimensions, like time,

1309
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:18,510
is gravity.

1310
01:15:21,147 --> 01:15:22,182
Okay.

1311
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:28,721
The beings that led us here,
they communicate

1312
01:15:28,754 --> 01:15:29,822
through gravity, right?

1313
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:30,890
(WHISPERS) Yes.

1314
01:15:30,923 --> 01:15:32,643
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

1315
01:15:33,493 --> 01:15:34,759
Maybe.

1316
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:35,795
Okay. If they can...

1317
01:15:37,196 --> 01:15:40,900
"They" are beings
of five dimensions.

1318
01:15:40,933 --> 01:15:43,903
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

1319
01:15:44,203 --> 01:15:45,937
To them,

1320
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:47,906
the past might be a canyon

1321
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,576
that they can climb into
and the future,

1322
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:53,246
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

1323
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,916
Look, Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

1324
01:15:59,352 --> 01:16:01,053
But you knew about relativity.

1325
01:16:01,087 --> 01:16:02,087

(INHALES DEEPLY)

1328
01:16:10,396 --> 01:16:12,965
My daughter was 10 years old.

1329
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:14,209
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories

1330
01:16:14,233 --> 01:16:16,235
before I left.

1331
01:16:16,269 --> 01:16:18,629
Couldn't you have told her you
were going to save the world?

1332
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:20,238
No.

1333
01:16:21,974 --> 01:16:24,410
When you become a parent,

1334
01:16:24,444 --> 01:16:25,684
one thing becomes really clear.

1335
01:16:27,914 --> 01:16:29,024
And that is that
you want to make sure

1336
01:16:29,048 --> 01:16:30,283
your children feel safe.

1337
01:16:32,118 --> 01:16:34,020
And it rules out
telling a 10-year-old

1338
01:16:34,053 --> 01:16:35,488
that the world is ending.

Oh, I had a couple of stretches.

1362
01:18:20,526 --> 01:18:22,662
But I stopped believing
you were coming back.

1363
01:18:22,695 --> 01:18:26,131
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1364
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:29,835
I learned what I could
from the black hole,

1460
01:23:36,275 --> 01:23:37,476
Then let's succeed.

1461
01:23:38,778 --> 01:23:39,778
So...

1462
01:23:40,512 --> 01:23:42,648
Back to the fourth iteration.

1463
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:44,950
Let's run it through
some new fields.

1464
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,352
With respect, Professor,

1465
01:23:46,385 --> 01:23:48,420
we've tried that
hundreds of times.

1466
01:23:48,454 --> 01:23:51,824
It only has to work once, Murph.

1467
01:23:55,594 --> 01:23:59,532
Every rivet that
they strike could
have been a bullet.

1468
01:23:59,565 --> 01:24:01,633
We've done well
for the world here,

1469
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:04,002
whether or not
we crack the equation

1470
01:24:04,035 --> 01:24:06,539
before I kick the bucket.

1471
01:24:06,572 --> 01:24:08,073
Don't be morbid, Professor.

1472
01:24:08,106 --> 01:24:09,275
I'm not afraid of death.

1473
01:24:10,142 --> 01:24:11,744
I'm an old physicist.

1474
01:24:13,145 --> 01:24:14,680
I'm afraid of time.

1475
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:23,021
MURPH: Time.

1476
01:24:25,224 --> 01:24:26,726
You're afraid of time.

1477
01:24:29,662 --> 01:24:31,663
For years, we've been
trying to solve the equation

1478
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:32,874
without changing
the underlying assumption

1479
01:24:32,898 --> 01:24:34,400
about time.

1480
01:24:34,433 --> 01:24:36,401
- And?
- And that means

1481
01:24:36,435 --> 01:24:41,140
Each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1482
01:24:41,173 --> 01:24:43,275
It's recursive.
It's nonsensical.

1483
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:45,277
Are you calling my life's work

1484
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:47,346
nonsense, Murph?

1485
01:24:47,379 --> 01:24:49,214
No, I'm saying
you've been trying to

1486
01:24:49,247 --> 01:24:50,481
finish it with one arm...

1487
01:24:50,515 --> 01:24:52,884
No, with both arms
tied behind your back.

1488
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,056
And I don't understand why.

1489
01:24:58,257 --> 01:24:59,892
I'm an old man, Murph.

1490
01:25:01,227 --> 01:25:03,962
Can we take this point up
at another time?

1491
01:25:03,995 --> 01:25:05,765
I want to talk to my daughter.

1492
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:11,003
PROFESSOR BRAND: Stepping out
into the universe,

1493
01:25:11,037 --> 01:25:14,407
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

1494
01:25:15,607 --> 01:25:20,546
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

1495
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:25,051
We must think not as
individuals but as a species.

1496
01:25:28,254 --> 01:25:31,424
"Do not go gentle
into that good night."

1497
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:34,493
COOPER: TARS
kept the Endurance

1498
01:25:34,526 --> 01:25:35,894
right where we needed her.

1499
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:38,997
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1500
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:42,067
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1501
01:25:42,735 --> 01:25:43,936
We have to choose.

1502
01:25:45,237 --> 01:25:46,372
But how?

1503
01:25:47,505 --> 01:25:48,974
They're both promising.

1504
01:25:50,642 --> 01:25:52,545
Edmunds' data is better,

1505
01:25:52,578 --> 01:25:55,481
but Dr. Mann is the one
still transmitting.

1506
01:25:55,514 --> 01:25:56,648
We've no reason to suspect

1507
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:58,084
Edmunds' data would have soured.

1508
01:25:59,585 --> 01:26:02,020
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1509
01:26:02,054 --> 01:26:03,455
As does Dr. Mann's.

1510
01:26:03,488 --> 01:26:04,990
Cooper, this is my field.

1511
01:26:06,225 --> 01:26:07,225
And...

1512
01:26:08,527 --> 01:26:10,496
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1513
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:11,864
Why?

1514
01:26:11,897 --> 01:26:13,132
Gargantua, that's why.

1515
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,204
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes.

1516
01:26:19,238 --> 01:26:22,406
But no life. Sterile.

1517
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,840
We'll find the same thing
on Mann's.

1518
01:26:24,109 --> 01:26:26,044
Because of the black hole?

1519
01:26:26,078 --> 01:26:27,212
BRAND: Murphy's Law.

1520
01:26:27,246 --> 01:26:29,515
Whatever can happen will happen.

1521
01:26:29,548 --> 01:26:31,816
Accident is the first
building block of evolution.

1522
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:33,161
But when you're orbiting
a black hole,

1523
01:26:33,185 --> 01:26:34,753
not enough can happen.

1524
01:26:34,786 --> 01:26:37,389
It sucks in asteroids
and comets,

1525
01:26:37,422 --> 01:26:39,458
other events which would
otherwise reach you.

1526
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:41,026
We need to go further afield.

1527
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:43,963
You once said that Dr. Mann

1528
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:47,199
was the best of us.

1529
01:26:47,232 --> 01:26:49,068
He's remarkable.

1530
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:50,341
We're only here because of him.

1531
01:26:51,036 --> 01:26:53,004
And yet here he is.

1532
01:26:53,038 --> 01:26:54,640
He's on the ground,

1533
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:57,209
and he's sending a very
unambiguous message,

1534
01:26:57,242 --> 01:27:00,045
telling us to
come to his planet.

1535
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:04,483
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1536
01:27:05,084 --> 01:27:06,184
We should vote.

1537
01:27:06,217 --> 01:27:07,419
Well, if we're going to vote,

1538
01:27:07,453 --> 01:27:08,773
there's something
you should know.

1539
01:27:09,388 --> 01:27:10,923
Brand?

1540
01:27:10,956 --> 01:27:12,091
He has a right to know.

1541
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:14,493
That has nothing to do with it.

1542
01:27:14,859 --> 01:27:16,195
What does?

1543
01:27:16,228 --> 01:27:18,063
She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1544
01:27:18,097 --> 01:27:19,164
ROMILLY: Is that true?

1545
01:27:19,197 --> 01:27:20,466
Yes.

1546
01:27:23,902 --> 01:27:26,205
And that makes me
want to follow my heart.

1547
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,676
But maybe we've spent too long

1548
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,545
trying to figure all this out
with theory.

1549
01:27:33,579 --> 01:27:35,213
You're a scientist, Brand.

1550
01:27:35,247 --> 01:27:36,582
So listen to me

1551
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:41,219
when I say that love isn't
something we invented.

1552
01:27:41,253 --> 01:27:43,255
It's (SIGHS)

1553
01:27:43,289 --> 01:27:45,491
observable, powerful.

1554
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:49,628
It has to mean something.

1555
01:27:49,661 --> 01:27:52,163
Love has meaning, yes.
Social utility,

1556
01:27:52,197 --> 01:27:54,033
social bonding, child rearing...

1557
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:56,168
We love people who have died.

1558
01:27:56,202 --> 01:27:57,562
Where's the social utility
in that?

1559
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,704
None.

1560
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:03,307
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't

1561
01:28:03,342 --> 01:28:05,744
yet understand.

1562
01:28:05,778 --> 01:28:08,848
Maybe it's some evidence,
some...

1563
01:28:10,315 --> 01:28:12,551
artifact of a higher dimension

1564
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:14,786
that we can't
consciously perceive.

1565
01:28:14,819 --> 01:28:17,289
I'm drawn across the universe

1566
01:28:17,322 --> 01:28:19,624
to someone I haven't seen
in a decade,

1567
01:28:19,658 --> 01:28:22,928
who I know is probably dead.

1568
01:28:22,962 --> 01:28:26,498
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving

1569
01:28:26,531 --> 01:28:28,934
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1570
01:28:31,236 --> 01:28:32,671
Maybe we should trust that,

1571
01:28:32,704 --> 01:28:34,607
even if we can't
understand it yet.

1572
01:28:40,378 --> 01:28:41,747
All right, Cooper...

1573
01:28:43,915 --> 01:28:44,950
Yes,

1574
01:28:46,818 --> 01:28:49,522
the tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

1575
01:28:50,589 --> 01:28:51,957
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1576

Honestly, Amelia,

1577
01:28:56,895 --> 01:28:57,895
it might.

Would you like
some more souffle?

No, no. I'm full, thanks.
It was delicious.

01:31:26,277 --> 01:31:28,513
He's been asking for you
since he came to.

1621
01:31:28,546 --> 01:31:29,847
We were trying to reach you.

1622
01:31:32,784 --> 01:31:33,784
MURPH: (WHISPERS)
Hey.

1623
01:31:35,921 --> 01:31:36,921
Murph.

1624
01:31:37,922 --> 01:31:39,223
Hi. I'm here, Professor.

1625
01:31:40,325 --> 01:31:42,894
(WEAKLY) I let them all down.

1626
01:31:42,927 --> 01:31:46,031
No, you got us so far!
Real close.

1627
01:31:48,066 --> 01:31:50,102
I'll finish what you started.

1628
01:31:50,135 --> 01:31:52,037
Good, good, Murph.

1629
01:31:54,539 --> 01:31:56,475
You had faith

1630
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:59,110
all those...

1631
01:32:00,379 --> 01:32:01,947
All those years.

1632
01:32:03,615 --> 01:32:04,717
I...

1633
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:07,352
I asked you to have faith.

1634
01:32:09,521 --> 01:32:11,990
I wanted you to believe

1635
01:32:13,725 --> 01:32:15,360
that your father...

1636
01:32:18,663 --> 01:32:20,132
would come back.

1637
01:32:20,532 --> 01:32:21,734
I do, Professor.

1638
01:32:23,435 --> 01:32:24,837
Forgive me, Murph.

1639
01:32:25,737 --> 01:32:27,473
There's nothing to forgive.

1640
01:32:30,341 --> 01:32:31,341
I...

1641
01:32:32,077 --> 01:32:33,746
I lied, Murph.

1642
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:37,883
I lied to you.

1643
01:32:44,422 --> 01:32:47,392
There was no need for him

1644
01:32:48,827 --> 01:32:50,395
to come back.

1645
01:32:53,565 --> 01:32:56,401
There is no...
No way to help us.

1646
01:32:57,735 --> 01:32:58,837
But Plan A...

1647
01:32:59,538 --> 01:33:02,406
All this. All these people.

1648
01:33:03,642 --> 01:33:05,277
And the equation.

1649
01:33:09,614 --> 01:33:11,116
Did my father know?

1650
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,555
Did he leave me?

1651
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:21,625
Do

1652
01:33:23,127 --> 01:33:24,163
Not

1653
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:26,131
go

1654
01:33:27,732 --> 01:33:29,168
Gentle...

1655
01:33:31,402 --> 01:33:32,402
No.

1656
01:33:34,172 --> 01:33:35,172
No!

1657
01:33:36,408 --> 01:33:37,976
You can't leave.

1658
01:33:38,409 --> 01:33:39,444
You... No.

1659
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:42,681
MURPH: Dr. Brand,
I'm sorry to tell

1660
01:33:42,714 --> 01:33:45,384
that your father died today.
He had no pain.

1661
01:33:45,918 --> 01:33:47,451
He was at peace.

1662
01:33:48,654 --> 01:33:50,522
I'm very sorry for your loss.
(SNIFFLES)

1664
01:34:07,105 --> 01:34:08,574
He told you, right?

This was all a sham.

1668
01:34:21,386 --> 01:34:23,422
You left us here.

1669
01:34:24,923 --> 01:34:26,325
To suffocate.

1670
01:34:28,626 --> 01:34:29,928

just how good it can be
to see another face.

1682
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,635
I hadn't a lot of hope
to begin with, but...

1683
01:37:57,668 --> 01:37:59,538
After so long, I had none.

1684
01:38:01,539 --> 01:38:04,142
My supplies were
completely exhausted.

1685
01:38:06,411 --> 01:38:07,879
The last time I went to sleep,

1686
01:38:07,912 --> 01:38:09,714
I didn't even set a waking date.

1687
01:38:14,119 --> 01:38:16,321
You have literally
raised me from the dead.

- Hmm.

What about the others?

Our world, we hope.

1698
01:38:50,288 --> 01:38:52,357
Our world, uh, is cold,

1699
01:38:52,824 --> 01:38:53,859
stark,

1700
01:38:55,926 --> 01:38:57,495
but undeniably beautiful.

1701
01:39:00,298 --> 01:39:03,235
The days are 67 hours long,
cold.

1702
01:39:07,539 --> 01:39:09,074
The nights are

1703
01:39:09,107 --> 01:39:11,309
67 far colder hours.

1704
01:39:17,616 --> 01:39:22,119
The gravity is a very, very
pleasant 80% of the Earth's.

1705
01:39:22,153 --> 01:39:25,389
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali,

1706
01:39:25,423 --> 01:39:27,392
and the air has too much
ammonia in it to breathe

1707
01:39:27,425 --> 01:39:28,993
for more than
just a few minutes,

1708
01:39:29,026 --> 01:39:30,862
but down at the surface...

1709
01:39:30,895 --> 01:39:32,897
And there is a surface.

1710
01:39:33,798 --> 01:39:35,800
The chlorine dissipates.

1711
01:39:35,833 --> 01:39:38,036
The ammonia gives way
to crystalline hydrocarbons

1712
01:39:38,069 --> 01:39:39,337
and breathable air.

1713
01:39:39,771 --> 01:39:41,706
To organics.

1714
01:39:41,739 --> 01:39:43,607
Possibly, even to life.

1715
01:39:45,009 --> 01:39:47,378
We might be sharing this world.

1716
01:39:47,412 --> 01:39:49,580
These readings
are from the surface?

1717
01:39:49,613 --> 01:39:53,017
Over the years,
I've dropped various probes.

1718
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:54,361
COOPER: How far
have you explored?

1719
01:39:54,385 --> 01:39:56,521
I've mounted
several major expeditions.

1720
01:39:56,554 --> 01:39:58,222
But with oxygen
in limited supply,

1721
01:39:58,256 --> 01:40:00,624
KIPP there really did
most of the legwork.

TARS: What went wrong
with him, sir?

1723

DR. MANN: Degeneration.

1724
01:40:03,694 --> 01:40:05,696
He misidentified
the first organics we found

1725
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:07,298
as ammonia crystals.

1726
01:40:07,332 --> 01:40:08,866
He struggled on for a time,

1727
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:11,602
but ultimately
I decommissioned him

1728
01:40:11,636 --> 01:40:14,338
and used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1729
01:40:14,371 --> 01:40:17,008
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down!

1730
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:18,561
TARS: Would you like me
to look at him?

1731
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:22,180
No. No.
He needs a human touch.

She's... She's grown.

1743
01:41:03,788 --> 01:41:05,290
He told you, right?

(BITTER LAUGH)

1745
01:41:08,259 --> 01:41:09,461

This was all a sham.

1747
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:15,533

Did my father know, too?

(SOBBING) Dad?

1752
01:41:33,518 --> 01:41:35,320
I just want to know

1753
01:41:36,855 --> 01:41:38,589
if you left me here to die.

1754
01:41:41,392 --> 01:41:43,328
I just have to know.

(CONTINUES SOBBING)

Cooper, my...

1757
01:41:51,969 --> 01:41:54,272
My father dedicated

1758
01:41:54,305 --> 01:41:56,373
his whole life to Plan A.

1759
01:41:56,407 --> 01:41:59,010
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

1760
01:42:00,812 --> 01:42:01,812
DR. MANN: I do.

1761
01:42:07,585 --> 01:42:09,754
He never even hoped to
get the people off the Earth?

1762
01:42:10,955 --> 01:42:11,955
No.

1763
01:42:16,461 --> 01:42:17,571
But he's been trying to solve

1764
01:42:17,595 --> 01:42:19,431
the gravity equation
for 40 years.

1765
01:42:20,965 --> 01:42:23,835
Amelia, your father
solved his equation
before I even left.

1766
01:42:25,002 --> 01:42:26,704
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1767
01:42:26,737 --> 01:42:28,740
The equation couldn't
reconcile relativity

1768
01:42:28,773 --> 01:42:30,875
with quantum mechanics.
You need more.

1769
01:42:30,909 --> 01:42:33,009
More? More what?

1770
01:42:33,043 --> 01:42:34,312
DR. MANN: More data.

1771
01:42:34,345 --> 01:42:36,247
You need to see
into a black hole.

1772
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:38,349
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1773
01:42:38,383 --> 01:42:39,684
Romilly, is that true?

1774
01:42:41,252 --> 01:42:42,787
If a black hole is an oyster,

1775
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:45,189
then the singularity's
the pearl inside.

1776
01:42:45,222 --> 01:42:47,925
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden
in darkness

1777
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:49,127
behind the horizon.

1778
01:42:50,895 --> 01:42:53,129
That's why we call it
a black hole.

1779
01:42:53,163 --> 01:42:55,232
Okay, but (BREATHING HEAVILY)

1780
01:42:55,266 --> 01:42:56,506
if we see beyond the horizon...

1781
01:42:57,068 --> 01:42:59,036
We can't, Coop.

1782
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:00,114
DR. MANN:
There are some things

1783
01:43:00,138 --> 01:43:01,539
that aren't meant to be known.

1784
01:43:01,572 --> 01:43:03,408
Your father had to
find another way

1785
01:43:03,441 --> 01:43:05,777
to save the human race
from extinction.

1786
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:07,311
Plan B. A colony.

1787
01:43:07,344 --> 01:43:08,847
Why not tell people?

1788
01:43:10,681 --> 01:43:12,415
Why keep building
those damn stations?

1789
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:13,885
Because he knew
how hard it would be

1790
01:43:13,918 --> 01:43:16,219
to get people to work together
to save the species

1791
01:43:16,254 --> 01:43:17,689
instead of themselves.

1792
01:43:18,222 --> 01:43:19,357
Or their children.

1793
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:20,924
Bullshit.

1794
01:43:20,958 --> 01:43:22,469
You never would've come here
unless you believed

1795
01:43:22,493 --> 01:43:23,994
you were gonna save them.

1796
01:43:24,028 --> 01:43:26,230
Evolution has yet
to transcend
that simple barrier.

1797
01:43:26,263 --> 01:43:29,100
We can care deeply, selflessly

1798
01:43:29,133 --> 01:43:30,534
about those we know,

1799
01:43:30,567 --> 01:43:32,103
but that empathy rarely extends

1800
01:43:32,136 --> 01:43:33,303
beyond our line of sight.

1801
01:43:33,337 --> 01:43:34,906
But the lie.

1802
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,478
That monstrous lie?

1803
01:43:41,846 --> 01:43:42,846
Unforgivable.

1804
01:43:43,347 --> 01:43:45,716
And he knew that.

1805
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:47,752
He was prepared to
destroy his own humanity

1806
01:43:47,785 --> 01:43:50,120
in order to save the species.

1807
01:43:50,154 --> 01:43:51,298
He made an incredible sacrifice.

1808
01:43:51,322 --> 01:43:52,424
No.

1809
01:43:53,992 --> 01:43:56,427
No, an incredible sacrifice
is being made

1810
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:58,696
by the people on Earth
who are gonna die!

1811
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:02,132
Because in his arrogance

1812
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:03,802
he declared their case hopeless.

1813
01:44:04,568 --> 01:44:05,937
I'm sorry, Cooper,

1814
01:44:06,604 --> 01:44:07,972
their case is hopeless.

1815
01:44:08,272 --> 01:44:10,008
No. No.

1816
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,110
We are the future.

1817
01:44:16,247 --> 01:44:17,949
Cooper, what can I do?

1818
01:44:21,252 --> 01:44:23,687
Let me go home.

1819
01:44:23,721 --> 01:44:26,490
GETTY: You're
absolutely positive?

1820
01:44:26,524 --> 01:44:28,593
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1821
01:44:29,327 --> 01:44:30,662
It's worthless?

1822
01:44:30,695 --> 01:44:31,830
It's half the answer.

1823
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:35,834
Okay. How do you find
the other half?

1824
01:44:36,634 --> 01:44:38,469
Out there? A black hole.

1825
01:44:38,502 --> 01:44:39,870
But stuck down here on Earth?

1826
01:44:39,904 --> 01:44:41,071
Yeah?

1827
01:44:42,606 --> 01:44:44,075
I'm not sure you can.

1828
01:44:46,443 --> 01:44:48,746
GETTY: God,
they just pack up and leave.

1829
01:44:50,447 --> 01:44:52,150
What are they hoping to find?

1830
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:53,916
Survival.

1831
01:45:01,759 --> 01:45:02,759
Damn it.

1832
01:45:05,697 --> 01:45:07,031
Murph.

1833
01:45:07,064 --> 01:45:08,499
Don't... (SIGHS)

1834
01:45:08,533 --> 01:45:09,853
Don't people have
a right to know?

1835
01:45:10,234 --> 01:45:12,337
Well, panic won't help.

1836
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:14,539
We just have to keep working,
same as ever.

1837
01:45:14,572 --> 01:45:16,574
Yeah. But isn't that exactly

1838
01:45:16,607 --> 01:45:17,984
what Professor Brand was
manipulating us to do?

1839
01:45:18,008 --> 01:45:19,376
Brand gave up on us.

1840
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:21,012
I'm still trying to solve this.

1841
01:45:21,813 --> 01:45:22,813
So...

1842
01:45:24,348 --> 01:45:25,850
Do you have an idea?

1843
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:27,886
A feeling.

1844
01:45:31,488 --> 01:45:33,156
I told you about my ghost.

1845
01:45:35,593 --> 01:45:37,795
My dad thought
I called it a ghost

1846
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:39,297
because I was scared of it.

1847
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,360
But I was never scared of it.

1848
01:45:46,804 --> 01:45:49,073
I called it a ghost
because it felt...

1849
01:45:51,676 --> 01:45:53,177
It felt like a person.

1850
01:45:56,013 --> 01:45:57,373
It was trying to
tell me something.

1851
01:46:00,818 --> 01:46:03,321
If there's an answer
here on Earth, it's back there

1852
01:46:04,155 --> 01:46:05,790
somehow, in that room.

1853
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:08,059
So I have to find it.

1854
01:46:09,293 --> 01:46:10,293
(ENGINE STARTING)

1855
01:46:11,662 --> 01:46:13,197
We're running out of time.

1856
01:46:15,666 --> 01:46:17,568
CASE: What about auxiliary
oxygen scrubbers?

1857
01:46:17,602 --> 01:46:18,869
COOPER: No,
they can stay, CASE.

1858
01:46:18,903 --> 01:46:20,080
I'll be sleeping
most of the way, anyway.

1859
01:46:20,104 --> 01:46:21,806
- Hey, Coop.
- Yeah.

1860
01:46:21,839 --> 01:46:24,008
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1861
01:46:24,042 --> 01:46:25,375
Yeah, what's that?

1862
01:46:25,409 --> 01:46:26,889
Have one last crack
at the black hole.

1863
01:46:28,446 --> 01:46:30,281
I'm going home, Rom.

1864
01:46:30,314 --> 01:46:33,183
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to
cost you any time.

1865
01:46:34,452 --> 01:46:36,052
There's a chance
for the people on Earth.

1866
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,721
Talk to me.

1867
01:46:37,755 --> 01:46:39,923
Gargantua's an older
spinning black hole.

1868
01:46:39,957 --> 01:46:42,293
It's what we call
a gentle singularity.

1869
01:46:42,593 --> 01:46:43,861
Gentle?

1870
01:46:43,894 --> 01:46:45,530
They're hardly gentle.

1871
01:46:45,563 --> 01:46:47,665
But the tidal gravity
is so quick that

1872
01:46:47,698 --> 01:46:50,468
something crossing the horizon
fast might survive.

1873
01:46:50,501 --> 01:46:52,270
A probe, say.

1874
01:46:52,303 --> 01:46:53,704
What happens after it crosses?

1875
01:46:53,737 --> 01:46:57,174
After the horizon
is a complete mystery.

1876
01:46:57,208 --> 01:47:00,277
So, what's to say there
isn't some way that the probe

1877
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:03,314
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1878
01:47:03,347 --> 01:47:04,648
If he's equipped to transmit

1879
01:47:04,682 --> 01:47:06,851
every form of energy
that can pulse.

1880
01:47:06,884 --> 01:47:09,120
TARS: Just when did this probe
become a "he," Professor?

1881
01:47:09,954 --> 01:47:11,623
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1882
01:47:12,757 --> 01:47:14,924
I've already told him
what to look for.

1883
01:47:14,959 --> 01:47:17,495
TARS: I need the old optical
transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.

1884
01:47:17,528 --> 01:47:18,963
You'd do this for us?

1885
01:47:18,996 --> 01:47:20,331
TARS: Before
you get all teary,

1886
01:47:20,364 --> 01:47:21,575
try to remember that as a robot

1887
01:47:21,599 --> 01:47:22,800
I have to do anything you say.

1888
01:47:23,801 --> 01:47:25,469
Your cue light's broken.

1889
01:47:25,503 --> 01:47:26,871
TARS: I'm not joking.

1890
01:47:29,941 --> 01:47:31,575
I'm gonna need TARS
to remove and adapt

1891
01:47:31,608 --> 01:47:33,310
some components from KIPP.

1892
01:47:33,343 --> 01:47:35,646
Well, I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1893
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:36,981
ROMILLY: Oh, I'll supervise.

1894
01:47:37,414 --> 01:47:38,883
All right.

1895
01:47:38,916 --> 01:47:41,519
Dr. Mann, we need to find
three secure sites.

1896
01:47:41,552 --> 01:47:43,988
One for Brand's lab,
two for habitat.

1897
01:47:44,021 --> 01:47:46,199
Once those modules
have landed, you don't
want to move 'em.

1898
01:47:46,223 --> 01:47:47,534
Well, I can take you
to the probe sites,

1899
01:47:47,558 --> 01:47:48,892
but I don't think this...

1900
01:47:48,926 --> 01:47:50,361
These conditions are gonna hold.

1901
01:47:50,394 --> 01:47:51,828
I think we should wait.

1902
01:47:51,862 --> 01:47:53,163
COOPER: CASE is
headed back down

1903
01:47:53,197 --> 01:47:54,999
with the rest
of the distillery equipment.

1904
01:47:55,032 --> 01:47:57,335
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1905
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:02,340
Well, these squalls
do usually blow over.

1906
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,509
Okay then.

1907
01:48:04,542 --> 01:48:06,653
- But you're gonna need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1908
01:48:06,677 --> 01:48:08,012
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

1909
01:48:08,578 --> 01:48:09,578
Follow me.

1910
01:48:10,515 --> 01:48:12,883
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

1911
01:48:12,916 --> 01:48:14,052
TARS: Roger that, Cooper.

1912
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:23,261
DR. MANN: Brand told me why
you feel you have to go back.

1913
01:48:25,395 --> 01:48:28,332
But I'd be remiss if I didn't
at least mention that

1914
01:48:28,366 --> 01:48:29,734
a mission such as ours

1915
01:48:29,767 --> 01:48:32,270
could certainly use
an extra engineer.

(BEEPING)

1917
01:48:34,472 --> 01:48:36,841
You better slow down, turbo.

1918
01:48:36,874 --> 01:48:38,342
Safety first, CASE, remember.

1919
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:40,910
CASE ON RADIO:
Safety first, Cooper.

1920
01:48:42,246 --> 01:48:43,714
COOPER: I have to
tell you, Dr. Mann,

1921
01:48:43,748 --> 01:48:45,649
I'm honored to be
a part of this.

1922
01:48:45,683 --> 01:48:48,018
But once we set up base camp

1923
01:48:48,052 --> 01:48:50,354
and secure those modules,
my work's done here.

1924
01:48:51,122 --> 01:48:52,155
I'm going home.

1925

You have attachments.

1926
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,601
But even without a family, I can

1927
01:49:04,635 --> 01:49:06,470
promise you that, that yearning

1928
01:49:06,504 --> 01:49:08,773
to be with other
people is powerful.

1929

That emotion
is at the foundation

of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

don't you, Cooper?

has time to worry

2267
02:13:40,076 --> 02:13:41,556
about relativity right now,
Dr. Brand.

2268
02:13:46,081 --> 02:13:47,584
I'm sorry, Cooper.

2269
02:13:50,853 --> 02:13:52,164
COOPER: Once we've gathered
enough speed

2270
02:13:52,188 --> 02:13:53,623
around Gargantua,

2271
02:13:54,123 --> 02:13:55,692
we use Lander 1

2272
02:13:56,726 --> 02:13:58,795
and Ranger 2
as rocket boosters to

2273
02:14:00,096 --> 02:14:01,998
push us out
of the black hole's gravity.

2274
02:14:04,567 --> 02:14:06,269
The Lander's linkages
have been destroyed,

2275
02:14:07,503 --> 02:14:09,572
so we'll have to
control manually.

2276
02:14:10,907 --> 02:14:14,343
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

2277
02:14:14,377 --> 02:14:16,377

right into that black hole.

2279
02:14:18,547 --> 02:14:19,758

shed the weight

to escape the gravity.

have ever figured out

of getting somewhere
is to leave something behind.

Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

He's a robot.

2428

02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,301
Roger that.

You survived.

2444
02:26:56,538 --> 02:26:57,539

2445
02:26:58,273 --> 02:27:00,542
in their fifth dimension.

2446
02:27:00,575 --> 02:27:02,111
They saved us.

02:27:02,978 --> 02:27:06,215
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?

2448
02:27:06,248 --> 02:27:08,183
And just why would
they want to help us, huh?

2449
02:27:08,216 --> 02:27:09,884
I don't know,
but they constructed

2450
02:27:09,918 --> 02:27:11,220
this three-dimensional space

2451
02:27:11,253 --> 02:27:13,121

Yes, it is.

2455
02:27:18,527 --> 02:27:20,104
You've seen that time
is represented here

2456
02:27:20,128 --> 02:27:22,364
as a physical dimension.

2457
02:27:22,397 --> 02:27:24,099
You have worked out
that you can exert

Affirmative.

Gravity

2462
02:27:36,078 --> 02:27:38,680

including time.

2463

Do you have the quantum data?

Roger. I have it.

2466

I am transmitting it
on all wavelengths,

2467
02:27:52,094 --> 02:27:53,895
but nothing is getting out,
Cooper.

I can do this. I can do this.

2469
02:27:56,498 --> 02:27:58,967
But such complicated data
to a child?

2470
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,235
Not just any child.

2471

Oh, come on, Dad.

Murph, the fire's out!
Come on!

2474

Even if you communicate it here,

2475
02:28:11,046 --> 02:28:14,014
she won't understand
its significance for years.

2476
02:28:14,049 --> 02:28:15,951
I get that, TARS. All right?

2477
02:28:15,984 --> 02:28:17,952
But we've got to
figure something out

are gonna die.

Cooper,

2481
02:28:22,557 --> 02:28:24,827
they didn't bring us here
to change the past.

2482
02:28:28,197 --> 02:28:30,298
Say that again.

2483
02:28:30,332 --> 02:28:33,202
They didn't bring us here
to change the past.

2484
02:28:38,006 --> 02:28:40,142
No, they didn't bring us
here at all.

2485
02:28:44,746 --> 02:28:46,348
We brought ourselves.

COOPER: TARS, give me
the coordinates for NASA

COOPER: (PANTING)
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

2492
02:29:34,630 --> 02:29:36,298
I brought myself here!

2493
02:29:37,599 --> 02:29:40,669
We're here to communicate with
a three-dimensional world.

2494
02:29:41,135 --> 02:29:42,638
We're the bridge!

2495
02:29:50,812 --> 02:29:52,346
I thought they chose me.

2496
02:29:56,117 --> 02:29:58,053
But they didn't choose me,
they chose her.

2497
02:29:58,086 --> 02:29:59,138
TARS: For what, Cooper?

2498
02:29:59,139 --> 02:30:00,189
(LAUGHS)

2499
02:30:02,057 --> 02:30:03,559
To save the world.

2500
02:30:08,129 --> 02:30:10,899
All of this
is one little girl's bedroom.

2501
02:30:10,932 --> 02:30:12,500
Every moment.

2502
02:30:12,534 --> 02:30:14,369
It's infinitely complex.

2503
02:30:14,402 --> 02:30:16,638
They have access
to infinite time and space,

2504
02:30:16,672 --> 02:30:19,241
but they're not
bound by anything!

2505
02:30:19,274 --> 02:30:22,444
They can't find
a specific place in time.

2506
02:30:22,477 --> 02:30:23,745
They can't communicate.

2507
02:30:25,614 --> 02:30:28,316
That's why I'm here. I'm gonna
find a way to tell Murph,

2508
02:30:28,349 --> 02:30:30,085
just like I found this moment.

2509
02:30:30,118 --> 02:30:31,185
TARS: How, Cooper?

2510
02:30:31,219 --> 02:30:32,754
Love, TARS, love.

2511
02:30:32,787 --> 02:30:35,089
It's just like Brand said.
My connection with Murph,

2512
02:30:35,123 --> 02:30:37,292
it is quantifiable.
It's the key!

2513
02:30:37,325 --> 02:30:38,927
TARS: What are we here to do?

2514
02:30:39,995 --> 02:30:40,996
Find how to tell her.

2515

2516
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:50,405

into Morse and feed it to me.

never came back for it?

2522
02:31:11,259 --> 02:31:13,795
She will. She will.

02:36:46,394 --> 02:36:47,696
Yes, it is.

2590
02:36:50,465 --> 02:36:52,968
DOCTOR: We'll have you checked
out of here in a couple days.

2591
02:36:55,303 --> 02:36:57,638
I'm sure you'll be excited
to see what's in store.

2592
02:36:59,240 --> 02:37:03,444
I actually did a paper on you
in high school.

2593
02:37:03,477 --> 02:37:05,614
I know all about your life
back on Earth.

2594
02:37:07,281 --> 02:37:08,283
Oh, yeah.

2595
02:37:08,583 --> 02:37:09,818
Right.

2596
02:37:12,753 --> 02:37:14,055
If you'll follow me,

2597
02:37:14,088 --> 02:37:16,958
we've got a really
good situation for you.

2598
02:37:21,162 --> 02:37:24,398
So, um, when I made
my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,

2599
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:28,403
I was delighted to hear that
she thought it was perfect.

2600
02:37:32,073 --> 02:37:33,317
OLD WOMAN 1:
It was just constant.

2601
02:37:33,341 --> 02:37:35,877
Just that steady blow of dirt.

2602
02:37:35,910 --> 02:37:38,780
Of course, I didn't
speak to her personally.

2603
02:37:38,813 --> 02:37:40,815
We always
set the plate upside-down.

2604
02:37:40,848 --> 02:37:44,050
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.

2605
02:37:44,085 --> 02:37:48,956
My dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else
back then.

2606
02:37:48,989 --> 02:37:51,826
There just wasn't enough food.

2607
02:37:51,859 --> 02:37:54,428
OLD WOMAN 2: We wore
little things, little strips

2608
02:37:54,462 --> 02:37:58,666
of sheet, put it sometimes
over our nose and mouth,

2609
02:37:58,700 --> 02:38:00,010
so we wouldn't
breathe so much of it.

2610
02:38:00,034 --> 02:38:03,271
Well, it was pretty exciting
for me because it was hope.

2611
02:38:03,304 --> 02:38:05,206
OLD MAN: I don't care
who describes it,

2612
02:38:05,240 --> 02:38:07,742
there is no way for it to be
exaggerated. It was that bad.

2613
02:38:07,775 --> 02:38:09,510
ADMINISTRATOR:
She did confirm

2614
02:38:09,544 --> 02:38:11,679
just how much you loved farming.

2615
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:13,414
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.

2616
02:38:13,448 --> 02:38:15,216
Here we are.

2617
02:38:15,250 --> 02:38:16,950
Home sweet home.

2618
02:38:16,984 --> 02:38:19,854
Everything replaced
and put back where it...

2619
02:38:26,461 --> 02:38:27,528
Hey, is this...

2620
02:38:27,561 --> 02:38:29,130
Oh, yeah.

2621
02:38:29,163 --> 02:38:31,966
The machine we found
out near Saturn
when we found you, yes.

2622
02:38:31,999 --> 02:38:33,701
Its power source was shot,

2623
02:38:33,735 --> 02:38:35,045
but we could get you
another one if you want it.

2624
02:38:35,069 --> 02:38:36,471
Yes. Please.

2625
02:38:38,239 --> 02:38:39,374
TARS: Settings.

2626
02:38:40,174 --> 02:38:42,143
General settings.

2627
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:43,478
Security settings.

2628
02:38:46,748 --> 02:38:48,450
Honesty, new setting,

2629
02:38:50,084 --> 02:38:52,119
95%.

2630
02:38:52,153 --> 02:38:54,255
TARS: Confirmed.
Additional customization?

2631
02:38:55,356 --> 02:38:56,357
Humor,

2632
02:38:58,125 --> 02:38:59,260
75%.

2633
02:38:59,861 --> 02:39:01,896
TARS: Confirmed.

2634
02:39:01,929 --> 02:39:05,265
Auto self-destruct
T minus 10, nine...

2635
02:39:05,300 --> 02:39:06,935
Let's make that 60%.

2636
02:39:09,503 --> 02:39:11,306
TARS: 60% confirmed.

2637
02:39:12,306 --> 02:39:13,440
Knock-knock.

2638
02:39:13,474 --> 02:39:14,908
You want 55?

2639
02:39:20,181 --> 02:39:22,350
TARS: Is this really
what it was like?

2640
02:39:24,719 --> 02:39:26,988
It was never this clean,
Slick. (CHUCKLES)

2641
02:39:31,426 --> 02:39:33,260
I don't care much for this

2642
02:39:33,294 --> 02:39:34,929
pretending we're back
where we started.

2643
02:39:37,365 --> 02:39:39,200
I want to know where we are.

2644
02:39:41,236 --> 02:39:42,403
Where we're going.

2645
02:39:47,208 --> 02:39:49,511
Mr. Cooper.
The family's all in there.

2646
02:39:50,444 --> 02:39:51,779
Family?

2647
02:39:51,813 --> 02:39:53,246
Yeah, they all came out
to see her.

2648
02:39:53,281 --> 02:39:55,283
She's been in cryo-sleep
for almost two years.

2649
02:40:12,132 --> 02:40:13,168
(SOBBING)

2650
02:40:28,682 --> 02:40:30,451
You told 'em I like farming.

2651
02:40:31,251 --> 02:40:32,387
(LAUGHING)

2652
02:40:36,457 --> 02:40:37,925
It was me, Murph.

2653
02:40:40,661 --> 02:40:42,197
I was your ghost.

2654
02:40:43,631 --> 02:40:44,966
I know.

2655
02:40:47,135 --> 02:40:48,903
People didn't believe me.

2656
02:40:48,936 --> 02:40:51,406
They thought that
I was doing it all myself.

2657
02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:53,074
But...

2658
02:40:55,810 --> 02:40:57,345
I knew who it was.

2659
02:41:02,783 --> 02:41:04,352
Nobody believed me.

2660
02:41:05,619 --> 02:41:07,388
But I knew you'd come back.

2661
02:41:10,224 --> 02:41:11,226
How?

2662
02:41:13,694 --> 02:41:16,231
Because my dad promised me.

2663
02:41:22,770 --> 02:41:24,505
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

2664
02:41:25,806 --> 02:41:27,108
I'm here.

2665
02:41:28,709 --> 02:41:29,911
No.

2666
02:41:32,546 --> 02:41:35,916
No parent should have to
watch their own child die.

2667
02:41:39,287 --> 02:41:41,322
I have my kids here for me now.

2668
02:41:44,525 --> 02:41:45,660
You go.

2669
02:41:49,363 --> 02:41:50,398
Where?

2670
02:41:54,368 --> 02:41:55,536
Brand.

2671
02:42:05,146 --> 02:42:06,948
She's out there,

2672
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:14,589
setting up camp.

2673
02:42:41,882 --> 02:42:43,184
Alone

2674
02:42:44,885 --> 02:42:46,720
in a strange galaxy.

2675
02:42:58,533 --> 02:43:02,737
Maybe right now she's
settling in for the long nap

2676
02:43:21,289 --> 02:43:23,624
by the light of our new sun

2677
02:43:39,573 --> 02:43:41,274
in our new home.
