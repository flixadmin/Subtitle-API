00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:24,471
There's simply no way to shield
against every weaponized agent.

3
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,472
Instead, I can make
super-immune systems

4
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,426
by strengthening
the human cellular response.

5
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:30,357
Banner, I know
where you're going.

6
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:33,472
But manipulating the immune system
is dangerous and stupid.

7
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:37,473
The president's science advisors
made it absolutely clear...

8
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,561
no human subjects.

9
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:04,695
David, I have wonderful news.

10
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:09,869
I'm gonna have a baby.

11
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:53,516
What's it gonna be?  Whoa, look at that,
Bruce. Huh?  Want a dinosaur?

12
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:55,466
Come on,
let's have another fight. Come on.

13
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:58,018
You don't scare me.

14
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:03,848
That's a delicious eyeball.  Ooh, you're big
and green and scary.  I'm gonna run away.

15
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:33,389
Really, speaking of Cheryl,
guess... what...

16
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,153
Bruce, you're hurt!

17
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:39,414
Jack hit 'im with the stick,
but... Bruce wouldn't hit 'im back.

18
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,612
He just stood there, shaking.

19
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:43,439
It's okay.

20
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:53,069
Yeah, strange
he didn't make a peep.

21
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,110
Any other kid
would've wailed his head off.

22
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:59,586
That's Bruce. He's like that.
He's just so... bottled up.

23
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:07,158
The samples we found in your lab...
they were human blood.

24
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:09,173
You've ignored protocol.

25
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:11,942
You had no right
snooping around in my lab.

26
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:13,774
That's my business.

27
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:17,785
Wrong, Banner. It's government business,
and you're off the project.

28
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,990
Attention, to all personnel.
Fail-safe has been initiated.

29
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:45,687
Gamma decontamination
will occur in 30 minutes!

30
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,426
Evacuate immediately!

31
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:48,497
I repeat...

32
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,400
- Edith?
- David, what's going on?

33
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,689
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

34
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,868
What are you doing?

35
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,735
David, please, stop it!
No!

36
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,483
- David, no!

37
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:08,092
David! No!

38
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:17,709
Bruce.

39
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:20,464
Bruce, wake up, son.

40
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:23,515
Bruce. Bruce.

41
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,260
Another nightmare?

42
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,727
I don't know.
I don't remember.

43
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,147
Hi, mom.

44
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:43,710
Already off to college.
Gonna miss you terribly.

45
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,362
I'll miss you too.

46
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,195
Please. Come here.

47
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:52,140
Look at you.

48
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:55,315
Soon to be a great scientist.

49
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:56,877
I guess.

50
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:58,774
- I mean, who knows?
- I do.

51
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:03,490
There's something inside you...
so special.

52
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,094
Some kind of greatness.

53
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:08,386
I'm sure,
someday you're gonna...

54
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:10,979
share it with
the whole world.

55
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:08,891
But, as far as I'm concerned,
security oughta be...

56
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:10,420
Good morning, dr. Krenzler.

57
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,226
Security oughta be beefed up a lot more.
In a place like this, you can't be too careful...

58
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:17,197
Bruce!  Big day.

59
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:20,241
- Did you sleep?  I didn't sleep.
- I slept okay.

60
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:22,134
- Is Betty here?
- She's around.

61
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:26,128
I really gotta say, seeing you
in that stylin' head wear...

62
00:12:26,352 --> 00:12:28,383
You're implying something
about my helmet?

63
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,893
You look like a massive nerd,
even around other scientists.

64
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,844
Can I just ask... were you wearing
the helmet while she dumped you?

65
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:38,433
See, it protects
my very important brain, Harper.

66
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:41,024
Go prep the samples.

67
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:45,837
- Hey. I found you.
- Betty, hey.

68
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:50,278
I hate them.

69
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,254
- Wait, I just got here. Who do we hate?
- The review board.

70
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:55,333
We have to make
a presentation on Tuesday.

71
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,479
And you're gonna
make it with me.

72
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:02,956
- You think I should?
- Yeah, you're great with that stuff.

73
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:08,311
You start talkin' about microbes and
nanomeds, you sound almost... passionate.

74
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:14,071
I'm sorry.
That was rude.

75
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:16,318
Look, nobody expects this
to be easy,

76
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:21,243
us working together
after being... so close.

77
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:22,908
We were close?

78
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:26,077
Look, if I could be more...

79
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,276
whatever, you know, I'm...

80
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:32,199
- just...
- Don't.

81
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:34,573
It's not your fault, really.

82
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:35,700
You're just a by-product

83
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,495
of my... inexplicable obsession
with emotionally distant men.

84
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,471
I'll get over us.

85
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:44,472
Good for you.

86
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,843
Anyway, I'm just really stressed
about this review.

87
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:48,418
If we don't get
impressive results today,

88
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:51,302
we're gonna have
a really hard sell come Tuesday.

89
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,394
Well, then,
let's go be impressive.

90
00:14:39,652 --> 00:14:40,565
Harper?

91
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:43,977
- Ready when you are.
- Let's hit it.

92
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:52,698
- We passing inspection?
- Safeties all going green.

93
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,034
Countdown... started.

94
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:00,223
Nanomeds released.

95
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:03,996
Four seconds.

96
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:10,188
Okay.
Nanomeds fully dispersed.

97
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,281
Okay. Let's hit Freddie
with the gamma radiation.

98
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:30,273
Gamma exposure.

99
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,756
Nanomeds now active.

100
00:15:38,714 --> 00:15:41,248
Nanomeds replicating
cells on border.

101
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:42,910
It's working...

102
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:50,844
Cell copy to disassemble ratio
holding within one percent.

103
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:00,430
Imbalanced nanomed activity.

104
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:14,982
You wanna go to the review board
on Monday and tell 'em

105
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:18,003
we've developed a brand-new
method for exploding frogs?

106
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:20,656
Yeah. I think maybe
there's a market for it.

107
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:23,119
And what if there's a plague?

108
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,186
What have you had, Betty,
like, one beer?

109
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:29,422
I'm just sa...
I'm just saying, you know,

110
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,254
frogs start falling from the sky,

111
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:37,051
who do they come to?
We'd be world-renowned.

112
00:16:37,225 --> 00:16:38,847
Make any parent proud.

113
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:41,759
I bet they would be.

114
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:45,137
They actually did want me
to be a scientist.

115
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,501
I mean, your birth parents.

116
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:51,962
Guess we'll never know.

117
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:58,198
I don't understand why
you don't wanna find out about them.

118
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:01,739
They're dead. They died before
I can remember anything. And it...

119
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,620
Why do you always
come back to this?

120
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:06,491
Don't know.

121
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,253
Guess I figure there's
more to you than you like to show.

122
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:13,708
I guess
there couldn't be any less.

123
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:17,723
Right. So now we come
full circle back to that.

124
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,652
Nice work, Betty.

125
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:34,403
Betty!

126
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:37,822
- Glen!
- Hey.

127
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:39,177
Hi.

128
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:40,875
Hi.

129
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:45,290
What happened
to your uniform?

130
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,054
Oh, I, uh... I switched over.

131
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,475
I'm still working
with your father, but...

132
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:53,933
Well, you know, the military's subcontracting out
all the most interesting work, and...

133
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,512
can't argue with a paycheck.

134
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,214
I basically run
all the labs on the base now.

135
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:01,275
Oh.

136
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:08,234
Hey, you...
You're looking good.

137
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,439
You're the genetics expert.

138
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,556
Ah, the good old college days.

139
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:34,052
So, how's business?

140
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,753
What do you want?

141
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:41,836
All right, I'll cut to the chase.

142
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,259
I've been hearing interesting things
about what you guys are doing here.

143
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,348
Your little molecular machines
have some incredible implications.

144
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,182
How would you like
to come work for Atheon?

145
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:55,043
Get paid 10 times as much
as you earn now...

146
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:58,023
and own a piece of the patents.

147
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:04,571
- You just have to say the word.
- Two words. The door.

148
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:25,699
General?

149
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:27,690
Come in.

150
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,846
Talbot wanted you to see this, sir.

151
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,191
It's about a lab Atheon is targeting for
acquisition and removal to desert base.

152
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:39,019
Why isn't it
going through NSC?

153
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:44,497
It, uh, concerns
your daughter, sir.

154
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:54,680
Hi. Sorry.

155
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,136
Hey, what happened to Benny?

156
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,149
Is he not working
the night shift anymore?

157
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:03,513
Benny's dead.
I'm the new guy.

158
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:06,712
Oh.

159
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:10,771
- Good to meet you.
- Same.

160
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:39,166
- Let's try another.
- Mm, no. Stay here.

161
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:43,419
- I look tired anyway.
- Yeah, but you look great.

162
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,551
What's the matter?

163
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,712
It's these dreams, doctor.

164
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,982
I keep having 'em,
and they're terrible.

165
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:58,845
Tell me about your dream.

166
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,003
Well, it starts...

167
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,281
It starts with a memory...
I think it's my first memory.

168
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,030
It's this... image I have...

169
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:13,217
from when I was
maybe two years old.

170
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:46,739
Do you think
it's just a dream?

171
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:49,787
No, I think it's something
that happened when...

172
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,534
I was living at a desert base
with my father.

173
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:55,214
Anyhow...

174
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,117
the dream goes on, and...

175
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:00,289
suddenly I'm alone.

176
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,218
That's terrible.
You know I'd never hurt you.

177
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:17,735
Hey, there.

178
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:23,842
What's your name, darlin'?
Eh? What's your name?

179
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,378
Okay. It's okay.

180
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,537
<i>I gotta talk to you, Edith.</i>

181
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,712
<i>Bruce, stay here!</i>

182
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:46,942
"C... T... G...

183
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:50,247
A... G."

184
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:54,422
Bruce.

185
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,554
My Bruce.

186
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:14,468
Good morning.
Glen dropped by.

187
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:17,603
- What's he doing here?
- You know, dr. Krenzler,

188
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:21,296
you and I have never had the chance
to get to know each other properly.

189
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:25,383
Well, that's because I don't wanna get
to know you, properly or improperly.

190
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,097
So, leave.

191
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,158
Hey, no worries.

192
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:41,994
Yeah, let me give you
a little heads-up.

193
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,240
There is a hairsbreadth
between friendly offer...

194
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,473
and hostile takeover.

195
00:27:47,604 --> 00:27:51,517
I've done my homework.
The work you're doing here is dynamite.

196
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:54,518
Think. GI's embedded with
technology

197
00:27:54,562 --> 00:27:57,084
that makes them instantly
repairable on the battlefield,

198
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,258
in our sole possession.

199
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,775
That's a hell of a business.

200
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:06,737
Well, it's not what we're doing here.
We're doing the basic science for everyone.

201
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:11,160
You know, someday
I'm gonna write a book...

202
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:16,391
and I'm gonna call it "When Stupid Ideals
Happen To Smart, Penniless Scientists".

203
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:20,382
In the meantime, Bruce,
you will be hearing from me.

204
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:46,870
- About Glen, I, um...
- There's nothing to talk about.

205
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:51,697
Okay.

206
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:56,136
I just wanted to say, don't worry
about 'im... I'll handle it.

207
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,150
How?

208
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:06,516
I'm gonna call my father,
ask him to exert some pressure.

209
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:09,927
Last I heard, you and your father
weren't speaking.

210
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:11,510
Hm.

211
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:13,229
Well...

212
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,861
I guess now I have something
to talk with him about.

213
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,357
<i>I think this circuit's kinda fried.</i>

214
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:22,020
<i>I-I don't know.  Maybe you
wanna come take a look at it.</i>

215
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,898
Okay, I'll be right there.

216
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:54,218
The gamma's too high!
Bruce, I can't stop it!

217
00:29:57,102 --> 00:29:58,477
Harper, get out!

218
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,039
Get out!

219
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:30,871
- How's Harper?
- He's all right.

220
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:33,350
You saved him.

221
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:36,597
I don't think he's coming back
to the lab for a while, though.

222
00:30:42,768 --> 00:30:45,021
I don't understand
how this is possible.

223
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,589
You should be dead.

224
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:54,402
They worked... the nanomeds.

225
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,914
I mean, I feel great.

226
00:30:55,914 --> 00:30:59,244
I feel like... I don't know.
They must have, like, fixed me.

227
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:03,227
Bruce, they've killed everything else
that they've come into contact with.

228
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:09,015
- Are you sure the doctor checked?
- The doctor gave me the full workup.

229
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:11,590
He wants to know where
he can get what I'm taking.

230
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:14,201
I'm a hundred percent.

231
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:16,688
More.

232
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,477
- What do you mean?
- Remember my bad knee?

233
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:24,072
Well, now it's my good knee.

234
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:29,523
Bruce, this isn't funny.
I was watching you.

235
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:33,819
You were gonna die,
and I was gonna have to watch you die.

236
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:35,945
Betty...

237
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:39,081
I'm sorry.

238
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:42,281
Really.

239
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:48,254
- Hey, I'm not gonna explode, okay?
- Yeah.

240
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:53,386
You should get some rest.
And I'm fine, really.

241
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:57,643
I've never felt better.

242
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:04,108
Your name is not Krenzler.
It's Banner.

243
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:10,481
- What?
- Your name...

244
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:14,270
it's Banner. Bruce Banner.

245
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:16,683
Bruce.

246
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:21,656
- How did you get in here?
- I work here now.

247
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:24,612
In the labs.
The late shift.

248
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:28,017
It keeps me close to you.

249
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:32,233
You always work so late yourself
with your friend, Miss Ross.

250
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:36,198
No, no. Please. Please.
Let me.

251
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,711
You're not well.

252
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:44,877
You've had
a terrible accident.

253
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,038
You're wondering
why you're still alive.

254
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:55,175
You're thinking
there's something... inside.

255
00:33:56,226 --> 00:33:58,420
Something different...

256
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:02,445
inexplicable.

257
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:07,765
I can help you understand...
if you'll let me.

258
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:12,018
If you'll...

259
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,708
forgive me.

260
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:24,422
Look, mister, I'm sure I have
nothing to forgive you for.

261
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:29,540
So, perhaps you should leave now.
I'll be fine.

262
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:31,841
You must know.

263
00:34:32,555 --> 00:34:37,527
You may not want to believe it,
but I can see it... in your eyes.

264
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:41,582
So much like your mother's.

265
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:45,268
Of course,
you're my flesh and blood.

266
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:49,276
But then,
you're somethin' else too, aren't you?

267
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:55,406
My physical son,
but the child of my mind, too.

268
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,998
No. You're lying.

269
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,819
My parents died
when I was a small boy.

270
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:06,107
No, no, no, that's not true. That's not true.
That's what they wanted you to believe.

271
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:09,412
The experiments, the accident...
all top secret.

272
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:12,544
They put me away for 30 years.

273
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,481
Thirty years!

274
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:20,236
Away from you.
Away from our work.

275
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:23,457
But they couldn't keep me forever.

276
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:26,135
After all, I'm sane.
They had to admit it.

277
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,726
You see,

278
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:31,950
everything...

279
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:38,146
your extraordinary mind
has been seeking all these years...

280
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,858
it's been inside you.

281
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:45,575
Now, we will understand it.
We will harness it.

282
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:50,636
No, don't answer it.
It's Miss Ross again.

283
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:55,203
There's something you need to know
about her, Bruce. Something troublesome.

284
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:57,292
Let me protect you from 'er.

285
00:35:58,315 --> 00:36:00,463
No. Get out.

286
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:02,880
- Bruce...
- Get out!

287
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:04,900
Sit!

288
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:25,641
We're gonna have to watch
that... temper of yours.

289
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:08,737
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, just glad to be out of bed.

290
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:15,123
Got a message from my father.
He's coming to see me.

291
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:16,821
- Your father?
- Mm.

292
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:20,549
- When?
- Lands in about an hour.

293
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:23,758
The funny thing is...
he called me.

294
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:38,395
- Hi, dad.
- Hello, Betty.

295
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,570
- Here, ma'am.
- Thanks.

296
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,872
- You're welcome. Sir?
- Thank you.

297
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,008
You're welcome.

298
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:04,792
Look, I'm gonna...
get right to it.

299
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,613
It's about Glen, isn't it?

300
00:38:09,092 --> 00:38:11,384
He's been snooping
around my lab.

301
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,102
Glen noticed some things.
Asked me to make some inquiries.

302
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:23,086
- Are you here to... question me?
- No.

303
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,071
We've turned up
some surprising things.

304
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:31,922
This Krenzler you work with...

305
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,574
you know who he really is?

306
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,218
How much do you
actually know about 'im?

307
00:38:39,326 --> 00:38:40,714
I think the question is,

308
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:44,248
what is it
that you know about him?

309
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:50,479
- Well, right now, I'm not at liberty...
- Not at liberty to disclose it to me, right.

310
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:51,880
Right.

311
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:54,304
You know...

312
00:38:55,013 --> 00:38:57,605
I think I was hoping that...

313
00:38:58,056 --> 00:39:03,209
maybe this time you just...
honestly wanted to see me again.

314
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:06,928
- You've got this all wrong, Betty.
- Do I?

315
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:10,838
Yes. I do wanna see you.

316
00:39:13,277 --> 00:39:16,248
I really wish that
I could believe you.

317
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,936
<i>Everything...</i>

318
00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:09,502
<i>your extraordinary mind
has been seeking...</i>

319
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,894
<i>all these years,</i>

320
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:14,396
<i>it's been inside you.</i>

321
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:34,964
<i>Hi, you've called dr. Krenzler.</i>

322
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:38,095
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll call you right back.</i>

323
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:42,876
<i>Bruce. Hey. Are you there?</i>

324
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:46,117
<i>Look, um,
I think I screwed up.</i>

325
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,770
<i>My father... It's... it's like he suspects
you of something. I don't know.</i>

326
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,945
<i>I was so impatient,
like always, and</i>

327
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:56,489
<i>I didn't hear him out.
I don't know, I...</i>

328
00:40:56,944 --> 00:41:00,424
<i>I just think that they're planning
something with the lab.</i>

329
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,207
<i>So, um, uh...</i>

330
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,120
<i>Call me. Okay?</i>

331
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:05,018
<i>Bye.</i>

332
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:09,167
Betty!

333
00:42:46,353 --> 00:42:49,267
Dispatch! Dispatch!
We have a 4-15 at the lab!

334
00:42:49,353 --> 00:42:52,047
Send Berkeley P.D. now!
Send 'em now!

335
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,415
Watch out!

336
00:44:26,735 --> 00:44:29,036
<i>- Edith?
- David, what is going on?</i>

337
00:44:30,326 --> 00:44:33,543
<i>- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.</i>

338
00:45:05,723 --> 00:45:07,897
My big Bruce.

339
00:45:22,029 --> 00:45:23,578
Bruce?

340
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,501
There was some sort
of explosion.

341
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,998
They wouldn't let us
into the building.

342
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:09,255
I was worried about you.

343
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:11,414
Well... I'm okay.

344
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:15,994
What happened
to you last night?

345
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:19,735
I had the most vivid dream.

346
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,462
It was like being born.

347
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:27,005
Coming up for air.
Light hitting my face.

348
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:28,528
Screaming...

349
00:46:29,823 --> 00:46:31,349
My heartbeat...

350
00:46:32,345 --> 00:46:34,305
it was, like, boom...

351
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:36,911
boom...

352
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:41,209
boom...

353
00:46:47,252 --> 00:46:51,080
- Were you at the lab?
- No.

354
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:53,782
But something...

355
00:46:56,697 --> 00:47:00,293
And there was that man.
The one with the dogs.

356
00:47:01,336 --> 00:47:02,067
Who?

357
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:08,834
That new janitor.
He said he was my father.

358
00:47:15,175 --> 00:47:16,112
I'll get it.

359
00:47:26,658 --> 00:47:28,280
My father.

360
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,291
My, my...

361
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,660
So, this is
the young Bruce Ban...

362
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:46,622
Krenzler.

363
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,999
I think you left something
in your lab last night.

364
00:47:55,984 --> 00:47:56,789
Mitchell!

365
00:47:56,825 --> 00:48:00,604
Escort my daughter outside.
I'll join her shortly.

366
00:48:01,229 --> 00:48:05,019
- I'd rather stay here.
- Now! Betty...

367
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,358
It's okay. I'll be fine.

368
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:24,439
Keep 'im under observation.
I'll be back.

369
00:48:32,418 --> 00:48:34,766
- What?
- Your friend in there.

370
00:48:34,973 --> 00:48:38,601
There's a good chance he's caught up
in some... very bad business.

371
00:48:38,601 --> 00:48:40,684
Unfinished business.

372
00:48:41,348 --> 00:48:43,933
And I promise you, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

373
00:48:44,627 --> 00:48:46,657
You have my word
I'll make sure he's cared for.

374
00:48:47,105 --> 00:48:49,896
But as of right now,
he is incommunicado.

375
00:48:49,896 --> 00:48:52,150
And for the next
few days, at least,

376
00:48:52,454 --> 00:48:56,347
you're gonna stay away
from here. For your own good.

377
00:49:04,847 --> 00:49:07,713
Okay, and that's for the new guy
on the night shift, right?

378
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:11,500
Great. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

379
00:49:29,524 --> 00:49:30,920
Dr. Ross...

380
00:49:32,353 --> 00:49:35,654
How unexpected.
Please, come in.

381
00:49:41,374 --> 00:49:44,984
I'm sorry to just... show up
at your house... like this.

382
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:45,662
Uh...

383
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:52,507
I came to... ask you
something that...

384
00:49:53,095 --> 00:49:55,859
I really have
no business asking.

385
00:49:57,899 --> 00:50:02,185
- He told you.
- He said you talked to 'im.

386
00:50:02,508 --> 00:50:03,657
Oh.

387
00:50:04,508 --> 00:50:06,030
Please, sit down.

388
00:50:14,902 --> 00:50:18,729
Bruce was at the lab last night.
He said that you were there too.

389
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,087
But he can't remember
much about it.

390
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:24,008
I need to find out
what happened.

391
00:50:24,043 --> 00:50:27,513
So, you wanna know, uh,
what's wrong with him...

392
00:50:29,034 --> 00:50:30,686
so you can fix 'im?

393
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:33,562
Cure him, change him.

394
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,641
My father's with the military.

395
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:41,363
He seems to think he's involved
in some kind of threat to national security.

396
00:50:41,363 --> 00:50:43,037
Mm.

397
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,223
Your father. Ross.

398
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:51,343
You brought your father down
upon his head?

399
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:54,430
How little you understand,
Miss Ross,

400
00:50:54,473 --> 00:50:58,028
and how dangerous
your ignorance has become.

401
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:02,300
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

402
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:04,431
My son is...

403
00:51:06,152 --> 00:51:07,579
unique.

404
00:51:07,866 --> 00:51:09,829
That's why you can't relate to 'im.

405
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:16,427
And because he is unique, the world
will not tolerate his existence, will they?

406
00:51:17,651 --> 00:51:19,230
But... you...

407
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:24,239
you try... don't you?

408
00:51:26,731 --> 00:51:27,678
Yes.

409
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:35,582
And a very beautiful woman
like you,

410
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:38,254
your attentions...

411
00:51:38,741 --> 00:51:42,437
can't be completely unwanted.

412
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:44,916
Can they?

413
00:51:46,264 --> 00:51:47,015
No.

414
00:51:48,568 --> 00:51:51,813
Not with... eyes like yours,

415
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,004
watching... expectantly,

416
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:57,043
lovingly.

417
00:52:00,745 --> 00:52:03,570
But I'm afraid
we're both too late to help 'im.

418
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:05,876
There's nothing
I can do for him...

419
00:52:06,782 --> 00:52:08,362
or for you.

420
00:52:09,086 --> 00:52:10,137
Besides,

421
00:52:11,442 --> 00:52:13,944
he's made it clear
he wants nothing to do with me.

422
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:15,728
His choice.

423
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:20,008
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Ross,
I have some work to do.

424
00:52:20,816 --> 00:52:24,737
And don't worry about the... dogs.
You'll be fine.

425
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:27,708
Just don't look 'em in the eyes.

426
00:52:30,978 --> 00:52:31,952
Goodbye.

427
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:37,837
He gets released, and a month later
your lab is destroyed.

428
00:52:37,924 --> 00:52:39,073
What a coincidence.

429
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:42,046
So, you're just not gonna tell me
where he is, are ya?

430
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,559
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'd like to help you, but I just don't know.

431
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,993
You know who I am.
Right, Banner?

432
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:50,014
Your Betty's father.
You're a high-ranking general.

433
00:52:50,014 --> 00:52:51,402
Let's cut the crap.

434
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:55,274
I'm the guy who had your father
tossed away, and a lot more like 'im,

435
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:58,574
and I'll do the same with you
if I feel so disposed. You understand?

436
00:52:58,574 --> 00:53:01,299
If you had 'im tossed away,
then why are you asking me?

437
00:53:01,299 --> 00:53:04,996
I don't remember. I was
always told my father was dead.

438
00:53:04,996 --> 00:53:06,905
Don't play with me!

439
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:09,828
You were four years old
when you saw it.

440
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:11,999
When I saw what?

441
00:53:11,999 --> 00:53:16,137
You were right there.
How could anyone forget a thing like that?

442
00:53:18,483 --> 00:53:19,067
What?

443
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:22,612
Oh, some more repressed memories.

444
00:53:25,845 --> 00:53:27,844
Just tell me.

445
00:53:30,628 --> 00:53:32,203
I'm sorry, son.

446
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:37,245
You're an even more screwed-up mess
than I thought you'd be.

447
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,189
Until we get
to the bottom of this,

448
00:53:41,195 --> 00:53:44,195
your lab has been declared
a top-secret military site

449
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,153
and you're not gonna get
a security clearance to get back into it...

450
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:50,577
or any other lab that's doin'
anything more interesting than...

451
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:54,577
tryin' to figure out
the next generation of herbal hair gel.

452
00:53:57,496 --> 00:53:58,868
One more thing.

453
00:54:00,024 --> 00:54:01,670
If you ever...

454
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,400
come within a thousand yards
of my daughter again,

455
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:09,721
I'll put you away for the rest
o' your natural life.

456
00:54:24,245 --> 00:54:25,567
Dogs!

457
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:30,760
Go! Go get 'er!

458
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:34,214
And let nothing
stand in your way!

459
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:36,781
Go!

460
00:55:41,328 --> 00:55:42,149
Hello?

461
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:43,312
<i>Bruce?</i>

462
00:55:44,735 --> 00:55:48,629
<i>So, they think they can just
throw you away as they did me.</i>

463
00:55:57,422 --> 00:55:59,746
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?

464
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:01,695
<i>I got a visit today.</i>

465
00:56:01,782 --> 00:56:04,123
A very unwelcome visit.

466
00:56:04,217 --> 00:56:06,783
I'm afraid
my hand is being forced.

467
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:10,045
What did you do to me?

468
00:56:10,715 --> 00:56:13,044
<i>You so much wanna know,
don't you?</i>

469
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:17,306
But I think no explanation
will serve you half as well...

470
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,478
as experience.

471
00:56:20,728 --> 00:56:24,769
In any case, I still don't
quite understand it myself.

472
00:56:24,829 --> 00:56:27,381
If they'd only
let me work in peace...

473
00:56:27,746 --> 00:56:30,746
Of course, my betters
would have none of that.

474
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:33,821
<i>So, you experimented
on yourself, didn't you?</i>

475
00:56:34,092 --> 00:56:37,175
And passed on to me.
What?

476
00:56:37,831 --> 00:56:40,397
<i>An alteration. Genetic.</i>

477
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:44,055
A deformity.
I guess you could call it that.

478
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:47,301
But an amazing strength, too.

479
00:56:47,485 --> 00:56:51,151
And now, finally unleashed,
I can harvest it.

480
00:56:51,918 --> 00:56:52,703
<i>No.</i>

481
00:56:52,703 --> 00:56:54,152
You'll do no such thing.

482
00:56:54,486 --> 00:56:56,674
I will isolate it
and treat it myself.

483
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:59,953
I'll remove it and I'll kill it
before it does any real harm.

484
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:03,185
Oh, I'll bet you and your Betty
would love to destroy it.

485
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:06,661
But would you really
destroy part of yourself?

486
00:57:07,705 --> 00:57:09,963
I don't think so.

487
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:12,003
And as for Betty...

488
00:57:12,402 --> 00:57:14,402
I'm sending her a surprise visit

489
00:57:14,446 --> 00:57:16,905
from some four-legged
friends of mine.

490
00:57:16,905 --> 00:57:21,447
You see, I've managed to culture
some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

491
00:57:21,534 --> 00:57:24,048
and the results are tremendous.

492
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:27,799
They're unstable,
but very powerful.

493
00:57:29,492 --> 00:57:31,395
What about my DNA?

494
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:35,797
<i>Let's just wait and see
what Betty makes of the results, huh?</i>

495
00:57:35,884 --> 00:57:39,718
No. You're crazy.
I won't let you.

496
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:45,624
Get your hands off of me.
Talbot, what's this...

497
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:47,972
Inside, asshole.
I wanna talk to you.

498
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,973
Listen to me,
my father's going after Betty.

499
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,321
What makes you think you can go behind my back
and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

500
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:56,800
Listen to me!
Betty's in trouble!

501
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:01,324
You pathetic freak.

502
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:03,877
Betty's in danger.
I swear to you, she'll be killed.

503
00:58:03,877 --> 00:58:06,040
I can state the obvious.

504
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,131
Something tells me
you aren't in much of a position

505
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:10,460
to be making
stupid threats to anyone.

506
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:16,609
- Talbot.
- Yeah?

507
00:58:17,064 --> 00:58:20,846
- You're making me angry.
- Oh, am I?

508
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,378
I got him! Open fire!

509
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:11,852
Bruce?

510
01:06:39,012 --> 01:06:41,576
He sent these dogs,
didn't he?

511
01:06:42,404 --> 01:06:44,317
But I killed them!

512
01:07:09,713 --> 01:07:11,167
My God.

513
01:07:11,671 --> 01:07:13,933
That must be the nanomeds.
It must be the gamma exposure.

514
01:07:13,933 --> 01:07:17,073
But we've never seen
any effect like this before.

515
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:19,323
No. Deeper.

516
01:07:20,279 --> 01:07:22,634
The gamma just unleashed
what was already there.

517
01:07:22,634 --> 01:07:24,273
Unleashed what?

518
01:07:26,412 --> 01:07:27,144
Me.

519
01:07:28,706 --> 01:07:30,038
It.

520
01:07:32,863 --> 01:07:34,107
It's okay.

521
01:07:34,537 --> 01:07:35,848
Shh. It's okay.

522
01:07:37,615 --> 01:07:38,946
What were those animals?

523
01:07:40,955 --> 01:07:42,610
My father sent them.

524
01:07:43,501 --> 01:07:46,196
He is my father.

525
01:07:46,284 --> 01:07:48,371
He wanted me to change.

526
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:51,668
He wanted me to change
into that mindless... hulk.

527
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:53,981
Why would he want that?

528
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:57,227
Can you remember anything?

529
01:07:57,227 --> 01:08:00,431
Is there anything
from when you were changed?

530
01:08:03,808 --> 01:08:05,408
It was like a dream.

531
01:08:07,338 --> 01:08:08,975
About what?

532
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:13,070
Rage.

533
01:08:14,505 --> 01:08:16,164
Power.

534
01:08:18,115 --> 01:08:20,117
And freedom.

535
01:08:39,301 --> 01:08:42,012
Hello? Sir.

536
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,601
- Hello.
- Dad?

537
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:46,862
Betty! Are you all right?

538
01:08:49,816 --> 01:08:53,424
I'm scared.
I need your help.

539
01:08:53,512 --> 01:08:54,937
Where are you?

540
01:09:05,948 --> 01:09:10,869
- How are you?
- Okay... I guess.

541
01:09:14,645 --> 01:09:16,521
I think that somehow...

542
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:19,776
your anger is triggering
the nanomeds.

543
01:09:21,322 --> 01:09:24,821
How could it?  We designed them
to respond to physical damage.

544
01:09:24,907 --> 01:09:27,558
Emotional damage
can manifest physically.

545
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,246
Like what?

546
01:09:34,736 --> 01:09:36,645
Serious trauma.

547
01:09:38,736 --> 01:09:40,484
Repressed memories...?

548
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:50,514
Your father grilled me about... something
that happened to me from early childhood

549
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,853
that I'm supposed to remember.

550
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:54,494
He did?

551
01:09:54,847 --> 01:10:00,087
It sounded bad,
but... I honestly don't remember.

552
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:04,841
The thing that worries me...

553
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:07,093
is...

554
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:09,886
a physical wound is finite,

555
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:11,661
but with emotions,

556
01:10:11,661 --> 01:10:15,242
what's to say that
it won't just go on and on...

557
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:18,229
and start a chain reaction?

558
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:24,067
You know
what scares me the most?

559
01:10:26,571 --> 01:10:28,033
Is that, when it happens,

560
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,140
when it comes over me...

561
01:10:31,657 --> 01:10:33,537
and I totally lose control...

562
01:10:36,484 --> 01:10:37,915
I like it.

563
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:58,357
It's okay. I got you.
I'm sorry.

564
01:10:59,602 --> 01:11:01,777
You'll be okay.
It's just to make you sleep.

565
01:11:02,227 --> 01:11:04,097
Target down.
Target secure.

566
01:11:05,157 --> 01:11:07,011
I'm gonna take you
someplace safe.

567
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,779
Okay? Bruce?

568
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:12,157
Bruce?

569
01:11:12,881 --> 01:11:14,502
Bruce?

570
01:13:48,688 --> 01:13:50,691
All right. Clear!

571
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,121
- Attention on deck.
- Carry on.

572
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:14,344
We're buried out here
in the middle of nowhere.

573
01:14:14,474 --> 01:14:16,233
How long are you gonna
keep him sedated?

574
01:14:16,233 --> 01:14:18,986
For the rest of his natural life,
if I have to.

575
01:14:18,986 --> 01:14:22,098
- You said I could trust you.
- I'm your father.

576
01:14:22,432 --> 01:14:26,521
You can trust me to do what I think is right,
not what you think you want.

577
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:30,354
- He is a human being.
- Well, he is also something else.

578
01:14:30,694 --> 01:14:34,260
Suppose he gets out,
has one of his little mood swings

579
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:35,695
in a populated area.

580
01:14:35,739 --> 01:14:40,435
Yes, I'm aware of the potential danger.
I'm also aware that he saved my life.

581
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:42,826
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.

582
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:45,222
I'm indebted to 'im for that.

583
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:49,393
He also put three men in a hospital,
and Talbot's barely walkin'!

584
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,596
- I mean, what do you want me to do?
- I want you to help him!

585
01:14:53,586 --> 01:14:57,612
- Why is he such a threat to you?
- Because I know what he comes from.

586
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,970
He is his father's son,
every last molecule of 'im.

587
01:15:02,513 --> 01:15:03,848
He says
he doesn't know his father,

588
01:15:04,471 --> 01:15:09,282
but he's workin' in the same
exact goddamn field his father did.

589
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:14,354
So, either he's lyin'...
or it's somethin' worse, and he's...

590
01:15:14,398 --> 01:15:15,191
What?

591
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:19,573
Predestined to follow
in his father's footsteps?

592
01:15:21,746 --> 01:15:23,908
I was gonna say "damned".

593
01:15:25,449 --> 01:15:28,271
Of course you were.
But I'm a scientist.

594
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:33,400
As a scientist, I believe we can
figure this out and he can be helped.

595
01:15:34,053 --> 01:15:35,629
I know you do.

596
01:15:36,835 --> 01:15:39,762
Whether you know... or care,

597
01:15:41,202 --> 01:15:43,935
I've got a lot o' pride
in what you've done.

598
01:15:44,819 --> 01:15:47,059
But this is too big for you.

599
01:15:47,435 --> 01:15:51,055
Look. I know the government thinks
they have a weapon on their hands.

600
01:15:51,142 --> 01:15:52,645
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.

601
01:15:53,794 --> 01:15:55,674
They can probe and
prod all they want.

602
01:15:55,674 --> 01:15:58,068
In the meanwhile,
just let me try to help him.

603
01:15:58,068 --> 01:16:00,947
Nobody knows 'im
better than I do.

604
01:16:04,839 --> 01:16:07,168
What did David Banner
do to him?

605
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,494
Cover left!
Clear left.

606
01:16:13,537 --> 01:16:14,705
Cover right!

607
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,676
What's happening here?

608
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,898
My hand.

609
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,907
You see, the strength
of my son's DNA,

610
01:18:38,019 --> 01:18:42,107
combined with...
nanomed reconstruction...

611
01:18:44,169 --> 01:18:47,219
You see, I can partake
with the essences of all things.

612
01:18:49,953 --> 01:18:51,142
Gonna have to ask you to...

613
01:18:52,518 --> 01:18:54,556
put your hands up, pal, okay?

614
01:18:55,649 --> 01:18:57,358
Nice an' easy.

615
01:19:03,999 --> 01:19:09,052
Do you really believe
that I am separate from you?

616
01:19:27,915 --> 01:19:29,657
Where am I?

617
01:19:33,873 --> 01:19:35,745
You're home.

618
01:19:48,136 --> 01:19:50,554
It's hard to believe
we used to live here.

619
01:19:53,702 --> 01:19:56,304
I must have seen you...
or known you.

620
01:19:56,746 --> 01:19:58,494
If only I could remember...

621
01:20:33,316 --> 01:20:35,430
This is my old house, isn't it?

622
01:21:15,861 --> 01:21:16,932
Let's go.

623
01:21:18,672 --> 01:21:20,628
Please try.

624
01:22:14,811 --> 01:22:17,786
- What is it?
- Nothing.

625
01:22:19,592 --> 01:22:20,971
Really?

626
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:25,341
Damn it.

627
01:22:30,553 --> 01:22:34,337
Okay, Betty...
what do you wanna know?

628
01:22:37,972 --> 01:22:40,148
What was in that room?

629
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:53,236
What are you afraid
that I'll see?

630
01:22:59,601 --> 01:23:03,288
See? There's nothing.

631
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:05,871
It's empty.

632
01:23:18,604 --> 01:23:20,636
What do you mean
I don't have access to him?

633
01:23:20,636 --> 01:23:27,144
NSA has decided to turn over study
of the, uh, the threat... to Atheon.

634
01:23:28,074 --> 01:23:31,356
But you're head of the base.
I thought you were in charge.

635
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:35,815
But I don't set policy,
and I still take orders.

636
01:23:38,836 --> 01:23:41,786
I can't believe Talbot
would go around me like this!

637
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:47,674
Oh, there's a lot o' powerful people
that want in on this.

638
01:23:48,173 --> 01:23:50,878
And money to be made.
Lots of it!

639
01:23:56,479 --> 01:23:58,692
You know the worst part
about all this?

640
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,350
When I had David Banner locked up
and sent that kid away,

641
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:05,940
I didn't give that boy a second thought.
He was just collateral damage.

642
01:24:07,132 --> 01:24:09,165
Well, he isn't anymore, is 'e?

643
01:24:12,776 --> 01:24:14,613
What can I do?

644
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,178
You can go home now.

645
01:24:20,135 --> 01:24:23,310
I'd tell you to go and... say goodbye,
but I've already been informed

646
01:24:23,396 --> 01:24:27,423
that... for now all further contact
is out of the question.

647
01:24:28,527 --> 01:24:30,038
Right.

648
01:25:08,446 --> 01:25:12,959
Hiya, Bruce. How you feelin'?
Grub okay in here for you?

649
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:16,916
- What do you want?
- That's a good question.

650
01:25:18,256 --> 01:25:21,968
See, I need your cells to trigger
some chemical distress signals.

651
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:25,493
You know, so you can turn
a little green for me again...

652
01:25:26,385 --> 01:25:29,095
and I can carve off
a piece of the real you...

653
01:25:29,885 --> 01:25:33,063
analyze it, patent it,
make a fortune.

654
01:25:34,103 --> 01:25:37,792
- Do you mind?
- I'll never let you.

655
01:25:39,243 --> 01:25:41,367
I'm not sure
you got much of a choice.

656
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:46,072
Come on, Bruce.
Aren't you feelin' a little angry?

657
01:25:46,463 --> 01:25:47,785
After all, you've only
got me to play with

658
01:25:47,785 --> 01:25:50,384
now that Betty's dumped you
and gone back to Berkeley.

659
01:25:51,453 --> 01:25:52,384
You're lying.

660
01:25:52,771 --> 01:25:55,289
You know, for me
this is a win-win situation.

661
01:25:55,289 --> 01:25:57,755
You turn green, and all these guys
come in and kill you

662
01:25:57,755 --> 01:25:59,463
and I perform the autopsy.

663
01:25:59,889 --> 01:26:00,378
You don't...

664
01:26:03,151 --> 01:26:04,510
and I'd mop the floor with you,

665
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:07,227
and maybe by accident
go too far and break your neck.

666
01:26:07,802 --> 01:26:12,391
Bad science, maybe...
but personally gratifying.

667
01:26:14,805 --> 01:26:18,149
Come on, Bruce!
Let's see what you got.

668
01:26:19,654 --> 01:26:20,817
Never.

669
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:28,661
You know, consciously
you may control it,

670
01:26:29,683 --> 01:26:32,667
but, subconsciously,
I bet that's another story.

671
01:27:03,278 --> 01:27:06,068
All right, let's jump-start
those brain waves.

672
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:19,091
<i>Bruce.</i>

673
01:27:33,055 --> 01:27:36,407
My dear Miss Ross.
Welcome back.

674
01:27:37,079 --> 01:27:39,410
There are two guards
right outside.

675
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:44,175
You don't have to worry.
I'm not angry with you. Not anymore.

676
01:27:45,651 --> 01:27:46,985
What do you want?

677
01:27:47,385 --> 01:27:50,429
It's over for me now.
I know that.

678
01:27:50,646 --> 01:27:53,749
And soon it'll be over for Bruce.

679
01:27:54,911 --> 01:27:56,503
That's why I've come to you,

680
01:27:56,503 --> 01:28:00,428
to ask you... if
you could persuade your father,

681
01:28:01,169 --> 01:28:03,734
as a man,
as a father himself,

682
01:28:04,803 --> 01:28:08,534
that if I turn myself in,
now, peacefully,

683
01:28:08,692 --> 01:28:11,345
and before
he puts me away forever,

684
01:28:12,302 --> 01:28:17,265
that he would let me
see my son ... for one last time.

685
01:28:17,868 --> 01:28:19,705
Could you do that for me?

686
01:28:23,591 --> 01:28:25,741
It's out of
my father's hands now.

687
01:28:30,608 --> 01:28:33,914
I understand.
He's a puppet now.

688
01:28:35,218 --> 01:28:37,584
- I don't blame him.
- You shouldn't.

689
01:28:38,141 --> 01:28:40,923
You should blame yourself
for what you've done to your son.

690
01:28:42,437 --> 01:28:44,421
And what have I done
to my son, Miss Ross?

691
01:28:44,757 --> 01:28:50,156
Nothing. I tried to improve
on the limits in myself.

692
01:28:50,655 --> 01:28:52,960
Myself! Not him!

693
01:28:53,508 --> 01:28:56,613
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.

694
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,080
My nature!
Knowledge of oneself!

695
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,978
It's the only path to the truth,

696
01:29:01,978 --> 01:29:06,944
that give men the power
to go beyond God's boundaries!

697
01:29:07,788 --> 01:29:11,619
You know what's beyond
your boundaries? Other people.

698
01:29:12,892 --> 01:29:15,326
All you've given Bruce is fear.

699
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,125
Fear of life.

700
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:24,443
Fear?

701
01:29:25,878 --> 01:29:31,647
Perhaps, Miss Ross.
And loneliness, too.

702
01:29:32,357 --> 01:29:37,721
Yes... I feel them both.

703
01:29:40,707 --> 01:29:46,229
But I have lived... completely once.

704
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:50,123
I was so much in love,

705
01:29:50,778 --> 01:29:53,489
and she so much wanted a baby.

706
01:29:53,666 --> 01:29:55,618
My baby.

707
01:30:03,275 --> 01:30:05,794
I could tell
from the moment she conceived

708
01:30:06,171 --> 01:30:08,777
that it wasn't a son
I had given her,

709
01:30:09,319 --> 01:30:11,398
but something else.

710
01:30:11,669 --> 01:30:13,484
A monster, maybe.

711
01:30:13,931 --> 01:30:16,401
I should have put a stop
to it right then,

712
01:30:16,974 --> 01:30:21,578
but I was curious
and that was my downfall.

713
01:30:21,861 --> 01:30:25,209
And as I watched
this tiny life unfold,

714
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:28,650
I began to imagine
the horror of it,

715
01:30:29,152 --> 01:30:35,368
and my curiosity was replaced...
with compassion.

716
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:40,668
But they took away
my chance to cure him.

717
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:42,470
Your father threw me out.

718
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,339
<i>What are you doing?</i>

719
01:30:44,339 --> 01:30:49,547
I remember that day so well...
Every moment, every sensation,

720
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:51,590
walking into the house,

721
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:55,302
the feeling of the handle
of the knife in my hand.

722
01:30:55,805 --> 01:31:00,435
I knew I was doing a father's work,
fulfilling a father's mercy.

723
01:31:00,435 --> 01:31:03,459
<i>David, please stop it! No!</i>

724
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:06,460
<i>David, no!
Talk to me! Listen!</i>

725
01:31:06,984 --> 01:31:09,077
But then she surprised me.

726
01:31:11,522 --> 01:31:13,286
<i>No! No!</i>

727
01:31:13,987 --> 01:31:15,615
<i>David, no!</i>

728
01:31:16,026 --> 01:31:17,817
It was as if...

729
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:21,659
she... and the knife...

730
01:31:22,245 --> 01:31:24,328
merged.

731
01:31:33,987 --> 01:31:35,030
<i>No!</i>

732
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:41,848
You cannot imagine
the unbearable finality of it.

733
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:45,496
And in that one moment,

734
01:31:45,814 --> 01:31:49,523
I took everything
that was dear to me

735
01:31:50,162 --> 01:31:56,359
and transformed it into
nothing more than a memory.

736
01:32:11,948 --> 01:32:15,212
Bingo! That must be some
jumbo nightmare he just had.

737
01:32:19,949 --> 01:32:22,167
Okay, do it now.
Start the enzyme extraction.

738
01:32:27,638 --> 01:32:29,255
Sir, negative on drill penetration.

739
01:32:29,491 --> 01:32:31,437
Damn it, drill 'im harder!
Give 'im full RPMs!

740
01:32:31,437 --> 01:32:33,324
Come on, Holeman!
Come on!

741
01:32:47,405 --> 01:32:48,206
Should I neutralize?

742
01:32:48,206 --> 01:32:50,688
No, I can't do anything
with goop. Come on!

743
01:33:04,688 --> 01:33:05,969
All right,
put 'im to sleep.

744
01:33:16,742 --> 01:33:17,716
It's not stopping 'im!

745
01:33:25,264 --> 01:33:27,742
Ready room, send in
our containment team.

746
01:33:27,829 --> 01:33:30,569
Non-lethals only.
I repeat, non-lethals only.

747
01:33:30,656 --> 01:33:32,345
I must have a sample of 'im.

748
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:33,882
Sir!

749
01:33:36,526 --> 01:33:40,048
- Jesus!
- Hit 'im with the foam.

750
01:33:40,092 --> 01:33:41,471
Deploy containment foam.

751
01:33:42,343 --> 01:33:43,902
Talbot, talk to me.

752
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,449
Under control, general.
I'll let you know if we need you.

753
01:33:49,449 --> 01:33:52,442
Unacceptable.  Unseat your
asses down here immediately.

754
01:33:52,442 --> 01:33:55,502
I want a full-court evacuation now.
I'm shutting you down.

755
01:33:55,502 --> 01:33:56,816
Lockdown.

756
01:33:57,442 --> 01:34:00,500
- Didn't you hear what the general said?
- I said "lockdown"!

757
01:34:02,965 --> 01:34:05,376
Clear!
I need a sample of 'im!

758
01:34:09,001 --> 01:34:10,494
Take it easy there, buddy.

759
01:34:10,923 --> 01:34:13,889
This might give you
a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

760
01:34:26,839 --> 01:34:29,762
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Clear your weapon! Clear it!

761
01:34:29,762 --> 01:34:33,839
Gimme the M2.
So long, big boy.

762
01:34:33,927 --> 01:34:35,351
Clear!

763
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:49,326
Lockdown the entire
facility immediately.

764
01:34:53,539 --> 01:34:55,924
Target's still moving...
towards blue level.

765
01:34:55,924 --> 01:34:57,628
Evacuate the main hall.

766
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:07,512
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.

767
01:35:07,888 --> 01:35:09,428
Set firing lines left and right!

768
01:35:10,628 --> 01:35:12,108
Heavy weapons, go, go, go!

769
01:35:35,197 --> 01:35:37,371
Contamination, sir.
System readings are redline.

770
01:35:37,415 --> 01:35:39,046
<i>Data's on
backup power supply.</i>

771
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:47,951
Incoming!

772
01:35:55,504 --> 01:35:58,201
- Shut down all power to the main hall.
- Sir?

773
01:35:58,245 --> 01:36:02,075
Show 'im the way out.
We'll fight 'im outside.

774
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:14,527
Driver, stop.
Driver, stop.

775
01:38:21,527 --> 01:38:23,721
Gunner, traverse left!
Traverse left!

776
01:39:06,709 --> 01:39:08,622
Clear back! Clear back!

777
01:40:02,804 --> 01:40:06,917
Mr. President,
I have some bad news, sir.

778
01:40:07,239 --> 01:40:08,521
Well, let's have it, general.

779
01:40:09,153 --> 01:40:12,124
I've briefed the President on Angry Man.
I assume that's what this is about.

780
01:40:12,124 --> 01:40:16,622
It is, ma'am. I'm requesting
a National Command Authority override.

781
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:19,571
Angry Man is unsecure.

782
01:40:20,068 --> 01:40:24,626
I need everything we have at my disposal
in order to stop his movement.

783
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:27,434
You're expecting
civilian casualties, general?

784
01:40:27,997 --> 01:40:29,716
Not if I can help it, ma'am.

785
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:32,335
Consider it done.
Keep us posted.

786
01:41:21,338 --> 01:41:23,252
Contact Goodman Control.

787
01:41:23,338 --> 01:41:25,355
Patch data to the assets.

788
01:41:25,742 --> 01:41:27,598
Contact H.Q.

789
01:41:28,329 --> 01:41:31,113
Have them initiate
an immediate evacuation

790
01:41:32,145 --> 01:41:37,656
in vicinity of grid coordinates
653-216.

791
01:42:11,954 --> 01:42:14,129
Confirm that the area
has been cleared.

792
01:42:14,216 --> 01:42:15,354
Confirm area cleared.

793
01:42:15,354 --> 01:42:19,162
<i>H.Q. confirms area cleared.
Assets on-line, sir.</i>

794
01:42:19,162 --> 01:42:21,201
Gentlemen,
it's time to dig in.

795
01:42:21,571 --> 01:42:25,030
I want this target
stopped in his tracks.

796
01:43:15,807 --> 01:43:17,059
Jesus.

797
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:35,689
Mayday! Mayday!
Ah, shit!

798
01:43:41,577 --> 01:43:45,198
<i>Tango Four is down. Have C-SAR
respond to our 20 ASAP.</i>

799
01:43:45,839 --> 01:43:49,100
<i>We're okay, but, damn it, get 'im
off us before he tears us apart!</i>

800
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:51,887
<i>I've got no shot.
Do you have a clear line of fire?</i>

801
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,247
Watch it, Tango Flight.

802
01:43:54,247 --> 01:43:55,960
<i>Break left! Break left!</i>

803
01:43:58,303 --> 01:44:00,585
<i>Tango Three, pull back and
set up for a Hellfire shot.</i>

804
01:44:00,585 --> 01:44:02,930
<i>Hold your fire
till we draw 'im off.</i>

805
01:44:03,668 --> 01:44:05,380
<i>Tango One is hot.
Gun wazzed.</i>

806
01:44:05,717 --> 01:44:07,462
<i>Roger. Going hot.
Guns ready.</i>

807
01:44:13,721 --> 01:44:14,853
Engage at will.

808
01:44:35,891 --> 01:44:38,147
<i>Tango One, pull back!
Clear my line!</i>

809
01:44:38,891 --> 01:44:41,330
<i>Tango Flight, clear back.
I got him painted for Hellfire.</i>

810
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:42,503
<i>Roger that.</i>

811
01:44:44,443 --> 01:44:46,522
<i>Tango One, clear.
Take the shot.</i>

812
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,909
<i>Tango One, Tango Three.
I have contact.</i>

813
01:45:08,403 --> 01:45:10,128
<i>Holy shit!
He's got my missile!</i>

814
01:45:12,652 --> 01:45:14,079
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

815
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:19,775
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
We're hit! We're going down!</i>

816
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:25,112
Give me a head count.

817
01:45:25,112 --> 01:45:27,262
<i>Tango Three,
give me a sit rep.</i>

818
01:45:28,943 --> 01:45:31,842
<i>Our kite's busted up...
but we're okay.</i>

819
01:45:33,912 --> 01:45:36,291
<i>Tango Flight, do you have
eyes on the target?</i>

820
01:45:37,132 --> 01:45:38,935
<i>Tango One,
I have 'im in the rocks.</i>

821
01:45:38,935 --> 01:45:42,229
<i>Salvo all. Turn it
into a parking lot.</i>

822
01:46:02,948 --> 01:46:04,961
<i>T-Bolt, your parking lot
is ready.</i>

823
01:46:04,961 --> 01:46:08,106
<i>We're bingo for fuel
and ammo. R.T.B.</i>

824
01:46:35,344 --> 01:46:37,099
<i>T-Bolt,
this is Goodman Control.</i>

825
01:46:37,099 --> 01:46:41,137
<i>Be advised, target not destroyed.
He's on the move again.</i>

826
01:46:41,258 --> 01:46:42,638
Damn!

827
01:46:43,258 --> 01:46:44,541
I've got it.

828
01:46:45,597 --> 01:46:47,628
It appears
he's heading home.

829
01:46:48,723 --> 01:46:52,472
Launch fast movers.
Have them intercept and engage.

830
01:46:55,191 --> 01:46:55,912
Hello?

831
01:46:55,956 --> 01:46:59,307
Betty... Bruce got out.
He's headed your way,

832
01:46:59,307 --> 01:47:01,182
probably right for you.

833
01:47:01,479 --> 01:47:03,065
<i>How far from
the base are you?</i>

834
01:47:03,065 --> 01:47:06,574
I'm already here.
They're taking his father in now.

835
01:47:07,088 --> 01:47:10,865
That's all good news.
Stay there, Betty.

836
01:47:24,786 --> 01:47:27,774
<i>Legend One rolling in hot.
Legend Two, breaking off left.</i>

837
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:30,931
<i>I think I can come back around
for a gun attack.</i>

838
01:47:31,918 --> 01:47:34,442
Acquire a clear target.
Fire at will.

839
01:47:39,615 --> 01:47:42,525
<i>Increase altitude.
Civilian aircraft in vicinity.</i>

840
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:50,079
<i>Pull up! Pull up!
You're headed for the bridge!</i>

841
01:47:52,395 --> 01:47:54,801
<i>I can't pull up!
I can't pull up!</i>

842
01:48:03,375 --> 01:48:05,955
Okay, you've got him now. Take 'im
on a ride to the top of the world.

843
01:48:05,955 --> 01:48:08,414
Let's see what the thin air
will do for 'im.

844
01:48:10,245 --> 01:48:11,663
<i>Initiating afterburner.</i>

845
01:48:29,187 --> 01:48:31,231
<i>I'm passing flight level 600.</i>

846
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:33,028
<i>This is out of my envelope.</i>

847
01:48:34,068 --> 01:48:35,032
<i>Hang in there, Legend.</i>

848
01:48:35,418 --> 01:48:38,634
I can't maintain.
He's all over my aerodynamics.

849
01:48:39,189 --> 01:48:41,158
<i>He'll lose consciousness
before you.</i>

850
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:50,108
Nine-fifty. I can't hold it.
I'm pullin' back!

851
01:49:37,429 --> 01:49:39,503
Puny human.

852
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:51,463
<i>Contact. He's in the water.
All units, weapons hot.</i>

853
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:53,316
<i>Let's not take any chances.</i>

854
01:49:53,316 --> 01:49:56,445
You are cleared to fire
on target, Legend.

855
01:50:19,091 --> 01:50:20,681
- Dad?
- Betty?

856
01:50:21,989 --> 01:50:23,118
<i>We don't have a choice.</i>

857
01:50:23,556 --> 01:50:25,054
I have to destroy 'im.

858
01:50:25,409 --> 01:50:27,598
But you can't.
You will only fuel his rage,

859
01:50:27,598 --> 01:50:29,223
and you will make him stronger.

860
01:50:30,971 --> 01:50:33,287
It's you he's coming for.
You know that.

861
01:50:35,425 --> 01:50:37,111
Then let me go to him.

862
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:39,695
Please.

863
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:43,826
<i>Just give him
a chance to calm down.</i>

864
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:06,442
<i>To all aircraft.
Vicinity of San Francisco.</i>

865
01:51:06,443 --> 01:51:08,442
<i>This is DEVO armed guard.</i>

866
01:51:08,691 --> 01:51:12,064
<i>This area has been declared
restricted airspace.</i>

867
01:51:12,064 --> 01:51:16,606
<i>All aircraft are ordered
to clear the airspace immediately.</i>

868
01:51:58,283 --> 01:52:00,090
<i>Echo, One-Niner.
Weapons are hot.</i>

869
01:52:00,178 --> 01:52:02,699
<i>Target acquired.
Waiting your orders to engage.</i>

870
01:52:02,743 --> 01:52:05,033
<i>Repeat, waiting
your orders to engage.</i>

871
01:52:05,569 --> 01:52:08,587
<i>Command code yellow.
Hold for authorization.</i>

872
01:52:18,866 --> 01:52:20,397
All units, hold your fire.

873
01:52:20,485 --> 01:52:23,833
This is T-Bolt to all assets. You have
direct orders to hold your fire.

874
01:52:23,963 --> 01:52:25,756
I repeat, hold your fire.

875
01:52:26,529 --> 01:52:27,950
<i>Echo One-Niner.
Roger that.</i>

876
01:52:42,923 --> 01:52:44,924
Go go, go, go, go, go!

877
01:53:20,451 --> 01:53:22,973
<i>Engine 24 to command.
We are in position now.</i>

878
01:54:30,332 --> 01:54:32,984
You found me.

879
01:54:34,331 --> 01:54:36,602
You weren't
that hard to find.

880
01:54:38,767 --> 01:54:40,415
Yes, I was.

881
01:55:46,256 --> 01:55:47,652
Let's take a walk.

882
01:56:19,914 --> 01:56:23,218
That's the deal, gentlemen.
He stays on this base

883
01:56:23,306 --> 01:56:26,941
until we get the final word from C-3
on how to dispose of 'im.

884
01:56:27,697 --> 01:56:31,259
In the meantime, if he does
anything but sit there in that chair,

885
01:56:32,742 --> 01:56:36,682
we're gonna turn on the juice
and he'll be incinerated immediately.

886
01:56:36,682 --> 01:56:39,697
We've established
a 200-yard perimeter, sir.

887
01:56:39,697 --> 01:56:44,482
If we deploy the electromagnetic array,
there should be no collateral damage.

888
01:56:44,570 --> 01:56:46,245
Here they come!

889
01:56:53,484 --> 01:56:55,166
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.

890
01:56:55,624 --> 01:56:59,847
But one way or another, we're gonna
have to prepare for the worst.

891
01:58:49,285 --> 01:58:51,071
I should have killed you.

892
01:58:52,502 --> 01:58:54,578
And I should have killed you.

893
01:58:56,329 --> 01:58:57,943
I wish you had.

894
01:59:04,195 --> 01:59:05,722
I saw her last night.

895
01:59:07,896 --> 01:59:09,624
Saw her face.

896
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:12,384
Brown hair...

897
01:59:14,288 --> 01:59:15,524
Brown eyes...

898
01:59:16,898 --> 01:59:18,839
She smiled at me.

899
01:59:19,811 --> 01:59:22,637
She reached down
and kissed my cheek.

900
01:59:24,856 --> 01:59:27,850
I can almost remember
a smell.

901
01:59:31,291 --> 01:59:33,439
Almost like desert flowers.

902
01:59:35,813 --> 01:59:37,649
Her favorite perfume.

903
01:59:40,727 --> 01:59:45,115
It's my mother,
and I don't even know her name.

904
01:59:52,816 --> 01:59:56,716
It's all right, son.
You go ahead and cry.

905
02:00:03,775 --> 02:00:05,527
Go ahead and cry.

906
02:00:09,471 --> 02:00:11,486
Cry. Crying will do you good.

907
02:00:11,486 --> 02:00:13,522
Don't touch me!

908
02:00:16,255 --> 02:00:18,147
Maybe once
you were my father,

909
02:00:19,724 --> 02:00:21,865
but you're not now
and you never will be.

910
02:00:21,951 --> 02:00:24,261
Oh, is that so?

911
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:30,935
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't come here to see you.

912
02:00:31,582 --> 02:00:37,417
I came here to see my son.
My real son.

913
02:00:37,954 --> 02:00:40,060
The one inside of you.

914
02:00:40,519 --> 02:00:44,608
You're nothing
but a... superficial shell,

915
02:00:44,694 --> 02:00:46,824
a husk of
flimsy consciousness,

916
02:00:46,912 --> 02:00:50,019
ready to be torn off
at a moment's notice.

917
02:00:50,019 --> 02:00:54,075
You can think what you like.
I don't care. Just go!

918
02:00:59,827 --> 02:01:03,262
No, son. Listen to me.
I found a cure.

919
02:01:03,999 --> 02:01:04,944
For me.

920
02:01:05,785 --> 02:01:11,427
My cells can transform too,
absorb enormous amounts of energy.

921
02:01:11,787 --> 02:01:13,541
But, unlike you, they're unstable.

922
02:01:14,682 --> 02:01:18,292
Son... I need your strength.

923
02:01:19,372 --> 02:01:24,841
I gave you life.
Now you must give it back to me!

924
02:01:25,756 --> 02:01:30,327
Only a million times
more radiant, more powerful!

925
02:01:30,327 --> 02:01:33,950
- Stop it.
- Stop? Stop what?

926
02:01:34,354 --> 02:01:36,569
Stop... what?!

927
02:01:37,181 --> 02:01:41,486
Think about all those men
out there in their uniforms,

928
02:01:41,616 --> 02:01:44,495
barking and swallowing orders,

929
02:01:44,982 --> 02:01:48,530
inflicting their petty rule
over the entire globe!

930
02:01:48,617 --> 02:01:51,835
Think of all the harm
they've done!

931
02:01:51,922 --> 02:01:54,922
To you! To me!

932
02:01:55,010 --> 02:01:56,703
To humanity!

933
02:01:57,358 --> 02:01:59,882
And know this...
that we can make them...

934
02:02:00,401 --> 02:02:03,010
and their flags and their anthems
and their governments

935
02:02:03,054 --> 02:02:07,450
disappear in a flash!
You in me!

936
02:02:08,012 --> 02:02:09,179
I'd rather die.

937
02:02:11,363 --> 02:02:13,574
Oh, that's your answer?

938
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:18,742
Then indeed you shall die...
and be reborn

939
02:02:19,362 --> 02:02:22,622
a hero... of the kind
that walked the earth

940
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:26,439
long before the pale religions
of civilization

941
02:02:26,667 --> 02:02:29,111
infected humanity's soul!

942
02:02:29,652 --> 02:02:32,135
Go!!!

943
02:02:47,281 --> 02:02:48,512
Stop your bawling,

944
02:02:50,132 --> 02:02:52,679
you weak little speck
of human trash.

945
02:02:59,411 --> 02:03:02,368
All right... I'll go!

946
02:03:04,107 --> 02:03:06,760
- You just watch me go!
- Hit it.

947
02:03:33,126 --> 02:03:33,681
Hit it again!

948
02:03:33,681 --> 02:03:37,983
We can't, sir. There's no power.
Some kind of counter-electromagnetic field.

949
02:03:43,069 --> 02:03:45,687
Move in and
assault the target. Move in!

950
02:03:45,687 --> 02:03:48,897
Move, move, move!

951
02:04:37,744 --> 02:04:40,040
Sir, I've located them on radar.
Pear Lake.

952
02:04:40,789 --> 02:04:42,579
Call up the task force.

953
02:04:49,993 --> 02:04:51,600
Yes!

954
02:05:56,786 --> 02:05:59,488
That's right. Keep fighting.

955
02:06:00,373 --> 02:06:04,083
The more you fight,
the more of you I take.

956
02:06:12,391 --> 02:06:16,674
Strange. We're reading a phenomenal drop
in temperatures there.

957
02:06:16,833 --> 02:06:19,091
But simultaneous radiological activity.

958
02:06:19,486 --> 02:06:21,939
They're absorbing
all the ambient energy.

959
02:06:32,612 --> 02:06:35,737
Sleep now, Bruce,
and forget forever.

960
02:06:35,737 --> 02:06:41,185
Struggle no more...
and give me all of your power.

961
02:06:43,011 --> 02:06:45,936
You think
you can live with it? Take it!

962
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:50,792
Take it all!!!

963
02:06:52,491 --> 02:06:55,926
Oh, yes! Yes!

964
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:10,934
Take it back!

965
02:07:13,522 --> 02:07:16,074
It's not stopping!

966
02:07:16,669 --> 02:07:18,692
Take it back!

967
02:07:35,063 --> 02:07:37,926
Gentlemen... release.

968
02:07:45,892 --> 02:07:47,066
<i>Gamma charge away.</i>

969
02:08:10,677 --> 02:08:13,748
- Mwah!
- Sweet dreams.

970
02:09:07,773 --> 02:09:10,262
- Hello?
- Betty, is that you?

971
02:09:10,730 --> 02:09:12,978
- Hi, dad.
- I'm glad I caught you.

972
02:09:13,383 --> 02:09:15,915
- I'm glad you called.
- Thanks.

973
02:09:17,992 --> 02:09:21,456
Look, Betty... you and I...

974
02:09:22,690 --> 02:09:26,132
<i>well, we both know that Bruce
couldn't have survived that blast.</i>

975
02:09:27,167 --> 02:09:29,541
<i>But... well, you know...</i>

976
02:09:31,783 --> 02:09:34,343
- What is it?
- Well, you know.

977
02:09:34,385 --> 02:09:37,417
The usual loonies.
Seein' things.

978
02:09:37,876 --> 02:09:39,858
Only now everything's green.

979
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,940
Right.

980
02:09:43,735 --> 02:09:45,483
Look, uh...

981
02:09:46,823 --> 02:09:49,095
if by some chance
he... did survive...

982
02:09:50,519 --> 02:09:53,931
and he should try to contact you,
try to get in touch,

983
02:09:55,455 --> 02:09:57,148
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

984
02:09:58,998 --> 02:10:02,325
No... I wouldn't.

985
02:10:02,868 --> 02:10:05,991
But... you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.

986
02:10:05,991 --> 02:10:09,639
I mean, my... phones are bugged,
my computer's tapped.

987
02:10:09,639 --> 02:10:11,505
I'm under surveillance.

988
02:10:14,523 --> 02:10:15,937
I'll tell you, though,

989
02:10:17,127 --> 02:10:18,621
that... if he were alive,

990
02:10:18,621 --> 02:10:21,899
I'm... the last person
I would want him to come to

991
02:10:21,899 --> 02:10:30,314
because... as much as I miss 'im,
I... I... loved him. I, uh...

992
02:10:33,395 --> 02:10:34,828
<i>Yeah.</i>

993
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:39,135
I'm sorry, Betty.

994
02:10:41,483 --> 02:10:44,092
I am so sorry.

995
02:10:46,397 --> 02:10:48,615
I know you are.

996
02:11:25,012 --> 02:11:26,926
Si.

997
02:11:38,101 --> 02:11:39,098
Let's take a walk.
