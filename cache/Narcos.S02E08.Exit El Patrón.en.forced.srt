1
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,930
DEATH TO ESCOBAR

2
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,310
Forgive me.

3
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,060
Children and innocent people
died in that bombing.

4
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,820
That was an act of pure terrorism.
It must be answered for.

5
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,490
Surrender, unconditionally, now.

6
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,320
What kind of country is it
when a death squad is not only tolerated

7
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,080
but is actually sanctioned
by the goddamn government?

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you want to see Bogotá
turned into a crater?

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,590
Is that what it will take to protect
my family from those bastards, Los Pepes?

10
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,010
No. Your family's safety
is our utmost concern.

11
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,760
They're simply... in protective custody.

12
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,430
Get my family out of Colombia.

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,520
We can get your family out of Colombia.

14
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,360
But I can't guarantee any country
will accept them.

15
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,450
I don't have that kind of power.

16
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,950
You better find that kind of power,

17
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,700
because I won't even discuss surrender
until my family is out of the country.

18
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,000
Until then, we have nothing to talk about.

19
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,730
Congressional leaders
are calling for immediate action

20
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,240
and President Gaviria has called an
emergency meeting of the national police.

21
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,090
Yesterday's bombing
has resulted in a total of...

22
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,950
Now he's really fucked up.

23
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,660
Pacho... I want you on a plane to Miami.

24
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,250
It's time.

25
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,460
And Escobar's family? Should we get them?

26
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,800
No, not now. They're surrounded by police.

27
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,930
They're not going anywhere.

28
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,810
Son of a bitch.

29
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,450
Stay there. You can go.

30
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,210
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

31
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,220
Agent Jimenez, put out that cigarette
and go downstairs, please.

32
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,050
- And don't smoke in the room again.
- Yes, sir.

33
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Thank you.

34
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Excuse me.

35
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,900
- Who wants dinner?
- Me!

36
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,490
Stop looking out the window.
There's no one out there.

37
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,160
Come eat something.

38
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,410
- Mama?
- Yes, my love?

39
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,540
Who are Los Pepes?

40
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,920
No one. No one you have to worry about.
All right, my love?

41
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,000
And how much longer do we have to be here?

42
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,670
Not much longer, love. Keep eating.

43
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,170
Can I speak with you a moment?

44
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,430
- We have to do something, Hermilda.
- Pablo will fix this, like always.

45
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,680
We can't even call him.

46
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,600
Even if we could,
all the telephones are tapped anyway.

47
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,690
We're alone, Hermilda.

48
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,700
And you're telling me
everything will be okay?

49
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,370
Excuse me, Colonel...

50
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,710
CARLOS HOLGUIN POLICE BASE

51
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,310
Blackie. What's going on?

52
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,640
- Do you think you can get inside?
- No, boss. I don't think so.

53
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,390
With all the police swarming around,
it's impossible.

54
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,610
Can you see the top floor?
Through the windows?

55
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,150
No, I can't. It's too difficult.

56
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,450
Keep your eyes on it, Blackie.
You might see something.

57
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,570
Sure, boss.

58
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,330
All right, as soon as you see anything,
call me.

59
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,830
Blackie...

60
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,750
it's important that I know they're okay.

61
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,670
Hey, boss.

62
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,170
Can you believe it?

63
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,590
Just this second,
Tata came into view, boss.

64
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,590
What do you see? Is she alone?

65
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,180
She looks beautiful. She's at the window.

66
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,350
She's got that dress on that you had me
bring from Miami, remember, boss?

67
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,810
The one you like so much.

68
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,110
The children, Blackie. Can you see them?

69
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,690
There, I can see Manuela, boss.

70
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,990
- Can she see you?
- She looks so pretty, boss.

71
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,700
Go.

72
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,200
Blackie...

73
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,370
thanks for this.

74
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,710
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR; IN DEFENSE
OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, LOS PEPES

75
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,340
- Héctor.
- Sir.

76
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,350
Do me a favor and bring Miss Judy a beer.

77
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,100
- Of course, boss.
- Thanks.

78
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,770
This isn't about Pablo.
Pablo is a dead man.

79
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,440
It's just a matter of time.
We're here to talk about the future.

80
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,360
And if you're interested in the future,
then you'll have to join us.

81
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,200
Listen, Judy,
you know we never had problems with Pablo.

82
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,120
Plus, we had a very good relationship
with Kiko. Right, Berna?

83
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
- Yes.
- And that's why we made the decision

84
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,080
to stay out of this shit.

85
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,790
And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

86
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,960
Because things are very difficult.

87
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,220
And when all this shit is over,
the organization will change,

88
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,050
the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

89
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,060
And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

90
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,400
That's why I'm talking to you.

91
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,820
If all of us from Medellín are united,

92
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,940
we'll be able to say
what happens to each one of us.

93
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,410
Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

94
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,830
and you tell them you're on our side.

95
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,130
She wants them to join Los Pepes.

96
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,100
They say Pablo Escobar is fucked,
that his time has come.

97
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,520
And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

98
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,850
- What did they say?
- They're joining.

99
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,360
Here's the information.

100
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,610
They have a meeting
with the Castaños on Friday.

101
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,530
This is big, boss.

102
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,790
If the Gallóns are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too.

103
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,040
When is it?

104
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,960
Friday at 9:00 p.m., boss.

105
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,670
Take that address...

106
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,510
and go to Montecasino.

107
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,720
Take Limón with you.

108
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,010
And find out what's going on over there.

109
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,310
Quica.

110
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,140
Are you all right?

111
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,900
Yes, boss.

112
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,240
How many men can we rely on?

113
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,410
I think I can round up a hundred.
But we need cash.

114
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,920
How much money do we have on hand?

115
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,760
If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

116
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,590
It's... around this much.

117
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,430
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

118
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,430
But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

119
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:20,940
Make sure we have the weapons and the men
we need when the time comes. Got it?

120
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,700
The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

121
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,580
Then we can take care of business.

122
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,620
Go on.

123
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,120
Yes, sir.

124
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,880
Pass that to me.

125
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,640
Nothing relevant has happened today.

126
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,810
Corrupt politicians, celebrity divorces.
Bullshit.

127
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,150
You don't like it, go work at CNN.

128
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,150
- Miss Velez.
- Yes, honey?

129
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,160
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but you have a call--

130
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,490
Take a message, I'm about to go on air.

131
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,040
Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.
She says it's urgent.

132
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,760
What are you doing? Answer the call.

133
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,890
You have to get her
to give you an interview.

134
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,730
Hello?

135
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,940
Hello?

136
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,620
I know that you and I have had
a lot of problems in the past.

137
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,200
But I need you to help me.

138
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,650
I brought all the influence
the party can bear on Gaviria.

139
00:17:53,490 --> 00:18:00,490
And it seems he has agreed
to find asylum for your family.

140
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,160
Where?

141
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,500
No, that remains to be seen.

142
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,670
But we will meet in his office,

143
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,090
I suppose to discuss the terms
of their relocation.

144
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,510
Thank you, sir.

145
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,430
- You're a man of your word.
- I am.

146
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,020
Now you must be of your word.

147
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,770
I will. Be sure of that.

148
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,520
The moment my family is safe,
we will speak again.

149
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,940
- Until then.
- Thank you.

150
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,860
She's here.

151
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,370
Bring her here.

152
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,560
Hello, Valeria.

153
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,730
I liked it more with the hood on.

154
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,900
I told them, don't take me anywhere
that doesn't have a beautiful pool.

155
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,240
It's very dangerous
to be my friend these days.

156
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,210
Come on.

157
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,770
Look. These are the codes for the radio.
I'll put them here.

158
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,400
And here is some cash.

159
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,440
This is for you.

160
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,110
- No, Pablo. I don't want your money.
- It's for your help.

161
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm doing this for you.

162
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,720
Thank you.

163
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm worried about you, Pablo.

164
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,750
You guys can't do shit to me.

165
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,920
De Greiff offered us amnesty.

166
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,470
That's right.

167
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,840
But you have to talk to get it.

168
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,680
You want to negotiate, gringo?

169
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,180
You want to negotiate? Let's negotiate.

170
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,350
I'll give you something. Something small.

171
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,810
Blackie...

172
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,530
Blackie, Blackie, Blackie.

173
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,830
What name did your mother give you?

174
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,540
Nelson Hernández... Lucumí.

175
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,880
Lucumí?

176
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,670
From the Pacific.

177
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,350
Lucumí, they found explosive residue
on your hands.

178
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,470
On your jacket, everywhere.

179
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,700
They're going to blame you
for that bomb, Lucumí.

180
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,580
Hey...

181
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,840
- I had nothing to do with it.
- We know that.

182
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,720
We know it wasn't your idea.
We know you're not the boss.

183
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,520
Don't let them blame you for this.

184
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,610
Don't let them see you as the one
who killed all those innocent children.

185
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,280
Help us and we'll help you.

186
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,450
Give us Pablo.

187
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,580
No fucking way. I can't give you Pablo.

188
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,590
No fucking way I give you the boss.

189
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,250
Then give us something.

190
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,720
You have to give us something
or they'll hang you.

191
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,810
I'll give you...

192
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,480
La Quica.

193
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,570
Faggots.

194
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,680
There's a lot of them.

195
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,600
Do you think we can take all of them?

196
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,350
What's wrong, brother?

197
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,940
You're turning into a pussy.

198
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,780
If you're scared, why don't you run away?

199
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,530
Abandon the boss.
It's that easy, brother.

200
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,030
No, brother.

201
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,330
I'm loyal to the boss.

202
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,540
And if I have to die, I'll die, brother.

203
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,960
You better, motherfucker.

204
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,760
- Trujillo.
- Yes, Colonel.

205
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,760
Prepare the emergency team.

206
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,260
They need to be ready
when we get the signal.

207
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,560
- Yes, Colonel.
- Martinez, get your people ready.

208
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,770
We'll start tracking them
first thing tomorrow.

209
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,440
At your service, Colonel.

210
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,960
Good work on Blackie.

211
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,130
I need to know you didn't make the call.

212
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,800
The only thing I want
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.

213
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,640
It's the only thing I want, Peña.

214
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,140
- For all the lives he has taken.
- I know.

215
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,940
But not with them.

216
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,650
I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

217
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,400
When Escobar dies, a Colombian cop
should be standing over him.

218
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,250
- Good evening, Ms. Velez.
- Good evening.

219
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,920
Welcome, they're expecting you.

220
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,510
What is she doing here?

221
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,350
I sent for her.

222
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,350
Please, take the children to their room.

223
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,520
Please.

224
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,480
Let's go.

225
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,370
This is from Pablo.

226
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,630
It's a radio telephone,
so you can speak with him.

227
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,210
This is a cipher sheet
for the frequencies he'll be on all day.

228
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,050
You must keep it hidden.

229
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,020
He also sent you money.

230
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,070
Thank you.

231
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,750
Well, let's do the interview already.

232
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,920
You know what? Another time.

233
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,760
When all of this is over.

234
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,940
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.
I can't leave so quickly.

235
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,030
Then stay.

236
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,070
You can show yourself out
when you're ready.

237
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,920
Pablo?

238
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,470
Tata.

239
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,720
Pablo, is it you?

240
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,810
So good to hear your voice, my love.

241
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,140
How are you, Tata?

242
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,150
How are our children?

243
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,570
My love, we're all okay.

244
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,570
We need you.

245
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,150
And I need you.

246
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,570
Listen, I'm going to get
you out of there soon.

247
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,990
I talked to the attorney general.
Everything is ready.

248
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,830
Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.

249
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,170
I love you very much.

250
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,590
I love you, my darling. I love you...

251
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:42,030
Mr. President, I ask you
not to take this as a failure.

252
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,370
Escobar will be brought to justice.

253
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,620
And once his family is out of Colombia,

254
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,040
he will reinitiate negotiations
for his surrender.

255
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,170
- I already did that.
- Yes.

256
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,130
Well, I've got a list here

257
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:07,390
of possible locations that would be safe
for the Escobar family.

258
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:13,350
If you ask officially,
those countries will allow them to enter.

259
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Attorney General De Greiff...

260
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,360
it seems you've been misinformed.

261
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,660
Escobar's family isn't going anywhere.

262
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,370
Pardon me?

263
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,830
I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.

264
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,090
I am categorically opposed
to you or anyone else doing so.

265
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,420
Do you know what that means?

266
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
There will be no surrender.

267
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,180
The violence will not end.

268
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,600
And you will be the one responsible.

269
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,190
You... will be the one responsible.

270
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,770
Your promises and negotiations
have only brought us more violence,

271
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,440
while making him stronger.

272
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,200
This, Mr. De Greiff, doesn't end
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.

273
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,450
This...

274
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
This ends with his death.

275
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,210
No, you don't need to worry
about anything.

276
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,220
Put yourself at ease. We got it.

277
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,220
Miami is ours.
I'll be back in Colombia tonight.

278
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,480
How's it going?

279
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,650
What's up, little Lion?

280
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,990
Doing good. Just hanging out.

281
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,910
Is everything packed or what?

282
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,330
I don't get why you're staying
in this dump, brother.

283
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,500
I would have thought that Pacho Herrera

284
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,500
would be staying in a five star hotel
with all the bells and whistles--

285
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,280
- Do you want juice, my love?
- Yes.

286
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,860
I'll take more.

287
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,150
PABLO'S WHORE

288
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,820
So my business is done? Is that right?

289
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,080
I can't get anyone on the phone, sir.

290
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,500
I called many times. Many times.

291
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,340
I called everyone in Miami.
There's no trace of the Lion.

292
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,260
Pablo!

293
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,110
Tata?

294
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,780
Pablo, they killed her.
They dumped her in front of the hotel.

295
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,280
Who?

296
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,450
Valeria.

297
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,090
Are you all okay?

298
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,960
Yes, we're okay.

299
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Listen.

300
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,550
I need you to be strong.

301
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,470
Everything will end soon. But you need
to be stronger than ever, Tata.

302
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,810
I'll call you back soon.

303
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,560
I love you very much.

304
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,490
Tonight...

305
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,750
we're going to fight
like we've never fought before.

306
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,000
We'll fight with everything we have.

307
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,590
Fuck the Cali cartel!

308
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,340
Fuck Judy Moncada!

309
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,840
Fuck Los Castaños!

310
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,510
We're going to show these motherfuckers
who they are messing with,

311
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,600
because we're still the Medellín cartel

312
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,190
and tonight we're going to Montecasino!

313
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,940
Bring all the men we can buy.

314
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,780
Go to Medellín,
to every money stash we have

315
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,280
and bring me every penny you can find.

316
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,620
Limón and Quica
will take me to Montecasino,

317
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,540
because tonight we'll be fighting
side by side to the death.

318
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,880
And when those motherfuckers
open their doors to the Gallóns,

319
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,130
we'll go in and hit them
with everything we have!

320
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,550
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.

321
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,350
Boss...

322
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,350
I think I should go with Rojas.

323
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,060
It's too dangerous.

324
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,320
Okay.

325
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Take Ricardo with you.

326
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,490
As you wish, boss.

327
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,410
Let's go, brother.

328
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,540
- Let's go!
- Quickly!

329
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,850
Let's go!

330
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,200
There. After that corner. Right there.

331
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,120
What are the odds that we survive tonight?

332
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,630
Fifty-fifty.
But that's pretty good for us.

333
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,260
Let's do this quickly.

334
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,640
I think we're ready.

335
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,110
We've cast as wide a net as possible.

336
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,780
Go ahead.

337
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,470
Hello?

338
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,770
I can't hear you. Hello?

339
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Damn it.

340
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,440
Let's go.

341
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,200
Let's go to 10th and 32nd street.

342
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,840
Answer it.

343
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,890
Fucking answer it. Could be the boss.

344
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,140
Hello?

345
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,180
Quica.

346
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,810
Hello.

347
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,480
Shit. Who the fuck is this?

348
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,320
- Hello, Quica. How's it going, my friend?
- Motherfucker. Who is this?

349
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,410
Calm down, Quica. Don't be nervous.
What's up, Quica?

350
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,530
Who the fuck do you think you are, bitch?

351
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,420
- Velén, let's go!
- Let's go, they're in Laureles!

352
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:15,100
Hey, Rojas, wait for me.
You're leaving me behind.

353
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,950
Hello?

354
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,620
Quica. What's up, Quica?

355
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,210
Quica, Quica, Quica.
What time is it, Quica?

356
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,630
- What are you up to, Quica?
- Bastard.

357
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,140
You're the accountant.
How much is there?

358
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,220
I don't know. Maybe $500,000.

359
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,980
Looks like you're almost out of money.
Leave some for the market, fat ass.

360
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
So funny.

361
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,990
Why aren't you watching the car--

362
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,080
Sorry, but this toss of the coin
doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

363
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,500
Let's make a deal.

364
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,700
Go right.

365
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,560
Copy that! We're on it!

366
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,400
Perez, close all of 4th street.
Go straight.

367
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,820
We'll go this way to cut him off.

368
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,910
Come on, pussy.

369
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,340
There! Follow him!

370
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,760
Follow him!

371
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,260
To the right!

372
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,510
All units, be ready for the play.

373
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,890
Fucker.

374
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,020
Limón.

375
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,610
Relax.

376
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,530
Okay, boss.

377
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,320
- Are we ready?
- They're all waiting for us, boss.

378
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,530
I think we have enough.

379
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,330
La Quica isn't answering, boss.

380
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,210
Okay.

381
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,050
Go start the car.
I'll be there in a second.

382
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,680
Yes, sir.

383
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,060
Where's the staging area?

384
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,650
You want me to hand you information,
just like that?

385
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,110
Free?

386
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,650
No, brother.

387
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,990
I want a deal.

388
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:48,490
Then give us Pablo... asshole.

389
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,330
I want something different.

390
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,290
I want to start a new life,
in the United States of America.

391
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:14,980
We don't have time for bullshit.
Blackie already rolled on all of you.

392
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,940
If you don't give us something fast,
of substance,

393
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,870
we'll buy you that ticket
to the United States... but extradited.

394
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,290
- Extradition doesn't exist.
- Fine, then a jail cell here.

395
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:36,540
With a sign that says "snitch"
around your neck.

396
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,210
Quica.

397
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,670
Hello. Where are you, boss?

398
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,090
I'm en route, and you?

399
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,050
Me too. I'm not too far off.

400
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:34,930
I'm almost there, boss.
Are you still far off?

401
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,270
Pass the phone to Ricardo.

402
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:48,110
Boss, Ricardo went to get one last stash.

403
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,780
He's on his way.

404
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,540
You want me to meet you?
Are you with Limón?

405
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,210
Yes, we're almost there.

406
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:20,140
You have what you wanted.
He'll be there soon. Limón is driving.

407
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,570
Now give us the staging point.

408
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,820
Pull over.

409
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,450
Give me a moment.

410
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,250
Sure, boss.

411
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,630
Tata.

412
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,930
Yes, my love?

413
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:57,770
I just want you to know...
that I love you very much.

414
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,690
You and our children.

415
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,030
You may not hear from me for a while.

416
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,530
What's happening, Pablo?

417
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,030
What are you going to do?

418
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,200
Something I have to do.

419
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,340
But you know that I will never,
never leave you, right?

420
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,670
I know.

421
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,720
I love you, Tata.

422
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,690
I will always love you, Pablo.

423
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:08,500
Keep going down that road.
I'll show you the way.

424
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,590
Yes, boss.

425
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,060
Fuck.

426
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,900
I've got something.

427
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,650
Attention all units.
A vehicle is approaching. Be alert.

428
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,920
Hey, girls.

429
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,010
Negative. They're whores.

430
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,350
All right. Let the women through.

431
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,020
Stand by, everyone.
This isn't happening tonight.

432
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,030
Fire! Let's go! Fire!

433
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,560
What will happen with Quica, boss?

434
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,860
Quica is gone, Limón.

435
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,030
They're all gone.
