I will.

481
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,978
Fuck me.

482

[MACHINE] <i>Please leave your name
and number and a message after the beep.</i>

483
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,487
Hey. Hey, Annie, it's me again.

484
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:07,492
I was just wondering,
have you ever seen the music video

485
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,328
for that Billy Joel song
"You're Only Human"?

486
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,623
There's this kid,
and he's climbing up a bridge,

487
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:15,500
and he's gonna kill himself.

488
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:18,587
But then Billy Joel steps out
with his harmonica and tells him to stop.

489
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,547
"You just have to wait
for your second wind."

490
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,884
And now I feel like I'm that kid...

491
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,637
and I'm gonna drown and...

492
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,646
And thank God
I found my second wind, because it's you.

493
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,399
You're my second wind.

494
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,612
Um...

495
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,199
Look, I know it's exciting
taking down Vought

496
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:50,410
and being like James Bond and everything,

497
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,790
but you gotta be careful because
that stuff can go to shit really quick...

498
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,337
and you wind up
hurting the people that you love.

499
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,799
Like the way that I hurt you.

500
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:05,675
Um...

501
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:11,181
Anyhoo, that's all I wanted to say.

502
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:14,351
Second wind.

503
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,519
Fuck.

504
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,730
Okay, thanks. Bye.

505
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:45,048
I know I don't come up to 99 enough,

506
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,509
and I apologise for that.

507
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,598
But times like this tend
to give us clarity, don't they?

508
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,146
You and me are partners, after all.

509
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,399
A symbiotic part of a larger thing,

510
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:06,319
a living thing named Vought.

511
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:11,074
And that's how we'll get through this.
Together as Vought.

512

[A-TRAIN] But, sir...

513
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,997
I gotta say...

514
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,754
we didn't know about this Compound V shit.

515

None of us.

517
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:31,469
Well, we're all victims here, A-Train,
but we'll get to the bottom of it.

Sure, whatever.

It must be our priority,
and it changes the conversation.

524
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:50,280
So you want us to go out there? Now?

525
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:55,452
I mean, we still need to be prepped
by Legal and PR.

526

- We'll be eaten alive.
- There's no time for that.

527

Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think
we have to damage-control your fuckup.

who made us or how we got here.

535

The point is...

536
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,110
we are here.

537
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:31,237

This guy? He doesn't care about us.

542
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,507
We're not his partners. We're his product.

543
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:54,010
So who gives a shit
if Vought burns to the fucking ground?

544
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,010
You should think

545
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,765
- before you say something you don't mean.
- Really? Should I?

We are not Vought.

547
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,980
You see, companies,
they come and go, but talent...

548
