1
00:00:01,029 --> 00:00:02,653
Time travel is real,

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:04,957
and all of history is
vulnerable to attack,

3
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:07,036
which is why we must
travel through time

4
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:10,061
to stop the spread of these
so-called time Aberrations

5
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:12,397
and to erase their damage to history.

6
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:15,133
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

7
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:17,184
so please don't call us heroes.

8
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:19,700
We're Legends.

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,675
Previously on “Legends of tomorrow”...

10
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:26,044
- Thank you, Mister...
- Hex.

11
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:27,512
Jonah Hex.

12
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:29,380
Temporal Aberrations cause these things

13
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:30,949
called timequakes.

14
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:33,351
If there was a way of
locating their epicenters,

15
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:35,920
maybe we'll be able to
fix the Aberrations

16
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:37,155
before they happen.

17
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:05,950
Whoa, there, wanderer.

18
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,355
Don't see many folks around here.

19
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:11,889
Been a while since this old mine

20
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,958
turned up anything worth taking.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,827
Then I guess I'll be on my way.

22
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:18,096
And let you be on yours.

23
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:20,298
Oh, ain't you heard?

24
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:24,869
I'm the one that does the lettin'
around here.

25
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:30,508
- Or do you need a reminder?
- Wait.

26
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,077
I know things about these mines.

27
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,779
Things I can't tell you if I'm shot.

28
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:37,181
Oh, you'll tell me.

29
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:39,584
Or I'll shoot you, otherwise.

30
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:41,819
Now lower that iron and start talking.

31
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:46,491
The ore in there?

32
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:48,259
It's rare.

33
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:49,827
And powerful.

34
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,763
More powerful than gold.

35
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:54,032
And how would you be
the one to know that?

36
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:56,034
I can show you.

37
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:57,068
With your permission.

38
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:05,977
Found it using this.

39
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:07,979
There's enough in that
mine for the both of us.

40
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:09,747
We're the only ones who know.

41
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:11,315
We can be like partners.

42
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:14,185
Give it here.

43
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:29,967
Nice doing business with you, partner.

44
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:34,988

45
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:38,342
What's with bad guys and ancient amulets?

46
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:39,944
Any idea why Darhk wants this?

47
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:41,512
All I know is, it's never a good idea

48
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:43,581
when your nemesis starts accessorizing.

49
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,316
And he's teamed up with a Speedster.

50
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:47,351
- What's a Speedster?
- Someone with super speed.

51
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:48,853
That's how Darhk escaped.

52
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:51,255
The energy of the Speed
Force grants the Speedster

53
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,391
Chronokinesis, temporal manipulation.

54
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,659
English, Professor.

55
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:56,728
It means that his running real fast,

56
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,029
lets him time travel.

57
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,597
I'll be in my room.

58
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,933
Martin, I need you to
gather everything you can

59
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:03,501
on Speedsters.

60
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:05,970
And Nate's right...
This amulet looks a lot like

61
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:07,672
the one we recovered off the Nazis.

62
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,340
There's got to be a connection.

63
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:12,025
Let me guess, I'm on library duty.

64
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,611
We're dealing with a Speedster here.

65
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:16,848
How long we gonna keep this
secret from them, Grey?

66
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,850
Come on, future Barry's message.

67
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:21,419
Yes, I know what you're
talking about, Jefferson.

68
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:23,020
And we have been through this.

69
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:26,124
Barry implored us not to share any info...

70
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:30,261
You okay?

71
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:33,030
I'm fine, it's just... Just a headache.

72
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:34,899
You would tell me if something
was up, right?

73
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,068
'Cause if we start keeping
things from each other...

74
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,036
I just need to rest.

75
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:43,074
Saving history can be
extremely wearing on the body.

76
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:49,080
I'm thinking this amulet dates back

77
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:52,283
to Late Antiquity and is
Judeo-Christian in origin.

78
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:53,618
Great.

79
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,219
Is... is that great?

80
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:57,722
Well, I can't find a
reference of it anywhere.

81
00:03:57,724 --> 00:03:59,223
Like, none.

82
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:02,093
Historically speaking,
this doesn't exist.

83
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,428
Well, this is right in front of us,

84
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,130
so I'd say it does exist.

85
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:08,065
And we know that Damien
Darhk and the Speedster

86
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,467
are willing to kill for it.

87
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:11,736
Sounds like you got
some more homework to do.

88
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:13,671
What?

89
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:15,439
I-I just thought, becoming a superhero,

90
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:17,992
I would spend less time in
the library than my old job.

91
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:18,908
That's all.

92
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,579
Well, research skills are
a kind of superpower.

93
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:22,947
And you can turn to steel.

94
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,616
So you got two.

95
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:28,252
Saved by the Aberration.

96
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:30,521
Oh, what's the Trouble Alert say?

97
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,924
Look, I told you, don't call it that.

98
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:35,154
The timequake's epicenter is

99
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:37,395
Liberty, Colorado, 1874.

100
00:04:37,397 --> 00:04:39,197
Hah! Back to the Wild West.

101
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,765
You guys were in the Old West?

102
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,701
- Yeah, town made me a Sheriff.
- That's cool.

103
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:46,204
All right, well, I will go
tell Jax and Stein.

104
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:47,438
Who wants to tell Rory?

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,739
- Not it.
- Not it.

106
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:50,174
What?

107
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:56,347
Okay. I'll do it.

108
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:58,983
I don't know how to use 'em,
but I'm wearing spurs.

109
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:02,019
I remember my first
time in the Wild West.

110
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,921
I drove a real-life
desperado out of town.

111
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:06,657
- That's cool.
- And that was my hat.

112
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:08,125
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:13,231
Hmm.

114
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,400
- That's cool.
- What's this?

115
00:05:16,402 --> 00:05:18,102
Oh, uh, that's nothing.

116
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:19,837
Don't open that...
You don't have to open...

117
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,505
You opened it.

118
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:23,374
Did you draw your own superhero costume?

119
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:25,142
No.

120
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:26,878
Absolutely not. Yeah, I did.

121
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,613
And I only did, because when I steel up,

122
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:30,615
my clothes stretch out
and they fit all weird.

123
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:32,617
And besides, don't I deserve a suit?

124
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:35,186
I mean, am I just the research guy here?

125
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:37,555
Look, I-I know what it's
like to be a rookie.

126
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:40,024
Just, uh, follow my lead,
and you'll be fine out there.

127
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:41,792
Oh, I know a few things
about the Old West.

128
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:44,128
Like, for instance, nobody says, "howdy."

129
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,563
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh...

130
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:46,864
you know how to ride a horse, right?

131
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,332
Yeah, I can figure it out.

132
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:50,167
- This loaded?
- Yes.

133
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,371
It is? Oh.

134
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:12,023
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

135
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:14,191
Guys, I think my, uh, horse is broken!

136
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:18,729
Where's the Professor?

137
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:20,898
Uh, he's feeling a little off.

138
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,166
More whiskey for me.

139
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:24,302
- Yee-haw!
- Whoo-whoo-whoo!

140
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:26,003
Sounds like a commotion of some kind.

141
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:27,538
Hold back, let's get a better look.

142
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,106
Yee-ha!

143
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,545
Yeah-hoo!

144
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:36,280
Look at him up there, boy!

145
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:38,182
Ah, it's a hanging.

146
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:42,920
Is that Hex?

147
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:43,921
You know that man?

148
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:46,590
We got to help him.

149
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:48,192
Well, we got to take his crew out first.

150
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:50,094
- They look armed.
- Don't worry, guys.

151
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:53,130
- I got this!
- What?

152
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, well, well, you
look a lot less mean

153
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:58,336
with that noose around your
neck, don't you, Hex?

154
00:06:58,338 --> 00:06:59,837
You think this is finished?

155
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,472
Lookin' pretty finished to me.

156
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:02,773
Don't you think, boys?

157
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,077
Ah!

158
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:09,914
You son of a bitch!

159
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,149
You might want to slow down there.

160
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:16,153
Because these here parts
ain't big enough for the...

161
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:17,555
five of us.

162
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:19,857
- And who the hell are you?
- What he said.

163
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:22,609
On second thought, I don't give a damn!

164
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:42,947
Hold still, Hex.

165
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:56,727
Nice shot.

166
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:07,671
Now you get on that horse
and you ride till you feel like

167
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:10,260
you can't ride any further, then...

168
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:11,509
you ride some more.

169
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,511
Now go on, get! Go on!

170
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:14,512
Whoo!

171
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:16,247
Hyah! Whoo!

172
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,348
Hyah!

173
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,783
Woo-ah!

174
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:19,984
Face.

175
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:22,019
What?

176
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:24,188
Nothing.

177
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:28,559
Oh, hell.

178
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:31,996
They're back.

179
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,467
Saved by a filly. Ain'Aithat
the damnedest?

180
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,102
A simple “thank you” would suffice.

181
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:39,737
How'd you know I needed saving?

182
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:42,706
Because we got an alert that
history was being changed,

183
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,765
and the coordinates led
us to your hanging.

184
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,044
Well, I guess it's nice to
know that I matter.

185
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:49,880
Leaving already?
I didn't get to shoot anyone.

186
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:51,382
I need a drink.

187
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:54,819
Where's Rip?

188
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:59,390
He's MIA.

189
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:00,915
Damn.

190
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,726
How the hell did you
miscreants manage to not

191
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,395
get yourselves killed without him?

192
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:08,299
Miss Lance has been serving as Captain.

193
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:10,868
But she's a lady.

194
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,136
You are a lady, right?

195
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:13,671
You know I could take your life

196
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:15,506
just as easily as I saved it.

197
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:17,741
Oh, fiery.

198
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:20,411
Whoever breaks her's in for a wild ride.

199
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:22,813
Too bad this filly's into other fillies.

200
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:26,584
You don't say.

201
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:28,452
So how did you end up in the noose?

202
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,054
Well, I was collecting the bounty

203
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:32,623
on a pissant by the name
of Quentin Turnbull.

204
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,226
- As in “Turnbull Country”?
- Never heard of it.

205
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:37,161
That's because it's
not supposed to exist.

206
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,930
This book has changed since
the last time I saw it.

207
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:42,600
- Check this out... Gideon.
- Right away.

208
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:46,103
That's a map of the
United States from 1876.

209
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:47,471
All right, who is Turnbull?

210
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:49,673
Two-bit, yellow-bellied cattle rustler.

211
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:52,476
Who controls all of the land
west of the Rocky Mountains.

212
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:53,911
Looks like we found our Aberration.

213
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:55,579
Am I supposed to have the faintest idea

214
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:56,981
what the hell this means?

215
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:58,849
It's means that we need to stop Turnbull

216
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:00,618
from taking over the West.

217
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,820
Looks like you got yourself
a posse, partner.

218
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:11,324
Where is everybody?

219
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,940
Ever since Turnbull set up shop
'bout six months ago,

220
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:16,899
everyone's been run out of town
or made to work in the mine.

221
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:18,701
Mine? What kind of mine?

222
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:20,769
- Gold?
- Hell if I know.

223
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:22,571
Nobody's been mining for
gold through these parts

224
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:24,206
for half a century.

225
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,375
Listen to me, "these parts"...
I sound like I'm a cowboy.

226
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,014
Well, he's pulling something
out of the ground

227
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:30,446
that's making him rich...
Turnbull also owns the saloon.

228
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,582
The hotel, the laundry...
and the whorehouse.

229
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:35,584
The answer's no, Mick.

230
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:38,220
Turnbull's got an office
above the saloon.

231
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,822
It's also got about a dozen men

232
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:41,490
making sure nobody gets close to him.

233
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,158
I think I know how we can.

234
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,594
Mick.

235
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:46,428
Why don't you mosey on in there?

236
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,964
- Have yourself a good time.
- If you insist.

237
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,799
I'm not sure I understand your plan.

238
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,468
You just set a match to a powder keg.

239
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,603
And if Turnbull doesn't
want his saloon to burn down,

240
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:57,039
then he's gonna have to come out
of his office and deal with it.

241
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,174
Better yet, get your boy to
get in a fight with Turnbull

242
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:00,643
and bring him out here on the street.

243
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:02,912
Amaya, your job is to make sure Rory

244
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:05,381
keeps his pistol in his pants
until he's outside the saloon.

245
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:08,384
Clearly, I drew the short straw.

246
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:10,352
So what you want us to do?

247
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,488
Reckon I can post up
nearby with a long gun.

248
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,258
- Are you chewing tobacco?
- Mm, Tootsie Roll.

249
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,193
Get rid of your hats and your guns.

250
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:19,762
What? I thought we were supposed to be

251
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:21,497
some badass cowboys?

252
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:23,032
You guys want to know how Turnbull

253
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,333
went from being a cattle rustler

254
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,001
to running his own country?

255
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:29,238
I'm gonna need you to infiltrate
his base of operations.

256
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,673
As what?

257
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:34,710
Y'all are tax collectors?

258
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:36,178
We're here to go over your books

259
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,680
and make sure everything's in order.

260
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:39,582
And we're in a bit of a hurry, so, uh...

261
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,685
Yes, we're on the next
train back to Washington D.C.

262
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:45,387
Well, there ain't no train to Washington.

263
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,723
Pass won't be open till spring.

264
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:49,792
He means mule train.

265
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:50,926
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:53,062
This guy.

267
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:55,731
How'd I go from desperado to accountant?

268
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,533
At least Mick's having fun.

269
00:11:57,535 --> 00:11:59,768
Stuck here doing research
while everyone else

270
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,070
is out drinking.

271
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:02,972
It's like high school all over again.

272
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,508
A shot.

273
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:14,984
Make it two.

274
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,819
You're with him?

275
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,220
Unfortunately.

276
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,197
Guys, I think I found something.

277
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:29,281
According to this ledger,

278
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:31,300
Turnbull's stockpiling some kind of ore

279
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:32,534
in a nearby mining camp.

280
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:37,306
And you are?

281
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:39,441
I work for Mr. Turnbull.

282
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:41,110
Who are you?

283
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:43,112
My friends and I are with
the Internal Revenue Ser...

284
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:46,315
Ah, Mr. Turnbull don't like no taxmen.

285
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,751
Well, nobody likes paying taxes,

286
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:51,220
but they are an essential part
of the Federal Government...

287
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:54,223
Mr. Turnbull don't like the
Federal Government, neither.

288
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:57,259
Is that why he's trying
to start his own country?

289
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,194
Oh, now see, why'd you have to

290
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,296
go and say something like that?

291
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,365
Now I got to pump some lead into you

292
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,135
so you don't go blabbing
to the wrong person.

293
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:09,672
Hey, hey, would you shoot an unarmed man?

294
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:12,775
I think that's a yes.

295
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:21,350
So what's your history with Turnbull?

296
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,118
Come again?

297
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,823
Well, you said that you
had dealings over the years.

298
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:30,626
I can tell a vendetta when I see one.

299
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:34,263
I'm kind of an expert
when it comes to revenge.

300
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:36,465
This is what it's like
working with a woman?

301
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:39,501
You just sit around and
talk about your feelings?

302
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:42,571
Well, if your "feelings"
are what almost got you hung,

303
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:46,675
then, yeah, I'd say they're
worth talking about.

304
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:48,377
Not in my century.

305
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,179
Now that we've got outlaw outfits,

306
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:52,414
it's time to find out what
Turnbull's stockpiling

307
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,216
at his mining camp.

308
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:57,152
Or we could do the responsible
thing and head back to the ship

309
00:13:57,154 --> 00:13:59,354
with the rest of the team.

310
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:00,322
You're joking, right?

311
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,360
Time to cowboy up.

312
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,107
Oh!

313
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:19,074
Another blackjack.

314
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:21,276
Must be my lucky day.

315
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,312
- You're cheating.
- I'm winning.

316
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,249
Sweetheart, that's for you.

317
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:29,985
I'll see you around.

318
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:31,420
Piano man.

319
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:33,255
Play something else.

320
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:35,057
I've had more fun at a funeral.

321
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:38,494
Bartender!

322
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:42,231
And who might you be?

323
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,733
- Name's Turnbull.
- Never heard of him.

324
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,771
That's my name on the
sign in front of the saloon.

325
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:50,139
Or can't you read?

326
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,842
So it's your money I'm winning?

327
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,244
Well, that's interesting.

328
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:04,453
I'd say your luck has run out, partner.

329
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:09,758
You just gonna stand
there and make threats?

330
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,059
Or you gonna back it up?

331
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:15,130
Amaya, what's going on in there?

332
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:18,333
You wanted Rory to start a fight.

333
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,636
I'd say your plan's working.

334
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,862
Man, these clothes smell like ass.

335
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:30,047
People didn't wash in
the Wild, Wild West?

336
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:31,448
Well, we're criminals, remember?

337
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,883
It's important to smell the part.

338
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:34,117
Game faces, boys.

339
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,052
We got company.

340
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:39,389
I don't recognize you three.

341
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:43,126
That's probably
'cause of our new bandanas.

342
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:44,795
This one off his rocker?

343
00:15:44,797 --> 00:15:48,265
You could blow his brains out,
only he doesn't got any.

344
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:58,408
Nice work.

345
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,014
Gideon, let's run the
neural imaging scan again.

346
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:05,949
There must be something you missed.

347
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:07,751
The odds that I
misdiagnosed your condition

348
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:09,653
are infinitesimally thin.

349
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:12,789
The algorithm programmed into my
medical diagnostic systems...

350
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,024
Please just do it.

351
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:16,393
As you wish, Professor.

352
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:26,370
Biometric scan reveals
all brain functions

353
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,071
are within normal parameters.

354
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:30,207
Physiologically, there's
nothing wrong with you.

355
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,610
Are you implying that my
symptoms are psychosomatic?

356
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:35,312
Because...

357
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:43,387
Please...

358
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,356
I need you to run the test again.

359
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,774
Oh, my God.

360
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:05,142
What is it?

361
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:08,011
It's dwarf star.

362
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:10,047
One of the rarest minerals in the universe.

363
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,316
How does this help
Turnbull take over the West?

364
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:14,885
I used dwarf star to power the ATOM suit.

365
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,820
The piece I had was the
size of your little finger.

366
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:18,722
There's enough potential energy here

367
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:21,325
to power the entire Wild West.

368
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:23,694
Or blow it up.

369
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:26,563
Question is, how does Turnbull
even know what it is?

370
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,835
Bet ya this has something to do with it.

371
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:41,979
It's some sort of tracker,
definitely not from the 1800s.

372
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,647
Probably stole it from the time pirate.

373
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:44,915
We got to get this out of here.

374
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:48,385
Yeah.

375
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:50,020
Oh, I should've mentioned,

376
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:53,423
it's also the densest
material in the universe.

377
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:55,659
Let's get the rest of the team.

378
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:57,260
Amaya, it's been forever,

379
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:58,795
what the hell is going on in there?

380
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:00,897
Your plan's caught something of a snag.

381
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:02,165
Explain.

382
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,600
Well, it's hard to...

383
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:06,236
but Mr. Rory and Mr. Turnbull...

384
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:09,706
Like each other.

385
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,141
What?

386
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:12,976
What happened to Rory starting a fight?

387
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:14,878
I think it's more likely
that him and Turnbull

388
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,580
get matching tattoos.

389
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:19,549
Then they told me to put my
hands up and my pants fell down.

390
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:21,218
Because of all the loot I was carrying!

391
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:26,590
You see, that's what them damn fools

392
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:28,859
in government back in
Washington don't understand,

393
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:32,029
that men like you and me,
we wasn't meant to live in cages.

394
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:34,331
Hell, that's why our forbearers
busted away from England

395
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,999
to begin with, so we could be free!

396
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,635
And that's what "Turnbull
Country" is all about.

397
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:41,571
It's about keeping the Wild West wild.

398
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:44,307
I'll drink to that.

399
00:18:45,577 --> 00:18:46,810
Will you have some of that?

400
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:52,783
Are you gonna sit around
while those two bend elbows?

401
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,151
What are you doing?

402
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:55,752
I'm gonna collect my bounty,

403
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:56,953
whether you like it or not.

404
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:58,522
Stick to the plan, Jonah.

405
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:00,490
Your guy on the inside
ain't sticking to no plan,

406
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:01,458
why the hell should I?

407
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:06,063
Sara? What do you want me to do?

408
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:08,832
Brace yourself.

409
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:13,503
Turnbull!

410
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,944
Well, if it ain't the great
Jonah Hex, himself.

411
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:23,947
Whoo, you got quite a pair

412
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:26,283
to walk into my establishment like this.

413
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:28,118
You're like a cockroach.

414
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,152
Hard to kill.

415
00:19:29,154 --> 00:19:31,621
I'm taking you in.

416
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:33,623
Alive or dead.

417
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,292
Your choice.

418
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:37,194
I choose...

419
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:38,095
dead!

420
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:46,203
Actually, Jonah...

421
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:49,039
I'm glad you decided to
pay me this little visit.

422
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:53,777
You see, I've been working
on a little something.

423
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:57,047
It seems that ore that I discovered...

424
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:01,785
Well, it's got special qualities.

425
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:18,068
Let's party!

426
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:38,421
Come on!

427
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:47,664
Why do you guys get to have all the fun?

428
00:20:50,002 --> 00:20:51,735
We just got back from Turnbull's mine.

429
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:53,170
The reason for the Aberration?

430
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:54,838
He's digging up dwarf star.

431
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,374
Get back to the ship.

432
00:20:59,211 --> 00:21:02,412
That's right, run,
you yellow-bellied cowards!

433
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:09,986
Finally! Some excitement.

434
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:12,322
Mick, no!

435
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:14,791
And here I thought you
and me was gonna be friends!

436
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:17,260
I don't have friends.

437
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:33,376
- Ugh!
- Nate?

438
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:36,179
- Nate? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

439
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:37,514
I'm the Man of Steel, remember?

440
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:39,049
Oh, my gosh.

441
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:47,836
Gideon, prepare to run diagnostics.

442
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:50,121
What's to run? I've been shot!

443
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,924
The bullet has lodged
itself between several

444
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:55,593
of Dr. Haywood's internal organs.

445
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:57,128
How's that possible? He's made of steel.

446
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,562
Because it wasn't a normal bullet.

447
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,064
It was dwarf star.

448
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:03,134
I estimate his chance of survival at 51%.

449
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:08,038
Ugh, would it kill you to say
"better than average," Gideon?

450
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:14,411
We had a plan.

451
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:15,451
You went off book,

452
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:16,847
now you're gonna cut the crap,

453
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:18,415
and tell me what the hell is going on

454
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:19,984
between you and Turnbull.

455
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:22,153
I don't answer to you, Miss Lance.

456
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:23,788
It's Captain Lance.

457
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,689
And if you did answer to me,

458
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:28,793
Nate wouldn't have gotten shot.

459
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:32,630
Now, I know you don't like
taking orders from a woman...

460
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:35,065
but you're gonna like getting
your ass kicked by one

461
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,801
even less.

462
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:46,844
I've been after Turnbull
for eight years now.

463
00:22:46,846 --> 00:22:49,046
I almost got him twice.

464
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:50,815
He wants to see me pushing up daisies

465
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:53,818
just as bad as I want
to see him do the same.

466
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,186
Because why?

467
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:58,789
Little town in Oklahoma.

468
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,225
Goes by the name of Calvert.

469
00:23:01,227 --> 00:23:03,928
Turnbull and his men were harassing it.

470
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,630
And they hired me to fight back.

471
00:23:06,632 --> 00:23:10,134
Calvert, that's the town
that Rip left in the lurch.

472
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:12,369
My little rebellion

473
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,405
made other towns think
they didn't need to pay

474
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:17,575
protection money to
Turnbull and his gang.

475
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:20,311
So one night...

476
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:25,182
Turnbull gathered every man,
woman, and child in Calvert.

477
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,817
Locked us in the church.

478
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,920
Set it on fire.

479
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:32,256
Somehow, I escaped.

480
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,095
The good Lord saw fit to
leave me with a souvenir.

481
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:42,833
Oh, what the hell am
I telling a woman this for?

482
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:45,069
You'd never understand.

483
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:49,640
Wrong.

484
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:54,411
Like I said, vendetta's kind of my thing.

485
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:56,347
I've got a Turnbull.

486
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:58,716
And he's still out there.

487
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:01,151
Well, here you are with a timeship.

488
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,620
Been there, tried that.

489
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:05,155
Killing Darhk would
create ripples in history

490
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:06,757
that I can't control.

491
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,827
But there are things that I can control.

492
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:15,065
I can help you capture Turnbull.

493
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,500
Even though I screwed up?

494
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,769
Been there, too.

495
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,604
I'm starting to think that screwing up

496
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:23,841
is just an essential part of surviving.

497
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:31,715
So how's your headache?

498
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:34,318
Oh, it's fine.

499
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,420
Nothing a little aspirin couldn't help.

500
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:39,256
Funny, that's not what Gideon told me.

501
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:40,758
What's going on?

502
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,560
And don't lie, because you
know I can always tell.

503
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:45,195
All right, while you were away,

504
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:47,264
I...

505
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:48,565
I had a vision.

506
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,968
A vision? Like a hallucination?

507
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,803
It's possible it could merely be

508
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:56,006
a side effect from multiple time jumps.

509
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,808
- Ah!
- Whoa, Grey!

510
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,043
Grey!

511
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:02,212
Grey?

512
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:06,650
That is not a reaction to time travel.

513
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:07,851
What did you just see?

514
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,687
A woman.

515
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:12,589
Someone I've never met,
but her face, it keeps...

516
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:13,958
flashing in my mind.

517
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,993
It's like...

518
00:25:15,995 --> 00:25:18,329
I'm having memories of a stranger,

519
00:25:18,331 --> 00:25:22,399
but she's not... Not really a stranger.

520
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:24,635
But I...

521
00:25:24,637 --> 00:25:27,871
I haven't the slightest notion why.

522
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,982
Trying to work out your frustration?

523
00:25:37,984 --> 00:25:39,783
Something like that.

524
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,954
What happened out there today?

525
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:45,990
You lost control.

526
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:48,092
Says you.

527
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:49,927
That man back in town,

528
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:53,597
the drinker, the gambler,
the animal that wants

529
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,267
to watch the whole world burn...

530
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:00,671
that's the real me.

531
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:04,708
I happen to know a thing
or two about animals.

532
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,444
They're not vicious by nature.

533
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:08,912
Unless they're attacked.

534
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:11,982
If you're trying to tell me to...

535
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:14,585
to tell you some sob
story about how horrible

536
00:26:14,587 --> 00:26:18,989
and painful my life is, forget it.

537
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:22,126
I'm no victim.

538
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:25,763
Sara's told me all the things
that you've done for this team.

539
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:27,631
And you don't sound like an animal

540
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,134
who just wants to watch the world burn.

541
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:32,469
They like to pretend
I'm part of the team,

542
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:36,040
that they have me on a leash.

543
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:38,008
No.

544
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,244
Hmm.

545
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:42,646
Now...

546
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:44,648
if you'll excuse me.

547
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:55,025
Some superhero.

548
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:58,195
Maybe I am better suited for the library.

549
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:02,399
Don't be so hard on yourself.

550
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,301
You had no idea that
Turnbull laced the bullets

551
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:07,204
with dwarf star, or that you
were even vulnerable to it.

552
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:11,842
When I was a kid,

553
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:14,745
there was this bully, Shane Blocklin.

554
00:27:14,747 --> 00:27:17,347
And one day, I decided,

555
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:20,451
"I'm gonna stand up to old Shane".

556
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:24,188
Long story short, he breaks
my nose in two places.

557
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:29,226
But from that point on, I was, uh...

558
00:27:29,228 --> 00:27:31,862
I was different.

559
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:33,597
I was afraid.

560
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:37,568
And then I meet you guys,

561
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,937
and I get these superpowers.

562
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:43,440
And I said to myself,

563
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:48,612
"Nate, you don't have
to feel afraid again".

564
00:27:48,614 --> 00:27:50,247
Well, maybe now you know how I felt

565
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:52,416
after you destroyed my ATOM suit.

566
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,020
When we were out
fighting with the Shogun,

567
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:59,957
without my suit, I was afraid.

568
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,126
Well, you hid it well.

569
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:04,461
That's because I realized that

570
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:06,630
weakness, or not being invulnerable,

571
00:28:06,632 --> 00:28:09,867
is what makes me a hero.

572
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:13,003
There's no bravery without fear.

573
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:15,772
That was a really good
inspirational speech.

574
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:17,474
- Really?
- Yeah.

575
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:19,977
Well, I have a few other
aphorisms in my back pocket.

576
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:21,545
Like, uh...

577
00:28:21,547 --> 00:28:24,882
"courage is the mastery of fear,
not the absence of fear."

578
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:26,316
"Strength is..."

579
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:27,818
You know what, buddy?

580
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,720
You nailed it.

581
00:28:29,722 --> 00:28:32,756
Sorry, got a little carried
away with my train of...

582
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,424
That's it.

583
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:37,728
I think I know how Turnbull's
gonna make his own country.

584
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,264
When I saw how much dwarf
star ore he had in that mine,

585
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:42,499
I started to wonder, how could he transport

586
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:44,301
such a heavy shipment?

587
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:45,769
- He'd have to use...
- The railroad.

588
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:47,070
The railroad.

589
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:48,705
Okay, get to the part where we care, Ray.

590
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:50,374
I think he's gonna use the railroad

591
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:51,642
and the dwarf star to...

592
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:52,709
wait for it.

593
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:54,111
I don't want to wait for it.

594
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:56,780
Close Summit Pass.

595
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:01,952
- Oh, my God, Ray's right.
- Thank you.

596
00:29:01,954 --> 00:29:04,354
Summit Pass connects
East/West via railroad.

597
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:07,124
Not if Turnbull uses this...

598
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,759
- the magic...
- Dwarf star?

599
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:10,861
Yeah, to blow the thing up.

600
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:13,030
Well, if he destroys the pass,

601
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:15,399
there's no way of transporting
soldiers and supplies

602
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:16,466
from the East coast.

603
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,702
The U.S. Army is effectively

604
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:20,070
locked out of the West.

605
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:21,972
So it's simple... We just stop Turnbull

606
00:29:21,974 --> 00:29:24,508
from blowing up the pass.

607
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,043
Yeah, simple.

608
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:28,579
You don't have a suit,
you just had invasive surgery,

609
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:29,980
Stein's out of commission.

610
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:32,416
We'll think of something.

611
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:36,086
"Courage is the mastery of fear,

612
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:37,521
not the absence of it".

613
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:40,791
Yeah, what about Turnbull?

614
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:43,060
If that train goes boom...

615
00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:44,294
he's not gonna be on it.

616
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:45,929
I overheard one of his people saying

617
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:50,033
Turnbull just called for
a meeting at his mine.

618
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:52,169
You, Jax, and Ray, stop the train.

619
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:54,338
The rest of us, we'll deal with Turnbull.

620
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,273
You sure about this?

621
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:58,342
Of course.

622
00:29:58,344 --> 00:30:00,744
This isn't my first rodeo.

623
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:02,980
I wanted to say that.

624
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:12,842
There's our train.

625
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:15,442
Loaded with enough dwarf star
to punch a hole in a mountain

626
00:30:15,444 --> 00:30:16,905
and cut off the pass to the East.

627
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,213
How do we stop a moving locomotive?

628
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:21,582
We don't.

629
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:23,984
I do.

630
00:30:23,986 --> 00:30:25,786
I think.

631
00:30:25,788 --> 00:30:26,921
Yah!

632
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,626
- So what do you think?
- I think I liked him.

633
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:45,039
That's three of them for every one of us.

634
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,674
Hex and I will draw their attention

635
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:48,876
while you two go make
sure Turnbull can't pull

636
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:50,444
anymore dwarf star out of the ground.

637
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:51,779
We'll need about five minutes

638
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:53,547
to plant enough dynamite
to seal the mine.

639
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:55,783
It's about time we got
to light something up.

640
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:57,184
Just light the fuse and run,

641
00:30:57,186 --> 00:30:58,886
don't stick around for the fireworks.

642
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:00,688
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,790
All right, I've got a plan to
get us close to Turnbull.

644
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,693
Are you ready to follow
my orders this time?

645
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:09,029
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Good, now put these on.

646
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:11,565
Hmm.

647
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:20,374
Quentin Turnbull!

648
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:22,443
Who's asking?

649
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,378
I heard you're looking for someone.

650
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:27,848
Jonah Hex!

651
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:31,785
Well, hell, looks like I'm
gonna have to kill you

652
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:33,988
for the third time.

653
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,289
I'm impressed, boy.

654
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:41,829
Jonah, Jonah, Jonah.

655
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:43,797
Back in the belly of the whale.

656
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,300
A lily-livered whale who
killed women and children.

657
00:31:46,302 --> 00:31:47,868
Whoa, no, that was before.

658
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,169
I've changed.

659
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:50,971
I got purpose now.

660
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:53,173
Matter of fact, why don't
I show you what I'm working on

661
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:56,043
so you know why you died?

662
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,511
You come along too, boy.

663
00:31:57,513 --> 00:31:58,846
Anyone who can bring in Hex

664
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:00,381
always got a place on my crew.

665
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:16,497
Nate, what are you doing, man?

666
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,132
Hold on!

667
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:20,200
- Keep your distance!
- What're you gonna do?

668
00:32:20,202 --> 00:32:21,635
I'm gonna cut 'em off at the pass.

669
00:32:21,637 --> 00:32:23,237
I've always wanted to say that.

670
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,905
You can't get in front of a moving train!

671
00:32:24,907 --> 00:32:28,275
You said it yourself...
there is no bravery without fear!

672
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:31,378
Which is good, because I
am scared as hell right now.

673
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,279
Yah!

674
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,216
Colt Single Action Army.

675
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:37,651
"The gun that won the West."

676
00:32:38,988 --> 00:32:41,722
Some folks like to call
it "the peacemaker."

677
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:43,724
Only, I don't much care for peace.

678
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:46,393
Yeah, thanks to what
I pulled out of this mine,

679
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:48,128
I got my own weapon now.

680
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,097
Something that's gonna tip the scales.

681
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:52,933
Win the West back for
the folks it belongs to.

682
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:54,535
The outlaws!

683
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,826
Hyah!

684
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:28,371
- Okay. I'm in position.
- And out of your mind!

685
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:30,504
You couldn't even stop a
bullet made with that stuff.

686
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,174
That train is loaded
with dwarf star, man!

687
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:35,342
You guys aren't helping.

688
00:33:36,946 --> 00:33:39,446
You got a whole minute
to get out of here.

689
00:33:39,448 --> 00:33:41,615
You mean we have a minute.

690
00:33:41,617 --> 00:33:44,251
That's what I meant.

691
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:46,186
Should we tell them about the minute?

692
00:33:48,457 --> 00:33:50,991
- No.
- Good.

693
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:52,459
I was hoping you were gonna say that.

694
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,844
- Who's next?
- Mick, we got to go!

695
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:14,815
Mick, now!

696
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:17,818
Put the animal away.

697
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,386
Okay.

698
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,126
Oh, yeah, those bullets ain't nothing.

699
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:28,195
Wait till you see what I got now.

700
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,167
Now get on in there!

701
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,843
You ain't no man!

702
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,184
You burned down Calvert!

703
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:52,085
You murdered all those people!

704
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:54,221
For what?

705
00:34:54,223 --> 00:34:56,223
For power?

706
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:58,225
Oh, get it over with!

707
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:00,294
Alive or dead?

708
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:04,565
Alive!

709
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:08,469
You lucky son of a bitch.

710
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:12,706
I got this. I got this.

711
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,174
I got this.

712
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:16,510
I got this, I got this,
I got this, I got this.

713
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,687
Did you see that? Did you see that?

714
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:01,822
Tell me you saw that.

715
00:36:01,824 --> 00:36:03,891
Yo, that was badass, dude.

716
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:05,092
Totally badass.

717
00:36:05,094 --> 00:36:07,394
- You all right?
- No.

718
00:36:07,396 --> 00:36:09,630
But I stopped a train.

719
00:36:09,632 --> 00:36:12,099
- I think he's good.
- Whoo!

720
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:14,013
I stopped a train!

721
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,351
That's a mighty fine
job you did back there.

722
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:28,188
Captain.

723
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,689
I'll drink to that.

724
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:35,862
So now that you have your man,

725
00:36:35,864 --> 00:36:37,063
what're you gonna do with him?

726
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:38,330
Turnbull?

727
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:42,569
If I had my way, he'd be in
for a long, painful demise.

728
00:36:44,172 --> 00:36:47,440
I'd let him bleed out from the gut.

729
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:52,779
But I'm gonna turn him
over to the authorities.

730
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:55,014
So you don't have to worry
about your "Aberration."

731
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:58,351
Only territory Turnbull's
gonna be claiming is a cold,

732
00:36:58,353 --> 00:37:00,153
dark prison cell.

733
00:37:00,155 --> 00:37:03,656
Then our work here is done.

734
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:05,558
You do a mighty fine job bearing a burden

735
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,927
few men could deal with.

736
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:10,263
Good thing I'm a woman then.

737
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:15,135
Yes, ma'am.

738
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,305
I best get Turnbull.

739
00:37:19,307 --> 00:37:21,474
Collect my bounty.

740
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:27,213
Now, you try to stay out of trouble.

741
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:34,053
Not likely.

742
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:36,055
Wouldn't imagine so.

743
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:08,421
It really is beautiful.

744
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:09,789
It's no wonder that human beings

745
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:12,792
have worshipped fire for millennia.

746
00:38:12,794 --> 00:38:16,696
Fire gives us life, but also
has the power to destroy

747
00:38:16,698 --> 00:38:18,264
everything in its path.

748
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:20,433
Your point?

749
00:38:20,435 --> 00:38:24,270
Or are you gonna keep
talking in metaphors?

750
00:38:24,272 --> 00:38:28,575
Yeah, I know what a metaphor is.

751
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:30,777
But don't tell them.

752
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:32,779
You were right.

753
00:38:32,781 --> 00:38:36,015
The animal who wants to
watch the world burn...

754
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:39,786
that is who you are.

755
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:42,388
But it's not all that you are.

756
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,724
Your point?

757
00:38:44,726 --> 00:38:47,093
Don't deny the animal.

758
00:38:47,095 --> 00:38:50,964
But don't let it control you either.

759
00:38:50,966 --> 00:38:53,166
I can help you.

760
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:56,336
Believe me, I know a thing or two

761
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:59,172
about controlling wild beasts.

762
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:12,986
Oh, there you are.

763
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:15,755
So I've been thinking
about your memory flashes.

764
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:18,258
"Manopause" moments,
or whatever it is you want to call 'em.

765
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,059
I got a theory.

766
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:23,229
What if when you interacted with
your younger self in 1987, you...

767
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,164
Inadvertently changed my past

768
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:28,568
so... so that my memories from my new life

769
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,603
are supplanting the
memories from my old life,

770
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:32,906
thus creating temporal dissonance.

771
00:39:32,908 --> 00:39:35,174
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.

772
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:36,376
Oh, it's a brilliant theory,

773
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:39,212
which I happen to share with you,

774
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:41,281
but it doesn't explain...

775
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:42,815
Who the mystery lady is.

776
00:39:52,394 --> 00:39:55,428
Or...

777
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,699
that I'm fairly certain I love her.

778
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:03,603
Man, Clarissa is gonna kill
you when you get home.

779
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:07,907
Assuming there even is
a Clarissa to go home to.

780
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:16,149
Huh.

781
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:18,084
Hey, heard you were looking for me.

782
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:20,053
Oh, yeah, uh, I just wanted to thank you

783
00:40:20,055 --> 00:40:21,654
for saving all that dwarf star ore.

784
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:23,656
I have enough to power 20 ATOM suits now.

785
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:25,892
That's cool, man, so we all get one?

786
00:40:25,894 --> 00:40:28,061
Uh, actually, there's something
I've been working on

787
00:40:28,063 --> 00:40:31,064
before I start building a new exo-suit.

788
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:33,900
It's, uh, not exactly what
was in your drawing.

789
00:40:33,902 --> 00:40:35,435
I made a few improvements.

790
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:41,507
Shut the front door.

791
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,910
Yeah. I figure you earned it.

792
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:45,178
Steel.

793
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,879
Cool name.

794
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:50,283
Hey, are you guys done bro-ing out?

795
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:52,251
- I mean...
- Uh, well, not really, but...

796
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:53,987
- We can.
- Good.

797
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:56,322
Because our friends back in 2016,

798
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:57,357
they need our help.

799
00:41:08,255 --> 00:41:13,500
