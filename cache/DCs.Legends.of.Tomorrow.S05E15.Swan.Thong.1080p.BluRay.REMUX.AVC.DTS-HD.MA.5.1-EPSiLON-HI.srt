[Charlie] <i>Previously on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:06,258
Only a weapon from hell
can eliminate a hell-spawned Encore.

3
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:07,426
We could use those.

4
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:09,112
[Sara] Yeah, let's just get them
and get out of here.

00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:12,723
[Charlie] <i>The Loom of Fate is one
of the most powerful tools in existence.</i>

6
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,851
<i>It gave my sisters and me control
over everyone's lives.</i>

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,978
None of this is how it should be!

8
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:21,190
Screw the Fates. Stop being so obedient.

9
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,191
[Mona] <i>They're free!</i>

10
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:24,818
Then I can't help them anymore.

11
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:33,160
- Oy! Stop it!
- [man] We will rule!

12
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,204
But even I like the Blue Mush.

13
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:39,082
[sighs] Bollocks.

<i>The world is perfect.</i>

16
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,886
What kept you, sister?

17
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:54,765
Oh, you know, running a TV empire is
not as easy as snipping threads, sister.

18
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:59,770
I was skeptical when you pitched
the idea of the Legends on TV,

19
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:01,855
but they've helped pacify the masses.

20
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:03,899
Well, should we get started then?

21
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:06,526
We don't want to
keep our worshippers waiting.

22
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:25,921
[sighs] Any luck finding the Loom?

23
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:28,757
Yeah, I think we found it, all right.

24
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,009
Yeah, well, our ride is
still very much MIA,

25
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,054
<i>so don't destroy the Loom
until we find the ship.</i>

26
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,180
- She has a weird voice, right?
- [coughing]

27
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:36,848
You okay?

28
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,559
Acid reflux. Too much Green Mush.

29
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,645
Ava better find that ship
because if we succeed,

30
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,022
then we're gonna have
three very angry Fates on our hands.

31
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,274
- Hey.
- God!

32
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,026
- You're all from the TV, right?
- Yes.

33
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,279
Can we get your autographs?

34
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:55,033
That depends.
How attached are you to your clothes?

35
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:01,999
Oh, my Fates! It's the Legends!

36
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:03,834
Gary, Mona, you're okay.

37
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,961
It worked. You're out of the TV.

38
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,804
Okay, I've been dying to ask,
was I a Legend?

39
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:10,841
Or a lovable rogue,
or a Manic Pixie Dream Boy?

40
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,760
Time Dweeb! Where is the <i>Waverider?</i>

41
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,138
Is that like the <i>U. S. S. Faterider</i>
on <i>Star Trip?</i>

42
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:17,556
Yeah, sure. Have you seen it?

43
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,933
No, but I bet
it's in the Forbidden Dump.

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,435
Well, that sounds ominous.

45
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:23,162
It's where we send
all the contraband items.

46
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,856
I know, because I work for
the Historical Sanitation Department.

47
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:29,568
Okay, great. So, how would we
infiltrate this Forbidden Dump?

48
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:39,369
The <i>Waverider</i> better be here.

49
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:41,538
If we stay, we'll raise suspicion.

50
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:43,165
Good luck, teammates.

51
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,082
I don't get it.

52
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:48,378
Fuzzy dice, waffle maker,
massage chairs.

53
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:49,880
This is all like the good stuff.

54
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:52,734
Yeah, if you make life bleak enough,
people become so focused on survival

55
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,009
they forget they can revolt.

56
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,259
Start clicking, Mickey.

57
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,222
[clicking]

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,700
You're not allowed back here.

59
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,460
Yeah, for good reason. Now!

60
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:33,965
Nice one, love.

61
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:35,550
Hope they have benefits.

62
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:38,470
Here.

63
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,181
- What do you need me in there for?
- You'll see.

64
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:43,268
All right. Keep your eyes out
for any more guards

65
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,851
and let's get rid of these two.

66
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:47,604
Okay, take that one, I'll take this one.

[giggles]

68

[sighs] I hope I have benefits.

69
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,906
What is your request?

70
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:01,952
More Blue Mush, please.

71
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,956
We shall weave it
into the fabric of time this afternoon.

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,083
Thank you.

73
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,419
Thank you.

74
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:11,877
[Lachesis] Speak, child.

75
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,172
Can you put my shows back on TV?

76
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:19,886
They'll be back in a tick. The actors
just need a bit of rest, that's all.

77
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,472
Why? Are they tired from the crossover?

78
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:24,224
What is a crossover?

79
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,440
The Legends are here.

80
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:43,452
Clotho, I have let you play
your childish game long enough.

81
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:45,912
It is time to grow up
and face the music.

82
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,330
The Legends are my friends.

83
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,082
Are they?

84
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,752
Time and again,
they have sown chaos into this world.

85
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:54,880
Sometimes they screw things up
for the better.

86
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,465
I mean, think about it, Encores.

87
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:57,506
That wasn't their fault.

88
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:59,147
And they've been
mopping that up all year.

89
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:02,888
That's true.
The Encores are not the Legends' fault.

90
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:04,389
They're yours.

91
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:08,894
Ambitious villains are
the product of the chaos you birthed.

92
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,397
Look at these people now.

93
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:16,651
Do you see a future Joseph Stalin
amongst these lambs?

94
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:21,698
Of the three of us, you always loved
these mortal creatures best.

95
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,241
What do you think they would want?

96
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:27,954
More choices or a lifetime of peace?

97
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:33,835
Peace.

98
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:38,465
Wise choice, sister.

99
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,020

I really wish you could see this, love.

100
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,486
Well, I can feel it.

101
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,159
It's beautiful.

102
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,955
Now destroy it, once and for all.

103
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,836
All right. We found the Loom.
John's working on it as we speak.

104
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,047
<i>I'm standing guard.
Any luck finding the ship?</i>

105
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,410
Yeah, we still haven't found it.

106
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:23,009
Mick, how do you know
the batteries in that thing even work?

107
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:25,845
For all we know, the <i>Waverider</i>
could be anywhere in this mess.

108
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:27,681
[car door chirping]

109
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,724
Shut the front door.

110
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,685
- No.
- Do you hear that?

111
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:56,042
I helped you find the ship.
Now I'm gonna find my kid.

112
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,378
Okay, Mick will be fine on his own.

113
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,506
A spell to destroy something
as powerful as this,

114
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:04,676
it requires
a considerable well of magic.

115

[Astra] Uh-uh.

116

I played hooky at Hogwarts.

117

I learned magic the hard way, John,
in hell.

118

It's dangerous.

119
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:16,605
You're Natalie Logue's daughter,
aren't you?

120
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:20,150
Your mother,
she was a natural conduit for magic.

121
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:23,612
Her blood flows through your veins,
meaning that you're a conduit as well.

122
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,656
Close your eyes and go with me.
All right?

123
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:31,620
Gideon, bring all systems online.

124
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:33,747
G, you there?

125
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,167
Guys, we have a problem.
There is no Gideon.

126
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:40,837
- Which means no flying.
- Damn it, Fates. Well played.

127
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,857
What would it take
to get the ship off the ground manually?

128
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,257
I mean, we need a superconductor

129
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:46,676
to transfer a huge surge of energy
to the timecore.

130
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,637
We could look in the junkyard.

131
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:53,224
Or... Huh. I have an idea.

We haven't really caught up.
I don't know what you've been up to.

137
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,199
- You spent a year in a Totem. I mean...
- Guys, can we just focus?

138
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:12,619
- I don't wanna do this.
- I know.

00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:09,152
<i>For once she was a true love of mine</i>

161
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:10,820
I love you, Mommy.

162
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:21,206
My sweet girl, your mother is gone.

163
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,130
No, no, no!

164
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,803
Forget her, or you will never be
the powerful woman I know you can be.

165
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:36,095
No!

166
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:46,397
Your power comes from me.
I alone am its master.

167
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:51,194
My power comes from my team.
John, open the door.

168
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:54,322
Behrad, now!

169
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,628
If my power comes from you,
then maybe I can do this.

170
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,679
[screaming]

171
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:23,977
[gasps]

172
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:31,276
Ava, where you at?

173
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,060
[Agent Sharpe] <i>Pulling up now.</i>

174
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:36,281
Clotho, what have you done?

175
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:39,158
[Sara] Go, go. Let's move.

176
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,556
I don't think we can hold this altitude.

177
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,581
[Sara] Jump the ship.

178
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:46,916
Do it.

179
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:56,342
[screaming]

180
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,561
[all groaning in pain]

181
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:09,105
Wait, when are we?

182
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:13,484
I don't know.
It's hard to see through all this trash.

183
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:14,776
[Nate] It's not trash.

184
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,696
They're some of
history's most iconic mementos.

185
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:21,117
I don't care what it is.
All I care is that I can see this face.

186
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,329
Oh, I think my powers are gone.

187
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,956
Yeah, well, your powers
were bestowed by a God.

188
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,709
Once that God kicked the bucket,
then bye-bye powers.

189
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:31,252
Everything's back to normal?

190
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:32,587
Only one way to find out.

191
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,481
Gideon is down.
Gotta do it the old-fashioned way.

192
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,900
- All right.
- [Agent Sharpe] Sounds good.

193
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:38,404
- All right, let's go check it out.
- [Agent Sharpe] All right.

194
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,765
[Agent Sharpe]
Okay, this feels like an improvement.

195
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,269
All right, this says
we jumped a few months.

196
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,395
Okay.

197
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,273
Well, gives the world some time
to get back on track.

198
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:54,943
Hey, Fate, what's the best way
to work today?

199
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:56,069
[watch chirps] <i>The subway.</i>

200
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,363
Hey, Fate. What should I have
for lunch today?

201
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,156
<i>Two soups and a smoothie.</i>

202
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:02,867
Hey, Fate,
should I ask Renee to marry me?

203
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,386
Hey, Fate, what do I buy my brother
for his birthday?

204
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,221
Uh... What are the chances
that everyone's watches

205
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,331
got a weird update
over the last four months?

206
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,416
I'd say one in a monkey's ass, love.

207
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,672
[sighs] Great. So, not only do Charlie
and her sister have the Loom back,

208
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,424
but now it's wearable.

209
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:25,348
Don't let choices get
in the way of your destiny.

210
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:27,392
Trust in Fate.

211
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:30,436
With Fatewatch, your link to the Loom.

212
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:32,647
<i>Always connected.</i>

213
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:40,798
[Agent Sharpe]
I get the Fates rebuilt the Loom.

214
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,142
But how'd they put it in a watch?

215
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,051
[Constantine] Well, that's why we're
breaking into the bloody temple.

216
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:45,326
Get some answers.

217
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,996
- What the hell? It's a...
- History museum.

218
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,289
Can't be all that bad.

219
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:53,626
Well, certainly an improvement
on the Loom Temple.

220
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:00,133
"Welcome to The History Museum.

221
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:03,469
Here you will learn the truth
about free will and the atrocities

222
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,471
it has brought upon humankind."

223
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:06,639
Atrocities?

224
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:10,935
"Join us as we examine the tragedies
of choice and the horrors of our past,

225
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:14,439
that we shall, with benevolence
and Fate, never suffer again."

226
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:18,234
So they went from trashing history
to weaponizing it.

227
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:19,694
But why?

228
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:21,422
Well, if we want to know
what happened in the past,

229
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:22,947
we certainly came to the right place.

230
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:26,743
All right. First up,
the Hall of Bad Ideas.

231
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,123
[Nate] Ray has that suit.

232
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,129
- What the hell is a shake weight?
- You don't want to know, babe.

233
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,280
[Constantine] Cigarettes? Oh, come on.

234
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:47,138
Bloody cheek of them.

235
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,932
John, you died of lung cancer. Come on.
You know they're right.

236
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:51,058
Yeah.

237
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,024
Whoa.

238
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,239
- Okay. What's "The Thong Song"?
- Seriously?

239
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,784
"She had dumps
like a truck, truck, truck.

240
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,786
Baby, move your butt, butt, butt."

241
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,454
[singing] <i>I think I'll sing it again</i>

242
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:14,916
Man, screw the Fates.
That is a spring break classic.

243
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,019
As a matter of fact, I'll play it
for you. I don't give a damn.

244
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:21,255
No, you won't. Come on,
we have to go to the Hall of Villains.

245
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,007
Later, Sisqó.

246
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:28,429
Okay. Other Z. I just rerouted
the nav system. Anything popping up yet?

247
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:33,142
No, nothing yet. Hey, try patching into
the secondary hard drive.

248
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:36,312
Maybe we can pull something up
from the backup... [echoes]

249
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,028
Zari, come on, run.

250
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,783
Behrad!

251
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,119
Hey, you okay?

252
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,788
I don't know...

253
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,791
There were these guys,
A.R.G.U.S. agents.

254
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,001
They had guns. Huge guns.

255
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,379
I thought they were gonna shoot you.

256
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:05,842
[exhales]
I must have smoked something way off.

257
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,887
Oh, uh... I thought you were Zari.

258
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,473
I... I am.

259
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:16,561
No, I mean, totally, I know.
It's just...

260
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:20,189
- It's weird.
- Yeah. I know. Tell me about it.

261
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:25,528
I'm hanging out with myself. A myself
that has the hots for John Constantine.

262
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,697
- You caught that, too?
- Yeah.

263
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:32,076
It wasn't something you smoked.
It happened.

264
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:35,621
You told me to run, and I did.
You didn't.

265
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:37,999
And then I died.

266
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:42,044
Every day since then,

267
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:43,880
everything I've done
has been to save you.

268
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,059
Whoa. This is like, really uncanny.

269
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:00,021
Wait a second.
Are these villains ranked?

270
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,690
I don't know.
Who do you have over there?

271
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:06,569
I got Vlad the Impaler,
but he's number 14.

272
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,821
Hey, if he's number 14,
who's number one?

273
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,202
Hey, Mick. You're okay.

274
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:17,538
What did you expect?
You left me, us behind!

275
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:19,749
Okay, calm down, please.

276
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,752
We were waiting for four months.
What took you so long?

277
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,254
Yeah, that's a question for
the other Zari.

278
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:31,052
Oh! Book club lady.
What are you guys doing here?

279
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:34,305
Well, when you guys broke the Loom,
people panicked.

280
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,766
Suddenly, all these memories
came flooding back.

281
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:37,975
No one knew what was real.

282
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,477
[Lita] Or what to do.

283
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,330
They were so used to
the Fates telling them.

284
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:43,898
So, Gary and Mona found me and Dad,
and we went into hiding.

285
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,192
- Hiding? Why?
- Because we're Legends.

286
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,275
Yeah.

287
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:50,488
And if you were listening to
what the Fates had to say, we were...

288
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:53,074
[Sara] "God Killers"?

289
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:55,284
I've been called worse.

290
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:57,387
Is it weird that I'm offended
that we're only number two?

291
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,497
Well, then who's number one?

292
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,169
[Agent Sharpe] Charlie.

293
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:06,420
[gasps]

294
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,882
No...

295
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:11,633
How did you...

296
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,303
You can't be here.
You have to leave right now.

297
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:16,531
What are you talking about, Charlie?
It's over. You have to come with us.

298
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:17,640
[watch chimes]

299
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,601
No, Fate says to stay. Fate says...

300
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:24,039
She's gonna kill you if she finds you.
You have to get out while you can.

301
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:26,107
Charlie, I'm sorry,
but you'll thank us later. John?

302
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,817
[speaking foreign language]

303
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,610
Charlie...

304
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:34,240
Hey, it's okay. You're home, Charlie.

305
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:37,118
No.

306
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:39,578
No, no, no, no, no, I have to go back.
She's gonna know.

307
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:44,959
Where's my watch? I need it.
That's how the Loom tells me what to do.

308
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:47,837
Why the hell do you listen
to that thing, Charlie?

309
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,339
Because I never should have destroyed
the Loom to begin with.

310
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:54,969
I mean, greed and war. Human suffering?

311
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:58,097
All those Encores we were up against,
that's all on me.

312
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,057
I'm the Loom breaker.

313
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,311
- I'm the creator of chaos.
- Charlie.

314
00:19:04,562 --> 00:19:07,773
That used to be
a badge of honor for you.

315
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:11,861
- What happened?
- We left. That's what happened.

316
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,904
Charlie, you were left all alone.

317
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:15,948
It's no wonder
Lachesis got into your head.

318
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:17,825
Lachesis, she's my family.

319
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,618
And family sticks together.

320
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,914
Hey, we are your family,
and we're here now, all right?

321
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,750
Charlie, what happened?

322
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:29,837
Lachesis rebuilt the Loom.
She saved everyone.

323
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,048
She restored the peace.

324
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:44,310
I replaced my own mother, John.

325
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:50,566
Summoning a ghost can be difficult,
even under the best of circumstances.

326
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,693
No, I mean in hell.

327
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:58,032
I was terrified, helpless.

328
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,868
Lachesis found me. She took me in.

329
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,247
But the price for her protection
was my humanity.

330
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:11,128
She trained me to let go of
anything that made me feel.

331
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:15,174
And so I had to forget the person
I had loved the most.

332
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:19,428
You were just a kid.
Trying to survive is all.

333
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:21,389
But I wanted to forget.

334
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,225
I saw what happened
to good people down there,

335
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,394
and I swore that would never be me.

336
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,814
Listen to me, all right?

337
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:32,233
You are still her daughter.

338
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:38,322
Whose? Natalie?

339
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,699
Or Lachesis?

340
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,835
Okay. I know you think free will
is a bad, scary thing.

341
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,921
So, we did a little dumpster diving
to give you some counterpoints.

342
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,215
Two words. The Beatles.

343
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:58,092
All right,
they taught an entire generation

344
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,469
that even during war and tragedy,

345
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:02,555
we can still make beauty.

346
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,598
Whilst also inspiring Charles Manson

347
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:06,976
to commit some of
the most brutal murders in history.

348
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,895
Also, they let Ringo sing a song
about an octopus.

349
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,189
- Damn it. Okay.
- [Sara] Okay.

350
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:13,774
Just get out of the way.

351
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:17,069
<i>Mamma Mia 2,</i> a celebration of free love,
reckless abandon

352
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:18,404
and following your bliss.

353
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:21,323
Even if that bliss means creating
a two-hour ABBA-palooza

354
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,534
where Cher plays Meryl Streep's mom.

355
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,179
Weren't the Legends almost murdered
by Napoleon because of ABBA?

356
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:32,668
Two words. "Octopus's Garden."

357
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,753
Gary, no.

358
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,428
Would this have happened in a world
without free will?

359
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,473
Seriously, Charlie, look, I'm a clone,
for God's sake.

360
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:46,599
She's a clone.

361
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,727
You don't have to... Anyway,
think about all the people on this ship.

362
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:51,479
Think about
how they came to be together.

363
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:53,898
Yeah, Nate's crazy conspiracy theory.

364
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,650
Mick's turn
as a futuristic bounty hunter.

365
00:21:56,817 --> 00:22:00,905
Zari and B's dystopian future.
You in that disco outfit.

366
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:03,657
Hey, come on, Charlie.
We were all in our own worlds,

367
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,576
but a twist in our stories
brought us together

368
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:06,660
and made us a family.

369
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,913
But humanity,
they've made so many mistakes.

370
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:12,249
Sometimes a mistake is
really just destiny.

371
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,293
What, you learn that being a Paragon?

372
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,545
No, I learned that being a person.

373
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,676
So, what do you think? Can we track
the Loom signal with that thing?

374
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:26,514
Yeah, I just need an external computer,
something with GPS and Wi-Fi.

375
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:33,729
- Well, that's perfect.
- Hey!

376
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,316
[gasps]

377
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,401
We all make sacrifices
for the greater good.

378
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:42,696
Really? How much THC is running
through your system right now?

379
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,157
I'm self-medicating for my Loom anxiety.

380
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,077
You know, the brain processes
phone screens and drugs the same way.

381
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,579
- Ha.
- That's why they're both so addicting.

382
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:51,789
Oh.

383
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:02,132
All right, the Loom's signal's coming
from somewhere inside the building.

384
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,343
Okay. Okay.

385
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:08,264
Okay.

386
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:17,481
John, other me,
we're gonna have to go floor by floor.

387
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,650
Well, it's a dodgy spot
for the Loom of Fate.

388
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:22,987
You know, I've hosted many an exclusive
party in a place like this.

389
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,406
The antithetical keeps the riffraff out.

390
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,075
Hiding in plain sight. Bloody brilliant.

391
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:32,496
Also, you can do whatever you want
and no one needs to know.

392
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,707
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,130
[moaning over speaker]

394
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:45,509
Oh, God, this is weird.
[clears throat]

395
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,847
All right, uh...
No windows, thick walls...

396
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,434
That's where I'd stash
my artisanal, world-altering apparatus.

397
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:56,478
[Zari] <i>Guys, I think we found it.</i>

398
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,315
I'm the worst.

399
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,358
Timing is impeccable.

400
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:07,948
Sara, we got to the Loom,
but there is no Loom.

401
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,744
- [Constantine] Blimey.
- Gideon.

402
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,787
[gasps] Gidget.

403
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:17,333
<i>Currently running Fate protocol.
I cannot be interrupted.</i>

404
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:20,419
She's controlling everyone with Gideon.

405
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,384
The watches, they're just running
a program telling everyone what to do.

406
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:27,676
Wait. So there is no Loom?
We actually destroyed it.

407
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,487
Yeah, all we have to do is
shut down the network.

408
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,139
What, and inspire panic
when Fate abandons everyone all at once?

409
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:34,475
You know, my sister was right
about you lot.

410
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:36,477
You shoot first and play doctor later.

411
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,978
[Astra] It won't matter anyway.

412
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,064
Lachesis will find another way
to keep her hooks in

413
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,547
because that is what she does best.

414
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:45,152
Okay, fine. So we just expose her
for what she really is. She's a fraud.

415
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,322
We take her down a notch, show everybody
that she can't control them anymore.

416
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:51,742
Yeah. Charlie, she's your sister.

417
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,869
You're the only person
that can stand up to her.

418
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:58,123
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,459
I can't help you.

420
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,724
[woman over loudspeaker]
The museum is now open.

421
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:19,228
For centuries after
my sister broke the Loom of Fate,

422
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,231
the world was filled with pain.

423
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,944
[all booing]

424
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:28,487
Horror.

425
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,698
[all booing]

426
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,534
Outrageous hubris and brutality.

427
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,370
Chaos.

428
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,665
But I could not let
people suffer any longer.

429
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:44,712
Alone, I rebuilt the Loom
and imprisoned my sister,

430
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:49,216
so that now and forever,
you may live in peace.

431
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,429
Here she is.

432
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:56,724
Loom breaker.

433
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:01,353
Creator of calamity.
Do you accept your fate?

434
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:04,314
- No.
- [crowd gasps]

435
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:05,607
What did you say?

436
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:09,987
I said no.

437
00:26:11,447 --> 00:26:13,532
Your story is a load of crap.

438
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,659
Astra.

439
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,372
Where is Clotho?

440
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,833
That was always the question, wasn't it?

441
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,755
Did you ever love me, or were you
just looking to replace your sister?

442
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:30,924
- You wanted a mother.
- I had a mother.

443
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,718
A woman who understood that

444
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,720
to love someone
you have to set them free.

445
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:37,556
Shut your mouth, dear,
before you say something you regret.

446
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,099
Make me.

447
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:44,188
Come on, all powerful Fate, smite me!
Strike me down!

448
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:49,443
Yeah, that's what I thought.

449
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:53,363
Why should these good people
listen to you?

450
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:57,201
- Because she's telling the truth.
- Take forever.

451
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:58,952
[Sara] <i>How's it looking, Zaris?</i>

452
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:03,040
I need to get into her mainframe to shut
her down. This might take a minute.

453
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,626
You tricked everyone
into giving up their freedom

454
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,377
by making them afraid of the past.

455
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,171
[Lachesis] That's rich,

456
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:13,634
coming from some of history's
most notorious criminals and killers.

457
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:16,845
- Shame.
- Shame.

458
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,347
- Shame.
- Shame.

459
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,933
All right. Yes, you're right.

460
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,601
We've made mistakes,

461
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,395
but sometimes things get messed up
for the better.

462
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,064
Take Marie Antoinette, for instance.

463
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,942
Her indifference
caused a revolution in France.

464
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,109
It gave them democracy.

465
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:34,112
Look, if you listen to her,
your stories are over.

466
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,157
They're right. Don't listen to me.

467
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,117
Listen to the Loom.

468
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,038
Come on, Zari.

469
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,749

00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,750
<i>The thing about circles
Is they never end</i>

629
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,377
<i>So our friendship will be universal</i>

630
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,758
<i>It's Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac...</i>

631
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:06,638
- Weren't they dead?
- I mean, who hasn't died?

632
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:09,015
Whoa.

633
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:16,689
- Hey. Finally some time travel.
- Mmm-hmm.

634
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,709
I can't believe Charlie is
the lead singer of The Smell,

635
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:19,651
that's insane.

636
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:20,944
They're my favorite.

637
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:23,780
Them and The Runaways.
We can go see them next.

638
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:26,282
It's a school night.
How about the weekend?

639
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,993
Yeah.

640
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,247
Excuse me, boss.

641
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,003
So, what's next for you, love?

642
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:42,173
I guess I'll give life above ground
a fair shot.

643
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,467
New York? Paris? Tokyo?

644
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:48,137
I was thinking about this haunted house
out in the sticks.

645
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:49,889
Were you, now?

646
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:52,433
I got my rent covered.

647
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,353
A-ha.

648
00:39:55,436 --> 00:40:00,733
Finally. All right, then. Cheers.

649
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:04,237
<i>So, what, you're looking for
A friend that's new?</i>

650
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,864
<i>I've always wanted a friend like you</i>

651
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:09,701
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friends</i>

652
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:12,245
<i>It's a street that goes on forever</i>

653
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,872
<i>A friendship is something without end</i>

654
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:18,835
<i>So let's run this thing together</i>

655
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:25,216
<i>Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac
Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

656
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:28,386

[cheering]

658
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,225
That's my girl!

659
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,816
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
I could taste the moon.

660
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,027
And that's enough for the evening.

661
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:49,324
All right, all right.
We came, we partied, we conquered.

662
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:51,659
And now, it's time to go.
It's time to go home.

663
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,244
- Home!
- [howling]

664
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,371
Actually, guys...

665
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,373
I think this is
the end of the line for me.

666
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,001
Wait, what? For reals?

667
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,670
Yeah, it's time for me
to just stay put for once.

668
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,130
And set down some roots.

669
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:05,506
All right. Well...

670
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:10,261
if you ever need anything, and I mean
anything, you know where to find us.

671
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:13,139
Thanks, Captain.

672
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:16,934
Once a Legend...

673
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:18,519
Always a Legend.

674
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:19,771
Thank you.

675
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:21,481
Well, come on, all of you.

676
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:23,733
Get in here.

677
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,277
I love you.

678
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,488
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

679
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:30,746
- Miss you.
- All right, go on. Get out there.

680
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,285
Go and enjoy your vacations.
You've earned it.

681
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:38,081
- Vacation!
- Vacation!

682
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:41,084
Vacation!

683
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:50,426
I think I'm gonna text Dion,
or is that too desperado...

684
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,470
This is why I don't have a phone.
