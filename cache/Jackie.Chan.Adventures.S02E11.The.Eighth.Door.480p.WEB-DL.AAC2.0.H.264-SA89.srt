1
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,114
Nice day for a Tsunami.

2
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,282
Too nice.

3
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,517
Why here?

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,818
The water demon
will need a palace

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,654
from which to rule
her new undersea
kingdom.

6
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:27,126
Here she comes, uncle.

7
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,427
Bai tza.

8
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,501
Uncle: Jackie,
take the gourd.

9
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,369
I will prepare
the <i> chi</i> spell.

10
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,804
Right--wah!

11
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:42,941
Jade?

12
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,777
Uh, no. I'm a moose.

13
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,012
Marlon moose.

14
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,882
Jade, you were
supposed to wait
back at section 13.

15
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,284
(Scoffs) I've been
at every demon
send-off so far.

16
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,220
Did you really think
I was gonna sit out
the last one?

17
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,724
Besides, then we can sell
our story to reality TV.

18
00:00:58,726 --> 00:00:59,958
Shall I turn back?

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,728
No. Please, just keep
out of harm's way.

20
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,763
(Chanting)

21
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,839
The <i> chi</i> wizard!

22
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,743
No!

23
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,816
Ooh, fish fry. Yah!

24
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:25,751
Jade!

25
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,019
Jackie!

26
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,936
Uncle, we have
to get Jade!

27
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,771
You have to re-open
the portal!

28
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,207
The <i> chi</i> spell has
sealed the portal,

29
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,509
like it has sealed
all the others...

30
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,810
Forever.

31
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,182
(Hiss)

32
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,087
Uh-uh-uh.

33
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,310
Uhh! Uhh!

34
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,847
Uhh! Hurry, uncle!
We must fly to Rome.

35
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,949
Jade is not
in Rome, Jackie.

36
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,218
She is trapped
in the demon netherworld.

37
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,620
Oh, why couldn't it
have been me?

38
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,389
Aah!

39
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,094
There must be something
we can do, uncle!

40
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,630
A counter spell!
A stronger spell!

41
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,399
Some way to--ow!

42
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,901
I cannot think
with all your noise.

43
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,406
The eighth door.

44
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,540
Uncle?

45
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,942
We have permanently sealed

46
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:33,111
7 portals belonging
to 7 demon sorcerers,

47
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,681
but not the one
belonging to shendu.

48
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,584
It is Jade's
only hope of escape

49
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,419
from the demon
realm.

50
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,424
But how do we find
shendu's door?

51
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,526
There is
only one way.

52
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,628
The pan ku box.

53
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,297
But shendu has it.
How do we find him?

54
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,234
Our hideout!

55
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,135
It's the helms
fish cannery!

56
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,805
Oh.

57
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,707
Uncle: Quickly.
We must find
the eighth door

58
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,875
before the demons
find Jade.

59
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,179
Jade:
"The demon netherworld:

60
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:09,715
"Where demon sorcerers go
when they've been bad,

61
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,684
where no human has
gone before...Until now."

62
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,054
My ratings will be huge!

63
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,857
(Sighs) If I ever find
a way out of here.

64
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,729
Uhh! Long way down.

65
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,065
Whoa!

66
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,377
Whoa.

67
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,613
We have liftoff.

68
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,492
(Snoring)

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,774
Hsi wu: Sister po!

70
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,244
Uh-oh.

71
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,681
Sister po!

72
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,749
(Snorts) Hmm?
Dinner time?

73
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,520
Meeting time.

74
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,755
Our sister bai
has returned.

75
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,990
I see.

76
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,695
Well, perhaps she brought
hors d'oeuvres.

77
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,931
Mmm, I love
the taste of humans.

78
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, boy.

79
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,401
Over here!

80
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,527
Double oh, boy.

81
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,531
Shendu: You may
take your leave, hak foo.

82
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,500
Valmont's voice:
I order you to stay!

83
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,335
Shendu's voice: Leave!

84
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,636
Valmont: Stay!

85
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,438
Shendu: Leave!
- Valmont: Stay!

86
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,006
Shendu: Leave!
- Valmont: Stay!

87
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,008
Shendu: Leave!
- Valmont: Stay!

88
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,643
Shendu: Your ruffian
has outlasted

89
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,645
his usefulness
to me, valmont.

90
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,847
Get rid of him.

91
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,315
Valmont:
And be left alone with you?

92
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,283
I think not, shendu.

93
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,786
On the contrary,
the both of you...

94
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,188
Are far from alone.

95
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,358
Shendu:
Brothers and sisters,

96
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,460
so good to see you.

97
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:39,264
Your sentiment will
quickly subside, shendu...

98
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,967
Once your punishment
is underway.

99
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,469
P-p-punishment?

100
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:48,173
Before I've finished
securing your release?

101
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,808
And how do you plan
to do that

102
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,844
with all of our portals
permanently sealed?

103
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,613
Yeah. How?

104
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:59,584
Why, through my portal,
dear sister.

105
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,319
The eighth portal?

106
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,923
It remains unsealed.

107
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,958
All I need do
is unlock it

108
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,760
with the pan ku box,

109
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,830
a task for which I have
retained the services

110
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,265
of a mortal servant,

111
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,966
who may touch
good magic.

112
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,234
Grr.

113
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,904
What is mine is yours,
demon brethren.

114
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,176
Uhh...Uhh.

115
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,711
Uhh.

116
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,757
Uhh!

117
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,827
What in the netherworld
is wrong with you, po Kong?

118
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,862
Uhh...Itch.
Cannot reach.

119
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,299
Hsi wu, scratch
your sister's back

120
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,100
so we may get on
with our meeting.

121
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,436
Uhh. There's
a lot of back.

122
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,238
Could take a while.

123
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,053
So, you want
a back scratcher?

124
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,459
Ahhh...

125
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,399
It passed.

126
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,478
Now, about
the eighth door,
shendu.

127
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,714
It is the portal
of <i> your</i> banishment.

128
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,216
Only <i> you</i> may
pass through it.

129
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,886
That once
was true, bai tza,

130
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,221
but now that
I am a spirit,

131
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,023
my portal is vacant...

132
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,726
Waiting to be filled
by others.

133
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,394
You mean <i> another.</i>

134
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,364
Only one may pass
through each portal.

135
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,933
That is the rule.

136
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,669
Do you think
I have been
dallying here?

137
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,539
I have discovered a spell

138
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,474
which will keep
the portal open

139
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,843
until the last of you
is freed.

140
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,746
In fact,
I was just preparing
to journey to it

141
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:08,947
when you called.

142
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,348
Hak foo...

143
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,684
Bring me...

144
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,189
The pan ku box!

145
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,025
Shark snatches bait!

146
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,894
Bai tza: What shark?

147
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,229
Xiao fung: What is
he talking about?

148
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,497
Jackie!

149
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,074
Shendu,
what is happening?

150
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,611
Uh, hak foo
always sounds the gong
as we take our leave,

151
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,080
which reminds me...

152
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,115
See you all
at my portal!

153
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,484
Shendu!

154
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,886
Can he be trusted?

155
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,321
Of course not!

156
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,957
Yet we have
no other options.

157
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,992
But all of eternity
to punish him

158
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,161
should he again
deceive us.

159
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:59,030
Hsi wu: Then let us go
to the eighth door.

160
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,401
Yes...Let's.

161
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,540
Hyah! Hyah!

162
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,809
Ohh...Ohh!

163
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,944
Why the interest
in the box, chan?

164
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,846
You have sealed
the portals.

165
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,881
I want a keepsake
of our time together.

166
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,049
Hyah!

167
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,353
Uhh!

168
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,390
Unh!

169
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,863
Jackie: Uhh!

170
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,301
Buffalo tramples
field mouse!

171
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,510
(Hisses)

172
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,018
You want the box,
shendu?

173
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,119
It's yours!

174
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,253
Aah!

175
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,921
Uhh!

176
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,023
(Groans)

177
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,524
Angry crow takes--

178
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,959
unh!
(Sighs)

179
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,829
What is
taking so long?!

180
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,831
Let's go.

181
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,268
Uncle:
In ancient times,

182
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,470
shendu ruled
what is now China.

183
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:16,307
I'm betting that
that is where
we will find his portal.

184
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,243
But even <i> if</i> we are
able to make this box

185
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,744
provide the
portal's location,

186
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,313
how will Jade find it
from the demon side?

187
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,649
With proper guidance.

188
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,218
That is why
I have brought research.

189
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,988
Ohh, nothing.

190
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,656
Ahh...

191
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,857
Jade is
good at puzzles.

192
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,626
She could
figure it out...

193
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,428
If she were here.

194
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,562
Uhh.

195
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,031
Uhh.

196
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,033
Uhh.

197
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,403
(Sighs)

198
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,472
I thought this rock
looked familiar.

199
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,641
I'm going 'round
in circles!

200
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,979
Valmont: And we are
on our way to China why?

201
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:58,116
Chan has stolen
the pan ku box.

202
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,820
Clearly, he wants
to find my portal
so he can seal it.

203
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:05,223
Now why would chan
go to all the trouble

204
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,227
if he knows you don't
need the portal to
pass between the realms?

205
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,162
For good measure,
I suppose.

206
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,631
Meanwhile,
my brothers and sisters

207
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:17,102
are expecting me
to open my door
and free them.

208
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:20,271
I brought
your spell book.

209
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,374
You brought
the phone book,
you simpleton!

210
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,976
I was bluffing!

211
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,848
So there is no way
to free all of them.

212
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,083
Of course there is!

213
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,352
I...Just need to find it...

214
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,787
That's all.

215
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,327
Uncle: Hotcha!

216
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,565
Uncle?

217
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,834
He is in a trance.

218
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,770
He's looking for Jade.

219
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,073
Day number...

220
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,142
Ohh, I haven't
the foggiest.

221
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,310
The good news:
The demons have left

222
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,478
to find
the eighth portal.

223
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,814
The bad news:
I lost their trail.

224
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:06,117
Jackie, toru, uncle.

225
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,619
I may never
see you again,

226
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,221
but in case
you ever find
this footage,

227
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:13,124
edit this mushy part out
before you sell it
to a TV show.

228
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,926
Just want you all
to know I miss you.

229
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,694
I even miss
uncle's garlic breath.

230
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,829
Jade!

231
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:18,963
Aah!

232
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,467
Uncle? How did you--

233
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,635
not important,

234
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,804
and garlic
is <i> good</i> for you!

235
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,238
Are you ok?

236
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,073
(Scoffs) Just lost.

237
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,708
Listen closely.

238
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,111
We are trying
to find the eighth door.

239
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,279
Shendu's door!

240
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,247
You know about that?

241
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,849
The demons are
looking for it, too.

242
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,584
Shendu told them
he's gonna open it up

243
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,919
so they can
all break out.

244
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,087
(Gasps)
Shendu deceives them.

245
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,424
Only one being
can now exit
through that portal,

246
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,526
and that being
must be you.

247
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,197
So how do I find
the portal, uncle?

248
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,700
When I know where it is,
I will lead you there myself.

249
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,636
Go, uncle.

250
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,072
One more thing:
I cannot know
where it is

251
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,975
unless I know
how the pan ku box works.

252
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,411
Jackie said
you are good with puzzles.

253
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,645
Hmm...

254
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,284
Those little lines
on the pan ku box!

255
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,919
The tri-grams?

256
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,221
Yeah, those!

257
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,623
Tell Jackie
the tri-grams
must be the key!

258
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,491
I will do that, Jade!

259
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,231
Time flies

260
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:29,067
when you're waiting
for a cell door to open.

261
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,107
Where's my camera?

262
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,609
Oh, Jade...

263
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,277
Say "chi spell."

264
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,046
Uhh!

265
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,862
The tri-grams
must be the key.

266
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,597
What could
Jade mean?

267
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,133
Shendu's tri-gram
representing "fire"

268
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,603
is a broken line
between 2 solid lines.

269
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,373
The tri-grams
could be a morse code.

270
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,575
Or the combination
to a lock.

271
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,213
If a solid line
is a half turn...

272
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:18,016
And the broken lines
are quarter turns...

273
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,622
(Sighs)

274
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,424
Um, perhaps
the unbroken lines

275
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,793
tell us
to turn it the long way?

276
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,096
Half...

277
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,231
Quarter...

278
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,432
Quarter...

279
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,700
Half...

280
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,779
Jade knows
her puzzles.

281
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,317
And I know
my demons!

282
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,386
Shendu's portal
is in Hong Kong.

283
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,861
Jackie:
Nothing yet, uncle.

284
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,730
According to
the pan ku box,

285
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:09,000
the eighth door
should lie just
beyond this tunnel.

286
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,837
Oh! It is near!

287
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,741
You have
to be kidding.

288
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,510
It is as if Jade herself
guided us here.

289
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,581
Jackie: Hong Kong
moose world.

290
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,650
Uncle: I will alert Jade.

291
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,754
Hsi wu:
Brothers and sisters,

292
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,090
I bring you
the mortal called...

293
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,458
Jade!

294
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,892
Mmm, yummy!

295
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,833
Uh...

296
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,801
If you think
you're <i> all</i>
getting out,

297
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,503
well, I hate
to break it to ya,

298
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,305
but shendu's lying.

299
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,511
Only <i> one</i> of you
can go through
the portal.

300
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,579
End of story.

301
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,014
How do <i> you</i> know?

302
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,115
Uncle told me.

303
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,282
The chi wizard?

304
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,852
So shendu
<i>did</i> deceive us.

305
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,653
There's a surprise.

306
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,255
So, uh...

307
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,290
Which one of you
is it gonna be?

308
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:09,527
Surely there must
be a simple way
to resolve this.

309
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,630
Like what,
alphabetical order?

310
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,635
Jade awaits us!

311
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,971
We must open
the portal
immediately!

312
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:23,141
Shendu:
So that is why
you wanted the box!

313
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:27,278
Well, I assure you, chan,
the only thing emerging
from my portal...

314
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,547
Will be a demon.

315
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,715
Hyah!

316
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,718
Gorilla grip!

317
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,423
Unh!

318
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,168
Jackie!

319
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,937
There is more
than one way
to skin a cat!

320
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,642
And 2 ways
to open a portal!

321
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,112
(Chanting)

322
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,853
The symbol
of the immortal
who defeated me!

323
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,655
Sword slays dragon.

324
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,990
Aah!

325
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,271
Brothers and sisters!

326
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,242
Bai tza: The portal!

327
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,277
Every demon for himself!

328
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,314
Unh!

329
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,986
Age before beauty.

330
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,322
Unh!

331
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,233
Hsi wu?

332
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,437
One goes through,
that's the rule.

333
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,906
No!

334
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,009
Uhh!

335
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,949
Uhh!
Jade!

336
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,017
Did you miss me?

337
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,286
Not at all.

338
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,754
Uncle: Jade.

339
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,192
Dai gui:
That is number eight.

340
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,195
Tso LAN:
Which would make us
fresh out of portals.

341
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,898
Hsi wu: Say, "chi spell."

342
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,233
Perhaps we should
seek a tear

343
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,336
in the time-space
continuum?

344
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,805
All 8 portals
are finally
sealed...

345
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,308
Forever!

346
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,676
Whippee!

347
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,078
He's gone! He's gone,
gone, gone!

348
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,015
I've got my body back,

349
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,550
¶ la Dee da Dee da ¶

350
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,985
¶ boom-shaka-laka-laka,
boom-shaka-laka-laka ¶

351
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,188
¶ oh, I've got
my body back ¶

352
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,760
can we, Jackie?

353
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,263
We're not really...

354
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,432
You're kind
of early, but...

355
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,101
Awww--

356
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,070
(like bullwinkle)
Welcome to moose world!

357
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,238
Hyuk!

358
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,409
Through
- the portal we go.

359
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,045
Yay!

360
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,882
It's gone.
I've got my body back!
(Cheers)

361
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,722
Hey Jackie, do you play
an instrument?

362
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,626
Yes, I do.
Harmonica,

363
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,895
when I was very,
very young...

364
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,466
And also I know
how to play...

365
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,468
Chinese guitar.

366
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,803
(Humming)

367
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,073
But now I forget.

368
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,108
But I do sing.

369
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,310
Yeah...Actually,
I'm a pretty good
singer.
