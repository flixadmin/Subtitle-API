Sulfuric acid cocktails.

More or less shoved Chernobyl

we can't hang about here

He's Ivan's problem now.

We got to get Kimiko home

You don't give a shit about Kimiko.

Or anyone else.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,435
Oh, come off it, mate.
Look, I took a fucking drug.

45
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,146
And in case you forgot,
I just saved your life.

46

You killed Gunpowder, didn't you?

47
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,321
Did you use your little laser eyes?

48
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,864
You're too fucking right, I did.

49
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:36,907
And it felt good.

50
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,535
For once, I leveled
the fucking playing field.

51
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:44,540
Butcher, the whole point of what we do,

52
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,293
the whole goddamn point,

53
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,713
is that no one should have
that kind of power.

54

Well, ain't that just fucking
fairies and dancing dildos, eh?

I accept your nomination as CEO

68

of Vought International. [chuckles]

69
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,306
You know, my mother used to say,

70
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,767
- before she died of cancer when I was 17...
- [door opens]

71
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,978
Okay, Ashley, that's enough.
Let's not bring the room down.

72
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,313
Apologies, sir. Of course.

73
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,232
Hello, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

74
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,901
Thank you so much for coming up to 99,

75
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,737

as it were. [laughing]

[forced laughter]

77
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,033
Okay.

78
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:03,536
Seeing as it's, uh,
my very first board meeting,

79
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:06,414
I thought perhaps we'd start by,
uh, going around the room

80
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,125
and giving you all a chance
to introduce yourselves.

81
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,753
Bill Marsh. And I, for one,
would like to thank you, Homelander,

82
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,589
for giving me the opportunity
to serve this board

83
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,342
at such a pivotal moment
in, uh, Vought's history.

84
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,052
- [chuckles]
- Pat Willis, sir.

85
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:23,764
You've rid us of Stan Edgar
and restored honesty, integrity

86
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:26,267
and innovation to this corporation.

87
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,476
[Maureen] One question.

88
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,771
With the changes around here,
our EBITDA margins will drop a tiny bit.

89
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,357
How do you want to handle that
on the earnings call?

90
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,366
- What's your name?
- Maureen.

91
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,953
Is there something you want
to get off your chest, Maureen?

92
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,705
Sorry, sir? Wh...

93
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,999
Do you think you know better than me?

94
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,168
I don't know.

95
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,879
Maybe you think you should be
sitting in my chair and...

96
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,465
I should be sitting
all the way down there in yours.

97
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,633
No, God, no, sir.

98
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,469
I-I'm sorry. I-I was just...

99
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,304
It was stupid of me.

100
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,724
I'm so stupid, and you're so great.

101
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,268
And... uh...

102
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,770
Maureen, you're embarrassing yourself.
You should go.

103
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,485
So who's next?

104
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:21,322
[board member] We look forward
to working hand in glove

105
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,699
- under your tremendous...
- [high-pitched ringing]

106
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,702
[distorting]
...and competent leadership, sir.

107
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,872
[Barbara] It was my honor
to lead Crime Analytics

108
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,124
for the past 13 years,

109
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,044
but all good things must come to an end,

110
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,339
and the Vought board decided
it was time for a change.

111
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:43,469
So, allow me to introduce you to the new
head of Crime Analytics:

112
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,804
the Deep.

113
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,640
[only Cassandra clapping]

114
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,433
[chuckles] Thank you, thank you.

115
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,186
Thank you for your service, Bar.

116
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,521
Let's hear it for Bar.

117
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,231
- Come on, she did great.
- [applause]

118
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,816
For someone with no practical experience,
it's amazing.

119
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,612
[sighs] Look, it's always been
a big dream of mine

120
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,239
to be able to fight crime

121
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,867
both at sea and on land.

122
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,246
I'm here to tell you

123
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,040
that if you work hard enough,

124
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,750
there's nothing you can't achieve.

125

#DreamBig.

126
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,586
Real big.

127
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,630
Because Vought will make sure
the right man...

128
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,841
Er... [scoffs] Sorry, Barbara.

129
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,135
Right person, gets the job.

130
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,096
So, to break the ice, we brought...

131
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,183
- Cupcakes. [laughs]
- [Deep] Cupcakes. [laughs]

132
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,643
- From Sprinkles.
- That's right.

133
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,771
Oh, and one more thing.
Everyone just needs to sign up for, uh,

134
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,690
performance reviews. [chuckles]

135
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,316
Just a formality, nothing to worry about.

136
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,902
[mouth full] Mmm.
You thinking of going freelance?

137
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,156
Watch her head. Let's go.

138
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,200
[Butcher] She'll be up
and about in no time.

139
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:49,493
We'll see you in the morning, yeah?

140
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,578
- [Mother's Milk] Fuck you.

Hughie, Homelander killed Alex.

Can I help you?

325
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,447
Supersonic trusted you,
and you got him killed.

326
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,493
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You fucking coward.

327
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,538
Why are you so desperate
to be with people who hate you?

328
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,129
Congrats from Lindsey Graham.

Anyway, I hope you know how much
Homelander appreciates your loyalty.

332
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,139
Now more than ever,
he needs people he can trust.

333
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,684
So, to thank you for being a team player,

334
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,228
Homelander has agreed
to a meeting with you and Blue Hawk.

335
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,938
[chuckles] Okay, great.

336
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,189
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

337
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,482
I'll just pop outside and get him.

338
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,735
What? Like, right now?

339
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:13,945
- Hi.
- Hey.

340
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,447
Thanks for coming
on such short notice, Blue Hawk.

341
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,407
Oh. A-Train.

342
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,534
[chuckles] Hey. Big fan.

343
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,245
Cool. Yeah.

344
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,540
- Blue Hawk.
- Yeah.

345
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,209
I wanted to talk to you
about your patrols in Trenton.

346
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,503
Little excessive.

347
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,673
Hmm? Says who?

348
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,134
Well, a lot of Black folks.

349
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:37,886
No.

350
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,930
No. This has nothing to do with...

351
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,559
African Americans.

352
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,686
You and me both trained
with Coach Brink at school.

353
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,022
We were taught to dominate totally.

354
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,234
Yeah, but, you're mostly just doing it
in-in Black neighborhoods.

355
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,779
And you don't want people to say
that you're being racist, right?

356
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,908
You know, it's actually racist
to call somebody racist.

357
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,744
What is this?

358
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,496
[chuckles]

359
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,374
Is this, like, a "cancel" thing?
Am I being canceled?

360
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,630
What can I do to make this right?

361
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,590
Wouldn't take much. [chuckles]

362
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,592
I don't know.
Make an apology or some shit.

363
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,345
What a great idea.
Thank you for saying that.

364
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,766
I'm sure Homelander would really,
really appreciate that, Blue Hawk.

365
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,227
Hey, name the time and place.

366
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:34,109
It is so important to do the work,
to have the difficult conversations.

367
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,569
This is so great, you guys.

All right. Go get your backpack.

you got Janine watching this guy?

- Do you understand?
- Ready.

Why? Janine loves Homelander.
He's her favorite.

focus on the job at hand.

480
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,477
Let me help you with Soldier Boy.

481

you don't got to see me no more.

Not right now, thanks. You were saying?

489
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,851
To find the guy, we'd have to comb through
every CCTV camera in the city.

490
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,562
It would take a dozen analysts
working double shifts.

491
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:27,897
Okay, then let's do it.

492
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,733
Where is everyone?

493
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,529
We are everyone.
Deep fired most of the department.

What? Why?

They had some tweets over the years
he said were critical of Homelander.

496
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,161
Said he only wants "team players."

497
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,873
Can I have that half?

498
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,083
Thank you.

00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,351
Soldier Boy's not gonna trace
this back to you. Trust me.

637
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,270
Oh, trust you.

638
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:43,856
Like I trusted him?

639
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,150
You forget what happened
last time I helped?

640
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,903
The underage hooker sting on Electroshock?

641
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,112
Oh. Oh.

642
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:53,532
You can't trust a man like that.

643
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,659
Everything and everyone
he touches turns to shit.

644
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,703
Well, you can trust me

645
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,455
to bash your fucking brains out
with that leg, mate.

646
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,706
Butcher, please.

647
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,462
Look, I'm the one you trust.

648
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,547
Now, you know what Soldier Boy
did to my family.

649
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,675
And you know
because you okayed the cover-up.

650
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,595
Shit, I... I okayed a million cover-ups.

651
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,388
And they're all tearing you up.

652
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:19,141
So just make this one right, will you?

653
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,436
[exhales]

654
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:28,150
I thought I was staring at a ghost,
but it was him.

655
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:32,363
He had a fucked-up beard, maybe,
but he hadn't aged a day.

656
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,614
[Hughie] Wait, so he doesn't get old?

657
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,699
- Like Stormfront?
- We kept that under wraps.

658
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:38,077
Though it got a little fishy
when he starred

659
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,746
in that <i>Love and War</i> picture
with Phoebe Cates.

660
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,957
He was 63. She was 19.

661
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh, fuck. Remember <i>Entrapment?</i>

662
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,628
Connery banged Zeta-Jones.
He was, like, a thousand.

663
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,338
Why was Soldier Boy here?

664
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,507
Came to pick up his super suit.

665
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,467
I held on to it.

666
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,969
You know me. I'm sentimental.

667
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:58,681
Although I did actually wear the suit once
for Kelly LeBrock.

668
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,224
By the way, her, too.

669
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,644
You don't know Kelly LeBrock?
Fucking Google it.

670
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,815
Big "L." Big "B."
The other letters, small.

671
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,650
So, did he tell you
where he was going next?

672
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,319
Or that he was gonna blow up
a fucking restaurant on 59th?

673
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,780
Who the hell knows
why talent does what they do?

674
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,031
That's why they're talent.

675
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,372
He also came for his girlfriend's address.

676
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,083
He's headed there.

677
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,168
Crimson Countess?

678
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:31,255
Why?

679
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,842
I didn't get the feeling
it was gonna be a happy reunion,

680
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,553
but I don't know.

681
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,763
Maybe you can go there and find out.

682
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,850
But mostly, get the fuck out of here.

683
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,771
<i>- Today's attack on 59th Street...</i>
- [Homelander] <i>Yeah.</i>

00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,027

a supervillain.</i> [chuckles]

689
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,285
<i>was an attempt by Stan Edgar
to discredit you.</i>

690
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,411
[chuckles] <i>Right. Yeah.</i>

anything about Stormchasers,</i>

692
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,125

why they might think that.</i>

693
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,003

00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,634

[Homelander] You think it really
was Edgar and the mayor?

707
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,949
Maybe Jake Tapper.

708
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,328
Trying to fuck with me?

709
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,497
Make me look ridiculous?

710
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,831
[TV turns off]

711
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,417
Or maybe

712
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:54,421
you're just a paranoid,
malignant narcissist

713
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:57,257
who thinks everything is about you.

714
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:01,345
Mmm, it's not paranoia
if they're really out to get you, though.

715
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,516
And you, Maeve.

716
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,645
You're out to get me, aren't you?

717
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,275
What are you talking about?

718
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,485
William Butcher.

719
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:18,821
I can smell him all over you.

720
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,157
You really will do anything
to hurt me, won't you?

721
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:25,869
So...

722
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,415
what are you and William cooking up?

723
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,583
Hmm?

724
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,420
Maybe you two brought
that supervillain to town.

725
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,088
[chuckles] Oh, John.

726
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,090
John, come on.

727
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,300
You're talking crazy.

728
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,096
- I'm not cooking anything up with Butcher.
- [chuckles]

729
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,389
Let's talk about this.

730
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,474
Don't you dare fucking "John" me.

731
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,185
You're not gonna weasel
your way out of this.

732
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,898
You know the real tragic thing
in all of this?

733
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:59,903
It's that, more than anyone,
I knew what it was like for you.

734
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:01,989
Swarmed everywhere we went.

735
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,408
Every little mistake, front-page news.

736
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,495
It is lonely at the top, yes,
but at least we had each other.

737
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,081
We were lonely together.

738
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,417
And I loved you.

739
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,211
In my own way.

740
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,841
But you...

741
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:23,677
What happened?

742
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,763
Was anything about us ever real?

743
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:28,932
Hmm?

744
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,656
From the start,

745
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,326
I hated you.

746
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,036
[chuckles softly]

747
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,415
But what's more,

748
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,960
I fucking pitied you.

749
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,466
You're completely and utterly alone.

750
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,843
You're getting old and bitter.

751
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,388
You pity me?

752
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:18,023
I mean, that's actually kind of funny,
don't you think? [chuckles]

753
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:22,694
Hey.

754
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,573
You want to know
something else that's funny?

755
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:31,370
[Maeve screams]

756

Frenchie's not answering.
Kimiko's out of commission.

00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:36,291
Soldier Boy's already got a head start.

759
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,834
We gonna need some backup.

760
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,047
And here it is.

761
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,465
[bag unzips]

762
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,259
[Mother's Milk] I thought you were out.

763
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,594
Nipped into the Duane Reade,
got some more, didn't I?

764
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:52,432
Look, I know how you feel
about this shite,

765
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,893
but it's Soldier Boy.

766
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:59,690
So why don't you come down
off your high horse just this once, eh?

767
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,739
My dad wouldn't want it.

768
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,784
Your dad, who died of a dodgy ticker,
suing Vought and never getting nowhere?

769
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,412
Yeah. Him.

770
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,871
You know, he also said,

771
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:17,207
if you don't draw the line somewhere,

772
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,835
how the hell are you gonna know
where you stand?

773
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,920
They ain't drawing no line.

774
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:23,839
Which is why we got to.

775
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:27,301
I'm in. Give me some.

776
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,344
Kid, didn't you just hear
a goddamn word I said?

777
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,472
I mean, who do you guys want?
Do you guys w-want

778
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:35,309
gawky, weak,
freaking-the-fuck-out Hughie

779
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,853
or do you want strong, confident,
handling-his-shit Hughie?

780
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,148
With it, I can actually help.

781
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,441
Without it, I'm...

782
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,319
I-I'm probably dead.

783
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,705
Lad can think for himself.

784
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,004

785
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,886
I am so sorry, Miss Barrett.

786
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,930
- What the fuck did he do to Maeve?
- That's all right, Gregory.

787
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:17,100
Maeve is at the Global Wellness Retreat
in Malibu.

788
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,561
Asking for help, it's just not easy.

789
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:23,649
And she is just truly
Brave Maeve, isn't she?

790
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,692
Mm-hmm. I want to speak to her right now.

791
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:28,195
Unfortunately, the facility
requires a digital detox

792
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,447
for their patients, but I'm sure

why you wouldn't call me for this.

949
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:20,226
Okay, okay. Look, you...
You're probably gonna be mad...

950
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,939
...but I promised
no more secrets, right? So...

951
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,610
Oh, my God.

952
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:30,778
Hughie.

953
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:32,530
Hold... One second.

954
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:34,741
- You found more V?
- It's temporary V.

955
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:37,160
It's temporary, okay? I'm not an idiot.

956
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,621
I-I know it's sketchy.
I've seen <i>Trainspotting.</i>

957
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,539
But i-it's Soldier Boy.

958
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:43,583
I mean, what else was I supposed to do?

959
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,169
- You were supposed to call me.
- Yeah, and what if you got hurt

960
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,670
trying to save me, Annie?

961
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:50,632
I would never forgive myself.
But now you don't have to, okay?

962
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:54,219
I can handle myself.
I can finally save you for once.

963
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:59,933
I don't need you to save me, Hughie.

964
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,978
I need you.

965
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,400
[Geiger counter clicking slowly]

966
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:13,154
[clicking continues faster]

967
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:30,672
[grunts]

968
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:40,056
[grunts]

969
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,767
[panting] What'd you do?

970
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:45,186
I know you're never gonna forgive me,

971
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,523
but you left me no choice.

972
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,358
Why?

973
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,611
I can't draw no line, M.

974
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,198
Not with what I got to do.

975
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:00,493
- [grunts]
- I'm sorry.

976
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:01,828
[grunting]

977
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:03,329
You'll be all right in the morning.

978
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,855
You're that asshole from the lab.

979
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,274
That's right.

980
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,151
I'm the arsehole that let you out.

981
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,611
Russian Portaloos, eh?

982
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:38,114
You want the Countess's head
on a spike, don't you?

983
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:41,868
Well, she's in there,
yours for the taking.

984
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,747
Consider it a gesture of good faith.

985
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:47,665
Good faith for what?

986
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,631
I was thinking that you and I

987
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:58,259
could come to a little arrangement.

988
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:02,722
What you lot call... a team up.

989
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,188
[Crimson Countess] Ben?

990
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:12,648
Is that really you?

991
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:19,947
You look so young.

992
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,574
You don't.

993
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,038
I'm so, so sorry.

994
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:28,539
It wasn't my idea.

995
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:30,958
God, you got to believe me. I-I...

996
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,586
How much did the Russians pay you?

997
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:37,090
Hmm?

998
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,593
They didn't.

999
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:41,803
What?

1000
00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:47,642
They didn't pay you anything?

1001
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,648
I loved you.

1002
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,276
All those years...

1003
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,821
that they burned me

1004
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,867
and that they pumped me full of poison,

1005
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:08,371
I held onto the hope that you would come.

1006
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:12,542
That you would save me.

1007
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:17,964
Because I still loved you.

1008
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,593
I didn't love you.

1009
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,680
I hated you.

1010
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,225
We all did.

1011
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:37,233
[whooshing growing louder]

1012
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,324
Annie, please, just go.
Let us handle this. You can yell at me...

1013
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:46,409
[explosion]

1014
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,099
What happened? Is he hurt?

1015
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:11,893
Keep an eye on him.

1016
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,604
He's had four or five mgs of Rohypnol.

1017
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,939
You fucking roofied him?

1018
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,776
[footsteps approaching]

1019
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,172
What are you doing?

1020
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:47,011
[Hughie] Annie, listen.

1021
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:50,223
We wanted a weapon.
Soldier Boy's our weapon.

1022
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:53,267
He's how we kill Homelander.
And Neuman maybe.

1023
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,811
If anyone's strong enough, he is.

1024
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:58,314
Y-You knew Butcher was gonna do this?

1025
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,108
MM never would've gone for it, and you...

1026
00:56:02,235 --> 00:56:04,237
- Look, you weren't supposed to be here.
- [exhales] Oh.

1027
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:08,741
So... no more secrets, huh?

1028
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,078
Hughie...

1029
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,206
you're teaming up with a murderer.

1030
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:18,292
This is the only way
that I can save you from Homelander.

1031
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:22,922
I'm doing this for you.

1032
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,424
Whatever it takes, remember?

1033
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:28,469
Come with us.

1034
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:32,723
You and me against the world.

1035
00:56:33,683 --> 00:56:34,934
[Butcher] Hughie.

1036
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,530
Please don't go.
