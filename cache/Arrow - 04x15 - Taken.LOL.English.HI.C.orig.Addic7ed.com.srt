Previously on "Arrow"...

00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:04,369
He can't know that
you're his father,

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:05,633
and nobody else can.

4
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:07,336
Samantha, there is
someone in my life now.

5
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:09,588
Please don't make me
keep this from her.

6
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:12,122
You will if you want
a relationship with my son.

7
00:00:12,124 --> 00:00:15,058
I know who Oliver Queen
cares about more than anyone.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,027
Nora, honey, there's
someone I'd like you to meet.

9
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,461
This is William.

10
00:00:18,463 --> 00:00:19,963
Curtis: It's an implantable
biostimulant.

11
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:21,331
This little piece
of technology's gonna help

12
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,732
me walk again?

13
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:24,294
After it's implanted
in your spine, yes.

14
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:27,937
[Shuddering]

15
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:29,139
I can do this.

16
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:32,609
I can do this.
I can so totally do this.

17
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:35,345
Yes, you can,
but either way,

18
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:37,480
we've got you.

19
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,716
It's no pressure
here, Miss Smoak.

20
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:42,819
Curtis' implant is the longest
of long shots.

21
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:43,987
I was expecting
a little more encouragement

22
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,355
from the husband
of the genius

23
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:46,723
who invented the thing.

24
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:48,425
My man works
miracles with technology,

25
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,327
but the human body
doesn't play by the same rules.

26
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,663
Well, here we go.

27
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:54,931
Here we go.

28
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,334
Here we go,
here we go.

29
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:00,036
Yeah. We're going.

30
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:04,340
- Ooh! Ow!
- Ohh!

31
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:07,844
Ok. It's ok. Got you,
got you, got you.

32
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:09,913
[Breathing heavily]

33
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:12,382
Well, that went nowhere.

34
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:14,250
Curtis ever tell
you how we met?

35
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:15,552
Uh-uh.

36
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:18,321
He came in with
Achilles tendonitis.

37
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:19,956
He was training
to qualify for the Olympics,

38
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,792
so all he cared
about was results.

39
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:24,127
Took me weeks just
to get him focused

40
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,795
on what really
mattered.

41
00:01:25,797 --> 00:01:28,965
How handsome
his therapist was?

42
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,033
Healing.

43
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,703
Got to be patient with yourself.

44
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:34,304
These things
take time.

45
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:45,115
Are you sure what Conklin
told you was the truth?

46
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:47,183
Conklin was dying.

47
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:49,052
He had no reason
to lie.

48
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,587
Whatever Reiter
has planned,

49
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:52,756
he's gonna kill
everyone here.

50
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,023
Reiter: Mr. Queen...

51
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:56,459
It appears we are
within striking distance

52
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,927
of my prize.

53
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:00,563
I want you both at my side
when I claim it.

54
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:01,831
I don't give a damn
about your

55
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,867
superstitious
crusade!

56
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,035
Nevertheless, you'll
both bear witness to its fruition.

57
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,241
You ok?

58
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:20,718
Me?

59
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,051
I knew you were gonna
ask me,

60
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:23,219
so I thought I'd beat
you to the punch.

61
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:26,089
Heh heh.
Are you ok?

62
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:30,160
A guy, a brilliant guy
says he can put

63
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,661
a microchip in my spine

64
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:33,530
and I will walk again.

65
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:36,366
I'm enough of a geek
to know science fiction when I see it.

66
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,768
You're still
disappointed?

67
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,638
Yeah. You know...

68
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,642
It's stupid.

69
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:47,410
Talk to me.

70
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:51,414
I wanted to be able to walk down
the aisle on our wedding day.

71
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,116
Heh.

72

[Slow clapping]

73
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:02,725
Darhk: Aw, you two just
melt my stone-cold heart.

74
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:04,394
You almost make me
believe in love again.

75
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:05,695
Nice to see you,
Mr. Queen.

76
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:07,463
How was your Christmas?

77
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,065
Son of a bi--

78
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:12,335
Ooh! Oh. You're so brave
for a political candidate

79
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:13,837

Oh. Sorry about the limo,
love the wheelchair.

Unh!

00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:22,278
We have extremely
powerful friends.

84
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,313
You do not know who
you're messing with.

85

If it makes
you happy,

the messing ends today.

87
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:30,019
I tried to bring you
into the fold, Mr. Queen,

88

I tried to kidnap
your nearest and dearest,

89
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:34,557
I tried to kill you,
but none of that took.

90
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:38,328
Well, like she said, you don't know
who you're messing with.

91
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,297
I suspect that is true,

92
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,734
but as they say--
well, or should--

93
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,803
the fourth time
is the charm.

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,141
I'll wait.

00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,684
Funny. Heh heh heh.

00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:04,921
Anyhoo, 6:00 on Friday,
you're gonna hold a press conference

100
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:07,423
and drop out
of the mayoral race.

101

Oh, that's 6 pm,
by the way.

102
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,261
I will be at home
watching you

from my brand-new
television.

on your phone?

Are you the only person

on this planet that considers
the truth complicated?

116

Just to be clear,
I don't care

117
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:58,441
that you have a child.

118

I can't believe that
you have a child

that you didn't
tell me about.

What does it say
about our relationship

if your first instinct is
to always hide the truth?

122

William's mother made
a condition

123
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:11,387
that the only way
I would be allowed

124
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,426
to meet my son is
if I agreed to keep him secret,

125
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:18,261
even from you.

126
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:19,829
Who even makes
that kind of ultimatum?

127
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,831
Just a--a mother
who's trying to protect her son,

128
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,433
and she thought that
the best thing for him

129
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,601
was to keep his world
separate from mine.

130
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:27,437
After everything
that has happened,

131
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,238
can you really say that
she was wrong?

work, did it?

us a visit.

release him

00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:43,920
if Oliver drops out
of the mayoral race.

Oliver: Let's get
in touch with Alex,

140
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,856
have him schedule
a press conference

Felicity: Yeah.
I just found out, too.

146

Apparently, the only
two people that knew

147
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,471
about William were
Oliver and Darhk.

I found out, too. Um--

um, what's our
next plan?

Barry that William's your--

what happened with the League,

and, um, Malcolm
knows, as well.

to list the people

about your son.

00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:36,973
Ahem. Samantha's here.

162
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:38,474
Who's Samantha?

163
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:40,009
It's William's mother.

164
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:48,551
Alex.

165
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:50,453
She said her name
was Samantha Clayton.

166
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:52,221
The name struck a bell from the
million-dollar check you told Thea

167
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:53,322
wasn't gonna be
a problem.

168
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:54,891
It's not gonna be
a problem.

169
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:58,694
Ok. Then why did I
just get a 911 text

170
00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:00,936
from Thea telling me
that you're pulling out of the race?

171
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:04,901
Have you heard
from William?

172
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,469
Do you know
where he is?

173
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,737
I don't, but I'm doing
everything I can.

174
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,639
Oh! I knew it.

175
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,374
I knew the second
I realized he was gone,

176
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:15,578
I knew that you had to have
some sort of involvement in this.

177
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,913
Oh, my God.
What was I thinking

178
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:18,414
letting you get
into his life?

179
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,116
Two months later,
and he's missing.

180
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,984
Samantha, I need you
to tell me exactly what happened.

181
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:23,252
No, Oliver.
You need to tell me

182
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:24,720
what the hell
is going on,

183
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:26,355
and you need to give me
my son back right now!

184
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:28,024
I am trying,
but you need to tell me

185
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:29,759
what happened, please.

186
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:35,965
I--I went upstairs to get him for dinner,
and he was gone.

187
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,000
Gone.

188
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:40,369
No--no note,
no sign of struggle.

189
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:42,205
Just vanished.

190
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:44,540
I called the CCPD, and they have been
looking everywhere,

191
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:47,110
but it's already been
48 hours,

192
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:48,678
and still nothing,

193
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,980
but then a crime scene technician
pulled me aside

194
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:53,416
and said that I needed to talk
to you about this.

195
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:54,717
Barry Allen?

196
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:57,587
Yes. That's the one.

197
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,088
Oliver, you promised.

198
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,590
- I--
- You promised me

199
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,625
that you wouldn't tell
anyone about my son.

200
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:04,327
Barry figured it--
that's not what's

201
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:05,761
important right now.

202
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:07,363
What is important is
I'm gonna do everything--

203
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:08,564
and I mean absolutely
everything in my power--

204
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:10,733
and we will get
him back!

205
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:12,101
What can--what can
you do, Oliver?

206
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,137
What can you do that
the entire police force

207
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,238
hasn't been able to do?

208
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,706
S-Samantha...

209
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:20,977
I'm the Green Arrow.

210
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:27,150
This doesn't make
any sense.

211
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,718
Oliver: Well,
like I said,

212
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,487
I'm not the person
that I used to be.

213
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:32,855
Samantha, these are
my friends.

214
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,958
They're gonna help us
find William.

215
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,628
You probably remember...

216
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,429
Laurel Lance.

217
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:43,166
I am so sorry that you're
going through this, Samantha.

218
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,535
We will help you
get William back.

219
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:47,803
Look, Laurel.

220
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,839
It was one time,

221
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:53,643
and I knew that you
and Oliver were together,

222
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:57,947
but I was young
and stupid and selfish,

223
00:08:57,949 --> 00:08:59,649
and I should have been
honest with you.

224
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:02,218
No. Oliver
should have been.

225
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:05,521
Come on.

226
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,860
Oliver: Does CCPD
have anything?

227
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:12,995
No. It was a clean grab.

228
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:14,697
Do we have any other
angles we can work,

229
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,499
other than Malcolm?

230
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,667
Finding William
isn't the problem.

231
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:19,502
Beating Damien Darhk is.

232
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:20,636
Every time we've
faced him,

233
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,271
we have been beaten
thoroughly.

234
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:23,639
That's because we can't
go against his magic.

235
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:24,640
We just need to
fight harder,

236
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:26,642
we need to fight
smarter.

237
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:27,944
You know, Oliver.
Insanity is doing

238
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,979
the same thing
over and over again

239
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:32,915
and expecting
a different result.

240
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:33,983
We need a new strategy.

241
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,084
What bout Constantine?

242
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,285
He's in Hell.

243
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:37,820
Really?
What's going on?

244
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:41,057
I mean, he's
actually literally in Hell.

245
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:42,692
Oh.

246
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:44,227
But I might know
someone else.

247
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:45,962
Her name is
Mari McCabe.

248
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:49,665
She possesses a totem which is
powered by magic.

249

She calls herself
Vixen.

250

What the hell
was that thing?

horrible circumstances.

How are you gonna
help me find my son?

00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,509
With magic.

284

Magic.

285
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,079
Yeah. It's
a long story,

286
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,081
but the short
version is that

287
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,784
this totem gives
me the ability to channel

288
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:54,287
the ashe-- or the spirit--
of any animal.

289
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,088
Do you have anything of
William's with you?

Yes, I do.
Just this.

with your father.

sat with Samantha?

Yeah. Malcolm's
coming over.

I'll go talk to him.

been a lot worse.

00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:56,074
Mari, this is not
on you.

483
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:57,609
There is still so much
that we don't know about Darhk's power.

484
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:59,010
We--we don't--
we don't even know

485
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:00,779
what the source
of it is.

486
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:04,416
Wait. I get my powers
from this necklace.

487
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:05,951
Without it, I'm just
a wannabe fashion designer

488
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:08,353
who lives at home
with her foster dad,

489
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:10,755
so up to now, everyone I've gone up
against with mystical powers

490
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:13,592
has had some sort
of totem like mine.

491
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:15,527
What if Darhk has an object
that helps him with his magic?

492
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,063
I think he does.
I walked in on him

493
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:20,065
once or twice in front
of this cabinet thing,

494
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:24,502
and inside, there's some kind of,
I don't know, idol.

495
00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:25,570
Can you draw it for me?

496
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:27,706
Yeah. I'll give
it a whirl.

497
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,874
Ok, Oliver. What if
this little art project

498
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:31,276
doesn't yield
any results?

499
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:32,577
Well--

500
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:33,612
And what if it
takes too long?

501
00:22:33,614 --> 00:22:35,213
M-Mari
and Captain Lance

502
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:38,883
are working on a way
to eventually stop Darhk.

503
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,919
Right now, I have
to save William.

504
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:48,960
What's he saying?

505
00:22:48,962 --> 00:22:50,929
Whatever it is,
it's not good.

506
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:06,144
We have to get
out of here now!

507
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:09,914
Reiter, what
are you doing?

508
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,182
Proving what I know
about you is true.

509
00:23:11,184 --> 00:23:13,318
You can't leave us
in here with it.

510
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,586
Reiter!

511
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:26,364
You.

512
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:33,271
You are worthy
to pass.

513
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:50,021
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

514
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:52,390
When I entered this race,
it was because

515
00:23:52,392 --> 00:23:55,126
no one else was willing
to step into the spotlight.

516
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:58,530
It has always been my hope
that my actions

517
00:23:58,532 --> 00:24:01,132
would inspire others.

518
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:03,034
4 months later,
and they have.

519
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,503
Knowing that,
effective immediately,

520
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:09,474
I will be suspending
my campaign

521
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:14,012
and throwing my full support
behind Ruvé Adams.

522
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:15,714
Now I would like
to take a moment

523
00:24:15,716 --> 00:24:17,415
to thank all
of my supporters

524
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:20,885
for all of your hard work.

525
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:24,889
What you've done
will not be forgotten.

526
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:26,424
Thank you.

527
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,043
New numbers are out.

528
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,445
You're leading
by 16 points.

529
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,048
Alex, I'm sorry.

530
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,351
I know that you put your heart and soul
into this campaign, and--

531
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:53,222
And your days of speech-making
are now behind you.

532
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:56,993
Look, man. I don't
want sorry.

533
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,196
I just want
an explanation.

534
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,031
That's why I'm sorry.

535
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:06,336
[Sighs]

536
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,348
Sucks when you can't
tell the truth.

537
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,484
Samantha told me
about her ultimatum.

538
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:25,321
I just figured that eventually
she'd trust me.

539
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,091
Yeah. You'd work your
Oliver Queen charm.

540
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,093
I didn't want to be
a part of William's life

541
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,696
without the opportunity
for you to be a part of his life.

542
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,832
John's made it
pretty clear that, uh,

543
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,333
I should have made
more of an effort

544
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,369
to be a part
of William's life

545
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,304
and that the best way
to keep him safe

546
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,506
would have been
to keep him close,

547
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:47,607
even with
all of this.

548
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,680
Your resignation's
all over the news.

549
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,848
Have you heard
from Darhk?

550
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,882
Not yet.

551
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,984
[Cell phone chimes,
vibrates]

552
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,654
Speak of the devil
literally.

553
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:01,324
It's not Darhk.
It's Mari.

554
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,692
She has something.

555
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,295
Mari: I e-mailed
Captain Lance's drawing

556
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:07,864
of Darhk's idol to a friend of mine
at Detroit University.

557
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,499
Thea: And did he
recognize it?

558
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,335
It's a Khushu idol,
very rare, very powerful,

559
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,303
but its power requires
a constant connection

560
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:16,672
to one of the earth's
Ley lines.

561
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:19,041
I never thought
I'd say this, but huh?

562
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:22,745
Ok. Think Wi-Fi
for magic,

563
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,181
and the idol is
his Internet connection.

564
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,417
If Professor Macalester's
theory is correct

565
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,718
and this map is accurate--

566
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,952
Then Darhk must be
holed up near one

567
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:31,687
of these Ley lines

568
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,156
in order for him to get
the strongest signal.

569
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,557
I'll start cross-referencing
all the locations

570
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,925
that we've
encountered Darhk.

571
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,360
And you pulled out
of the race.

572
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,628
Why isn't this man
giving me my son back?

573
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,596
He will, and everything
will be fine.

574
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,533
You keep saying that,
but it hasn't been yet.

575
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,180
You're doing everything you
possibly can.

576
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,048
You can't beat
yourself up about it.

577
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,451
Well, you don't know
me very well, do you?

578
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:08,224
Just before Christmas,
Darhk took Thea, Felicity, John,

579
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,692
held them captive.

580
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,728
We agreed that I would
trade myself for them.

581
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,531
I did,

582
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,235
and Darhk did not live up
to his end of the bargain.

583
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:23,306
So you're worried
that's playing itself out again now.

584
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,008
We're gonna get
William back, Oliver,

585
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,743
but when we do,

586
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:30,279
I think you should
consider that...

587
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:37,119
Maybe letting him go
isn't such a bad thing.

588
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:38,955
What do you mean?

589
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:43,926
Well, I heard what you told Felicity
about keeping him close.

590
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,795
Owl ears.

591
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,631
Uh, I never knew
my real parents.

592
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,733
I grew up
in foster home,

593
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,769
and my whole life,
I wondered,

594
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:56,405
"Who am I?
Where did I come from?

595
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,341
Why didn't my
real parents want me?"

596
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,344
A boy should know
who his father is.

597
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,146
He should,
and he will

598
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:06,349
but knowing what
William's going through right now,

599
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,651
I realize that I wasn't
ready for the answers.

600
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:12,388
Learning about
my heritage, my powers,

601
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,259
the evil my mother fled our homeland
to protect me from,

602
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,161
no child should have
to carry that burden.

603
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:20,796
I mean, look around you.

604
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,536
Oliver, the best gift
you can give him is his childhood.

605
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,471
Keep him as far away
from your world

606
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,873
for as long as possible.

607
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,642
[Sighs]

608
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:37,013
I can't imagine
a greater sacrifice.

609
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,848
Isn't that what
parenthood is?

610

[Footsteps]

611
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:44,787
Thea: Hey, guys.

612
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,389
I think we
found something.

613
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,793
Felicity: Darhk moves his idol around,
which makes sense, but--

614
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,161
John: It makes him
a whole lot harder to track.

615
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,696
Felicity: Right,
but after referencing

616

a buttload of satellite feeds,
thermal imaging data,

617
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,233
and the Ley line map,
I think dark is located

618
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,437
out on a compound
in Sky woods.

619
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,838
Hello?

620
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,241
Very good speech.
You look great on television.

621

Nelson Plaza,

622
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,678
William
will be there.

Darhk says he's gonna
release William

Laurel: There's no
guarantee with Darhk.

626
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,752
This could be
a trap.

627
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,220
And now we have a chance
to take out

he won't be able

to do this to anybody
ever again.

631

I have about my real

I was raised in a situation

713
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:18,076
where that was
my biggest issue in life.

714
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:21,846
Best things my parents
ever gave me was that freedom.

that makes me a total badass.

believe me

you put him in danger.

to protect us.

736
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:21,973
Shut up. How could
you possibly think

737
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:23,775
that there was
an us to protect?

738
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:27,078
You know, sometimes,
I lay awake at night,

739
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,148
and I wonder what Robert would think
about our relationship.

740
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,452
He raised me,
he loved me,

741
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:38,023
and I threw that all away the moment
I became your daughter.

742
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:42,193
Yes. Yes, you did,
and it was your choice.

743
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:44,262
And I wish I never did.

744
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:46,731
Don't you dare speak
to me like that.

745
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:52,470
You would be dead
10 times over if not for me.

746
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:54,639
I taught you
how to fight,

747
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:56,007
how to be strong.

748
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:58,076
I turned you from
a delicate, spoiled brat

749
00:36:58,078 --> 00:36:59,878
into a warrior,

750
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,047
and all I've ever gotten
from you in return

751
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:04,449
is your
venomous spite!

752
00:37:04,451 --> 00:37:06,384
For a very good
reason!

753
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:08,520
You have no idea
what you are up against.

754
00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:11,323
You are incapable
of seeing the bigger picture,

755
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:13,992
but I can,

756
00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:16,961
and I would rather
you hate me and be alive

757
00:37:16,963 --> 00:37:19,831
than love me
and be dead.

758
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:25,970
Hi, William.

759
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:33,745
I hope you're well,
and I hope you're safe.

760
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:37,682
There's something that I--
I want to tell you.

761
00:37:37,684 --> 00:37:40,218
I wanted to
tell you before,

762
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,653
but...

763
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:45,657
But this is better.

764
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:55,767
I'm your father
biologically, that is.

765
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:59,971
As far as really being
your father goes,

766
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:02,273
I haven't earned that yet.

767
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:06,378
A father should be there
for his child every day

768
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,847
no matter what
to make sure

769
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,751
that they feel loved,
that they feel safe,

770
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:15,587
and a child should be able
to rely on their father

771
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:22,894
and go to him for--
for guidance and reassurance.

772
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:25,296
I have failed
to do that for you...

773
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:31,803
And now I'm--I'm gonna
tell you why.

774
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:37,609
I'm the Green Arrow,

775
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:39,077
and my life is
very dangerous,

776
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:41,813
which is why...

777
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:49,421
We decided to keep you
out of it for all these years.

778
00:38:49,423 --> 00:38:52,590
What happened to you
in Star City,

779
00:38:52,592 --> 00:38:56,628
that was my fault,

780
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,599
and I can't allow anything
like that to happen ever again,

781
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:05,537
and that's why I've asked
your mother to

782
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:09,941
move you far away

783
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:14,212
and to not tell anyone
where she's taking you,

784
00:39:14,214 --> 00:39:18,750
including me.

785
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:24,656
It's also why I asked her
to wait to show you this message

786
00:39:24,658 --> 00:39:26,591
until after your 18th birthday.

787
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:35,633
I wanted to give you
a real childhood.

788
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:37,702
I wanted to give you that gift.

789
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:44,509
Good-bye, Son.

790
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:48,613
I sure hope
it's not forever.

791
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:59,924
How much of that
did you hear?

792
00:39:59,926 --> 00:40:01,259
Enough.

794
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,529
Oliver, we need
to talk.

795
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:07,799
About a number
of things, I suspect.

796
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:13,505
Let's start with...

797
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:21,212
I can't do this.

798
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:22,413
When your son
was in danger,

799
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:24,782
I had to table
what I was feeling

800
00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:26,518
about everything,

801
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,521
but now that I've
had some space,

802
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:31,723
I realize
I need space.

803
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:32,579
Felicity.

804
00:40:32,603 --> 00:40:34,460
I know the position

805
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:35,660
Samantha put you in,

806
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:37,962
I know it was
an impossible decision,

807
00:40:37,964 --> 00:40:39,864
but you were right.

808
00:40:39,866 --> 00:40:43,501
You should have
told me.

809
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:46,838
Marriage is
about inclusion.

810
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,042
It's about leaning
on your partner

811
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:53,578
when things get
complicated.

812
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:58,750
I don't think that
you know how to do that.

813
00:41:01,888 --> 00:41:04,622
I'm--I'm trying.

814
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:06,925
And now you're
sending William away,

815
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:09,594
and I understand why.

816
00:41:09,596 --> 00:41:11,229
You know that I do,

817
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:14,065
but once again, you have left me out
of the decision.

818
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,369
Felicity?

819
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:31,115
Oh, my God.

820
00:41:53,506 --> 00:41:54,939
[Door shuts]

822
00:42:20,897 --> 00:42:22,897
Greg!
Move your head.
