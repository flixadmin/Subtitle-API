3
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,314
Thank you. Hi.
I'd like to go to the Adelphi Hotel.

4
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,715
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry. This is my cab.

5
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,952
I was here first!

6
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,633
Oh, God.

7
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,872
Taxi!

8
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,711
Let's go across. Come on.

9
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,910
We'll get one down the road. Hurry.

10
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,837
For God's sake, Harold,
can we please just get a taxi?

11
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,592
I'm trying to get a... Taxi!

12
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,750
We're going the wrong way!

13
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,237
Put that away. We'll look like tourists.

14
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,355
Hi, honey.

15
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,635
We'll never get a cab.
Let's cut over to Seventh.

16
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,632
- Seventh is that way.
- I know where we are!

17
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,671
Hey, mister. Give me a dollar.

18
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,469
- Come on.
- How about it? One dollar.

19
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,509
Are you deaf? You don't speak English?

20
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,592
Come on! Up here.

21
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,633
Hey, lady...

22
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,029
do the kid a favor. Don't scream.

23
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,032
Hey, all right.

26
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,032
Get out of here.

27
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,156
Let's beat it, man. I don't like it up here.

28
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,231
What, are you scared of heights?

29
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,638
I don't know.
After what happened to Johnny Gobs...

30
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,952
Look, man, Johnny Gobs got ripped
and took a walk off a roof. No big loss.

31
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,713
No, man, that ain't what I heard at all.

32
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,591
I heard that the Bat got him.

33
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,558
The Bat? Give me a break, will you?

34
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,395
Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.

35
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,917
No shit. It was all over the pavement.

36
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,437
- I'm getting out of here, man.
- Shut up, man. Listen to me.

37
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,715
There ain't no Bat.

38
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,157
You shouldn't have turned the gun
on that kid.

39
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,990
You want your cut of this money or not?
Now shut up! Shut up.

40
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,954
Don't kill me! Don't kill me, man!

41
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,471
Don't kill me!

42
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,240
I'm not going to kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.

43
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,276
I want you to tell
all your friends about me.

44
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,509
What are you?

45
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,114
I'm Batman.

<i>Across this nation...</i>

47
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,748
<i>the words "Gotham City"</i>
<i>are synonymous with crime.</i>

48
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,029

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,149
They'd be happier someplace else.

66
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,870
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

67
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,112
Don't worry about it.

68
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,078
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.

69
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,430
If Grissom knew about us...

70
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,150
he might hand you something.

71
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,435
Don't flatter yourself, angel.

72
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,271
He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.

73
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,672
And besides...

74
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,512
he doesn't know.

75
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,399
You don't worry about anything,
do you, Jack?

76
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,393
You look fine.

77
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,393
I didn't ask.

78
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,032
Yeah. Hanging on.

79
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,718
No. Let me guess.

80
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,232
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.

81
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,114
That's it. What are they seeing up there?

82
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,312
They're drinking Drano.

83
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,839
It's a little weird, Lieutenant.

84
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,353
Thanks for the tip.

85
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,758
Christ. Knox.

86
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,912
Hello, It. Eckhardt,
I hear we just had us another Bat attack.

87
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,673
That's what, eight sightings now
in just under a month?

88
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,990
I hear the Commissioner's
even opened a file. True?

89
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,277
Sorry, Knox.
These two slipped on a banana peel.

90
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,558
I'm telling you, man, a giant bat!

91
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,113
Don't be writing this stuff
in the newspaper, Knox.

92
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,395
It'll ruin your already useless reputation.

93
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,392
Lieutenant, every punk in this town
is scared stiff.

94
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,398
Do you know what they say?
They say he can't be killed.

95
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,391
They say he drinks blood.

96
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,637
- They say...
- I say you're full of shit, Knox.

97
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,712
You can quote me on that.

98
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,752
Is there a 6-foot bat in Gotham City?

99
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,035
And if so, is he on the police payroll?

100
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,157
And if so, what's he pulling down,
after taxes?

101
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,909
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.

102
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,594
- Why don't you broadcast it?
- Shut up and listen.

103
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,749
Harvey Dent has been sniffing around
one of our front companies.

104
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,992
That's my territory.
If there's a problem, I deal with it.

105
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,200
Your problems are our problems.

106
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,510
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.

107
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,758
Why, Eckhardt,
you ought to think about the future.

108
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,432
You mean when you run the show?
You ain't got no future, Jack.

109
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,751
You're an A-1 nut-boy,
and Grissom knows it.

110
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,108
Better be sure.

111
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,595
See?

112
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,118
You can make a good decision
when you try.

113
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,108
Where you been spending your nights?

114
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,117
I don't care how deeply in debt
this festival is, I want a parade.

115
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,509
I want hot dogs, balloons,
the whole schmeer.

116
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,229
We're gonna celebrate this
200th anniversary proudly and publicly.

117
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,356
We may be celebrating
in bankruptcy court.

118
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,671
This festival's $250,000 in the red
and we haven't seen one balloon.

119
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,196
You fill this square with people,
and the businesses will come back here.

120
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,192
I think a lot of people might stay away,
Mayor. They're scared.

121
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,317
They won't be scared
when you get Grissom in that courthouse.

122
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,675
I promised that, remember?

123
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,868
Welcome, Count Dracula.

124
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,475
- Had any sightings of Bigfoot lately?
- Hey, Knox...

125
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,075
- they buried your story on the Batman.
- That's what they do to garbage.

126
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,230
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff, guys.

127
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,515
Hey, Knox. I got something for you.

128
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,069
Very funny. You should have a little bit
more gore under the fangs, though.

129
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,472
What a dick.

130
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,472
Hello, legs.

131
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,552
I'm reading your stuff.

132
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,557
Well, I'm reading yours.

133
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,793
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

134
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,952
Yeah, photographer. <i>Vogue, Cosmo.</i> Yeah.

135
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,510
Listen, if you want me to pose nude,
you're gonna need a long lens.

136
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,830
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.

137
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,869
A girl could get hurt doing this stuff.

138
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,991
So, what brings you here?

139
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,198
I'm here to see some of the wildlife
in Gotham City.

140
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,669
Wildlife? Like what?

141
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,350
Like... bats.

142
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,594
- Who sent you?
- Nobody, really.

143
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,750
I just loved your story, and...

144
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,311
I like bats.

145
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,189
Yeah?

146
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,509
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.

147
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,990
Okay, you're a visionary.
You're also the only one who believes me.

148
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,877
I need something tangible.

149
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,396
Gordon's got a file on this.
I can't even get him on the phone.

150
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,676
Bruce Wayne's benefit.
He'll be there, right?

151
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,196
Yeah. I don't seem to be
on the guest list. No.

152
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,798
Yes. Vale, will you marry me?

153
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,030
- No.
- Will you buy me lunch?

154
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,997
- Maybe.
- I eat light.

155
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,272
Say this...

156
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,432
son of a bitch...

157
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,515
makes a connection with us
and with Axis Chemicals.

158
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,556
What kind of damage are we looking at?

159
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,155
If he ties us in with Axis Chemicals,
we're dead and buried.

160
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,470
We should move immediately.

161
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,229
I say we break into the place...

162
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,152
trash the office...

163
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,794
and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.

164
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,869
Jack.

165
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,238
Smart thinking. That's the way to go.
In fact...

166
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,677
I'd like you to handle
this operation personally.

167
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,635
Me?

168
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,189
Hello, sweetheart.

169
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,033
I wonder if you'd mind
waiting in the next room?

170
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,678
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.

171
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,719
Carl...

172
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,150
can we get somebody else to do this?

173
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,189
The fumes in that place...

174
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,389
Jack.

175
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,678
It's an important job.

176
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,399
I need someone I can trust.

177
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,437
You are my number one guy.

178
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,114
Now...

179
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,992
don't forget...

180
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,992
your lucky deck.

181
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,472
My friend...

182
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,839
your luck is about to change.

183
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,033
<i>Police Department.</i>

184
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,590
Get me It. Eckhardt.

185
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,713
Can I help you, sir?

186
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,232
Thanks. Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.

187
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,159
Here you go.

188
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,709
- Good evening, ma'am.
- A little crowded.

189
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,236
Excuse me.

190
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,158
Could you tell me
which of these guys is Bruce Wayne?

191
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,119
I'm not sure.

192
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,954
Thanks anyway.

193
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,794
Oh, certainly.

194
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,349
Eight. I can make that eight.

195
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,149
- I can make that eight.
- Place your bets, please.

196
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,356
Commissioner!
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.

197
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,238
How about that rumor that
Commissioner's got a file on the Batman?

198
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,389
That's not true, is it?

199
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,277
Knox, for the ninth time, there is no Bat.

200
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,237
If there were,
we would find and arrest him.

201
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,754
Would you confirm him?
Be straight with me, Commissioner.

202
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,717
- How you making out?
- Not good at all.

203
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,756
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.

204
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,469
We were discussing the pros and cons
of winged vigilantes. What's your stand?

205
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,994
Mr. Knox, we have enough problems
in this city...

206
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,594
without worrying about
ghosts and goblins.

207
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,069
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.

208
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,991
Excuse me, dear. I'll be back.

209
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,877
Isn't anybody going to go on record?

210
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,793
- Your Honor, great suit.
- No comment.

211
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,754
- Robert, what's up?
- Anonymous tip.

212
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,195
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

213
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,469
Why wasn't I told about this?
Who's in charge?

214
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,869
- Eckhardt, sir.
- Oh, my God!

215
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,473
Come on, let's go.

216
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,553
KNOX: Commissioner Gordon?

217
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,512
Commissioner Gordon?

218
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,157
Wait, wait.
Living room, dining room, arsenal.

219
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,752
Look at this stuff.

220
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,991
Who is this guy?

221
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,792
He gives to all these humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.

222
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,079
He probably does it to get chicks.
They like him for his big charity balls.

223
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,038
Don't leave out his very large bankroll.

224
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,793
Now, remember, the more they've got,
the less they're worth.

225
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,077
Then this guy must be
the most worthless guy in America.

226
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,438
Check this out. He must have been
King of the Wicker People.

227
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,153
Where'd this come from?

228
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,958
I have no idea.

229
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,793
It's Japanese.

230
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,474
How do you know?

231
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,317
Because I bought it in Japan.

232
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,548
- Who are you?
- Sorry. Bruce Wayne.

233
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,514
Alexander Knox.

234
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,110
I read your work. I like it a lot.

235
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,078
Thanks. Can I have a grant?

236
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,957
- Vicki Vale.
- Hi.

237
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,837
- Bruce Wayne.
- Are you sure?

238
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,079
Yeah, this time.

239
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,073
I've seen your photographs
from Corto Maltese, haven't I?

240
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,229
Right.

241
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,038
You've got a wonderful eye.

242
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,031
Some people think she has two.

243
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,469
This is an amazing house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime if you...

244
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,950
We need to open a few more cases of
the champagne. Will that be all right?

245
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,632
Sure. Go ahead.

246
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,240
Open, what, six? Six?

247
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,271
- Six is good.
- Okay.

248
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,758
That's great, six, thanks.

249
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,550
Anyway, you gonna be staying
in Gotham for a while?

250
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,872
I'd love to. I'm intrigued by
Alex's giant bat stories.

251
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,828
Oh, right. The Batman.

252
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,237
That's a little bit light after the war
in Corto Maltese, isn't it?

253
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,470
- What do you do for a living?
- Well, I'm involved...

254
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,950
Sir, Commissioner Gordon
was compelled to leave.

255
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,075
Okay, thank you.

256
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,390
Very unexpectedly, sir.

257
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,678
Will you two excuse me?

258
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,440
I think perhaps this way, sir.

259
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,389
Alfred, they need some more wine
in the front room...

260
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,392
and someone named Mrs. Daley
needs a copy of the menu.

261
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,040
And give Knox a grant.

262
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,871
Nice talking with you, Wayne.

263
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,474
The rich...

264
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,951
You know why they're so odd?
Because they can afford to be.

265
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,673
Look at this mirror.

266
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,671
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.

267
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,519
<i>- Robert, what's up?</i>

ECKHARDT: All right. Take a good look.
This is the guy.

274
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,438
All right, get a good look.

275
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,880
Shoot to kill. You know what I mean?

276
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,992
All right, let's move out.

277
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,070
We've been ratted out here, boys.

278
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,355
Watch it.

279
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,555
Freeze!

280
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,113
You, left. You take the right. Move it.

281
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,632
What the hell's going on?

282
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,472
What are you trying to do?
Blow the collar?

283
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm in charge here, not Carl Grissom.

284
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,314
<i>This is Commissioner Gordon.</i>
<i>I want him taken alive.</i>

285
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,111
<i>I repeat. Any man who opens fire</i>
<i>on Jack Napier will answer to me.</i>

286
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,393
Let me down!

287
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,838
Let me down!

288
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,316
Oh, my God!

289
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,831
He went that way!

290
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,829
See if you can get up on the catwalk
on that side.

291
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,639
You take that side. Be careful.
Be very careful.

292
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,955
Jesus!

293
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,878
Let him go, or I'll do Gordon!

294
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,789
Nice outfit.

295
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,071
Come on, Jack, let's go!

296
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,914
Come on!

297
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,115
Come on, Jack.

298
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,113
Eckhardt!

299
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,917
Think about the future.

300
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,550
God damn it, we had him.

301
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,271
Hold it right there!

302
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,200
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.

303
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,680
Until we find out, keep a lid on it.

304
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,037
Wait. If there's no Bat, then who dropped
this guy, Napier, into the acid?

305
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,112
Suicide? Wait, I want to get this on tape.

306
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,795
Hello?

307
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,917
He hung up. What have you got?

308
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,430
Here's the inner city,
there's Axis Chemicals...

309
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,919
and here's the sightings so far.

310
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,560
Maybe Batman has
some kind of flight pattern or something.

311
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,675
That's all I can think of.

312
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,352
This is very good. I'll tell you what...

313
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,238
tonight, first I'll take you to dinner,
then we'll walk the trail.

314
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,788
No can do. I got a date. With Bruce Wayne.

315
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,677
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!

316
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,991
The guy's a stiff. He's a rich stiff,

Hold it!

646
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,917
I kind of like this one, Bob. Leave it.

647
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,315
You can take that off now, I think.

648
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,996
You're beautiful
in an old-fashioned kind of way.

649
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,676
But I'm sure we can make you more today.

650
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,878
Is that your portfolio?

651

Crap.

Now that's good work.

The skulls, the bodies.

01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,878
You give it such a glow.
I don't know if it's art, but I like it.

657
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,719
Let me tell you
what I'm thinking about, sweetie.

658
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,711
I was in the bath one day...

659
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,952
when I realized
why I was destined for greatness.

660
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,357
You know how concerned people are
about appearances.

661

This is attractive, that is not.

662
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,552
That is all behind me.
I now do what other people only dream.

Do I look like I'm joking?

Listen.

We mustn't compare ourselves
to regular people. We're artists.

For instance, let me challenge you
with a little piece I did.

Bob. Alicia.

You will take pictures

Why is she wearing a mask?

She's just a sketch, really.

681
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,796
Alicia, sit down.
Show the lady why you wear the mask.

682

You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's been
made over in line with my new philosophy.

So now, like me...

I'm no Picasso, but do you like it?

01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,388
It's great.

So, what can I do for you?

688
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,118
A little song, a little dance.
