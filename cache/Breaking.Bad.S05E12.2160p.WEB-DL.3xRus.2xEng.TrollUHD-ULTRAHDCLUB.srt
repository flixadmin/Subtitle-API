1
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,526
Jesse?

2
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,030
Jesse!

3
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,368
Show yourself right now!

4
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,899
I'll be in touch.

5
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,485
{\an8}Okay. Hey, Huell.

6
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,739
{\an8}Listen, I want you to swing by
the high school on your way to Saul's.

7
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,909
{\an8}I can't believe he would
go after my son, but...

8
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,995
{\an8}- You got it.
- And Kuby's at the car wash, right?

9
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:49,290
{\an8}Parked right across the street.
All's quiet. No Pinkman.

10
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,417
Okay. Just find him.

11
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:11,646
{\an8}<i>Please leave a message.</i>

12
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,982
Jesse, listen.

13
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:18,236
{\an8}I mean, obviously,
you've changed your mind here,

14
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:21,239
{\an8}and so thank you for that.

15
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,866
And I know you're angry.

16
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,410
I wanna fix this, okay?

17
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,121
Whatever it takes, all right?

18
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,083
{\an8}We'll talk, and we will fix this.

19
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,419
{\an8}Until then, just...

20
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:39,215
Just sleep it off, okay?

21
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,884
And then call me.

22
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,636
Be safe.

23
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:47,765
How's it coming?

24
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:50,058
I replaced the doorjamb
and the striker plate.

25
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,352
- Switch this out, we'll be good to go.
- Good.

26
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,938
Do you want separate keys
for the different locks,

27
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,776
- or do you want one working both?
- No, no, no. No re-key.

28
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,195
Same exact keys as before.

29
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,947
Usually with a break-in,
people like to get new keys.

30
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,950
No, same keys, same locks.

31
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,077
The old keys have to work here, okay?

32
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,996
- Okay.
- All right.

33
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:16,919
{\an8}Good.

34
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,424
{\an8}Good. Good, good, good.

35
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,848
{\an8}Oh, no, no. Hey, guys, guys, guys.

36
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,602
{\an8}- Cut that. Yeah, this...
- That area's still pretty bad.

37
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,010
{\an8}Right. We'll have to go over this
a lot more.

38
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,856
We've made three passes already.

39
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,564
Like I say, gasoline's tricky.

40
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,485
No, no, no. The smell has got
to be gone completely.

41
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:45,197
{\an8}My wife is coming home,
and I can't have any odor, any stain

42
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,576
{\an8}any sign that anything happened here.

43
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,244
{\an8}Understand?

44
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:55,791
{\an8}I... I know. This is short notice,
and I really appreciate it.

45
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,377
Sir, we'd love to take
more of your money,

46
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,236
but you've got gas soaked
through to your subfloor.

47
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,342
Until you pull this up
and get new carpet, new padding

48
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,761
this is as good as it gets.

49
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,483
{\an8}Is that gasoline?

50
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,694
- Ask Dad.
- Hey. Over here.

51
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,740
- What happened?
- What happened is that

52
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,242
{\an8}I should sue someone.
That's what happened.

53
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,996
{\an8}So I'm on my way to the drugstore,
and I have to stop to get some gas,

54
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,041
{\an8}and there is this total pump malfunction.

55
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,449
You know what?
She shouldn't be in this room.

56
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,385
I mean, this is supposedly green,
but you know how it is.

57
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,938
{\an8}You can close the windows in the nursery

58
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,718
{\an8}because it's really only out here.

59
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,055
{\an8}This is as good as it gets.

60
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,653
So...

61
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,823
pump malfunction?

62
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:17,523
Yeah. I'm standing there filling up
like I've done a thousand times,

63
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,580
and I hear a chunk.
You know, the pump's nozzle.

64
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,833
The metal thing.
The thing you squeeze?

65
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:28,254
I hear a chunk.
So I suppose, in my naivetÃ©

66
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:32,062
I took to understand that gas is
no longer coming out of the nozzle,

67
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:35,219
so I pull out the hose to put it back
and whoosh!

68
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,930
Yeah, I am suddenly soaked in gasoline.

69
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,351
I mean, on my arms
and my legs and my groin.

70
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:47,815
So now I am in a panic.
I race home, I run inside the house,

71
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,623
and I'm stripping off
my clothes as fast as I can.

72
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,784
I jump in the shower.

73
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,286
It's not until
after I get out of the shower

74
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:57,700
that I realize my gas-covered clothes

75
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:02,538
have been soaking
in the living room rug this entire time.

76
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:06,208
I mean, it's... It's...
The whole thing is just so stupid.

77
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,627
I could have rinsed off at the station.

78
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,686
Halfway home, I started to realize

79
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,425
wait a minute, there's a water hose
right there next to the air pump.

80
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,801
You know, for tires.

81
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,928
Anyway, so that was my day.

82
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:20,306
How was yours?

83
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,809
- Dad?
- Yeah.

84
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:28,105
Please, can you just tell the truth?

85
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,652
Tell... What do you mean?

86
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,655
You fainted, didn't you?

87
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,617
Because you're sick again?

88
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,203
You were pumping gas, and the fumes

89
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,663
they made you pass out again.

90
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,041
Just... Just admit it.

91
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,376
No, the... No.

92
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,128
It was the pump.

93
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,760
All right, I...

94
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,764
Maybe I did get a little
swimmy at one point,

95
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,058
but I did not faint. Okay?

96
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,602
I'm fine, and that's the truth.

97
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,565
However, in the best interest
of all of our continued good health

98
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,692
I don't think we can stay here.

99
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,612
- I mean, not until we get new carpet.
- Yeah.

100
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,825
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie,
they got plenty of space.

101
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,327
Hey, what about a hotel?

102
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,038
A hotel. That could be sweet.

103
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,790
A good one.

104
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,292
I like the way you're thinking. Yes.

105
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,294
Could be a little family vacation.

106
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,046
Might be fun. What do you say?

107
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:36,214
Why don't you put some clothes together.

108
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,550
Yeah. All right.

109
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,681
I'm sorry. It's not my finest hour.

110
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,392
I'll go pack a bag.

111
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

112
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,399
Think this'll leave a scar?

113
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:01,407
I never should have let
my dojo membership run out.

114
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,664
Jesus. Jesse did that?

115
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,543
Yeah, but you gotta understand,
deep down he loves me.

116
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,005
So where is he?

117
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:19,049
- Still looking.
- Where have you looked?

118
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:23,554
His place, his folk's place,
this Brock kid's place.

119
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:28,434
Crack shacks at Siesta Hills,
the Indigo, the Crystal Palace

120
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,437
go-kart joint on Copper Ave

121
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,105
AA meeting off the 40.

122
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:35,733
His buddies, Beaver and what's-his-name?

123
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,944
Badger and Skinny Pete.
Yeah, no, he's not with them.

124
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,820
They could be covering for him.

125
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,430
I posed as a meter reader. I put a bug
on the tall kid's mom's place.

126
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:48,828
For three hours straight, all he talked
about was something called <i>Babylon 5.</i>

127
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,748
I checked with my gal at A.P.D.

128
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,848
Pinkman's not in their system,

129
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,834
- so the cops don't have him.
- Yet.

130
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,344
Maybe he changed his mind about leaving

131
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,756
called your guy back.

132
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,634
Somebody misses their first chance
with my guy, there's no second.

133
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,596
Well, keep looking.

134
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,431
What then?

135
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,600
What do you mean?

136
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,558
I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny.

137
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,235
Sooner or later, he'll turn up.

138
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:16,856
I'm wondering what you wanna do
when he does.

139
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,026
Jesse is upset about the boy.

140
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,780
I just need to explain to him
why that had to happen.

141
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:29,411
Okay, but say, you know,
just for the sake of argument

142
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,664
the kid's not in the mood
for a nuanced discussion

143
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,792
of the virtues of child poisoning.

144
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,128
His plans are running more towards
stabbing you to death

145
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:42,007
with a pointed stick.
In that scenario, then what?

146
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,718
You have a suggestion?

147
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:51,100
We were wondering if maybe this isn't
an Old Yeller type situation.

148
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:53,769
Old Yeller?

149
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,232
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best,
most loyal dog there ever was.

150
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,359
I mean, everybody loved that mutt,

151
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,195
but one day he showed up rabid,

152
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:07,199
and little Timmy,
for Old Yeller's own sake

153
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,159
had to...

154
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,787
Oh, you... You saw the movie.

155
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:17,584
You're full of colorful metaphors,
aren't you, Saul?

156
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,795
Belize, Old Yeller...

157
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,755
Just brimming with advice.

158
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,806
Do not float that idea again.

159
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,185
Find him.

160
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:51,577
Sorry. Sorry.

161
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,985
Room key wouldn't
let me into the ice room,

162
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,332
so I had to go down to the front desk.

163
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,334
But here we are.

164
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,336
Checked in on Junior.

165
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,007
Pay-per-view and room service.
He's in heaven.

166
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,303
Hey, I thought you
were gonna take a bath.

167
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,722
How's Saul doing?

168
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:16,268
Saul? Goodman?

169
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,149
- No idea.
- No?

170
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,408
You were just out talking to him
in the parking lot.

171
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:31,533
I'm sorry. Were you spying on me?

172
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,994
Yes.

173
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,955
And I feel just awful about it too.

174
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,790
You know, I played along

175
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,999
with your pump malfunction bullshit

176
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,326
because Junior was standing right there,

177
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:47,549
but now I would like to know
what's going on.

178
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,724
First of all, it's no big deal.

179
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:59,061
Coming here is just me
being overly cautious.

180
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,110
Jesse Pinkman, you know?

181
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,449
He came over to our house
that time for dinner, remember?

182
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:17,496
Well, he... He got upset over this...

183
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,124
Something he thinks I did.

184
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,293
I did do it.

185
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:27,422
But I did it for very good reasons.
And it's just... It's complicated.

186
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,716
Wait, are you...?

187
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,512
Are you telling me that he tried to

188
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,639
burn our house down?

189
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,934
That was

190
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,438
probably, for a brief moment,
his intention,

191
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,358
but, obviously, he changed his mind.

192
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,903
And how does that work?

193
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,698
Him...? Him changing his mind?

194
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,033
God.

195
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,995
Look...

196
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,333
You've got to understand that with Jesse

197
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:09,172
there are emotional issues,
personal issues, some drug abuse.

198
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:13,427
But he has always been more
of a danger to himself than anyone else.

199
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,433
He has a tendency
to fly off the handle, that's all.

200
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:23,687
So he has never hurt anybody?

201
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,400
No.

202
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,071
I can't believe you got her down so fast.

203
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,163
So

204
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,208
What's your course of action here?

205
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:52,424
Saul's guy, Kuby, tracks him down,
which shouldn't take long,

206
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,218
and when he does, I'm gonna...

207
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,722
I'm gonna talk to him.

208
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,433
Make him see reason.

209
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,602
Talk to him?

210
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,647
Make him see reason?

211
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,486
So I'm clear

212
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,615
these are just euphemisms

213
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,950
you're using here, right?

214
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,786
No.

215
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,205
What?

216
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,916
Wh...? What does that mean?

217
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:30,420
My God.
I knew this was going to happen.

218
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,340
I knew it. I told you that someday

219
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:36,498
someone was going to come
to our door and try to hurt us.

220
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:37,928
And now here we are.

221
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,221
No.

222
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,682
Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone.

223
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,102
He poured gasoline
all over our house, Walt.

224
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,646
He tried to set our house on fire.

225
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,054
He changed his mind.
He didn't do it, did he?

226
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,150
What if he changes it back?

227
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:58,073
Walt, you need

228
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,866
to deal with this.

229
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,619
How much have you had to drink?

230
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,329
Not nearly enough.

231
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,331
I don't know how we got off

232
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,876
on whatever it is
we're talking about here,

233
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:14,130
but, clearly, I haven't explained
the situation well enough

234
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,133
because this is a big overreaction.

235
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:20,011
We all need to just take a deep breath
and calm down

236
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,098
because Jesse isn't just some...

237
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:26,393
Some... Some rabid dog.

238
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:31,273
- This is a person.
- A person that is a threat to us.

239
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:36,903
I mean, my God, where we are now
with Hank and Marie,

240
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,239
and that awful tape we made.

241
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,825
After everything we've done

242
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,453
you can't just talk to this person.

243
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,330
You're saying

244
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,876
that I just...

245
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:56,423
What...? What exactly are you saying?

246
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,885
We've come this far.

247
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,346
For us.

248
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,059
What's one more?

249
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,571
Jesse!

250
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,324
Stop what you're doing
and turn and face me!

251
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,786
You wanna...?
You wanna know what he did?

252
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,195
You wanna hear about it?

253
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,999
Jesse, put out the lighter.

254
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,044
He poisoned a little kid.

255
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,004
An 8-year-old boy.

256
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,214
Just because, you know...

257
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,924
Just as a move!

258
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,594
Walt's a bastard. Secret's out.

259
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:25,845
We'll talk about it.

260
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,973
But I need you to put out
the lighter, okay?

261
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,851
Look, Jesse...

262
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,479
Jesse, I don't wanna kill you.

263
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,065
And you don't wanna be killed.

264
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,149
So put it out.

265
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,948
He can't keep getting away with it!

266
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,201
He can't keep getting away with it!

267
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,496
He won't.

268
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,376
You really wanna burn him down?

269
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,713
Let's do it together.

270
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,852
You were following me?

271
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,022
Yeah. Since Goodman's.

272
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,776
Where we going now?

273
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,904
DEA. Downtown.

274
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,534
What, I'm, like, arrested?

275
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,036
Yeah, you know how this works.

276
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,289
Be a good witness for me

277
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,291
it'll go better for you.

278
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,961
Yeah, sitting around MDC

279
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,370
waiting to be a witness
against Mr. White.

280
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,007
It's...

281
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,135
It's gonna go great for me.

282
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,937
So

283
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,482
You're angry.

284
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,195
I can't sleep. I'm not eating.

285
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:53,283
Last night, I was online for six hours
looking up untraceable poisons.

286
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,244
This close family friend

287
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,872
had been keeping a secret
from you and Hank,

288
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:01,918
and somehow this person's secret
became known,

289
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:05,838
and now you're sad and hurt and angry.

290
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,885
I'm...? I'm in the ballpark?

291
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,723
To be this wrong about someone.

292
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,809
This off.

293
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,062
We all lead double lives
to some extent, don't we?

294
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,273
- We all have our secrets.
- Yeah. Not like this.

295
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,277
Not like him.

296
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:34,283
Marie, I think it's time you filled me in
on some more details here.

297
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,452
Who and what are we talking about?

298
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,412
I said I can't do that.

299
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,790
It'd be bad for Hank.

300
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,418
Our friend made that clear
in his little movie.

301
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,841
Those kids...

302
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,720
under his roof. That baby.

303
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,141
I'm sick just thinking about it.

304
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,602
How could I have not seen this?

305
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,482
If I weren't being such a

306
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,736
idiotic... Stupid idiot, I could've...

307
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,947
We could have...

308
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,120
Blackjack winnings.

309
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,081
Nothing suspicious about that at all.

310
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,500
Tell me about this movie.

311
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,837
Dave, can we simply

312
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,256
just focus on my feelings here?

313
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:35,094
The details don't really matter, do they?
There's nothing to be done, okay?

314
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,179
He screwed us and he won.

315
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,765
Can we just...?

316
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,726
Can we talk about something else, please?

317
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,520
Yes?

318
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,441
How's work?

319
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,528
Last week, you were upset
about the new parking rules.

320
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,368
Marie?

321
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,247
Saxitoxin.

322
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:05,917
Derived from shellfish.

323
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:10,463
Produces a flaccid paralysis
that leaves the victim conscious

324
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,466
through a progression of symptoms.

325
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,324
Death occurs from respiratory failure.

326
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,138
That is definitely a contender.

327
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,557
Marie

328
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:24,936
you're not ready to fill me in here

329
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,812
that's fine.

330
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,398
But I want you to listen.

331
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,653
There is no problem,
no matter how difficult,

332
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,781
or painful or seemingly unsolvable

333
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,950
that violence won't make worse.

334
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,994
I know, I...

335
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,720
Don't worry. I wouldn't hurt anybody.

336
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,499
I just...

337
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:54,423
It just feels good to think about it.

338
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,809
- Hey, babe.
- What's the story here?

339
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,936
Oh, well, something's come up.

340
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:10,294
I thought you might wanna
get out of the house for a day or two.

341
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,983
You thought I'd pack up
and move out of my own house.

342
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,402
Why? What's going on?

343
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,702
Look, I don't wanna get into it now.

344
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,112
But you know that thing with Walt,
there's...

345
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,491
There's been a development.

346
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:24,620
- What happened? Are you in danger?
- No, no, no, not at all.

347
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,622
Just... It's a fluid situation.

348
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,625
I think it might go a little smoother
if you're not here.

349
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,752
So I...
It's gonna be great, you know?

350
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:34,338
I booked you a spa package at La Posada.

351
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:38,467
- You can do that river-stones thing.
- Hank, what the hell is going on?

352
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,054
Hank?

353
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,348
We have a guest.

354
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:56,694
He was a little keyed up.
Gave him a couple sleeping pills.

355
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,662
Okay. Okay, so listen.

356
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,071
I bring that kid in,
put him in the system

357
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,898
Walt's gonna find out
five minutes later. You know?

358
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,151
My last 10 witnesses
died in jail, remember?

359
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,298
And I can't use a DEA safe house
without writing him up.

360
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,091
I can't risk a motel.

361
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,886
I know it sounds crazy,
but this is the best place.

362
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,346
For now. Just a day or two, tops...

363
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,724
Okay, just answer me this one question:

364
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,809
Is this bad for Walt?

365
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,478
Yeah. Very.

366
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,440
Good. I'm staying.

367
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,609
I'll heat up lasagna.

368
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,277
Phone's ringing.

369
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,503
<i>You have one new message.</i>

370
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,966
<i>Jesse, listen.</i>

371
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:05,471
<i>I mean, obviously,
you've changed your mind here,</i>

372
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,431
<i>and so thank you for that.</i>

373
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,683
<i>And I know you're angry.</i>

374
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,812
<i>I wanna fix this, okay?</i>

375
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,481
<i>Whatever it takes, all right?</i>

376
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,733
<i>We'll talk, and we will fix this.</i>

377
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,654
<i>Until then, just...</i>

378
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,366
<i>Just sleep it off, okay?</i>

379
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,368
<i>And then call me.</i>

380
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,954
<i>Be safe.</i>

381
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,440
Hey.

382
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,526
Hey.

383
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,736
What are you still doing up?

384
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,238
Couldn't sleep.

385
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,950
You and me both. Here. Have a seat.

386
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:17,293
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yeah.

387
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,546
Just business stuff.

388
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,049
Going over some options.

389
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:27,511
You guys still think
you might buy another car wash?

390
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,684
Yeah. Well, maybe.

391
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,519
See how it goes.

392
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,313
How it goes now that...

393
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,816
Now that you're...
You're sick again, right?

394
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:44,236
No. That's not what I mean.

395
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:47,031
Hey. Told you not to worry, remember?

396
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,658
How...? How can I not worry?

397
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,661
Come on.
You think I came all this way

398
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,333
just to let something as silly
as lung cancer take me down?

399
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,044
Not a chance.

400
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,422
I'm not going anywhere.

401
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,306
Should've brought our suits, huh?

402
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,901
It's okay.

403
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,278
It's all right.

404
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,455
I'll be up in a minute.

405
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,123
Okay.

406
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,044
- See you in the morning.
- Okay.

407
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,747
Would you like some coffee?

408
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,419
Morning.

409
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,629
You want some coffee?

410
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,591
No. The lady...

411
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,301
I think your wife...

412
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,595
You take cream and sugar?

413
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,014
Black's... Black's good.

414
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,807
Thanks.

415
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,111
Thanks.

416
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,118
Thanks.

417
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,462
This is probably gonna take a while.

418
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,172
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,299
- I'll run some errands.
- Okay.

420
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,009
All right.

421
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,137
You remember Agent Gomez?

422
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:04,103
- How you feeling? Your head clear?
- Yeah.

423
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:09,775
This... This can't be what you mean
by burning him to the ground, right?

424
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,767
I got stories that'll
make your toes curl,

425
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:16,907
but, you know, it's just "my word
against his word" kind of stuff.

426
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:20,327
So, you know, I don't really
have any, like, proof or anything.

427
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,662
Gomey, can you grab the curtains
over there?

428
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,207
There's a glare thing happening here.

429
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,254
You know he's retired, right? He's...

430
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,297
He's not even in the business anymore.

431
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,758
So you're never gonna catch him
with a camcorder.

432
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:38,262
We're gonna catch him.
We gotta do this first, okay? Come on.

433
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:48,063
Just tell us everything you remember.

434
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:51,316
Any business dealings,
any personal dealings

435
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:54,653
any criminal activity
you were a witness or a party to.

436
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,488
Anything and everything.

437
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,408
Just tell us your story, okay?

438
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,872
Start from the beginning.
When did you first meet Walter White?

439
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,917
Right. Okay...

440
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:15,382
I first met Mr. White...

441
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,593
Walter White.

442
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,263
...in junior year chemistry.

443
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,851
He was my teacher.

444
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,701
You believe him?

445
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,829
Yeah. I do, unfortunately.

446
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,541
And I hate to admit it,
but I think the kid is right.

447
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,836
There is no physical evidence,
not that I heard.

448
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:57,257
Yeah, well, no weapons,
no bodies, no working lab.

449
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:00,010
Just the word of one nut-job meth-head

450
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,138
against
Mr. Rogers-Has-a-Lung-Tumor.

451
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:05,497
So do we take a run
at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?

452
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,727
Vamonos Pest?
Follow up with the Drew Sharp killing?

453
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,270
Where do we start?

454
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,522
I say we start with this.

455
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,941
<i>Jesse</i>

456
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,946
<i>I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza
tomorrow at noon.</i>

457
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:23,784
<i>I hope you'll give me the chance
to explain myself,</i>

458
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,454
<i>and talk through everything
once and for all.</i>

459
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:32,501
<i>I'll be alone and unarmed.</i>

460
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,714
<i>So if you wanna come and shoot me
in the head, that's up to you.</i>

461
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,301
<i>Either way</i>

462
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,763
<i>I'm in your hands.</i>

463
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,862
Go and talk to that asshole?

464
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,239
You can't be serious.

465
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,325
Go and listen.
He wants to explain himself.

466
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,584
We put a wire on you and let him explain.

467
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:10,998
So your plan is to do his plan?

468
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,000
You seriously think that this...?

469
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,128
This whole
"once and for all in the plaza" thing

470
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,879
is so he can talk to me?

471
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,715
Why not?

472
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,635
I... I... I can't believe you two.

473
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:27,430
The dude wanted me out of town
before I came to burn his house down,

474
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,464
and now I'm more of a threat to him.

475
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:32,393
And he's got a zero-tolerance policy
on threats, you know?

476
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,397
If I go to this plaza,
I'm a dead man, is why not.

477
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,566
Hey, Walt's ruthless.

478
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,819
He'll do just about anything
to protect his interests.

479
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:44,906
I agree. Except when it comes to you.

480
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,909
He cares about you.

481
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,202
Can't you see?

482
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:54,624
Oh, yeah. You mean when he's not
ripping me off or calling me an idiot,

483
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,627
or poisoning people that I care about?

484
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,964
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me.
Everyone knows that.

485
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,800
No, I mean it.
Based on everything you told us.

486
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,969
He paid for your rehab

487
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,554
ran over those two drug dealers
with his car.

488
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,188
Sounds like he saved your life.

489
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,767
Made you a 50-50 partner.
He didn't need to do that.

490
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,854
Yeah, he sort of did.
I'm the only one near as good as him.

491
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,855
I don't know. The way you tell it

492
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,108
sounds like he's manipulating you
to stick around.

493
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:23,403
Like he doesn't wanna lose you.
All those numbers he runs on you

494
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:26,155
over and over,
helping you find the ricin cigarette.

495
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,991
Look how far he'll go to show you...

496
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:30,702
To convince you
that he's not such a bad guy.

497
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:33,538
- That's what this is.
- What if it's about

498
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,540
killing me, you know?

499
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,033
You know, getting me out in the open

500
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:41,296
hire some... Some clock-tower guy,

501
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:45,008
or have me sit on a poisoned needle
or something, you know?

502
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,717
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

503
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:50,452
The plaza's one of the most wide-open
public places in all of Albuquerque.

504
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,947
It's the middle of the day.

505
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,643
And Agent Gomez and I will
be right there with you.

506
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:59,981
Look, you two guys are just guys, okay?

507
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,902
Mr. White, he's the devil.

508
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:06,161
You know, he is.
He is smarter than you

509
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,323
he is luckier than you.

510
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:11,182
Whatever... Whatever you think
is supposed to happen

511
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,538
I'm telling you,
the exact reverse opposite of that

512
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,206
is gonna happen, okay?

513
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:20,085
Jesse, Jesse,
we're not brainstorming here.

514
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,421
This is not asking.

515
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:26,462
Unless you know another way to get the
man or you wanna take your chances

516
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,553
with the banger boys over in MDC,
then this is it.

517
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,472
This is what's happening.

518
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:36,601
- I gotta piss. Can I piss?
- Yeah. Down to the left.

519
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,481
You got another SD card?

520
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,070
- What?
- What if the kid's right?

521
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,488
What if it's a trap?

522
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,782
The kid?

523
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,034
Oh, you mean the junkie murderer

524
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,843
that's dribbling all over
my guest bathroom floor?

525
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,332
Well, then, he's right.

526
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,501
Pinkman gets killed,

527
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,004
and we get it all on tape.

528
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,916
Remember, you're hurt, angry,
but you're here for answers, okay?

529
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,836
But don't... Don't push the questions.

530
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:20,797
Okay?
Let's not get him suspicious, all right?

531
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:23,675
You let him do the talking, right?

532
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:26,109
Just relax. That's what matters most.

533
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:28,353
Don't cross your arms,
if you can help it.

534
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:32,733
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

535
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:34,560
<i>Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
You getting that?</i>

536
00:41:34,644 --> 00:41:38,023
- Loud and clear, <i>idiota.</i>
<i>- How's it looking, Gomey?</i>

537
00:41:39,191 --> 00:41:40,692
{\an8}No change.

538
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:42,527
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>

539
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,086
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>

540
00:41:44,654 --> 00:41:46,656
Ready to kick some ass, partner?

541
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:53,079
All right. Time to go.

542
00:42:03,423 --> 00:42:05,050
Okay.

543
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:15,036
{\an8}Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this?
What's with the kid?

544
00:43:15,245 --> 00:43:17,122
He's just standing there.

545
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:19,624
<i>What the hell is he doing?</i>

546
00:43:42,355 --> 00:43:45,775
{\an8}He's on the move now.
He's taking off. I think he's running.

547
00:43:45,984 --> 00:43:47,986
Oh, no, no, no, kid. Come on.

548
00:43:57,245 --> 00:43:59,748
{\an8}You got him? He's at the pay phone.

549
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:01,958
Who the hell is he calling?

550
00:44:04,419 --> 00:44:06,421
Oh, no, no, no. Come on, kid.

551
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,256
No. Come on.

552
00:44:21,394 --> 00:44:22,479
Hello?

553
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:25,523
Nice try, asshole.

554
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:28,902
Jesse, where are you?

555
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,153
I just wanna talk.

556
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:33,490
No. I'm not doing what you want
anymore. Okay, asshole?

557
00:44:33,698 --> 00:44:36,868
<i>This is just a heads-up
to let you know I'm coming for you.</i>

558
00:44:38,036 --> 00:44:41,539
See, I decided that burning down
your house is nothing.

559
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:44,918
Next time, I'm gonna get you
where you really live.

560
00:44:45,126 --> 00:44:47,003
Jesse, listen.

561
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:50,590
Jesse? Jesse?

562
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:17,450
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Hey!

563
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:32,298
Get in.

564
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:35,927
Son of a bitch! Stupid, high little...

565
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:37,786
What the hell was that all about?

566
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:39,305
What were you thinking?

567
00:45:39,514 --> 00:45:41,516
- Thinking there's another way.
- What?

568
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:45,311
To get him. There's another way.

569
00:45:47,272 --> 00:45:49,190
A better way.

570
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:10,336
Hey.

571
00:46:10,545 --> 00:46:12,380
It's Walt.

572
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:18,595
I'm okay.

573
00:46:18,803 --> 00:46:20,722
I...

574
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:24,184
Todd

575
00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:28,021
I think I might have another job
for your uncle.
