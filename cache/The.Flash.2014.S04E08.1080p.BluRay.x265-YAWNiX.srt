Crisis on Earth X...

00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,915
- To Barry and Iris.
- To Barry and Iris.

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,539
- Are you asking me to marry you?
- I am.

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:08,623
- Just forget about it.
- Felicity.

5
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,049
I don't wanna marry you.

6
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,876
I just called off my engagement.

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,674
To making things go away.

8
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,632
<i>Does anyone have just cause
why these two should not be married?</i>

9
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,134
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

10
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,218
<i>Nazis?</i>

11
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,302
<i>Why would Nazis want to
crash my wedding?</i>

12
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,137
There's a 53rd Earth called Earth-X.

13
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,144
Basically, our Earth
with one difference.

14
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,224
The Nazis won the war.

15
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,355
<i>I call it
"Calm after the Firestorm."</i>

16
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,107
No powers for either of us.

17
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,405
<i>The other archer
and flying woman</i>

18
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,232
<i>are Oliver and Kara of Earth-X.</i>

19
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,988
<i>And Thawne is working with them.</i>

20
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,740
<i>The General is dying.</i>

21
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,913
All we need is a new heart
and we found the perfect donor.

22
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,077
<i>I don't think
this is our Earth.</i>

23
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,680
<i>Eyes front!</i>

24
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,895
So, this craphole is Earth-X.

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,527
Wells was right.

26
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,694
He usually is.

27
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,157
It's hard to believe a place like this
actually exists. On any Earth.

28
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,363
I wish I shared your sentiment,
but in all my travels to distant times,

29
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,449
one thing sadly remains constant,

30
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,456
is man's ability to feel hatred
for other men.

31
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,045
<i>Keep moving.</i>

32
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,375
<i>Move.</i>

33
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,509
Stars and triangles.

34
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,262
Badges used to identify reported crimes

35
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,310
these people have quote-unquote
committed to land in here.

36
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,145
What's the pink triangle for?

37
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,688
<i>What'd you do?</i>

38
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,521
I loved the wrong person.

39
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,785
We gotta get out of these things.
Transmute us out.

40
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,861
With pleasure.

41
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,123
I can't vibrate through them either.

42
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,201
Power-dampening collars.

43
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,332
Why are we wearing them, then?

44
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,962
Doesn't matter.
There's too many guards here, anyways.

45
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,885
They're going to kill my sister.

46
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,588
Look, we're not gonna
let that happen, Alex, I promise you.

47
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,258
We're gonna get back to our Earth
before them.

48
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,934
How? We don't even know how we got here.

49
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,019
No, we don't. We're gonna figure it out.

50
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,388
Then we're gonna find a way
to get out of this place

51
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,102
and we're gonna get back
to the people we love.

52
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,400
I hope everyone else is okay.

53
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,375
Oh.

54
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,965
<i>Rip Van Ramon awakens.</i>

55
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,808
This doesn't look like a wedding.

56
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,680
You missed quite a bit, Cisco.

57
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,608
All you need to know is that
you're locked in one of your

58
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,562
<i>fabulous anti-meta-human cells
with the rest of us.</i>

59
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,645
And we can't escape.

60
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,652
Of course we can't.
That's what I designed them for, genius.

61
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,028
Good command of the obvious.

62
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,161
- Boys...
- Is that a ball?

63
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,738
Why? Is it bothering you?

64
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:27,913
Yes.

65
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,658
God!

66
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,742
Hey!

67
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,922
Are they gonna do that
the whole time we're in here?

68
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,998
Probably.

69
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,255
- It hurts. Cut it out.
<i>- Cut what out?</i>

70
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:48,801
S.T.A.R. Labs.

71
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,684
Feels like old times, doesn't it?

72
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,941
You know, I built this place?

73
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,147
With my own hands,
and called it home for 15 years.

74
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,314
And do you know what?

75
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,695
I hated every minute of it.

76
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,615
- Where are my friends?
- Your friends...

77
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,040
They're on Earth-X.

78
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,751
But I wouldn't worry about
your friends too much

79
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,457
because they're not going to be alive
much longer.

80
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,173
<i>Oh, my.</i>

81
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,552
It's because of the red sunlight.

82
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,519
And trust me, it'll make you
weaker than you can possibly imagine.

83
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,355
You did all this just... Just to get me?

84
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,028
Do you know how many
innocent people you killed?

85
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,318
Their lives to save mine?

86
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,446
Well, they should feel honored.

87
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,956
It's a strange sensation, isn't it?

88
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,958
Feeling vulnerable.

89
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,295
And it's just gonna get worse

90
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,837
because this red sunlight,
it's softening you up,

91
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,224
until pretty soon, I'm gonna
crack you open like a walnut.

92
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,935
Then I'm gonna take your healthy heart.

93
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,100
I'm gonna put it in her.

94
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,148
Which means we should probably
get you going.

95
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,103
Good.

96
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,068
That'll give me time to talk to

97
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,612
myself.

98
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,580
Did you hear that?

99
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,450
Everyone else is on Earth-X.

100
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,332
Kara only has a few hours
before they go full Mengele on her.

101
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,997
- We gotta stop them.
<i>- Got any ideas?</i>

102
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,083
I don't know.
Give me some time to think.

103
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,042
Iris, I'm all for girl power
and everything, but how are you and I

104
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,799
gonna stop the meaner Nazi version of
my whatever he is right now,

105
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,006
and people with superpowers?

106
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,727
We don't have to, we just need
to get to the pipeline and get Cisco.

107
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,805
He could turn off all the power to
the building and breach us out of here.

108
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,639
Do you know how to get to the pipeline
from here?

109
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,106
- I think so.
- Lead the way, McClane.

110
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,824
<i>Move!</i>

111
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,450
I don't like the looks of this.

112
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,203
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

113
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,534
<i>Keep moving.</i>

114
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,617
What are we doing?

115
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,079
- It's round-up time.
- Round-up for what?

116
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,421
<i>In line. Now!</i>

117
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,518
<i>So, these are...</i>

118
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,891
The heroes.

119
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,022
<i>Yes,</i> SturmbannfÃ¼hrer.

120
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:02,208
Blond hair, blue eyes.
This is Nordic perfection.

121
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,801
Why would you align yourself
with the unpure?

122
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,673
Because I like men.

123
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,013
And I like women.

124
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,056
You know, I had a daughter
who looked just like you.

125
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,566
With similar compulsions.

126
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,035
And I expunged that filth

127
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,159
from my family line forever.

128
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,586
Bring them all.

129
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,128
And him!

130
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,472
<i>Move! Now! Go!</i>

131
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,556
Not to be an alarmist,
but if we don't have an escape plan,

132
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,437
I suggest we get one immediately.

I'm sorry, Kara.

About time!

146
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,641
Kill them all!

Take cover!

Hey? You're cutting it close.

149
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,212
I thought that was great timing.
I really enjoyed the pun.

150
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,790
So, you're Leonard Snart's doppelganger.

151
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,467
No, I'm Leonard Snart,
but you can call me Leo.

152
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,675
That is a fantastic outfit.
Did you make that?

153
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,557
- Leo?
- Right!

154
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,392
Time to make you shine, buddy.

155
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,718
Uh, you...

156
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,930
You might wanna close your eyes.

157
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,347
Why?

158
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,690
I believe he just answered
your question.

159
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,545
Come on, let's go.

160
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,206
- Where we going?
- To our base.

161
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,668
- Your base?
- And... And who are you?

162
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,003
I was thinking exactly the same thing
about you all.

163
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,305
You might have to tell us on the way.

164
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,613
You're looking more human,

165
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,742
scared, helpless, pathetic,

166
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,329
- inferior.
- We're not that different from them.

167
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,290
Oh, please.
We're everything they want to be.

168
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,792
Blonde, white.

169
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,081
- Aryan perfection.
- I'm not like you.

170
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,838
I don't think I'm better
than everyone else.

171
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,295
You should, you are.

172
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,880
You're a god to them.

173
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,466
You could've been living like one.

174
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,102
- Like you?
- Yes, like me.

175
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,347
They want someone to bow to.

176
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,474
To worship. To lead.

177
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,443
What you're doing is not leading.

178
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,191
It's ruling.

179
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,906
Yes, it is.

180
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,823
They're like ants, Kara.

181
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,995
They shouldn't fear us
for what we can do.

182
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,915
They should rely on us
when they need us.

183
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,876
Oh, spare me the Good Samaritan crap.

184
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm not going to take advantage
of anyone just because I can.

185
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,127
The world isn't made better
by protecting the weak.

186
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,132
It's made better by getting rid of them.

187
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,474
You really are pathetic.

188
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,554
You know, I saw you at the wedding.

189
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,731
By yourself.

190
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,901
Poor lonely little Kara,

191
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,984
can't even find a date to a wedding.

192
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,074
You don't know
what you're talking about.

193
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:12,327
It's written all over that
pouty little face of yours.

194
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,788
You spend so much time on your planet
taking care of everyone but yourself.

195
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,468
No wonder you seem so utterly miserable.

196
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,711
It's not going to work.

197
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,591
You're not going to get what you want.

198
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,757
Really?

199
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,891
Why do you care if I take your heart?

200
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,441
You're not using it.

201
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,360
At least I have one.

202
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,618
<i>We're almost ready.</i>

203
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,919
Clear.

204
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,842
I know bad guys have inopportune timing,

205
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,635
but this is, like,
the worst timing ever.

206
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:08,712
Yeah, tell me about it, sister.

207
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,138
Barry and I were
just about to get married.

208
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,214
At least you guys left on good terms.

209
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,971
Last thing I said to Oliver was,
"I don't want to marry you."

210
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,428
And now, he's stuck in Nazi world.
What if we never see them again?

211
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,481
<i>Stop! Hands in the air.</i>

212
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,369
- That was extremely badass.
- Same to you.

213
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,029
Cisco?

214
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,204
<i>Cisco!</i>

215
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,372
Hey!

216
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,792
Guys! We're trapped in here!

217
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,118
We're gonna get you out of here.

218
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,507
- Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
<i>- What?</i>

219
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,835
- I can't open the blast door.
- You mean they're trapped?

220
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,675
I'll send an SOS to the Legends.

221
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,553
How long will it take
for them to get it?

222
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,259
Depends where they are in time.

223
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,810
I can't wait that long.

224
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,727
It's up to us to save Kara.

225
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,623
I guess we're in Earth-X's Star City.

226
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,993
I have to say,
that's one hell of a story.

227
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,791
- You're a speedster. Okay.
- Yeah.

228
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,669
You two turn into the burning man,

229
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,592
and you're the good doppelganger
of the <i>FÃ¼hrer.</i>

230
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,763
"Good" might be an oversimplification.

231
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,800
You still haven't told us
which Earth you're from.

232
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,431
Clearly it's not this one.

233
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,096
We're from Earth-1.

234
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,847
Earth-1. Well,

235
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,390
golly.

236
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,818
Am I missing something here?

237
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,733
I'm from Earth-1, too.

238
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,070
If you're from our Earth, then you know
how we got here, don't you?

239
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,154
Yeah. I have a pretty good idea.

240
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,863
I think you guys

241
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,532
came through this.

242
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,126
A temporal gateway?

243
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,126
Same physics as a breach.
Just more stable, and larger.

244
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,206
Yeah, much larger.

245
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,876
So, we have a way to get back?

246
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,971
So, where is this thing?

247
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,550
- It's actually not too far from here.
- 22.3 kilometers, to be exact.

248
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,852
- Well, we drive it.
- Good. So, take us to it.

249
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,438
Can't do that.

250
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:24,598
Why?

251
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,524
Because the gateway's in a facility

252
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,604
guarded by a not-so-small army of Nazis.

253
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,234
Yeah, well, we've faced worse, so...

254
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,861
Look, it's our only way home.

255
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,450
We're going through it.

256
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,947
Nobody's going through anything.

257
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,121
Because we're blowing it the hell up.

258
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,497
Winn?

259
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,833
Please, Freedom Fighter, General Schott.

260
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,876
- General Schott?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

261
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,671
- And who are you?
- New friends from Earth-1.

262
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,881
They're on our side.

263
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,217
Except for the part where you guys wanna
blow up our only way home.

264
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,597
We don't exactly want to.

265
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,971
Everyone we care about is on
the other side of that gateway,

266
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,180
imprisoned by Nazis.

267
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,641
The Nazis that want to
cut open my sister.

268
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,771
We have to get back!

269
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,228
Eliminate that facility,
and you eliminate our only chance

270
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,984
of saving our friends from your enemies.

271
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,695
I'm sorry, but we've been waiting
for an opportunity like this for years.

272
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,697
We cannot wait any longer.

273
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,621
This is our only chance to separate
the <i>FÃ¼hrer</i> from his army.

274
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,493
We are trying to turn this war around.

275
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,074
You are gonna leave our Earth

276
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,081
at the mercy of the three psychopaths
who have ravaged yours.

277
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,209
Wait, why does this man look exactly
like the <i>FÃ¼hrer</i> I'm trying to kill?

278
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,585
Look, fingerless gloves,

279
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,589
all we're asking is
for a little bit of time.

280
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,300
Let us get into the facility
and through that gateway.

281
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,803
The gateway's guarded
by 30 Panzer XII's,

282
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,635
50 Sturmtigers,
and 100 Schutzstaffel officers.

283
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,220
- Not the best odds, maybe.
- I'll take them.

284
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,850
No! You will not!

285
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,433
We're blowing up that gateway right now.

286
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,517
Final order!

287
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,355
Sorry, he's a little rough
around the edges,

288
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,317
but he is the General,
and he's issued his commands.

289
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,242
Hey, hey, hey.

290
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,912
You won't change his mind. No one does.

291
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,373
Look, on my Earth,
he and I are like family.

292
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,625
And he would do anything
to help my sister.

293
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,210
Ray! Let her try.

294
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,136
You don't seem to know
how to take an order.

295
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,896
That's because I'm used to giving them.

296
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,807
You can't do this, Winn.

297
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,391
General Schott.

298
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,318
Look, I don't know
where the hell you think you are,

299
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,862
but this planet has been
at war for generations.

300
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,155
We are tired.

301
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,948
There are men dying for the same causes
their grandfathers did.

302
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,952
We're not asking you to surrender.

303
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,123
Hey, just let us get back home
before you destroy that thing.

304
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,961
I'm just asking for a little time.

305
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,040
Time is what I can't give you!

306
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,006
They have a weapon,

307
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,930
a doomsday weapon powerful enough
to affect other worlds.

308
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,471
It has to be eliminated.

309
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,312
Winn.

310
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,480
Please.

311
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,774
The <i>FÃ¼hrer</i> on your Earth,
the people that you hate,

312
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:25,033
they're going to kill my sister if you
don't let me get back to save her.

313
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,287
On my Earth,
my sister is your closest friend.

314
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,416
She's saved you countless times.

315
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,002
You would do anything to help her.

316
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,132
You'd do anything to help each other.

317
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,505
No matter the risk.

318
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,253
Without question.

319
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,549
So, all I'm asking for is a chance.

320
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,013
Please.

321
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,976
I am sorry about your sister

322
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,856
and about your Earth,

323
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,404
I truly am,

324
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,992
but today, I have the chance

325
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,871
to protect my people, my Earth.

326
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,282
My decision stands.

327
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,538
Winn?

328
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,754
Jefferson?

329
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,676
Uh, Grey, I'm busy, man.

330
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,128
Yes, I can see that,

331
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,088
but I was hoping you might
take a moment away from your

332
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,926
ruminations on dystopian alternative
history to accept my apology.

333
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,016
I may be a learned man,
but I am not always an astute one.

334
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:36,476
I think I was just so thrilled with
the reality of my imminent departure,

335
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,481
that I neglected
to consider your feelings.

336
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,063
Look, man, I'm not tryin' to take you
away from your family, or nothing.

337
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,568
You are my family.

338
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,036
Long before I unexpectedly found myself
with a daughter,

339
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,035
I found myself unexpectedly with a son.

340
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,079
- Yeah, I know. I...
- You know.

341
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,618
You know, do you?

342
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,340
Look around you. We're standing
in one of the darkest places imaginable.

343
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,335
Yet somehow, I'm optimistic.

344
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,253
- Do you know why?
- 'Cause you're a crazy old man.

345
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,554
Yes. No!

346
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,388
Because I'm standing here with you.

347
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,638
You are a better son
than I could have ever hoped for.

348
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,269
And no length of time or distance
will ever change that.

349
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,857
A'ight. Apology accepted. Come here.

350
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,784
What are you doing?

351
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,083
Looking for a gun.

352
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,331
<i>Or a knife. Anything.</i>

353
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,634
Okay, I don't care how many Sturmtigers
they have out there,

354
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:45,965
I'm gonna go save Kara

355
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,717
with or without the help
of these people.

356
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,088
No, you're not.

357
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:53,677
I'm a government agent
certified in over 30 military weapons.

358
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,433
And you're impressive,
I'll give you that,

359
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,597
but you still can't fight your way

360
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,183
through an army of Nazis
alone and scared.

361
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,272
I'm not scared.

362
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,562
No, not for you. For your sister.

363
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,363
I should have done more.

364
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,782
I mean, if I hadn't gotten so

365
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,787
distracted.

366
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,866
Well, sorry to be a distraction.

367
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,292
You don't understand.

368
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,122
I can't lose her.

369
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,122
I understand more than you think.

370
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,878
I lost my sister.

371
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:33,513
The anger and guilt that I felt
for not being able to save her

372
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,595
took me down a dark path.

373
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,688
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

374
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,891
How could you?

375
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,480
I mean, the only thing
we know about each other

376
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,233
is what we look like with clothes off.

377
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,231
Beautiful, by the way.

378
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,573
You also don't know
that I protect my team.

379
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,700
And you, Danvers, you're on my team.

380
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,198
And I promise you,

381
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,580
we're not gonna let what happened
to my sister happen to yours.

382
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,875
I'm sorry. I just want...

383
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,707
I wanna save Kara
and I wanna get back to Maggie.

384
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:07,667
Maggie is...

385
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,468
- Complicated.
- Yeah.

386
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,008
I had a Maggie, too.

387
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,216
And I think about going back to her

388
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,059
all the time.

389
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,311
Look, Alex,

390
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,097
you seem like
a pretty thoughtful person.

391
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,524
And if you thought it wasn't gonna
work out and had to end it,

392
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,477
I'm sure that reason was valid.

393
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,854
Trust your instincts.

394
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,738
Ray, please, let's talk to him.

395
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,618
Look, you said to let Alex try,

396
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,791
I let her try, she didn't succeed.

397
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,539
So, that's that?
We'll just let these poor,

398
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,337
strangely dressed individuals
lose their one way home?

399
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,255
Look, it's what Winn ordered.

400
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,710
And I'm not in the habit
of defying generals on any Earth.

401
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,677
And what about your family?

402
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,258
Back on Earth-1?

403
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,672
What about them?

404
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,929
You'd be giving up any chance
of ever seeing them again.

405
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,101
Leo,

406
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,312
why are you pushing this?

407
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,765
- Pardon?
- We have fought, and bled,

408
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,441
and sacrificed for this war,

409
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,688
and then these strangers show up,

410
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,816
and you're willing to throw
everything away for them?

411
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,565
The fate of the world is at stake.

412
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,651
So are the lives of their loved ones.

413
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:14,734
Come on.

414
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,404
Tease me all you want
for being sentimental,

415
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,997
but these heroes would risk everything
for the people they love,

416
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,074
just like I would.

417
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,501
For you.

418
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,721
You know I can't say no
when you look at me like that.

419
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,757
That is why I look at you like that.

420
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,147
We talked to the General,
and after a lot of arguing,

421
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,983
- he agreed.
- We're gonna help you out.

422
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,246
Now, you referenced 100 guards.

423
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,198
I assume most of them
are around the perimeter?

424
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,453
- Correct.
- All right.

425
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,628
We fight through them outside,
we access the main corridor.

426
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,546
What is security like inside the hangar?

427
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,839
I'll do some recon.

428
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,544
So, the entire facility
has meta-human dampeners.

429
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,546
Okay, we can't take that hangar
with no powers, man.

430
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,257
These satellites indicate a control room
off the hangar.

431
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,092
That must be where the dampener is.

432
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,645
Okay, well, we definitely can't take
the main control room with no powers.

433
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,268
It's not like we blend in here.

434
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,523
I think I know how to get in.

435
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,825
I'm allowing this mission
against my better judgment.

436
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,115
You have one hour.

437
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,157
I appreciate it. We all do.

438
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,576
Yeah, I know.

439
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,952
I know what you're thinking.

440
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,664
If you don't make it
through the gateway,

441
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,424
I am not giving you more time.

442
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,220
I will blow that place to kingdom come.

443
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,227
Red light saturation

444
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,809
<i>is complete.</i>

445
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,018
She's cooked.

446
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,655
And you will wake up
stronger than you've ever been.

447
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,735
I love you.

448
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,164
And I love you.

449
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,661
Unfortunately, Miss Danvers,

450
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,123
we need you awake for this procedure.

451
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,003
My cousin,

452
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,427
he'll find you.

453
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,887
Your cousin.

454
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:41,964
Really?

455
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,428
<i>Fun tidbit.</i>

456
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,101
I fought your cousin once,

457
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,552
in the future.

458
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,642
He is fast.

459
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,811
I'm faster.

460
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,406
- They're starting the surgery.
- I'm working on it. And...

461
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,884
Just have backup power
and it's not enough.

462
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,712
Well, everyone in the building
has been accounted for.

463
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,342
Where might people be hiding?

464
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,616
Take that, you Nazi mother...

465
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,041
Hey, hey, hey.

466
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,338
Come with me if you wanna live.

467
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,507
- Get me to the sun.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

468
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,923
<i>- I got her, I got her.</i>
- Okay, okay.

469
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,888
We've gotta go!

470
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,567
<i>I don't believe
Mr. Thawne is done with you yet.</i>

471
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,493
Your papers, <i>Sturmmann.</i>

472
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,455
We don't have papers.
This is a special visit.

473
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,586
Your papers. Now.

474
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,176
Suit yourself,

475
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,511
but I think you better talk to our boss.

476
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,888
As you were.

477
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,977
My God, my apologies, sir.

478
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,222
<i>- Let them through!
- Let them through!</i>

479
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,727
<i>Thank you,</i> Mein FÃ¼hrer.

480
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,177
<i>Mein FÃ¼hrer,</i> we were...
We were not expecting you.

481
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,129
Nor was I anticipating
being back so soon.

482
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,131
Thanks to your incompetence.

483
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:32,060
The Earth-1 doppelgangers,
my doppelganger,

484
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,183
escaped his execution.

485
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,185
Yes. He did.

486
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,265
And?

487
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,976
We are exhausting every possible means
to locate them.

488
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,069
Good.

489
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,899
Would you like us to delay deployment
until we do so?

490
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,109
"Deployment"?

491
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,194
She is inbound and ready.

492
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,127
<i>Doomsday device.</i>

493
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,880
<i>The</i> Wellenreiter
<i>is fully operational</i>

494
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,550
and at the ready, <i>Mein FÃ¼hrer.</i>

495
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,395
Shall we send her through?

496
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,098
As scheduled.

497
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,442
Begin!

498
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,498
<i>The</i> Wellenreiter <i>is on its way.</i>

499
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,299
Hail victory!

500
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,051
Hail victory!

501
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,757
Hail victory.

502
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,264
- Report.
- Good news.

503
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,817
The <i>Wellenreiter's</i>
made the transition to this Earth.

504
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,190
Kara is all that matters.

505
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,192
That red sunlight
we're flooding her with,

506
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,272
that's burning off.

507
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,071
And so, pretty soon,
her cells will be so desaturated,

508
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,493
we cannot perform the surgery.

509
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,195
- Fix it.
- I can't.

510
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,664
This is your city.
This is your facility.

511
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,375
So, turn the power back on.

512
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:22,371
I can't because the system
has been encrypted.

513
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,622
By who?

514
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,131
By Miss Smoak.

515
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,391
Is there anything else
I could help you with?

516
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,809
No, that'll be all.

517
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,693
Very well.

518
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,912
Before I go, I have something for you,
<i>Mein FÃ¼hrer.</i>

519
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,613
A gift

520
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,953
to celebrate your return.

521
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,915
Guard!

522
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,054
Well, I know how much you enjoy
executing rule breakers

523
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,886
and this one has broken many of them.

524
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,434
We discovered that there's a Jewess

525
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,646
handing her rations
to the work camp children.

526
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,068
Strictly against camp rules, of course.

527
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,025
Those children were starving.

528
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,913
Well, this must be hard.

529
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:52,627
I hear your doppelganger on Earth-1
loved a woman who looks just like this.

530
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,183
Did you really think
I would hand you a loaded weapon

531
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,064
before verifying who you are?

532
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,592
Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay?
No, no, no, you're fine, you're fine.

533
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,295
Just take this and go.

534
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,847
Why are you doing this?

535
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,391
It's the strong's duty
to protect the weak.

536
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,467
Take it and go.

537
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,843
Go!

538
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,602
Clear.

539
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,737
How did it...

540
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,065
Oh.

541
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,031
Barry, we have a problem.
The gateway control's been damaged.

542
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,362
- We can't turn it on?
- We can't turn it on here,

543
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,448
but there should be a manual override
at the platform.

544
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,125
All right, we're gonna have to
fight our way through.

545
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,244
What do you mean "call it back"?

546
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,583
Too late. It's been programmed.

547
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,665
<i>- There's no changing course now.</i>
- You said we'd have an hour!

548
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,750
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

549
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,084
The team hasn't gone
through the breach yet.

550
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,886
That team has nothing to do with us
or saving our planet!

551
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,636
And everyone who can threaten it is on
the other side of that breach.

552
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,841
They're not coming back through!

553
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,597
- General...
<i>- Leo, enough!</i>

554
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,145
I'm not risking any more time.
We are blowing it up.

555
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,984
<i>Guys, we have a problem.</i>

556
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,021
What kind of problem?

557
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,239
<i>A weapon's heading
to blow up the facility.</i>

558
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,322
A weapon? You mean a missile?

559
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,820
<i>Not exactly.</i>

560
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,088
Felicity Smoak, turn the power back on.

561
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,465
He said...

562
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,171
Felicity!

563
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,136
Turn the power back on.

564
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,978
I'm sorry, Earbard. "Earbard"?

565
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,771
- Eobard.
- Eobard.

566
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,520
My God, the future sounds weird.

567
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,024
It's funny.

568
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:17,317
Sometimes, we think
we're more clever than we are.

569
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,732
Because where I come from,

570
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:24,912
the history books are filled
with stories of this age of heroes.

571
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:26,990
Green Arrow.

572
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,825
<i>Black Canary.</i>

573
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,201
The Flash.

574
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,870
And yet, no one,

575
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,080
no one

576
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:40,337
- has ever heard of "Felicity Smoak."
<i>- Stop!</i>

577
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,763
Stop. Stop.

578
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,093
You came here for me,
so just take me, please.

579
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,645
Please don't hurt anyone else.

580
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,356
Give him the code.

581
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,233
If I do, they'll kill you.

582
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,652
It's fine.
Nobody's gonna die because of me.

583
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,325
Latte, Ada, Jonas,
one-one-nine-zero-zero.

584
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,743
"Latte"? Cute.

585
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,186
<i>Let's go.</i>

586
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,901
In 10 minutes, Red Tornado's gonna
bring down this entire facility

587
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,898
and there's nothing we can do
to stop that robot.

588
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,355
Then we need to reopen the gateway
before that happens.

589
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,439
Barry. Ray.

590
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,651
We know. Stop a flying robot somehow.

591
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,827
Good. The rest of us
will open the breach.

592
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,449
That's the whole plan?

593
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,281
Well, as the Snart we know used to say,

594
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,991
"Make a plan. Execute the plan.

595
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,997
"Expect the plan to go off the rails.
Throw away the plan."

596
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:55,994
Wow, that is...

597
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,588
That is terrible advice.

598
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,415
I always have a plan,
down to the second,

599
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,625
so nothing ever goes wrong.

600
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,210
No, no, no, the only plan now

601
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,387
is not to leave this Earth without me.

602
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,463
Okay.

603
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,726
Right. Ready for Tornado watch.

604
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,802
Let's do it.

605
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,188
I thought it'd be fun
if we put on our costumes.

606
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,485
Where'd you get the bow and quiver?

607
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,313
The General collects weapons.

608
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,781
Let's go to war.

609
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,288
No one gets to the gateway!

610
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,828
No one!

611
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,101
Here we go!

612
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,675
Okay, we're Nazi-free. Let's go.

613
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,431
<i>Hold on.
That's an automated power cell.</i>

614
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,979
<i>We need to activate it
before using the control console.</i>

615
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,727
I can hot-wire it, no problem.

616
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,228
<i>Then I'll turn on the console.</i>

617
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,355
Oh. You wanna split up? You sure?

618
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,526
<i>It's our most favorable odds.</i>

619
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,358
<i>Let's kick some ass, Jefferson.</i>

620
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,554
Grey, we've got power!

621
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,062
Ray?

622
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,188
A little help here.

623
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,251
Whoa!

624
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,221
- Oh, crap.
- Oh, crap.

625
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,578
Well, that's not very fair.

626
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,433
I'm pinned down!

627
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,699
Grey! No!

628
00:41:43,723 --> 00:41:51,723
