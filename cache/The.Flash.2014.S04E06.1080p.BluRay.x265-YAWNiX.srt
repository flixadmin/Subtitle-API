1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:06,046
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,215
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,343
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,967
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,093
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,302
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,433
<i>And in doing so our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,811
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,226
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,645
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,775
What's happened to me?

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,731
<i>- Ralph Dibny.
- He used to be a cop.</i>

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,908
- A dirty cop.
- I was a good detective.

14
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,111
- This is not my world.
- And Earth-2 is?

15
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,117
Did you make a bunch of friends there
that I don't know about?

16
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,119
You said you were a good cop, be one

17
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,078
- Let me train you.
- For what?

18
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,379
<i>To do what I do.</i>

19
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,001
What made you look into Mayor Bellows?

20
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,550
It was a client. Last name, DeVoe.

21
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,133
I owe ya for the java, rookie.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,721
Can't believe I left my wallet at home.

23
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,428
Don't worry about it,
it could happen to anyone.

24
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,013
Five times in a row.

25
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,853
And could you stop calling me rookie?

26
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,444
Sorry. Old habit from when I was
your superior officer.

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,819
You know. Before you got me fired,
ruined my career, destroyed my life,

28
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,656
crushed my spirit. Left me alone
without a friend in the world.

29
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,488
Don't forget how I turned you into
an amorphous stretch-y blob.

30
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,448
Actually, that's the one good thing
you've done for me!

31
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,828
- Right.
- 'Course it wasn't on purpose,

32
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,999
so you don't get credit.

33
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,373
Both of ya, hand over your cash! Now!

34
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,420
Hey. Pardon us. Okay? One second.

35
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,960
Okay. This is perfect.
I've been teaching you, right?

36
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,840
Muggers are like Superhero 101.

37
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,842
- Ah, Ralphy likey.
<i>- What's your plan?</i>

38
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,345
Okay. I was thinking about this
in the shower this morning,

39
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,348
how sweet would it be
to turn into a giant slingshot?

40
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,930
It's a weird plan, but okay.

41
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,565
- I got an even cooler idea!
- Hey!

42
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,521
I'm still robbing you guys.

43
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,571
We will be right with you, sir. Please!

44
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,566
<i>Okay, what if I did like
a human-slinky thing</i>

45
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,275
<i>maybe wrap him up,
throw in a few on-theme puns.</i>

46
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,702
Whatever, Ralph.
We just gotta hurry up a little bit.

47
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,156
Relax, rookie. I've seen a lot
of thugs. This guy's no shooter.

48
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:09,748
My leg!

49
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,960
Well, our work here is done.

50
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,591
Hey, what're you doing? We can't
just leave. You just shot him.

51
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,384
I didn't shoot him. He shot him.

52
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,508
- Well...
- Do you feel like I shot you?

53
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,473
You. Stop shooting him!

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,144
- I am not shooting him!
- They shot my ass!

55
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,096
Okay. So, he's
a little banged up, but...

56
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,558
We caught the bad guy.
Isn't that what superheroes do?

57
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,816
No. A superhero's
first job is to protect people.

58
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,569
Oh, God! What's the second job?
Long-winded lectures before noon?

59
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:43,575
I barely... Take this. One day, gonna
throw a lightning bolt so far...

60
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,155
I'm taking him to the hospital.

61
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,411
And you owe me five coffees.

62
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,625
It's fine. I know. Come on, get up.
Not gonna hurt you. This way, come on.

63
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:01,888
Hey. He left his gun!
He's reformed already!

64
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,014
We need to talk.

65
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,766
The only way it can end...

66
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,814
With my victory.

67
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,019
What?

68
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,238
Fine. Let us take the long way
and continue.

69
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,907
Today, for the first time,

70
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,822
events will align that give Team Flash

71
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,327
a chance to discover your identity.

72
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,329
This is earlier than you anticipated.

73
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,163
- It is of no concern.
- Like hell! You know what's at risk.

74
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,372
What we're doing.

75
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,424
If you've miscalculated
by even a decimal...

76
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,720
There is not a decimal,
a fraction, an infinitesimal variable

77
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,093
beyond my thought!

78
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,551
Beyond my mind.

79
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,684
Even now, of the 7,798 variations

80
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:56,359
of this argument, I have anticipated
them all and know how it ends.

81
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,686
Then how does it end?

82
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,403
The only way it can end...

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,281
With my victory.

84
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,551
Ouch! All nighter, huh?

85
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,223
I haven't been this tired
since Killer Frost

86
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,801
decided to go to Burning Man.

87
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,980
Yeah? Well, how's our search
for the mysterious DeVoe coming?

88
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,897
Allen, we're searching
for an evil mastermind.

89
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,646
The only clue we have to go on
is his name,

90
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,069
of which there're literally thousands.
So, how's the search going? It's...

91
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,271
Fantastic.

92
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,445
- I missed that.
- If we're gonna find DeVoe,

93
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,780
we need more brain power.

94
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,454
Well, why didn't you say so?
One master detective ready to detect.

95
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,327
I said, "More brain power."

96
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,622
<i>Initiating emergency oxygen purge...</i>

97
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,251
<i>- In ten, nine, eight, seven...</i>
- I, I...

98
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,129
- I...
<i>- ...six, five, four...</i>

99
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,212
- One more second...
<i>- ...three, two, one...</i>

100
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,173
Like I said, we need more help.
Maybe I should call my friends.

101
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,595
- Your what?
- My friends.

102
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,264
- Is he saying friends?
- I think he's being sarcastic.

103
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,847
No, this is delirium. He's cracked
from being awake all night.

104
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,228
Hey, Harry. All of your friends
are in this room!

105
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,152
I have other friends. You asked me to
make new friends, I made new friends.

106
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,446
It was a task. I complete tasks.

107
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,447
That's so great.
I can't wait to meet them.

108
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,826
Harry, you listened to me!
I'm so proud of you.

109
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,453
Okay, there's no pride...

110
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,122
Put that down.
Look, my friends are smart,

111
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,949
they'll help us. I'll call them.

112
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:44,004
All right. In the meantime, we gotta
find the rest of these bus metas.

113
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,461
Somehow they're connected
to DeVoe's plan.

114
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,969
You were on the bus. Can you remember
anybody else who was?

115
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,392
Well, I was in between
drunk and hungover at the time.

116
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,437
She is cute. What's her deal?

117
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,435
- She's in jail.
- When are visiting hours?

118
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,561
What about vibing the rest
of the bus passengers?

119
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,941
I tried, but, you know, the...

120
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,654
The dark matter we release was such
a massive space-time event

121
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,236
that my energy just reflected back
and I ended up vibing myself.

122
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,201
I'm pretty sure
I relived my own birth...

123
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,367
Or was that my death?

124
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,577
You know, there are other
non-traumatizing ways

125
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,913
of bringing Ralph's memory back.
Like hypnosis.

126
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,247
Is that really a thing?

127
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,082
I mean, not the whole
cartoon pocket-watch version.

128
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,384
But yeah, real hypnosis can be used
to recover memories.

129
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,303
- All right. Do you know any hypnotists?
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,971
- Not me.
- You lost me at cartoon.

131
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,221
All right. So who's gonna
hypnotize Ralph?

132
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,972
I'm Doctor Sharon Finkel.

133
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,186
Dr. Finkel, thank you so much
for squeezing us in.

134
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,857
Our friend Ralph here is having
trouble remembering information,

135
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,777
for a detective case. Right, Ralph?

136
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,647
So, I see

137
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,110
you didn't go to Harvard.

138
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,947
No, did you?

139
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,446
I see what you did there.

140
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,373
If you could fix his personality, too,
that'd be great.

141
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,456
Give it up, rookie. This psycho-hooey
is never gonna work on me.

142
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,418
- Well, that was quick.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

143
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,501
Now, remember with me, Ralph.
It's a month ago.

144
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,345
You're on a bus. What do you see?

145
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:16,308
<i>I see someone crying.</i>

146
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,019
Dude's really bumming me out.

147
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,272
Hey. Cheer up, buddy!
You can do it!

148
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,644
What else do you see?

149
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,445
<i>I see some women.
I can't see their faces.</i>

150
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,116
34-32-36. 38-34-32.

151
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,362
Are those bus routes?

152
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,366
I think they are measurements.

153
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,787
Ew.

154
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,916
<i>I see something else. I see a...</i>

155
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,582
<i>It's a bison.</i>

156
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,465
Does a bison mean anything
to either of you?

157
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,385
This hocus-pocus is never gonna work
on a guy like me.

158
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,844
But we can try it if you want.

159
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,147
How'd you guys get over there?

160
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:05,171
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

161
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,815
Security guard found him here
this morning. Haven't ID'd him yet.

162
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,862
His personal effects
are scattered everywhere.

163
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,407
So we didn't find his wallet.
But we may find it

164
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,701
when we find the rest of his briefcase.

165
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,033
And his missing hand.

166
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,578
Well, judging by that avulsion

167
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,206
and the claw marks, I'd say
a large predatory animal did this.

168
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,793
But whatever it was would
have to have four-inch canines,

169
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,718
a bite force of 5,000 psi,
and weigh over a ton.

170
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,719
That animal doesn't exist.

171
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,300
Then what the hell did this?

172
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,636
You don't think...

173
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,154
Do you remember back in the day
when we wouldn't calmly consider

174
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,277
a stone statue our prime suspect?

175
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,699
No. I actually don't.

176
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,413
Blood.

177
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,389
All right, my friends.
We got meats.

178
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,060
We got cheeses, we got guac,
we got beer.

179
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,351
And of course, we got my favorite chips!

180
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,983
Let's get this confab poppin'.
Are your friends coming?

181
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,277
Yeah, let me just calibrate
the multi-verse holo-projector,

182
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,353
and we'll be on our way.

183
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,109
Your friends are from different Earths?

184
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,856
No, but I thought

185
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,159
multi-verse holo-projector
would've given you that clue,

186
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,454
but, apparently not.
Yes, they're from other Earths.

187
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,249
And we're off and running.

188
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,997
Well, allow me to make
some introductions.

189
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,706
From Earth-12, the holder of four
PhDs and the author of the book

190
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,916
<i>So Why'd You Buy This Book?,</i>

191
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,343
I give you,
<i>Herr</i> Harrison Wolfgang Wells.

192
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,967
<i>- Guten Tag,</i> Wells.
<i>- Guten Tag.</i>

193
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,265
Do you know
that it amuses me that you think

194
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,764
that saving your tiny world matters,

195
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,265
when the entire multi-verse

196
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,393
will inevitably be consumed
in a fiery heat desk?

197
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,937
- Desk?
- Yeah, that's what I said, desk.

198
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,394
Death.

199
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,229
Yeah, death. What are you, deaf?

200
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,814
- Yeah.
- You must be

201
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,490
the little one they call Cisco.

202
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,860
- Not that...
- I'm 5'7". <i>Guten Tag.</i>

203
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,701
All right. Moving on. From Earth-47.

204
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,288
I give you the billionaire-inventor
and publishing tycoon

205
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,372
General Champion of Free Speech,

206
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,120
H. Lothario Wells.

207
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,623
<i>That's right. Keep that coming.
Now try the other one on.</i>

208
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,380
<i>No, not the Crocs.
Just the other leopard prints...</i>

209
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,835
- It's really...
- What's going on?

210
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,012
He's otherwise occupied.

211
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,966
Oh, golly, there you are.

212
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,477
My apologies. Appears that you all
caught us red-handed here

213
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,646
at the mansion on dress-up night.
You know what they say,

214
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,019
intellect is the greatest aphrodisiac.

215
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,691
Yeah, so. Nobody says that.

216
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,277
Here's to rising IQ's and libidos.

217
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,941
Hate to call two a pattern here, Harry,

218
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,071
but aren't your friends...

219
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,325
And from the post-apocalyptic
landscape of Earth-22,

220
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,747
where man and machine
have become one in order to survive,

221
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,200
I give you, Wells 2.0.

222
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,378
<i>Right. Let's make this quick.</i>

223
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,623
Reapers have raided our petrol supplies

224
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,461
and stolen our water tanks.
I'd like to smash them to bits.

225
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,212
What? It's a party now.

226
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,597
Forget not about me!

227
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,101
'Tis I, Wells the Grey...

228
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,059
Sorry. It's a bad connection.

229
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,765
Yeah. That was a terrible connection.

230
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,849
Good on you.

231
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,022
That dude was strange.

232
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,770
- Harry?
- Yeah?

233
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,151
- Sidebar.
- We're gonna, sidebar.

234
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,486
So, remember when I said,
"Make friends"?

235
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,700
I didn't mean with yourself.

236
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,406
They're great, aren't they?

237
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,833
And some of the brightest minds
in all the multi-verse.

238
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,162
Good company, too, I might add.
I mean, that Harrison Wolfgang Wells.

239
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,008
- The guy's hilarious.
- Look, we're desperate.

240
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,927
- Sure we are.
- So, I think

241
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,675
we should give
the Council of Wells a chance.

242
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,427
- Council of Wells?
- Pretty good name, right?

243
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,598
- Yes, it is.
- I know.

244
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,675
- All right.
- All right.

245
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,759
- Fellas. Will you...
- Fellas.

246
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,843
No, do your thing.

247
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,646
- Here's how it's gonna go down.
<i>- Nein.</i> Halt.

248
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,351
You're unnecessary also,
not wanted, so...

249
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,484
Off you go. Off you go. Off you go.

250
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,905
Still here. Off you go.

251
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,904
And even I know when
you got too many partners.

252
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,738
I know I may be half machine.
But you're all useless.

253
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,323
I think what the fellas
are trying to say here,

254
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,120
is that they prefer to work alone.

255
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,251
- You don't say.
- I just did.

256
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,919
- Don't just say it.
- He just said it.

257
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,506
Fine. You enjoy your road-kill.

258
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,758
You won't be eating my favorite chips.

259
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,344
We had a Cisco on my Earth once.

260
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,634
He was delicious.

261
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,141
He ate another Cisco.

262
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,438
I'm gonna leave you to you.

263
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,612
So this stone sample shows absolutely
no unique attributes of any kind.

264
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,238
Totally normal granite statue.

265
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,655
Except, it's filled with traces
of the dark matter

266
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,412
on a molecular level,
as if it's been flooded with it.

267
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,708
So, another bus meta...

268
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,081
One that somehow brings
inanimate objects to life.

269
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,583
And uses them to kill.

270
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,003
How can this possibly be, possible?

271
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,334
My best guess?

272
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,387
This meta has the ability to leave
a psychic imprint on objects

273
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,432
A sort of telekinetic puppeteering
through a subconscious link.

274
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,809
That's really smart, 34-25-34.

275
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,680
- Did he just give my...
- No, ignore him.

276
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,731
<i>Um... Well, look,</i>

277
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,605
the good thing is, our rifles have
a "blow statues to hell" setting,

278
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,733
so when this meta does show up,
we'll be ready.

279
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,813
I hope we're ready now.

280
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,238
Our victim's name is Jim Fox.

281
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,411
He was an auctioneer at Wetherby's.

282
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,076
He was transporting a Native American
artifact when he was attacked.

283
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,824
We just don't know which one.

284
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,159
Oh, wait. Maybe we do.

285
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,373
<i>A bison necklace.</i>

286
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,163
Ralph, you said you saw a bison
on the bus, right? I mean...

287
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,298
Nothing in our world is a coincidence.

288
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,926
- Vindicated.
- No one said you were lying.

289
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,469
I could see it in your eyes.

290
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,671
<i>According
to this auction report</i>

291
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,722
the necklace was separated
into three pieces.

292
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,633
The first was in the briefcase,
the third is unknown,

293
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,060
but the second was in the hands
of a private collector.

294
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,391
Christoph Banks.

295
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,098
I'll get the CCPD. Get his address.
He may be in danger.

296
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,521
Then we better pay him a visit.
You ready to suit up?

297
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,820
Oh, yeah! Where's my suit?

298
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,607
<i>Now, this is just a prototype,</i>

299
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,864
but she's got an adaptive,
nano-weave structure

300
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,195
that is, wait for it...

301
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,953
Malleable, on a sub-molecular level.

302
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,283
Don't know what that means, don't care.

303
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,494
Just yank the tarp off.
I'm ready for my super-suit.

304
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,204
Ralph,

305
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,836
this "tarp" is your super-suit.

306
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,593
When you stretch, it stretches.

307
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,050
When you squish, it squishes.

308
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,924
Squishes into something butt-ugly.

309
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,519
Where's the style? The flair?
Dibny needs to peacock.

310
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,144
Dibny needs to wear the prototype
Cisco so lovingly made for him.

311
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,730
Either that or you fight crime naked.

312
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,902
No, don't fight crime naked.

313
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,234
What is this? A puppy's raincoat?

314
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,827
The collection really is
quite impressive, isn't it?

315
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,332
It's taken no small amount
of resources to acquire.

316
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,874
I'm just glad to share it
with someone who appreciates it.

317
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,418
That, I do.

318
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,384
So this book you're writing?
It's on Sioux artifacts?

319
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,092
My entire bloodline is Sioux.
Lakota to be exact.

320
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,226
Ah...

321
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,763
Then you're gonna love this.

322
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,935
This is a Lakota peace pipe.

323
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,612
Had to have it taken apart
and repaired so it can be smoked.

324
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,900
Wanna try it?

325
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,278
That which you call a "peace pipe"
is no such thing.

326
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,198
It is a sacred gift for prayer
from Ptesan-Wi,

327
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,249
bringer of the Seven Sacred Rights,

328
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,952
the White Buffalo Calf Woman.

329
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,289
You'd never hang
a Christian cross upside down,

330
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,799
or lay an American flag on the floor,

331
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,925
yet you destroy that which is wakan,

332
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,930
what is holy, by letting it
touch your filthy flesh.

333
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,724
But I'm here to teach you
the price for your impudence.

334
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:00,884
Who do you think you are?

335
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,769
I am the Black Bison.

336
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,776
Enough.

337
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,582
Whoa! Now, that is a cool suit.

338
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,242
Remind me to take some pics for Cisco...

339
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,499
<i>Help. Don't leave me.</i>

340
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,264
You let her get away.

341
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,903
I'm getting the same traces
of dark matter from this

342
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,359
that I was from the tiger's statue.

343
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,115
Looks like our meta isn't restricted
to animating just stone.

344
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,117
No. But she does have some limitations.

345
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,664
Out of all the artifacts in the office,

346
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,991
she could only control the knight.

347
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,621
So, then maybe her
psychic imprint abilities

348
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,169
are just restricted to effigies.

349
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,919
- It just means statues.
- Yeah, I don't know.

350
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,211
Sounds kinda dirty to me.

351
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,504
So, if the statue looks like people or
animals, she can bring them to life.

352
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,423
Good thing there's only thousands
of those in the city.

353
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,850
I got a hit on facial recognition.

354
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,770
<i>Mina Chaytan.
Professor of Cultural Anthropology.</i>

355
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,472
- She's a teacher?
- Was.

356
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,857
She became an activist,
but she lost her job

357
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,605
six months ago after being arrested.

358
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,527
Breaking and entering,
trespassing, burglary.

359
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,651
Quite an activist.
The charges were dropped,

360
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,357
but the university still let her go.

361
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,161
She was trying to reclaim several
Sioux art pieces from the museum.

362
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,363
Chaytan was at this even before
she was a meta.

363
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,873
Yeah. Except now she's
upped her game to homicide.

364
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,912
She wants the third piece
of that necklace

365
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,960
- Let's find it before she does.
- Okay.

366
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,913
West and West are on the case.

367
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,207
What's wrong with you?

368
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,378
You let her get away.
We could've caught her.

369
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,714
Yeah, I let her go
but I also saved Banks' life.

370
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,844
That was the most important thing
in that situation.

371
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,393
Really, Allen? Because to me,
when I was a cop,

372
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,971
getting the bad guy,
that was the most important thing.

373
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,274
You're the Flash. You could've
saved him and caught her.

374
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,693
All right. Look, Ralph,
I'm always gonna make the decision

375
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,988
to help the person in danger first.

376
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,318
That's what we do here.

377
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,566
All right, well.

378
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,654
We'll file all that under "Superhero
Lesson of the Day," y'know?

379
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,621
- ...part chicken.
- Guys, guys.

380
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,294
I still think the best thing we can do

381
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,464
is figure out what is DeVoe's goal
and from there we can track...

382
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,006
Ugh, that's a simple plan

383
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,880
- from a simple man.
- That's not helping.

384
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,211
<i>Why don't we use
the Bates-Novick Method first?</i>

385
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,843
We determine why each meta
developed their super-powers,

386
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,136
then we smash them to bits.

387
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,184
I've seen a lot of strange here, but...

388
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,848
This takes all the cakes.

389
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,647
Okay, Council of Wells. How we doing?

390
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,144
Have we found our mystery foe yet?

391
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,319
No, we can't even agree
on what methodology to use.

392
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,436
- What?
- Yes.

393
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,942
- You've had an entire day.
- I know.

394
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,231
- Wait.
<i>- What?</i>

395
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,366
- Weren't there three of you?
- Whoo!

396
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,195
Thanks for the merry-go-round,
sweetheart. You know what I mean.

397
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,075
Sorry, I had to take care of
some off-camera business.

398
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,573
Oh, my God!

399
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,080
- What?
- I can see your frank and beans.

400
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,410
Come on now.

401
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,961
I do my best thinking commando,

402
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,084
plus it ain't like
we all haven't seen it before.

403
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,506
I haven't seen it.

404
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,085
You guys are so uptight.

405
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,342
All right. Can we just get back
to the task at hand? We need answers.

406
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,515
The best answer is always the simplest.

407
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:31,387
Why don't we go to every DeVoe
we can find and interrogate him?

408
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,104
- What, even the baby DeVoe?
- Especially the baby DeVoe.

409
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,856
Baby violence solves nothing.

410
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,690
Gentlemen, clearly, this isn't working.

411
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,366
And by the way, it's not me.

412
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,152
It's you.

413
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,114
This was a bad idea.

414
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,708
It's like your junk
has been burned into my brain.

415
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,784
You're welcome.

416
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,162
We've got the third piece
of the necklace.

417
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,999
My dad found out that it was
on display at Central City Museum,

418
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,505
but when they figured out
that it was a target...

419
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,881
<i>- It's on the move.
- Yeah.</i>

420
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,428
It's being transferred via armored car

421
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,506
to a secure storage facility
in Brookfield Heights.

422
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,307
I pinged the truck's GPS.

423
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,760
All right. Ralph, let's go.

424
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:14,892
I'll get my ugly suit.

425
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,950
Kittens...

426
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,608
<i>Hello.</i>

427
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:06,990
Are you ready to go to jail?

428
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,531
This doesn't belong in an auction house.

429
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,159
It doesn't belong
in someone's collection.

430
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,832
It belongs to the Sioux people.
My people.

431
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,328
Mina, I know you've been through
a lot, but this is not the way to...

432
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,129
I don't need to listen
to men like you anymore, Flash.

433
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,547
A few weeks ago,
something inside me changed.

434
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,674
Changed for the better.
For the more powerful.

435
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,839
And now there's just the Black Bison.

436
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,182
Oh, no, you don't.

437
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,886
The power lines. Get those people clear!

438
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,421
But I can catch the meta.

439
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,925
Laura!

440
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,851
Whoa! Whoa!

441
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,772
Told you I'd get her.

442
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,817
- Hey, the power's out.
- Help!

443
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,029
- I can't keep holding it up.
- Laura.

444
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,738
<i>Laura.</i>

445
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,116
I got her.

446
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,254
EMTs are almost here.
She's still breathing.

447
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,715
Come on, wake up, honey.

448
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,423
I need you to wake up.

449
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,303
<i>Come on, honey.</i>

450
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,274
Hey, you just rest up, okay?

451
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,443
<i>I'm gonna come back and
check on you in a little while.</i>

452
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,116
Well, a mild concussion,
and a hairline fracture in her leg.

453
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,072
She's young, so she'll heal fast.

454
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,405
- Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
- You're very welcome.

455
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,909
But considering the accident,
she's very lucky to be alive.

456
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,460
Look, Ralph, we need to talk.
You can't...

457
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,336
Don't. Just...

458
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,927
Just forget it, okay?

459
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,398
Hey, buddy. You planning on bringing
the band back together

460
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,978
or should I clear out the speed lab?

461
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,857
Broom it. We don't need
that Council of Incompetents.

462
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,275
Ah?

463
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,951
Is that what we're
calling them now, 'cause...

464
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,407
I distinctly remember you saying

465
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,659
they were the brightest minds
in all the multi-verse.

466
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,956
And the most annoying.

467
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,580
I thought if I surrounded myself
with people like me,

468
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,161
I would like them. I don't like them.

469
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,837
I hate them. I hate them all.

470
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,250
- Hmm... Strong words.
- You saw them, Ramon, right?

471
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,919
That Wolfgang Wells,
he's always correcting people,

472
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,174
an extremely annoying habit.

473
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,052
The other guy, the "Free Willy"
Wells, he is so full of himself.

474
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,054
And the other cyborg Wells,
you know how he lost his eye?

475
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,181
His daughter gouged it out at the
Solstice Combat Games.

476
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,682
I don't blame her.
I'd have done the same.

477
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,229
I'd like to gouge out the other eye.

478
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,397
- Harry.
- What?

479
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,852
You know you're essentially
complaining about yourself, right?

480
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,065
Ramon, do your best to pay attention
to the conversation.

481
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,493
I'm not complaining about myself.
I'm complaining about them.

482
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,992
Yes, we're doppelgangers. We look alike.

483
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,448
We have completely
different personalities.

484
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,789
So you don't think you can be
quick to correct people?

485
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,370
You don't think
you can be full of yourself?

486
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,456
Full of myself? No, I'm amazing.

487
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,461
I'm fantastic. I'm talking about them.

488
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,964
I don't like them.
I hate them. I hate them all.

489
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,464
You know what I think? I think
this is entirely about yourself.

490
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,469
I think underneath
all your brain and bluster,

491
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,471
you actually don't have
a very high opinion of yourself.

492
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,760
What?

493
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,595
Why do you think it's so hard
for you to make new friends?

494
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,015
- Well...
- Harry.

495
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,897
No one's gonna like you,
if you don't like yourself first.

496
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:18,362
These weirdos over here, they didn't
have to answer our call for help.

497
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,366
But they did.
'Cause you would've done the same.

498
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,324
And yes, there are some
really annoying, rough parts of you,

499
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,377
but you know what?
I've seen some amazing parts too.

500
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,583
'Cause sometimes, you're a hard-ass,
you're a hero.

501
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,218
Sometimes, you're a wizard, Harry.

502
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,757
The Council of Wells...

503
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,392
If you wanna make that work,

504
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:48,180
you have to start treating yourself
with some compassion.

505
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,353
All of yourselves.

506
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,034
Now is the time that simple Harry
has called to insult us even more.

507
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,158
I didn't call to insult, I called to...

508
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,208
- Apologize.
- Apologize...

509
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,416
Apologizing is punishable

510
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,169
by banishment
under Krung the Face-Crusher.

511
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:19,469
All right, well, that's unfortunate.
Look, I know you guys

512
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,306
prefer to work alone. You don't wanna
work with other people,

513
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,349
you think you're so smart,
you can just push them away,

514
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,892
and I can say that
because I'm one of you,

515
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,971
but if we're going to find our DeVoe,

516
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,391
then we have to work together.
We have to work as...

517
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,856
- Friends.
- Friends...

518
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,526
- With benefits.
- Yeah, no, we're not doing that.

519
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,731
But I'm sure we can

520
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,067
all find something
that we like in one another.

521
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,448
Like, you, Wells 2.0,
you're clearly very...

522
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,865
...resourceful and strong. And you,
you're extremely charismatic.

523
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,576
I'm sure you can recruit
top talent to your research teams.

524
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,876
I'll bring the talent.

525
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,129
Yeah. And you,
<i>Herr</i> Wells, you're very...

526
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,132
- Blunt.
- Yeah.

527
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,675
- Obviously.
- Right.

528
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,297
But, can we just... Can you...

529
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,806
Yeah. Sure. I'm sorry, man.
What I said before about your...

530
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,846
You know, your theory
on the behavioral upbringings

531
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,518
and nano-serial killers
being unchill, that was uncalled for.

532
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,313
I shouldn't have said that.
It's a very groovy theory. Good on you.

533
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,232
Yeah. <i>Danke.</i>

534
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,311
I suppose when I said that your theory

535
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,318
on narcotics in molecular psychiatry

536
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,991
was stupider than a theory
made by tiny babies,

537
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,659
that that was uncalled for also.

538
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,490
- There we go.
<i>- Yeah, man.</i>

539
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,538
I'm digging the whole creepy half-man,

540
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,287
half-metal vibe you got going on.

541
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,333
I just wanna say, all of you...

542
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,121
I really respect the fact
that each one of you,

543
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,836
has two eyes.

544
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah, well, we all agree
on something. That's great. So...

545
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,637
On that note, I hereby reconvene
the Council of Wells.

546
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,968
Now, about our DeVoe...

547
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,762
Well, about DeVoe, perhaps if we were

548
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,349
to combine the Bates-Novick
of our mutant friend here,

549
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,935
with my models
of statistical elimination...

550
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,863
I'll do you one more.
Maybe enhance your elimination model

551
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:05,363
with a psych profile based
on DeVoe's previous action.

552
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,738
I could whip up a predictive algorithm.

553
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,818
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

554
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,825
Run it through my quantum cerebral chip.

555
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,368
We'll find him in no time.

556
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,666
I'm starting to see
why you called these guys.

557
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,742
Yeah.

558
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:15,952
All right, gentlemen.

559
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,378
Let's get to work.

560
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,306
If you're here to tell me
how I royally screwed up

561
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,008
letting that little girl get hurt...

562
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,977
Trust me, I know.

563
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,643
<i>I keep feeling all these feelings...</i>

564
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:40,477
Guilt. Remorse. Heartburn.

565
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,651
Well, I can't help you
with that last one.

566
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,356
But maybe I can help with the rest.

567
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,484
What are all those?

568
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:49,986
<i>Past cases.</i>

569
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:51,996
Those were simpler times.

570
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,493
Husband stepping out on wife.
Wife stepping out on husband.

571
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,204
Husband stepping out on wife
and husband.

572
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,048
That one was a little less simple.

573
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,008
Ralph, it was like
you were gonna make a point.

574
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,960
My point is...

575
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,471
When I was a PI, I...

576
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,847
I didn't have to worry
about little girls in hospitals.

577
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,433
I just had to get the dirt.

578
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,773
<i>Whatever happened after that,
I wasn't there to see it.</i>

579
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,937
Now, all I see are people getting hurt,

580
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,276
or about to get hurt.

581
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,323
And for five years, I've got by
without caring about anyone.

582
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,410
Now I have to care about a whole city?

583
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,376
It's a part of the job, Ralph.

584
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,830
Maybe the most important part.

585
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:43,752
How do you do it?

586
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,128
How do you walk around knowing what
could happen to all those people?

587
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,674
I don't always handle it well.

588
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:57,558
I've made bad decisions and sometimes
it got more people hurt.

589
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,306
You just gotta do the best you can.

590
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,480
And when that's not enough,
you lean on the people around you.

591
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,405
- You mean you.
- Yeah, me, Ralph.

592
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,986
<i>Look, I brought you into this</i>

593
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,117
because I think that you have
the makings of a hero.

594
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,291
But I would be lying if I said
there won't be hard days.

595
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,286
And when there are,
you'll need someone to turn to.

596
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,540
I can be that person. If you want.

597
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,293
You'd do that for me?

598
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,384
I will make it my personal mission
to protect your heart.

599
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:38,177
Look, Ralph, I actually think it's
great you're feeling all this stuff.

600
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,390
But don't forget,
that little girl's gonna be okay.

601
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,437
And we got the bad guy.

602
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,103
Yeah.

603
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,239
We got the bad guy.

604
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,200
<i>Don't I know you
from somewhere?</i>

605
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,280
Not likely.

606
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,834
No. I do. I arrested you after
one of those protests last year.

607
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,081
Don't touch me.

608
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,379
Those artifacts are headed
for the museum.

609
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,956
And once the warden's people get here,

610
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,549
you're headed to Iron Heights.

611
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,113
Gentlemen, feast your eyes
on this wonder.

612
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,776
This bad boy's replete with polymer
coated flame resistant armor,

613
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,826
frontal impact deflection panels,
a dual-filter gas mask.

614
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:43,076
So you don't cry on your own supply.
Especially with this bad boy.

615
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,293
I call it "the onion."

616
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,913
Any questions?

617
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,539
It's time we go collect what's ours.

618
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,418
Joe just called.
Chaytan escaped from CCPD.

619
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,502
Apparently she made a tactical dummy
go full <i>Terminator</i> at the station.

620
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,881
Well, we know where she's going.

621
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,378
The necklace.

622
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,463
The two pieces she stole have been

623
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,389
reunited with the third piece
at the museum.

624
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,388
She has killed for these before,

625
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,390
she will kill anyone that gets
in her way to reclaim them.

626
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,517
It's up to us. Are you ready?

627
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,895
- Well, I was until you said that.
- What are you...

628
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,353
Jeez, Louise, man. What kind of
rousing <i>Braveheart</i> speech was that?

629
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,904
Just put your thing on.

630
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,151
- You wanna help me?
<i>- No.</i>

631
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,699
- It's really tight.
<i>- Hurry up.</i>

632
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,790
Hello, beautiful.

633
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,391
Put it down, Mina.
That belongs in a museum.

634
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,852
- This is a museum.
- Realized that after I said it.

635
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,943
Yes. You keep it here
as part of "American History."

636
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,447
But we're not history.
We are still here.

637
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,150
Still sacred. As is this necklace.

638
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,908
It's going back to the Sioux.
Get out of my way.

639
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,614
Not after the people you've hurt, Mina.

640
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,744
And you're not gonna hurt anyone else.

641
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,075
Is that so?

642
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,889
Don't move.

643
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,263
Their vision is based on movement.

644
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,848
That movie is filled with lies.

645
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,524
We have a T. rex.

646
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,503
What's going on in here?

647
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,798
Stop. I got you.

648
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,101
What you gonna do, superhero?

649
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,401
For the love of Jeff Goldblum, stop!

650
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,206
You're really never gonna
stop chasing me, are you?

651
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,993
No. I'm really not.

652
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,539
Do you have any idea how many things
I can bring to life in this place?

653
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,543
The gargoyles on the roof.

654
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,592
The reliefs carved
into the walls and support pillars.

655
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,921
I can bring this whole place down
in a matter of seconds.

656
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,296
But you won't.

657
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,224
Because there is one thing
you care about more than vengeance.

658
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,384
Isn't there?

659
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,697
I kinda can't believe
you fell for that. Come on.

660
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,076
You almost let her escape.

661
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,999
Well...

662
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,752
I kept hearing your stupid voice
telling me to protect the innocent.

663
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,212
Nice job, rookie.

664
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,059
Good boy. Stay.

665
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,363
All right. Sounds good.
I'll let everybody know.

666
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,613
Hey. That was Joe.

667
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,916
He says that Warden Wolfe has Chaytan
locked up at Iron Heights.

668
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,998
Far, far away from any mannequins,
statues, or...

669
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,877
Effigies. Looked it up.
Still say it sounds kinda dirty,

670
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,710
but I'm not the mayor
of the dictionary, so whatever.

671
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,466
Joe also said that the clean-up crew
at the museum

672
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,297
still hasn't found the Bison necklace.

673
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,803
Huh?

674
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,718
Guess somebody might've mailed it
back to the Sioux reservation.

675
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,808
Somebody?

676
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,905
You gonna yell at me again?

677
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,694
No. Not for this one.

678
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,451
Mina's friends and family...

679
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,829
They've been hurt for too long.

680
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,543
And I'm not sure if you've
heard this saying before, but,

681
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,803
"A superhero's first job
is to protect people."

682
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:30,881
Wise words.

683
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,020
You want a coffee? On me.
For real, this time.

684
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:38,977
Thanks, but...

685
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,314
I gotta see about a girl.

686
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,002
Hey, kid. How you doing?

687
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,543
Better. Thanks.

688
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,628
That...

689
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,584
That's awesome.

690
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,678
But I'm really bored.

691
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,213
Yeah.

692
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,056
Do you like balloon animals?

693
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,823
Do a giraffe next.

694
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,993
Okay, but that might take some toes.

695
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,634
Hey. What's going on?

696
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,133
- We think we know who he is.
- According to Harry's friends,

697
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,765
the name we're looking for
is Clifford. Clifford DeVoe.

698
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,184
92% match to our psychological profile.

699
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,681
No other DeVoe comes close.

700
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,978
Guy keeps a low profile.

701
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,101
No social media, no criminal record.

702
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,807
And we know where he's hiding.

703
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,310
43 Hibbard Lane.

704
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,400
Well, if he's as dangerous as you said,

705
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,527
I can call Singh.
We can get a squad over there.

706
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,941
No.

707
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,569
Let's go get him.

708
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,204
Guys, Thawne. Zoom. Savitar.

709
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,833
For once, we actually have a chance
here to get ahead of our enemy.

710
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,461
Let's go get DeVoe.

711
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,341
We're about to have guests.

712
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,549
Then let's be ready to greet them.

713
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,270
- Is this the place?
- This is the one.

714
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,183
- Is everyone set?
- Eye in the sky is a go.

715
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,143
I have eyes on the front door.

716
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,070
Snow and Frost, standing by.

717
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,613
Just give us the word,
and we'll breach in.

718
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,868
What kind of criminal mastermind
has a welcome mat?

719
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,499
Hi, can I help you?

720
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,136
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Detective Joe West, CCPD.

721
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,929
This is Barry Allen, my associate.

722
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,590
Is everything all right?

723
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:22,929
Yes. We were just hoping to talk
with Clifford DeVoe. Is he here?

724
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,851
Yes, he is.

725
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,432
May I ask what this is about, officers?

726
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,143
We just need to ask him some questions.

727
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,403
Is something wrong?
Is my husband in trouble?

728
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,072
- Your husband?
- No, ma'am.

729
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:39,112
Clifford. The police are here.
They'd like a word.

730
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,995
Thank you, dear.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

731
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:52,125
I'm Clifford DeVoe.
How may I be of help?

732
00:41:52,149 --> 00:42:00,149
