1
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:54,138
<i>This is Free City.</i>

2
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:59,477
<i>Look at this guy.
He's one of the sunglasses people.</i>

3
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:02,730
<i>And the people who wear sunglasses
are heroes.</i>

4
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:12,824
<i>They have a devil-may-care attitude
and they run this town.</i>

5
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,453
You are so hot.

6
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,621
Oh, I know.

7
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,377
<i>See? That's not even his car.</i>

8
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:26,963
<i>Or his wife.</i>

9
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:36,347
<i>For the sunglasses people,
they get to do anything they want.</i>

10
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,433
<i>They go on all sorts of missions.</i>

11
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,269
<i>They got cool hair, cool clothes.</i>

12
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:46,524
<i>I mean, laws aren't really laws to them.
They're more like mild suggestions.</i>

13
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,444
<i>Like, I don't think
he's gonna return that car.</i>

14
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,321
<i>Or that nice lady.</i>

15
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:09,589
<i>See what I mean? Hero.</i>

16
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:29,067
<i>My name is Guy,
and I live in paradise.</i>

17
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,615
Good morning, Goldie.

18
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:39,952
<i>I've lived here in Free City
my whole life.</i>

19
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,455
<i>I've got a best friend,
I've got a goldfish,</i>

20
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:45,041
<i>and I work at the bank.</i>

21
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,417
<i>What more could a guy want?</i>

22
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,002
<i>Sunday should be warm and sunny</i>

23
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,712
<i>with just a scattering of drive-bys.</i>

24
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,256
<i>Great day for the beach,
but not Hitman's Beach,</i>

25
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,342
<i>which will be mined and sprayed
with high-caliber fire</i>

26
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:55,843
<i>from a renegade gunship stolen by…</i>

27
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,011
<i>And every morning,</i>

28
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:00,098
<i>I start my day
with the most delicious coffee</i>

29
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,225
<i>in the whole, wide, whole world.</i>

30
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,851
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

31
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,311
You know it. Mmm.

32
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:07,855
Mmm!

33
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,274
That is unexpectedly hot.

34
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,818
Jeez, that's good.

35
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,862
It's like losing my virginity,
but in my mouth.

36
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,242
Thank you for making this
with such love.

37
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:20,410
You're welcome.

38
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,619
Officer Johnny!

39
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:22,829
Have a good one, Guy.

40
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,790
Don't have a good day,
have a great day!

41
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,084
Hold the fudge.

42
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:31,963
You mean to tell me that nobody snabbed
up those bad boys? Today is the day.

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,465
- Like every other day.
- I'll be back for those.

44
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,140
Oh! So close.

45
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,560
Mmm! This is the greatest cup of coffee
of all time.

46
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,061
I wanna write a song about it.

47
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,021
I wanna dance to that song with my body.

48
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,189
I love my life.

49
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,024
There's something about finding
your lane and just staying in it.

50
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,777
That's why they call 'em comfort zones,
they're so damn comfortable.

51
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,363
Oh, Joe!

52
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:00,908
Mondays, am I right, Joe?

53
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,077
- You said it, Guy.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:09,459
<i>In Free City, I have everything I need.</i>

55
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,169
Don't have a good day…

56
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,463
have a great day.

57
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,881
Thank you.

58
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,048
Take care.

59
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,885
<i>Except one thing.</i>

60
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,345
Seem happy.

61
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,639
Oh, come on, don't worry
about that, Guy. You gonna find someone.

62
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,308
Oh, it's okay, Bud.

63
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,852
Feel like I've been looking
for her forever, you know?

64
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,520
Maybe it's not meant to be.

65
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,105
Everybody down on the ground!

66
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:39,989
I know the woman I'm looking for.

67
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,532
Oh, let me guess.

68
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,284
- A woman with an offbeat sense of humor.
- Sense of humor.

69
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,786
An obsession
with feel-good diva pop.

70
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:45,870
Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

71
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,955
She's rented space in my brain
and she won't move out.

72
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,124
And you know what?
I don't want her to.

73
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,710
Well, guess what?
She won't move either in or out.

74
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,504
You know why?
'Cause she doesn't exist.

75
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,631
- She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy.
- That's cruel. You're cruel.

76
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,257
- You're being rotten right now. Rotten.
- I'm being real.

77
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,427
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

78
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,347
So how about it?
Beers on the beach after work?

79
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:06,432
Of course we're going for beers
on the beach after work.

80
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:07,809
That makes me so happy.

81
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,060
Me too.

82
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,073
What have you got?

83
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,909
Proof of a secret level.
That's what you're looking for, right?

84
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,661
You got a video or a screen grab?

85
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,496
Nope. But I know who does.

86
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,873
Wanna know what I do to people
who waste my time?

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,459
Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play.

88
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,419
Hey, you really British,
or is that an accent filter?

89
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,213
'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

90
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,925
I don't have a burning desire
to see your mum's basement, thanks.

91
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,385
Got jokes, huh?

92
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,929
Well, I got a map,
shows the location of his stash house.

93
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:49,225
Don't know how you'll get in, but if
you do, clip 56 might interest you.

94
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,811
Now, I got a question.

95
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,521
What's so special
about this video clip anyway?

96
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,732
What's special is I kill people
who ask questions about it.

97
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,609
Mmm, I see. Fun.
Yeah, that's fun.

98
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,406
Damn, girl, you're so feisty.

99
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,200
But seriously, is it loot
or is it just the experience?

100
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,661
Those are questions.

101
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,040
Did you see the sneakers
on that last robber?

102
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,250
The 2:30?

103
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,877
No, the 4:00.

104
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,130
The three-quarter high-top,
gorgeous foam soles.

105
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:21,132
I could barely feel it
when he stepped on my face.

106
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,592
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

107
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,261
Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

108
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,429
Give it to me!

109
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,889
Looks like rain.

110
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,099
Has anyone seen my cat?

111
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:34,937
You know something, Guy,
people say it all the time, like,

112
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:38,274
"Guy can take a shoe to the face
better than anybody I know."

113
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,525
I mean, when you put it on there,

114
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:40,651
you act like
it's not a shoe in your face.

115
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,747
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

116
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,081
Love that song.

117
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,920
That's a new one.

118
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,059
Hey!

119
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,020
That's her.

120
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,605
Her who?

121
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,315
That's my dream girl, Buddy.

122
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,150
She exists.

123
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,737
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

124
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,989
Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.

125
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:28,658
So?

126
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,117
Whatcha mean "so?"

127
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,244
So, people with sunglasses don't talk
to people like us.

128
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,413
- You know that!
- I gotta try.

129
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,832
Look, Guy! Guy!

130
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,877
Guy! What about beers on the beach?

131
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,297
Excuse me!

132
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,219
Hey!

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,721
Hey!

134
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,734
<i>Coming soon</i>… Free City 2!

135
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,446
<i>Bigger! Badder! Radder!</i>

136
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,490
Free City 2: Carnage.

137
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,117
<i>Pre-order today

138
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,618
You done?

139
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,621
Sorry. Are you closing?

140
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:16,706
Yes.

141
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,582
We usually don't
put the chairs on the tables,

142
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,584
one-small-coffee-over-four-hours girl.

143
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:24,714
You really like that game, huh?
My 12-year-old nephew's addicted.

144
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,549
Seems like everyone's obsessed with it.

145
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,593
Oh, <i>Free City?</i> Ah. No.

146
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,138
I, uh, have a lawsuit
against the publisher

147
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,889
and the evidence that I need
is in the game.

148
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,516
- So then I had my codes…
- Oh…

149
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,394
I wish we weren't closing
so I could hear more about this.

150
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,072
Good morning, Goldie.

151
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,830
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

152
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,958
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

153
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:07,506
Actually, I think I'd like
to try a cappuccino today.

154
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,093
Ooh. "Cappuccino."
I enjoy saying that.

155
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,596
It's like a waterfall made of letters.

156
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:14,847
Excuse me?

157
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,640
I'd like to try a cappuccino.

158
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,267
Please.

159
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,311
But you get a medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

160
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,146
That's what you get.
That's what everyone gets.

161
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,397
Every day. Always.

162
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,941
- Well, I…
- Somebody's about to get shot.

163
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,194
Officer Johnny.

164
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,614
I just thought I'd try
something different today, you know?

165
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,408
Whatever. Right? Yeah?

166
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:38,996
Hi.

167
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,459
Ha! I'm just keeping you on your toes.

168
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,712
Coffee, cream, two sugars, please.

169
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,714
I'm joking.

170
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,633
Just keeping you on your toes.
I was kidding.

171
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,801
He was just kidding!

172
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,304
Oh, you think I'd deprive myself
of your baristic artistry?

173
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,555
No way, no how.

174
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,266
Mmm. That's hot.

175
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,895
It's like Jesus
washed my tongue…

176
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,773
but right before he finished,
he finally told my dad,

177
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,567
"He's good enough."

178
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,404
Thank you so much.
Officer Johnny!

179
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,489
Have a good one, Guy.

180
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,079
Cappuccino.

181
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,998
Don't have a good day…

182
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,793
… have a great day, I guess.

183
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,088
Okay. Good day to you.

184
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:33,134
Everybody down on the ground!

185
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,761
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

186
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,955
That's the girl.

187
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,039
We've been over this.

188
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,958
You tried to talk to her yesterday,
it didn't work.

189
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,543
It will never work.

190
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,919
She's wearing sunglasses.

191
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,504
We don't mess
with the sunglasses people.

192
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,590
Maybe I'll get
some sunglasses of my own.

193
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,757
What? What are you talking about?
You can't do that.

194
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,384
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

195
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,219
Hi.

196
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,554
What'd you say?

197
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,098
Hi.

198
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,684
I'm gonna need your sunglasses.

199
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,852
Ooh. Ow.

200
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:25,936
I'm just gonna…

201
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,396
I'm gonna
need your sunglasses for a sec.

202
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,772
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

203
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:29,982
Go back to your side, man.

204
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:32,318
He's just an NPC.
Waste that mother…

205
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,944
Okay, just need to borrow them
for a sec, okay?

206
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,322
- Back off! I said, don't!
- Just real quick. Real quick.

207
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,408
Stop!

208
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,660
You broken or somethin'?

209
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,870
I'm the robber!

210
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,538
You're the guy who lies down
and takes it!

211
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,706
Please, just stay down!

212
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,792
I said, stay down!

213
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,336
Guy, you don't do this, man.

214
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,504
This isn't you.

215
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,923
You don't do this.

216
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,425
Maybe I do.

217
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,136
What is wrong with this…

218
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,304
stupid mission?

219
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:01,722
I told you to smoke his ass.

220
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:02,890
Let go!

221
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:04,683
I'll give them right back.

222
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,685
I said…

223
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,441
Guy?

224
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,572
He's just resting.

225
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:19,949
In pieces!

226
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,283
That man is dead!

227
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,494
He's so sleepy.

228
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,414
I'm just gonna put your gun down…

229
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,458
right here…

230
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,669
for when you wake.

231
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,796
- Okay?
- Guy.

232
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,091
Guy! Where you goin'?

233
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,415
Excuse me.

234
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,875
Do you see this?

235
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,212
Have the quarterly reports
on my desk by Friday.

236
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,318
Whoo!

237
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,611
Oh!

238
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,904
Giddy up!

239
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,282
I feel brand new.

240
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:55,753
<i>Loser.</i>

241
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,555
What is happening?

242
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,018
So much money.

243
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,539
Hey, Mouser, check this out.

244
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,957
What's up, Keys?

245
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,209
What am I looking at?

246
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,920
Okay, so this user,
he gets his glasses stolen

247
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,088
and then killed.

248
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,131
The guy was smoked
by a non-playable character.

249
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,883
An NPC? That's impossible.

250
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,635
Yeah, exactly.

251
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,929
Nobody can equip an NPC skin
on their avatar.

252
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:50,933
Yeah, so you just boot the trash-ass
noob and ban him for life, you're done.

253
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,143
I tried that, but I…

254
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,770
I can't trace him.

255
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,107
Whoever it is, they're good.

256
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,360
Hmm. You gotta be better
at your job, buddy.

257
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:03,946
I'm pretty good.

258
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,197
I'll see you on the inside.

259
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,365
<i>Select your skin.</i>

260
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,409
Hey, Keys, what skin are you going with?

261
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,244
The ushe. Dirty stripper cop,

262
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,787
big guns, bigger mustache.

263
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,414
Hmm. Little dirt squirrel. I like it.

264
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,541
Almost scared to ask,
but what are you going with?

265
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:19,169
Uh, full body mustache, hot pink.
You should be very afraid.

266
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,754
I'm terrified.

267
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,381
Let's do this.

268
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,750
Seriously, man.

269
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,296
I'm just being honest, I think
the bunny suit is just a little much.

270
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,923
Excuse me?

271
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,759
Right.

272
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,511
Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

273
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,682
Hey, 40-year-old virgin!
Get over here!

274
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:14,850
Let's go!

275
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,185
Uh-huh. Captain Khakis.

276
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,145
- Come here. Come on, bud.
- Go, let's go.

277
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,897
- Closer.
- There he is.

278
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,607
Blue shirt guy.

279
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,442
Blue shirt?

280
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,068
Yes.

281
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,154
Hello, Officer.

282
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,323
Rabbit.

283
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,449
Nice skin.

284
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,993
Thank you. That's sweet.

285
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,369
How'd you get it?

286
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:37,873
Well, uh, mostly genetics,
I think. I'm pretty lucky.

287
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,583
I have naturally dewy skin.

288
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,918
Listen up, Neutrogena.

289
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,212
You know you can't go around
looking like that. The rules are clear.

290
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,379
And another thing.

291
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,881
- You can't hack the NPC avatars.
- No, sir!

292
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,216
- It screws up the mission load…
- Screws it up!

293
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,550
… and it makes the game look bad.

294
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,968
- Horrible!
- Yeah.

295
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,803
I got, like, 5% of that.

296
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,514
Lose the skin!

297
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,890
I… Lose?

298
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,683
How am I supposed to get rid of my skin?

299
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,851
Take it off, man.

300
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,228
Just take it off.
What are you doing?

301
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,437
- What?
- Seriously.

302
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,980
- The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
- How?

303
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,273
- Everything. Ditch it.
- Take it off.

304
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,691
If you don't, we're gonna kill you.

305
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,318
- Why?
- And we're gonna keep killing you.

306
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:07,528
Still why?

307
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,946
Until we do find out who you are…

308
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,697
and then we're gonna ban you for life.

309
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,159
Okay. No, no.
Okay, I want to comply.

310
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,453
I just find the order of those threats
very confusing.

311
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,205
- Somebody's about to get shot.
- Light him up!

312
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,765
No.

313
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,110
Come on, Blue Shirt.

314
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,841
Oh! Didn't see that one coming.
Did you see that one coming?

315
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,134
Scared me a little bit.

316
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,760
We're coming for you, Blue Shirt!

317
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,220
Coming to get ya.

318
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,888
We're coming to get ya.

319
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,517
Wait! Wait!

320
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,060
I can explain everything.

321
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:25,939
I found these glasses
and then I can see things now.

322
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,609
Things that… Whoa, whoa.
Things that aren't there.

323
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,485
Except they are there.

324
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,905
I know that sounds crazy, but it's true!

325
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,993
You can run, Blue Shirt,
but you cannot hide.

326
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,579
Come on, Blue Shirt.
You can't escape the rabbit.

327
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,789
We're apex predators.

328
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:46,543
All we do is bone and brawl
and slit throats.

329
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,254
Too high! Too high!

330
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,807
Oh, you wanna play, Blue Shirt?
Watch this.

331
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,853
I tire of these games, Keys. It's time
I went god-mode on this beyotch.

332
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,104
Okay, bring it.

333
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,023
Oh, it's brung. Go, go, go, go, go.

334
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,915
I'm so, so good at this.

335
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,008
Time's up, bank teller!

336
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,073
Nope!

337
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:23,765
I can't die!

338
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,517
I'm never gonna die!

339
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,601
Whoo!

340
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,855
And that was the heartbreaking story
of Blue Shirt Guy.

341
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,106
The end.

342
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,316
- Doesn't make sense.
- What?

343
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,526
I just checked the server stats.

344
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,070
We killed Blue Shirt and the number
of players online didn't change.

345
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,280
It's just a glitch, man.

346
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,489
- It's not a big deal.
- I know, I know.

347
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,116
It just seems like
that's something new, you know?

348
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,535
Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay?
You should not talk to Antwan.

349
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,370
I just think it's important
to be transparent, okay?

350
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,455
Uh-uh. No.

351
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,249
Antwan is deep in the sequel launch.
He's either not gonna care

352
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,335
or he's gonna get pissed
and then he's gonna blame us.

353
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,338
So, I don't know what you haven't
figured out about the whole situation.

354
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:59,760
Also, aren't you some kinda MIT genius,
indie game designer?

355
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,429
What are you doing down here dealing
with complaints?

356
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:06,433
That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic
story involving failed dreams,

357
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,685
desperation,
and a mountain of college debt.

358
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,479
You do not wanna hear about that.

359
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,022
You're absolutely right.

360
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:16,359
That story sounds horrible and boring
and full of white privilege.

361
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,278
Don't talk to Antwan.

362
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:25,535
<i>We never dreamt
this would've happened.</i>

363
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,246
I mean, <i>Life Itself,</i> it's essentially
a fishbowl game.

364
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,000
People aren't playing it,
they're watching it grow.

365
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,835
It's a strictly observational experience

366
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,672
where computer generated characters
interact and evolve.

367
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,633
I thought we'd be lucky to give it away.

368
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,262
That's what's so charming about Keys,
he's clueless about his own genius.

369
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,056
Uh, no, Millie is the genius.

370
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,684
Uh, she built the Al engine
from the ground up.

371
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,186
So, to get a little personal,

372
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,271
what's the thing that gets you up
in the morning?

373
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,857
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

374
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,360
What's the other thing?

375
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,904
Oh, yeah.
An insatiable thirst for validation.

376
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,531
- She's not kidding.
- I'm not.

377
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:03,865
How about you?

378
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,450
- Code.
- Code?

379
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,535
- Code.
- Code, yeah.

380
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,619
Here we go.

381
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,454
'Cause it's not just zeros
and ones, it's hidden messages.

382
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,624
I like to think of myself, actually,
as not a code writer, but an author.

383
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:17,170
I just use zeros and ones instead
of words 'cause words will let you down.

384
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:21,675
But zeros and ones, never.
Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

385
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,468
- He's not kidding.
- I'm not.

386
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,220
Now, I've gotta ask.

387
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,597
There is a lot of chemistry between
the two of you.

388
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,600
- Has this evolved into more than…
- No.

389
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,103
- No way. No. It's strictly platonic.
- No, no, no. We're friends.

390
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,354
- We're like best friends.
- Friendship.

391
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,106
And now your game
is gonna be released by Soonami,

392
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,691
one of the biggest publishers
in the world.

393
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,693
<i>- It's crazy, actually.
- It is, yeah.</i>

394
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,612
<i>It does seem a little bit
like an unlikely pairing, though.</i>

395
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,990
<i>Yeah,
I didn't totally get it either.</i>

396
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,659
<i>But Millie's got a real instinct
for these things…</i>

397
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,077
<i>Antwan is a genius.</i>

398
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:52,581
<i>He's brash and obnoxious,
but he's really good at what he does.</i>

399
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,916
<i>It's a chance for our work
to be seen by a wider audience.</i>

400
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,043
- God, those two were young and dumb.
- Jeez.

401
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,670
So we're breaking and entering now?

402
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,757
How does it feel working for a galactic
black hole of frozen shit?

403
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,885
You have to leave. I can't talk to you.

404
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,595
Aw, shame will have that effect.

405
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,388
No, Millie. I mean I can't talk to you.

406
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,016
I can't even see you. I'm literally
focusing on background objects

407
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,184
because looking at your lips move
violates my NDA

408
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,603
and it could get me fired.

409
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,272
Aw, fired by Antwan,
the guy who stole our work?

410
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,107
No, he bought it and then he shelved it.

411
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,319
All right? You're living in the past.
You are stuck. You gotta move on.

412
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,570
How can I move on?

413
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,113
How can you?

414
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,116
Antwan swiped our Al engine
to use in his dumb shooter.

415
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:31,745
Did he, Millie?
Because honestly, I'm not so sure.

416
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,456
Our game was complex
and beautiful and interesting

417
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:37,876
and <i>Free City,</i> it may be popular, but
it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

418
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:39,878
Then stop defending him
and help me beat his ass.

419
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,213
- Millie, I'm…
- Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

420
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:43,715
And now he's lying about it

421
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:46,176
so he doesn't have to give us the credit
and the royalties that we deserve.

422
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,344
Millie…

423
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,930
I found a clue.
It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.

424
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,475
All I need from you
is to get me in there.

425
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,894
Millie, I care about you…

426
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,025
but you need to leave.

427
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,369
Today is gonna be different, Goldie.

428
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,764
What are we lookin' at?

429
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,600
Who are you?

430
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,977
Okay, okay. Okay.

431
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,730
We ran into each other the other day,
you were humming that great song.

432
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:22,897
Oh, yeah.

433
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,650
I thought you were an NPC.
How did you find me?

434
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:28,778
I waited outside by the murder train,

435
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,196
then I followed you.

436
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,281
Shit!

437
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,006
Should I come with you?

438
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,508
Yes.

439
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,179
Holy hell, what just happened?

440
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,765
What just happened
is you almost blew my mission.

441
00:25:57,098 --> 00:26:00,060
No, I mean, how did we get from there
to wherever this is?

442
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,478
You mean the portal gun?

443
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,563
Portal gun?
That sounds expensive.

444
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,857
Wow, you are a special kind of noob.

445
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,150
Thank you. You too.

446
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,318
Turn around.

447
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,403
Okay.

448
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,741
Oh.

449
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,371
Is this the North Pole?

450
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,956
Listen, dude.

451
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,666
- Guy.
- Guy. Whatever.

452
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,543
Props on the NPC outfit,

453
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,129
but I'm busy trying to figure out
how to steal something.

454
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,048
Maybe I could help you.

455
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,257
I work alone.

456
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,842
You have beautiful grenades.

457
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,762
Besides, if you want to have any chance
of making an impact here,

458
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,597
you need to have
a higher level than that.

459
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,641
- That's tough. No.
- No.

460
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:41,392
Higher level?

461
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,685
Good Lord, rook.

462
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,480
See?

463
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,190
- Oh.
- That's mine.

464
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:48,817
And that's yours.

465
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:53,613
Oh… What,
is one the best or the worst?

466
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,281
There is literally nothing lower.

467
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,200
Well, how do I get to a higher level?

468
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,285
- Really?
- Really.

469
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:03,414
- You know, get stuff.
- Yeah.

470
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:04,874
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Okay.

471
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,876
- Experience, guns…
- Yeah.

472
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,961
- Put that down.
- Uh-huh.

473
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,463
Money. This is Free City.

474
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,632
You could rob a store,
carjack someone,

475
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,884
punch a pedestrian in the face.
You'll figure it out.

476
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,470
Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

477
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,393
Hmm. I've got to admit
that is kind of refreshing.

478
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:27,897
Sometimes I forget not everyone you meet
on here is a sociopathic man-child.

479
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,233
Thank you.

480
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,986
Wait. But the world
isn't that bad though, is it?

481
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,780
Oh! It's pretty bleak.

482
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,992
If you ever met the dick responsible
for this world, you'd agree.

483
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,704
Are we talking about God?
You've met God?

484
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,081
And he's a dick?

485
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:47,792
His name's Antwan,
and yes, he's an absolute troll.

486
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:49,669
Trolls exist?

487
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,339
Look, I don't know if anybody does it,

488
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:56,342
but you could rack experience points up
by being a good guy.

489
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,428
- Like a hero.
- Ooh. Easy, tiger.

490
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,555
If you don't wanna shoot people,
you could steal their guns.

491
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,098
All that shit makes your level go up.

492
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,641
Go be the good guy.

493
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,059
Okay. No, I'm gonna be the great guy.

494
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,352
Ooh! Ooh.

495
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,730
Okay, well, enjoy your
lifetime supply of virginity.

496
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:09,898
Off you go.

497
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,108
Okay. Wait! How will I know
that I've leveled up enough?

498
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:15,028
- Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk.
- Whoa.

499
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,779
- Bye now.
- That's so much more than one.

500
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,198
- It's like 99 more…
- Bye now.

501
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,365
Okay.

502
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,279
Hi.

503
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:27,475
Thanks, Guy.

504
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:48,788
Good morning, Goldie.

505
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:50,873
Good morning, Goldie.

506
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,209
Good fucking morning, Goldie.

507
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:57,130
<i>I have three words for you.
Blue Shirt Guy.</i>

508
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:01,884
<i>BSG is leveling up and at a record pace
by playing the hero.</i>

509
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:05,513
<i>It's got people all over the world
asking, "Just who is this guy?"</i>

510
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,225
I don't know who this guy is,
but he's out-skilling all these players.

511
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,019
<i>And here he is,
taking out Beefoven,</i>

512
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:12,979
<i>a level 102 from Clan Ragnarok.</i>

513
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:15,023
<i>- This is bullshit.
- Who is this guy?</i>

514
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,274
<i>I don't know, but he's good.</i>

515
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,651
<i>Yeah, he's good.
He looks like an NPC</i>

516
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:21,070
<i>but he's running around,
leveling up crazy fast</i>

517
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,363
<i>by being the freaking good guy.</i>

518
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,616
"This colorful character
in the video game <i>Free City</i>

519
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,619
"has been turning heads
by being the good guy."

520
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,538
- Piper.
- Who is Blue Shirt Guy?

521
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,789
You're absolutely right.

522
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:36,961
Blue Shirt Guy.
Who is he or she indeed?

523
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,019
Whoo-hoo!

524
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:05,656
There's a worldwide craze that has
captured kids' hearts— Blue Shirt Guy!

525
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,283
Hello, Hinata.

526
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,535
You have a great outfit.

527
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:10,953
Don't have a good day…

528
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,538
Have a GREAT day!

529
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,416
Crazy awesome!!!

530
00:31:56,457 --> 00:32:00,044
Well, well, well. Look who decided
to come to work today, huh?

531
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,422
Look, where have you been?
I've been worried sick about you…

532
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:04,507
What is this shirt?

533
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,050
Where's your collar at?
Where's the rest of the buttons?

534
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:08,803
And it's not tucked in.
You look sloppy.

535
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,639
Matter of fact, you look horrible.
Did you pick up some muscles, too?

536
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,015
Or is somebody outside pumping you up?

537
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:16,060
I'm sorry
that I haven't been around, Bud.

538
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:17,562
I've been figuring some stuff out.

539
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,606
Whatcha mean, "figure stuff out"?
It is nothing to figure out.

540
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,775
Okay? You go to bed, you wake up,

541
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,444
you get some coffee,
then you come to work.

542
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,112
And then you repeat
the same thing tomorrow.

543
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,738
- The girl.
- Oh, my God.

544
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,365
I talked to her. I talked to her.

545
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,868
- The one with the sunglasses?
- The sunglasses, yes!

546
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,995
I talked to one of the sunglass people

547
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,539
and now I'm one of the sunglass people.

548
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,249
Me.

549
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:39,834
Everybody down on the ground!

550
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,419
You're so hot.

551
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:44,380
What if I could tell you
that you could be more?

552
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:45,715
Your life could be fuller.

553
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,009
That you're free to make
your own decisions. Your own choices.

554
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:49,177
Yo, dumbass.

555
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,636
We are in the middle of something.

556
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,430
Uh…

557
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:54,474
- That's my gun.
- Quiet time.

558
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:58,603
These puppies changed my life.
And they're gonna change yours, too.

559
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,438
Come on now,
you know we don't wear sunglasses.

560
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:04,233
We do now.

561
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:06,986
<i>Mine now.</i>

562
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,488
Are you kidding me?

563
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,658
- Put 'em on.
- No.

564
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,869
Life doesn't have to be something
that just happens to us. All right?

565
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:17,580
Just put the glasses on
and you're gonna see.

566
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,499
You're gonna see.

567
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:23,878
Come on.

568
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,255
I can't, okay?

569
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,425
I'm sorry.

570
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,100
I'm keeping these, asshole mouth.

571
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,520
Now get out of here. Go be nicer.

572
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,605
Beat it. Go, go, go.

573
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,273
Don't walk, run.

574
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,400
And you…

575
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:47,860
Ugh.

576
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:49,028
Sorry.

577
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,865
Um, you could do so much better
than that guy.

578
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:56,118
You could be with, like, a good guy.

579
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:59,539
Or maybe
I don't have to be with any guy.

580
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,083
Right? Exactly.
Most of them are awful.

581
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,876
- They really are.
- Terrible.

582
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,253
Yeah, do whatever you wanna do.

583
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,220
You're my best friend, Buddy.

584
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,639
And you don't have to be scared.

585
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:19,475
If you change your mind, I'll be around.

586
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,025
Yo, Keys,
our Blue Shirt Guy is everywhere.

587
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:29,986
I know.

588
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,487
Who is this guy?

589
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:01,642
I'm here.

590
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,853
<i>I really appreciate this, Keys.</i>

591
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,980
Okay. Just to be clear,

592
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,983
all I'm doing right now
is opening the door.

593
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,236
If this clip really does prove
that Antwan reused our code illegally,

594
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:13,404
go find it and get out.

595
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:18,909
Player's doing the jewelry store mission
in midtown.

596
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,536
That gives you 5 minutes.

597
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,206
<i>And go.</i>

598
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,801
Keys, you're a goddamn genius.

599
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:36,969
<i>Really?</i>

600
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,554
I'm sitting on the toilet right now,
stealing user codes,

601
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,389
so I don't exactly feel like one.

602
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,724
Oh, you never have.

603
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,184
Good thing I know better.

604
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:47,438
<i>All right. The clip you're looking
for should be on the wall to your left.</i>

605
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:49,357
- Thanks for the assist.
<i>- You got it.</i>

606
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:50,941
<i>I hope it has the proof
you're looking for.</i>

607
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,760
Keys! I need your help!

608
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,553
He's got that place booby-trapped
with spawn points.

609
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,805
Millie, I can't help you.

610
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:43,494
Blue Shirt Guy?

611
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:47,289
It's a Henley. Was that cool?
It felt really cool.

612
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:50,918
You look really pretty.
Wow, this house is so nice.

613
00:36:58,551 --> 00:36:59,552
What are you doing here?

614
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,555
I was trying to steal a video clip,
now we're trying not to die.

615
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:04,765
Who are you talking to?

616
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:09,437
You know, that player in the NPC skin.

617
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,273
Millie, there are no other players
in that house.

618
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,776
That actually hurt my hand.

619
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,027
Get down!

620
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,704
I'm sorry! Oh, God!

621
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:14,460
We're doing great.

622
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,348
Wow!

623
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:31,018
We should definitely go!

624
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:33,687
Oh, shit!

625
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,072
- Is that a Glock in your pocket?
- No.

626
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,157
- What?
- It's two Glocks.

627
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,368
Oh!

628
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,735
I don't suppose this thing can fly.

629
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:22,987
No.

630
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,238
Jump.

631
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:26,073
Wow!

632
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,201
Whoa!

633
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,420
Oh, shit.

634
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:55,936
Good morning, sheeple!

635
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,438
Oh, you are fired.

636
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,274
There is some concern with the bloody
zombies, retailers won't carry the game.

637
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,984
Cut it. It's out.
Never even happened. Next.

638
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,235
It's your lawyers.
They need to get your deposition…

639
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,988
Speak. Which lawsuit
are we talking about?

640
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,657
Millie, Millie Rusk?
No sweat.

641
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,451
That will never see
the inside of a courtroom…

642
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:13,454
because she's got no proof
and her ex-partner works for me.

643
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:14,622
We're golden.

644
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,290
Antwan, hey. You look great.

645
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,708
Uh, I thought you were
still at Burning Man.

646
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,127
Oh, does it look like
I'm still at Burning Man?

647
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:21,295
You, you, you…

648
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,631
No. So, shut your stupid,
bearded face and listen.

649
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,174
You heard about the asshole
running around in the game

650
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:26,508
who looks like an NPC?

651
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,178
Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy.
But we're gonna get rid of him.

652
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:32,765
Don't get rid of him. People like him.
It's all over social media. No.

653
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:35,935
In fact, know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna use the skin in <i>Free City 2.</i>

654
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,355
Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some
upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right?

655
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,440
'Roid him out.
Make him a hitman or something.

656
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,401
Antwan, we're already way behind porting
over the skins from <i>Free City 1.</i>

657
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,153
Skins?
Don't even worry about that.

658
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,863
They won't be usable in <i>Free City 2.</i>

659
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,156
Antwan, you told the fans…

660
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:51,617
<i>Free City 2</i> is backwards compatible.
It was in the commercial.

661
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:53,827
You said there'd be the same characters
in the sequel.

662
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:57,331
Well, here's the thing.
When I said that, I was lying.

663
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,708
Listen, Antwan,
the game is already buggier than ever.

664
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,210
I got a stack of user complaints,
like a mile high.

665
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:02,711
Look, I know it sucks.

666
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:07,424
But the IP recognition is rock hard.
Okay? So don't even worry about it.

667
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:10,594
I'm just saying,
we could make an original game.

668
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,720
What?

669
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:14,306
Make an original? Why would I do that
when I could make a sequel?

670
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:15,474
A sequel.

671
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,684
So we can make it better?

672
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,770
IPs and sequels,
that is the thing that people want.

673
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:21,105
- Let me ask you a question.
- Okay.

674
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,648
You love Kentucky Fried Chicken, right?

675
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:23,732
- Mmm-hmm.
- No.

676
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,735
If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken,
and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken,

677
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,737
and I know that you love
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

678
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,531
why would I make
another restaurant called,

679
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:32,741
uh, I don't know,
"Albuquerque Boiled Turkey"?

680
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,868
- Okay? Makes no sense, homie.
- Mmm-hmm. No sense.

681
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,787
What am I gonna give you? A sequel.

682
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,372
Kentucky Fried Chicken-Chicken,
Part Two.

683
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:41,250
Uh, yum.
Drop the deuce on him.

684
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,627
Come on. Come here. Come here.

685
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:44,920
I don't want you to stress

686
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:46,505
that glorious shampoo commercial head
of yours about it.

687
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,634
<i>Free City 2</i> is gonna be jumunjious.

688
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:52,553
That's not a word.

689
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,223
You sure you don't wanna bump up
to programming?

690
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,183
I know you got the brains for it.

691
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,478
No thanks. I'm good right where I am.

692
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,901
Love it. Fear of flying.
Can't say I can relate.

693
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,279
But all good with me
if I don't have to pay you more.

694
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:11,989
Antwan out.

695
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,209
Who is this guy?

696
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:33,469
Wow!

697
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,179
I took your advice.

698
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:38,307
I leveled up.

699
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,559
Impressive.

700
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,354
Why are you doing all of this?

701
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:48,442
You know, I guess I felt… trapped.

702
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,028
You know, in my life.

703
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:53,238
I just felt so…

704
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,032
Stuck.

705
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,745
Yeah. And then I saw you.

706
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,998
Then I saw you.

707
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,084
Who are you?

708
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,002
I'm Guy.

709
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:09,129
No, who are you really?

710
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:10,297
Still Guy.

711
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,426
All of this, leveling up so fast.

712
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,513
Giving this whole world the finger.

713
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,931
How are you pulling this off?

714
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:22,059
I've never given anyone
any of my fingers.

715
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:23,894
You work at Soonami, don't you?

716
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:25,687
- No.
- You've got an inside track.

717
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,523
- I work at the bank.
- Right. The bank.

718
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:31,735
So, you're just this incredible hacker
who happens to work at the bank.

719
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:33,237
Yes, I work at the bank.

720
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:35,572
Where did you get that skin?

721
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:38,575
It's always sort of been there.

722
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,869
Why do people keep asking me
that question?

723
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,788
I don't know, why do they?

724
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:49,002
No, no. Not doing that. I…

725
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:51,463
What's happening right now?

726
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,423
I don't know, but I don't buy it.

727
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,883
No.

728
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,844
- Okay, fine. I'll forget it.
- Fine. Good.

729
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,303
- I'll let it go.
- Yes.

730
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:00,013
Great.

731
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,515
We all have our secrets, I guess.

732
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,267
Yes, we do.

733
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:06,937
Hey.

734
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:10,566
Do you like ice cream?

735
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,235
I can't believe
I've never been here.

736
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,237
Well, it's sort of a secret.

737
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:19,324
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy,
always come here. It's quiet and safe.

738
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,118
Yeah, it makes sense.

739
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,163
No missions here.

740
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:28,375
Oh, you gotta try this.
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

741
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:29,918
This is my favorite flavor
in the whole world.

742
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:32,296
- We'll take two of the usual, please.
- You got it, Guy.

743
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,423
It's bubble gum flavor.

744
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,049
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

745
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:37,593
Guy…

746
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,804
Get out of my brain hole!
I love bubble gum ice cream.

747
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:42,556
No, you don't.
Are you making fun of me right now?

748
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,933
No! Nobody likes bubble gum ice cream.

749
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,101
No, I do.

750
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:47,603
I had a relationship end
over bubble gum ice cream.

751
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:48,937
- No way. Here.
- Yeah.

752
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,606
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

753
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:51,690
Mmm.

754
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,066
How good is that?

755
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:54,318
You can taste it?

756
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:57,905
Taste it? It's like my tongue
had a baby with a sunrise.

757
00:44:58,405 --> 00:44:59,531
- Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.

758
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:02,826
Coffee used to be my favorite food,

759
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:05,162
but compared to this,
it tastes like liquid suffering.

760
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,289
What?

761
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,878
Nothing. You're funny.

762
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:15,589
- I am?
- Yeah.

763
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:18,258
Weird funny.

764
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:20,719
But that's kind of my speed.

765
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,888
Weird funny,
that's totally my speed, too.

766
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:24,973
- Great.
- Yeah. I know a joke.

767
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,516
A weird funny joke.
You wanna hear it?

768
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:27,768
- Please.
- Okay.

769
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:30,938
A homosexual
and a man in a wheelchair

770
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:33,232
are trying to murder
a very small child…

771
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:35,609
- The cripple says to the homosexual…
- Whoa. Stop, stop.

772
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:37,861
Stop! Where did you hear that?

773
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:40,530
A robbery.
The gunman told it to the driver

774
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:43,742
who thought it was hilarious,
so I memorized it and told everyone.

775
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,744
Word of advice?

776
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:48,956
Don't crib your jokes
from the trolls of <i>Free City.</i>

777
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,123
Trolls?

778
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,541
Is that a swing set?

779
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:18,527
Holy…

780
00:46:26,243 --> 00:46:28,537
Okay, this is too weird.

781
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:31,665
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice cream,
and now swings?

782
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:34,001
- This is too weird.
- I thought the same thing, too.

783
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,544
I thought the same thing.

784
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:38,630
When I was younger,
I was obsessed with swings.

785
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:41,967
<i>Growing up in my family, it was…</i>

786
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,428
You don't wanna hear this. No.

787
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:47,014
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

788
00:46:47,097 --> 00:46:48,598
Oh.

789
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,643
Growing up in my family,
it wasn't good enough to be great.

790
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:55,814
You had to win, and that pressure,
you know,

791
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:57,941
<i>it was just constant.</i>

792
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,945
But when I was in the backyard
on that little swing…

793
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:03,238
You know that moment,

794
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:07,242
<i>that split second between
rising and falling,</i>

795
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,369
when you're totally weightless,
it feels like you're free.

796
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:10,454
In love.

797
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:12,748
Free. What you said. Yeah.

798
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:17,711
I really wanna kiss you.
Is that weird?

799
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:20,339
You want to kiss me?

800
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,842
I wanna kiss you so badly.

801
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,469
You want to kiss me badly?

802
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,012
- No!
- No?

803
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:28,930
No, no, no, no, no.
I wanna kiss you well.

804
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:30,640
I mean, I'm an idiot,

805
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,267
so I say things
like an idiot sometimes.

806
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,727
No, you're not. You're not.

807
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:35,187
I mean, um,

808
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:38,648
uh, if you know how to, go for it.

809
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:39,983
I know how.

810
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,235
Okay.

811
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:45,906
Here it goes.

812
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:12,474
That was so much better than ice cream.

813
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:13,934
Whoa!

814
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:15,435
I think someone's at the door.

815
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:16,603
I'll say.

816
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,563
Well, this was great.

817
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,856
Yeah, it was.

818
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,733
Let's meet up again sometime soon.
Yeah?

819
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:23,610
Yes. Definitely.

820
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,153
Maybe in the real world.

821
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,405
What?

822
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:28,240
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

823
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:29,783
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

824
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,953
Bye, Molotov.

825
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,957
Hey… my real name is Millie.

826
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,962
My real name continues to be Guy.

827
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:51,805
Millie, open up! Millie, it's me,
it's Keys! Open up! Come on!

828
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:54,683
Millie! It's me, open up!

829
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,810
- What?
- You were right.

830
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,229
- You were right.
- Oh, come on in.

831
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:01,815
You were right.
Our code, it is in <i>Free City</i>

832
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:04,693
and, Millie, it works.

833
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,361
Yeah, I know. But we don't have proof.

834
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:08,405
Just forget about that
for one second.

835
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,782
I'm saying that our game, <i>Life Itself,</i>

836
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,743
where characters would grow
and change and feel real…

837
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,995
- Yeah?
- … worked.

838
00:49:15,162 --> 00:49:16,788
- Keys.
- The Al worked.

839
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:20,292
It's the reason why <i>Free City</i> is
so realistic and people love it so much.

840
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,335
And of course it doesn't look the same.

841
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:25,297
There's no waterfalls,
there's no butterflies and unicorns,

842
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:28,258
all the characters have different skins.
Of course they do.

843
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:32,846
But the underlying code in the game
is the same. Our code.

844
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,764
And Guy, I mean, he has evolved
way further

845
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:35,849
than we thought was even possible.

846
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,351
Wait, are you talking about the hacker
in the NPC skin?

847
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:41,938
Millie, I'm talking about the fact
that Blue Shirt Guy…

848
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,106
Yeah?

849
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:44,691
… is not a player.

850
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:47,944
He is an algorithm
who thinks he's alive.

851
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,280
I mean, hell, technically, he is alive.

852
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:54,493
He is the first real
artificial intelligence.

853
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,704
- No! No.
- I know.

854
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,247
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

855
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:00,790
- Guy? My Guy?
- Guy.

856
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,125
- One who has been…
- Your Guy?

857
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:03,418
- Holy…
- This is a good thing.

858
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:05,086
No, it's really bad.

859
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:08,423
Millie, his code, it's thousands
of times the size it should be.

860
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,925
We did it, Mills.

861
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:14,971
We did it. Everything that we wanted
to create, it actually happened.

862
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:18,058
Okay? Did you know
that the NPCs have private lives?

863
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:21,102
One of the baristas learned how to make
a cappuccino through trial and error.

864
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,271
I mean, that's really difficult.
I can't even do that.

865
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,357
I can't even froth my own oat milk
in the morning.

866
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,068
And the Bombshell character in the game

867
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:30,946
wrote a memoir
that's a searing indictment

868
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,822
of gender roles, the patriarchy…

869
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,783
It's a little preachy in parts,
but overall, it's pretty good.

870
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:35,951
Millie, we have to celebrate!

871
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:37,869
- No, this can't be happening.
- What are you talking about?

872
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:40,539
- This is what we've been working for!
- No, I let him kiss me!

873
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,500
So, yeah.

874
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,421
I'm sorry, wait, you let who kiss you?

875
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:49,631
Guy.

876
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:51,758
Guy?

877
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:56,555
The first time I kiss a non-toxic guy
in like forever

878
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,349
and of course he's not even real!

879
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:00,850
Uh, there's not a button for that.

880
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,186
Oh, he found the button.

881
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,813
- Okay.
- Yeah.

882
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,190
- I am… I'm so confused.
- Why is it so hot?

883
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,525
And surprisingly curious.

884
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:12,904
You let an artificially intelligent

885
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:14,698
- video game character kiss you?
- Oh, okay,

886
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,324
- can you just stop saying it like that?
- And then you thought that would be…

887
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:18,368
Because you have got to meet him, Keys.

888
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:21,496
He's funny, and he's sweet,
and he's so handsome.

889
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:23,915
Oh, my God,
now I'm saying it out loud.

890
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:27,544
Also, Millie, food for thought,
he's like four.

891
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:30,839
- Really? You're gonna do that?
- Really.

892
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:32,632
Wow, you just made that really creepy.

893
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,010
Millie, put all that aside.

894
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,386
Weird or not,
when people find out about this,

895
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,055
you could win a Nobel Prize.
Oh, God.

896
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,223
What?

897
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:41,766
Oh, my God, if they see this…

898
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:43,518
- What? What is it?
- Oh!

899
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:45,020
Antwan. What else?

900
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:47,981
He's lying.
He lied about using our code,

901
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:50,233
he's been lying about the game
being backwards compatible.

902
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,735
I think he's lying about <i>Free City 1.</i>

903
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:52,861
What are you talking about?

904
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:56,865
Look. You see? There's not
one mission, not one location…

905
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:59,075
I mean, there's not even a single
character from <i>Free City 1</i> on here.

906
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,660
<i>Free City 2</i> is not an update…

907
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,120
- It's a replacement.
- Exactly.

908
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,913
So when <i>Free City 2</i> launches
on Monday…

909
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,375
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our code,
everything will be deleted.

910
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,793
He can't do that.

911
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,130
I mean, this is artificial life we're
dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

912
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:16,926
We're screwed.

913
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:19,220
Maybe not.

914
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,848
If we can find our original build
in the game,

915
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:24,684
it'll prove that Antwan used our code
without properly licensing it.

916
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,020
And we just have to find it
before <i>Free City 2</i> launches.

917
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,438
We have 48 hours.

918
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:30,023
I've looked, Keys. You know I have.

919
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,316
I know you have.

920
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:33,860
But now that we both know
about Blue Shirt Guy,

921
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:35,528
maybe he can help?

922
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:37,447
That would mean I'd have to tell him.

923
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:40,992
Millie, he's not gonna exist
once the sequel launches.

924
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:43,620
His whole world's about to end.

925
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,498
Don't you think
he'd want a chance to save it?

926
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,752
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

927
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:52,921
- You got it.
- Guy?

928
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,339
Hey! Hi!

929
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:55,799
Guy, we need to talk.

930
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,551
What's going on with your voice?
Where's your Australian accent?

931
00:52:58,718 --> 00:52:59,719
British.

932
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:01,763
I think I know an Australian accent
when I see one.

933
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,015
I turned off the accent filter.

934
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:06,559
This is me.

935
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,019
Good.

936
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:10,230
Look, I have to tell you something
really important.

937
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:11,481
Are you married?

938
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:12,565
No.

939
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:15,068
Oh, God.

940
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:18,071
That would have been like
the worst thing ever.

941
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:19,864
Maybe not the worst thing.

942
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,449
Huh.

943
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,159
I have to show you something.

944
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,370
Okay.

945
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:31,793
Wow!

946
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,920
I always wondered what was in here.

947
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:36,297
<i>Tune in to the Kill Cam</i>

948
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:37,841
<i>for more of today's highlights</i>

949
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:41,636
<i>of every bloody, bullet-ridden
corner of Free City.</i>

950
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:43,555
<i>Has anyone seen my cat?</i>

951
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:47,308
Hey, that's Phyllis.
She's always losing her cats.

952
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:51,396
And there's Joe!
He's my friend, I know that guy.

953
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:54,399
I don't get it. What is this place?

954
00:53:54,566 --> 00:53:58,945
There is no easy way to say this,
but this city is a game.

955
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:01,364
There's no easy way to say this,
I know it's a game.

956
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:03,283
- You taught me how to play it.
- Boop-boop.

957
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,743
Yes, you're right, I did.

958
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,954
But it's not just that it's like a game.
It is a game.

959
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,458
It's a video game. And that's all it is.

960
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:15,003
So the entire world is a game?

961
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,171
Yes.

962
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,173
And we're all just players in the game?

963
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,425
Not exactly.

964
00:54:21,593 --> 00:54:22,886
I'm a player.

965
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:26,264
All these people here are players.
We live in the real world.

966
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:28,391
But you only exist here.

967
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:31,144
It's why you can never leave Free City.

968
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:33,062
You're what we call an NPC.

969
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,397
NPC.

970
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:37,567
The policeman
and the muscular bunny rabbit,

971
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,860
they called me that. What is an NPC?

972
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:40,028
<i>- Let's take…</i>
- Just watch.

973
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,112
<i>… another look at that leaderboard.</i>

974
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:42,947
<i>Everybody get down on the ground!</i>

975
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,657
<i>Nobody try to be a hero.</i>

976
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:45,992
<i>This will all be over soon.</i>

977
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:47,327
I don't understand.

978
00:54:47,494 --> 00:54:49,913
You're a non-player character.

979
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:52,373
- Non…
- A background person.

980
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,710
Someone designed to make the game
more fun for real people.

981
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:58,087
Wait, hold on a second.
Just stop for a second.

982
00:54:58,171 --> 00:54:59,297
I wanna make sure
I'm getting this straight.

983
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,424
I just wanna fully understand here.

984
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:03,593
So, I'm fake?

985
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:07,472
The entire world is fake?
I'm not even a main character,

986
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:10,975
I'm just this idiot
who's in the background?

987
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:15,063
Millie, why are you even saying this?
I love you.

988
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,316
You only think that
because it's in your programming.

989
00:55:24,823 --> 00:55:26,825
Guy, I need you to listen to me.

990
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,661
In two days, the game
is gonna shut down. For good.

991
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:32,330
When this sequel launches,
this whole city,

992
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:34,833
you, all the people in it
who aren't players,

993
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,417
they'll be gone forever.
You need to listen.

994
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:39,337
My whole life, I felt like there had
to be something more.

995
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:41,214
And then I saw you.

996
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:44,717
And I knew I was right.
I was right!

997
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:48,137
And for a second, I felt amazing.

998
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:50,056
- I know.
- Except you don't know.

999
00:55:50,223 --> 00:55:52,350
Because we're not the same.

1000
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:54,727
Isn't that what you said?
You said that.

1001
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:56,855
We're not the same.

1002
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,439
You're real.

1003
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:00,984
And I'm what? I'm what?

1004
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,030
You're not.

1005
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:10,410
You're not.

1006
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:14,497
Well, I may not be real,
but for a second there…

1007
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:16,791
I felt pretty alive.

1008
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,814
It's all a lie!

1009
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:29,364
Have the quarterly reports
on my desk by Friday.

1010
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,950
Quarterly reports.
My, what specific business lingo.

1011
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,118
Wow. Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

1012
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,286
Until it crushes your soul.

1013
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:38,831
Has anyone seen my cat?
Has anyone seen my…

1014
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,875
Your cats?
No, Phyllis, I haven't seen them.

1015
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:44,963
But here's a revolutionary idea…
close your goddamn door.

1016
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:47,423
It's not like they're climbing
on top of one another,

1017
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,718
forming a little kitty tower,
and then jimmying the locks.

1018
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:53,012
They don't have thumbs, Phyllis.

1019
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,681
No thumbs!

1020
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:58,476
Don't you get it?
Don't any of you get it?

1021
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:03,439
None of this matters! None of it!
It's fake! We don't matter!

1022
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:06,442
That building, that's fake!
This street…

1023
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:07,819
It's fake!

1024
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:09,070
That car…

1025
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:16,744
Officer Johnny!

1026
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:18,079
Have a good one, Guy.

1027
00:58:26,546 --> 00:58:28,006
Oh, hey, uh…

1028
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:30,675
Come in.

1029
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,061
Here you go.

1030
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:43,229
Thank you.

1031
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,356
Buddy,

1032
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:50,903
what would you do if you found out
that you weren't real?

1033
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:53,489
What do you mean?

1034
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:55,116
Pretend with me.

1035
00:58:55,283 --> 00:58:56,868
Okay, so…

1036
00:58:57,035 --> 00:58:58,703
Can I pretend I'm a ghost?

1037
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,205
Sure.

1038
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:04,667
Oh. Do I look like how I look like now?
Or whenever I die?

1039
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:05,960
Like, do I have a funeral outfit on?

1040
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:07,086
- This is kind of funeral…
- Doesn't matter.

1041
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,088
… but even though it's a work
uniform, 'cause I got a tie on.

1042
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:11,007
Let's move on from the concept, okay?

1043
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:13,634
Got it.

1044
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:16,721
I'm not a ghost.
I'm very disappointed,

1045
00:59:16,888 --> 00:59:18,264
- but I get it.
- Yeah.

1046
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:22,935
I'm me, who I am right now,
and I'm just trying to help a friend.

1047
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:27,148
I say, okay, so what if I'm not real?

1048
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:29,692
I'm sorry. "So what?"

1049
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:30,860
Yeah. So what?

1050
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,820
But if you're not real,

1051
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:35,490
doesn't that mean
that nothing you do matters?

1052
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:38,534
What does that mean?
Look, brother, I am sitting here

1053
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:42,080
with my best friend, trying to help him
get through a tough time.

1054
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:47,043
Right? And even if I'm not real,
this moment is.

1055
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:52,715
Right here, right now.
This moment is real.

1056
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:56,677
I mean, what's more real than a person
tryin' to help someone they love?

1057
00:59:57,678 --> 01:00:02,391
Now, if that's not real,
I don't know what is.

1058
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:07,188
Do you know the other security guards?

1059
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:09,023
I know 'em all. Why?

1060
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,400
Hey, Buddy…

1061
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,569
let's not have a good day…

1062
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:16,239
let's have a great day.

1063
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,033
Guy, what are we doin' here?

1064
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,661
We're here to get a video clip
for my friend Millie.

1065
01:00:21,828 --> 01:00:23,162
Does this look intimidating?

1066
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:25,748
I don't know, Guy.
How do you hold this thing?

1067
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:35,341
You have something I want.

1068
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,593
And you're gonna hand it over.

1069
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,013
How'd you get in here?

1070
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,432
Easy. I know your security guard.

1071
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:45,059
Jimmy?

1072
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:46,394
His name is Luigi.

1073
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:48,146
So if you took some time
to learn his name…

1074
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:49,939
maybe he wouldn't turn on you so quick.

1075
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:53,401
I need a video clip,
and you're gonna give it to me.

1076
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,611
Wait a minute, are you…

1077
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:57,697
Are you Blue Shirt Guy?

1078
01:00:57,864 --> 01:00:58,906
Yeah, maybe.

1079
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:01,951
Holy shit! You're Guy!
You're Blue Shirt Guy! It's you!

1080
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,202
- Yeah.
- I love you.

1081
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:04,662
- You do?
- I mean…

1082
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,164
I'm like a fan. You're awesome.

1083
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,373
You can have anything you want.

1084
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,541
Wait, hold on one second.

1085
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,626
Gamers, listen up,
this is Revenjamin Buttons here.

1086
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:11,794
I'm here with Guy.

1087
01:01:11,878 --> 01:01:14,380
The Guy, he's in my stash house,
and he's here to rob me.

1088
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,631
Can I get a little…

1089
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:18,926
- "what-what" for my followers, Guy?
- What?

1090
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:20,595
Perfect.
All right, so what's happening is…

1091
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:22,346
Guy's looking for a clip…

1092
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:25,057
showing a walkthrough I did
to get to the secret level.

1093
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:28,394
Who are you talking to?

1094
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:31,314
I'm sorry.

1095
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,567
Who am I talking to?
It's just such a classic Guy line.

1096
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,651
Right?

1097
01:01:35,735 --> 01:01:38,237
You're good. Oh, anyway…

1098
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:41,657
And you, you tried to steal it from me
with that Molotov chick.

1099
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:42,825
<i>Her name's Millie.</i>

1100
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,161
- Yeah. Wait, who?
<i>- Millie.</i>

1101
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:46,495
I think it's going really well.

1102
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,957
I know. This is literally the first time
I took my gun out the holster.

1103
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:51,167
Totally. Right?

1104
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:54,712
Guy, I tried to go back through,
but the glitch is patched.

1105
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:56,088
And I never found it again.

1106
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:58,049
So I'm the only one that ever saw
what was on the other side.

1107
01:01:58,216 --> 01:01:59,717
But it's all here, check it out.

1108
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,761
It's pretty cool actually.
It's like a whole other world.

1109
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:04,764
- This is it? This is the game clip?
- Yeah, that's it.

1110
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:08,142
Can you do one, single,
just one solid for me?

1111
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:09,602
- One thing, I'll stop asking, okay?
- Yeah.

1112
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:10,686
Just say my catchphrase.

1113
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,063
My viewers
will just banana cream sandwich

1114
01:02:12,146 --> 01:02:13,147
all over themselves if you say it.

1115
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:14,857
I love banana cream sandwiches.

1116
01:02:15,024 --> 01:02:16,025
Maybe not this banana cream sandwich.

1117
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,151
Yeah, this one.

1118
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:19,403
Okay, perfect. Okay, so just say,
"You know what time it is?"

1119
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,697
- You know what time it is?
- You know what time it is?

1120
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:22,865
You know what time it is?

1121
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:24,033
You know what time it is?

1122
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,326
You know what time it is?

1123
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:26,702
You know what time it is?

1124
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,204
You know what time it is?

1125
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,331
It's crime o'clock, baby. Yeah.

1126
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:31,707
It's crime o'cl…

1127
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,125
But, no, I can't say that. That's…

1128
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:35,253
Okay. It's all right.
I'll say it myself.

1129
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,255
- All right, you know what time it is?
- No.

1130
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,298
It's crime o'cl… Mom!

1131
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:40,758
Mom! Are you serious with the…

1132
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:42,134
vacuum right now?

1133
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:44,428
You really have to do that here?
I'm saying my…

1134
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:45,888
catchphrase! Everybody's watching!

1135
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:47,223
- God!
- You're 22,

1136
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:48,933
living in my house, there is no God!

1137
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,017
Sorry, Guy.

1138
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:53,229
Thank you, Mr. Buttons.
We're gonna go.

1139
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:54,981
No, no, no! No, you gotta kill me.

1140
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:56,857
- I'm sorry, what?
- You gotta kill me. Please kill me.

1141
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:59,318
Give it to me, Daddy.
Give it to me!

1142
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,654
No. Please don't do that.
Please don't do that.

1143
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:03,823
We're not gonna hurt anybody.
I'm a good guy.

1144
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,366
What? What'd you say?

1145
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,161
That's deep.

1146
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:10,329
No, it's not.

1147
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:11,497
That's like I can taste you, deep.

1148
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:15,459
I want your help, Buddy.
I don't have the safeword.

1149
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:16,544
I know what you want.

1150
01:03:16,669 --> 01:03:17,753
I don't want that.

1151
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:18,838
Yeah, you do.

1152
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:20,089
That's touching.

1153
01:03:20,256 --> 01:03:21,382
- They're touching.
- Yeah.

1154
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:23,009
I know what you want.

1155
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:24,385
Yes, I do.

1156
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,305
You want a little bit
of that <i>Free City</i> Itchy Kitty.

1157
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,056
- No.
- Uh-huh. Yes, you do.

1158
01:03:29,265 --> 01:03:31,058
<i>The way you move,
it's almost dirty.</i>

1159
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:32,476
What about a little Thanos Glove…

1160
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:36,230
into a little bit of Thanos Snap?

1161
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:38,149
- Oh. That looked like it hurt.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1162
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:39,483
A little Sunday Drive.

1163
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,193
You have a beautiful home.

1164
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,697
- Snakey Man? No? No Snakey Man?
- Bye, Mr. Buttons.

1165
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:47,241
Come on, give me one snake!
Just come on, man.

1166
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:49,368
Mom! Do not touch that sock!

1167
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:51,162
I swear to God,
if you touch that sock…

1168
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:53,331
you will be in therapy
for the rest of your life!

1169
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:56,709
No! That's my special sock! Put it down!

1170
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:03,049
<i>Millie, please.</i>

1171
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:05,926
Please wake up from your standing coma.

1172
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:08,554
Look, I know this world
is just a game to you

1173
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,639
and you can come and go, but to me…

1174
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:13,184
this place, these people,
that's all I have.

1175
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:15,394
And if I can help you save it,
I wanna do that…

1176
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:17,938
but you gotta wake up, please.

1177
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:19,732
Millie, I'm sorry for running away.

1178
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:21,567
Guy?

1179
01:04:22,818 --> 01:04:24,779
Oh, that's so scary!
It's just terrifying.

1180
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:25,988
I know, I know.

1181
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:27,156
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1182
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:30,242
Look, you may have started out living
in the background, but so did I.

1183
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,161
We're done with that.

1184
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:34,955
I got you a present.

1185
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:37,500
I didn't have time to wrap it.

1186
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:39,710
What?

1187
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:51,097
<i>They say over
a billion NPCs are killed every year.</i>

1188
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:55,893
<i>Now, I'm not gonna lie,
that's at least 50% my fault.</i>

1189
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,397
I used to shoot
all the secondary characters

1190
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,981
when I was bored, you know?

1191
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:04,485
And then, I'd teabag 'em a little bit.

1192
01:05:04,652 --> 01:05:07,363
<i>Who the hell even knows
who this Blue Shirt Guy is?</i>

1193
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,490
<i>But I'll tell you this,
he's got me thinkin'</i>

1194
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:11,242
<i>about NPCs and how I play the game.</i>

1195
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:13,911
<i>The game wasn't even made
for someone like this,</i>

1196
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:15,538
<i>for a player to be a good guy.</i>

1197
01:05:15,621 --> 01:05:16,872
<i>He's also a really cute guy.</i>

1198
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,708
<i>And not just the face, you know,
like the whole thing</i>.

1199
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,752
<i>And, honestly, it's got me realizing…</i>

1200
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,422
<i>maybe we've been thinking
about NPCs wrong this whole time.</i>

1201
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,465
<i>I think Blue Shirt Guy's
like a symbol, you know?</i>

1202
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:28,342
<i>Like, maybe people
can be whatever they want.</i>

1203
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,886
<i>He's like an icon.
Is that the right word?</i>

1204
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,930
<i>Like, he reminds us of what's possible.</i>

1205
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:34,432
<i>Also, he's like crazy hot.</i>

1206
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,601
<i>Oh, my God, totally.
I'd hit those pixels hard.</i>

1207
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,019
<i>We should all be
more like Blue Shirt Guy.</i>

1208
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:40,521
Maybe we just stop the killing.

1209
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,898
He's dead! You hear me?

1210
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:44,608
The guy, put him up here.

1211
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:47,069
Put him up here on the screen.
Put him on the screen.

1212
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:50,781
Make me see him. There he is.

1213
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:53,492
Yes. There he is, the little do-gooder.

1214
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:54,910
I thought you liked Blue Shirt.

1215
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:56,871
Don't say words to me!

1216
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,957
People are so busy watching this loser
on Twitch and YouTube.

1217
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:01,125
You know what they're not doing, guys?

1218
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,585
Buying <i>Free City 2.</i>

1219
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,628
- Pre-sales are down 16%.
- 60.

1220
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,589
60. That's bad.

1221
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:09,133
Oh, we are 48 hours from launch.

1222
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:11,010
Yeah, he's gone viral.

1223
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:14,847
Yeah, a virus that's giving me ass
and ball cancer at the same time!

1224
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,892
Inoperable!

1225
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:19,602
You know,
this whole good guy routine…

1226
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:22,563
it is a bad influence,
and is bad for the franchise.

1227
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,065
I want him gone.
I don't care who it is, boot him.

1228
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:26,233
You can't.

1229
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,027
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

1230
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:29,195
You can't.

1231
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:30,446
Why not?

1232
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:33,324
Because he's not a hacker, Antwan.
He's an NPC.

1233
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:35,242
You're tryin' to tell me that
all this shit

1234
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:37,369
about a self-aware NPC is real?

1235
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:40,581
Yeah. I don't know how or why,
but he's real.

1236
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,542
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1237
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:48,255
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1238
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:50,549
What to do? What to do?
Got it.

1239
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:53,636
And kip-up!

1240
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:58,724
So we can't kick him out of the game.

1241
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:01,685
How do we reset his Al?
Ideas, people. Come on.

1242
01:07:01,852 --> 01:07:02,978
Hit me. Ideas.

1243
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,022
You could just reboot the server.

1244
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:06,273
Keep talking.

1245
01:07:06,357 --> 01:07:07,691
If we reboot the server…

1246
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:10,611
then he's just gonna revert back
to a regular non-player guy.

1247
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:13,155
- Solution.
- Antwan.

1248
01:07:13,322 --> 01:07:14,740
Antwan,
you're talking about terminating…

1249
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:16,575
the first confirmed
artificially intelligent

1250
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:17,701
life-form right now, okay?

1251
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,328
Honey, honey. Shush.

1252
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,497
He's losing me money.

1253
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:25,084
So, I don't care if he's
Arnold-Frickin'-Schwarzen-Vader.

1254
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:26,752
Terminate him. Reboot.

1255
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:28,504
- On it.
- You can't do that.

1256
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:29,672
Reboot!

1257
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:42,434
<i>Order up and drown your bloodlust…</i>

1258
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:45,062
<i>with a tall glass of murder juice.</i>

1259
01:07:45,229 --> 01:07:47,022
<i>Here's this week's highlights.</i>

1260
01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:49,400
He's very expressive with his body.

1261
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:50,484
Clearly.

1262
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:51,777
<i>What is that?</i>

1263
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,237
<i>It's a whole new world over there.</i>

1264
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:54,613
<i>Some kinda paradise and shit.</i>

1265
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:56,365
Oh, my God, that's it.

1266
01:07:56,532 --> 01:08:00,869
It's our original build and that build
is proof our code is in the game.

1267
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:03,038
You have no idea
how long I've waited for this.

1268
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:04,540
I've seen this place.

1269
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:06,000
What?

1270
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:12,715
Yeah.

1271
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:14,967
What do you mean? How could you
have possibly seen it?

1272
01:08:19,388 --> 01:08:21,265
Millie? Millie?

1273
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:08,562
We're dark. <i>Free City</i> is offline.

1274
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:18,322
What is happening?

1275
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,578
Bye-bye, Blue Shirt.

1276
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,039
No, no, no.

1277
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:47,059
It's okay. Come on.

1278
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,233
Come on.

1279
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:56,819
Come on, come on, come on.

1280
01:10:02,658 --> 01:10:03,951
Good morning, Goldie.

1281
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:11,250
<i>Front of warm, dry gunfire…</i>

1282
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:12,960
<i>mixed with late afternoon stabbings…</i>

1283
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:15,003
<i>could leave you in the streets wet
with the blood of innocents…</i>

1284
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,131
<i>by early Tuesday night.</i>

1285
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,883
What really is the difference between
a light roast and a dark roast?

1286
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,677
Nobody knows.

1287
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,345
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

1288
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:24,638
Guy, can we talk?

1289
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:25,889
How does the sunglass girl
know your name?

1290
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:26,974
I don't know. Keep walking.

1291
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:28,392
Come on, Guy! You know me.

1292
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:29,560
You know this.

1293
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:32,312
You said this clip showed a place
you'd seen before.

1294
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:33,480
I need to know where.

1295
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,066
The data's been erased,
but it's in your head.

1296
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:38,986
Please try to remember.
This is really important.

1297
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:42,990
Please, Guy, think.
The ice cream, the swings?

1298
01:10:43,157 --> 01:10:44,366
Oh, my Guy loves swings.

1299
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:46,618
At Free City Harbor Park,
there's a great swing set there.

1300
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:47,786
- Have you been?
- Yes.

1301
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,288
We had bubble gum ice cream.

1302
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:52,166
OMG, I love bubble gum ice cream!

1303
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:53,751
He loves the bubble gum ice cream.

1304
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,878
Yes, I know.
We had it together, remember?

1305
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:59,465
Please, Guy, you're all I've got.

1306
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:06,388
I'm sorry, lady.
I think you have the wrong guy.

1307
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:09,850
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

1308
01:11:23,864 --> 01:11:24,907
Hello?

1309
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:26,074
<i>I might've found something.</i>

1310
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,411
I've been going through Guy's code
and there is something there…

1311
01:11:29,578 --> 01:11:31,622
even now, after the wipe.

1312
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:32,706
What's the point?

1313
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:35,501
Guy was, like, a one-in-a-billion
miracle. We can't replicate that.

1314
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:37,336
<i>I tried, okay?
You were right, it's over.</i>

1315
01:11:37,503 --> 01:11:40,088
No, Millie, Millie,
you're not listening to me, all right?

1316
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:43,133
A reboot,
it doesn't erase his Al coding…

1317
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,469
you literally would have to destroy
the servers to do that.

1318
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:48,013
<i>His AI is still there,
it just needs to be accessed.</i>

1319
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,182
I've seen him, Keys.
He's forgotten everything.

1320
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:52,518
Just look at the trace log I sent you.

1321
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:54,269
<i>It'll explain everything.</i>

1322
01:12:08,075 --> 01:12:09,451
<i>Now, from the beginning…</i>

1323
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:12,412
<i>Guy's behavior is much more complex
than it should be,</i>

1324
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,206
<i>thanks to our code</i>.

1325
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,749
<i>But he's still stuck in Free City.</i>

1326
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:18,210
<i>He's still stuck in this life,
this loop.</i>

1327
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:22,005
<i>And then, something changes.
He comes to life. Why?</i>

1328
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:23,966
<i>And then I remembered.</i>

1329
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:27,761
<i>One of the characters from</i> Life Itself
<i>was this guy that I nicknamed Lovelorn.</i>

1330
01:12:27,928 --> 01:12:31,932
And he was someone who was designed
to never meet the right person.

1331
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:34,351
It was essentially the building blocks
of the character.

1332
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:38,522
But he never stopped hoping that
he would meet "the girl of his dreams."

1333
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:40,232
<i>So I had to base this girl
off of someone…</i>

1334
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:44,027
<i>and who better than the person
that I was sitting next to every day?</i>

1335
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:45,195
<i>You.</i>

1336
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:46,864
But then, one day…

1337
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,491
<i>he meets you in</i> Free City,
<i>and once he sees you…</i>

1338
01:12:49,658 --> 01:12:51,076
<i>he can never be the same.</i>

1339
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:54,997
<i>He was supposed to feel doomed,
but instead, he feels alive…</i>

1340
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:57,791
<i>until eventually, he is alive.</i>

1341
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:01,211
<i>You changed him, Millie.</i>

1342
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:05,674
You changed his code.
And I think you can do it again.

1343
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:08,051
<i>You brought him to life, Millie.</i>

1344
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:11,221
<i>You brought him to life.</i>

1345
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:13,724
<i>And he was alive because
he met the one person…</i>

1346
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:16,643
Don't have a good day…

1347
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:18,812
have a great day.

1348
01:13:18,979 --> 01:13:20,105
Thank you.

1349
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:21,648
Take care.

1350
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:23,233
Everybody down on the ground!

1351
01:13:23,817 --> 01:13:26,111
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

1352
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:27,279
Okay.

1353
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:28,947
Everybody except you.

1354
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:34,202
Door, door, door. I got it.

1355
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:35,621
Please, I have a goldfish.

1356
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:36,914
Look, I don't have long.

1357
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,207
I just took you hostage,
so there are three badges on me.

1358
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:41,168
Badges? Is that like
a Girl Scout thing? What is that?

1359
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:42,252
There is something
inside you, Guy.

1360
01:13:42,336 --> 01:13:43,337
What? I don't want
anything inside of me.

1361
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,421
They stuck you
in that bank and…

1362
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:45,547
expected you
to just follow the rules…

1363
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:47,382
- I love the bank.
- … and do the same thing every day.

1364
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:49,635
- You are so much more than that.
- I don't wanna be more than that.

1365
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,470
No, and I need you to remember it.

1366
01:13:51,637 --> 01:13:53,639
Why have you been following me
and how do you know my name?

1367
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:54,723
Put these on.

1368
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:56,350
I don't have to do anything
that I don't wanna do.

1369
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:58,602
True. The choice is totally yours.

1370
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:00,479
Okay. Okay. Fine.

1371
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:07,277
What is that?

1372
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:09,154
What are these?
Trick glasses or something?

1373
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:10,238
Listen carefully.

1374
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:13,200
In 24 hours, this world,
everyone you know,

1375
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:15,494
it's all gonna disappear for good.

1376
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:17,120
Can you please just let me go?

1377
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:18,705
I mean, I haven't really even
seen your face.

1378
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,165
I mean, I've seen the general area,

1379
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:21,833
but I'm not really good
with descriptive words.

1380
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,377
Not really good with words in general.

1381
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:26,088
- Screw it.
- What? Oh!

1382
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:05,252
I remember.

1383
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:07,713
Welcome back.

1384
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:11,299
No. I remember everything.

1385
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:13,260
Come with me.

1386
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:17,014
I do this every day so much,
I'd forgotten why.

1387
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:21,893
Do you see that?

1388
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,520
Right there.

1389
01:15:24,146 --> 01:15:25,564
Oh, my God.

1390
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:28,483
Oh, my God!

1391
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:32,195
Antwan hid our original build past
the horizon, making it invisible…

1392
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:34,531
but he forgot to scrub the reflections.

1393
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:37,325
It's still out there, Guy.
We just can't see it.

1394
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:40,120
If we can get there,
that is the evidence we need.

1395
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:42,998
You can't go past the water line.
I tried.

1396
01:15:43,165 --> 01:15:44,207
We need help.

1397
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:47,502
Antwan found a way
to hide it in plain sight

1398
01:15:47,586 --> 01:15:49,588
in the one place no one can even get to.

1399
01:15:49,755 --> 01:15:50,756
<i>I can't even believe</i>

1400
01:15:50,839 --> 01:15:51,840
<i>he's smart enough to be this diabolical.</i>

1401
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:53,425
Keys, I need you to focus.

1402
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:57,095
Okay. So, the reflection shows the build
past the southern horizon.

1403
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:59,347
But the game physics
won't allow you past the beach.

1404
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:02,100
But you think you can find a way
to get us past the collision mesh?

1405
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:03,185
<i>We're gonna need a bridge.</i>

1406
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:05,520
You just get to Hitman's Beach
and I'll figure out the rest.

1407
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:06,897
And, Millie?

1408
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:08,648
<i>Be careful.</i>

1409
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:10,734
Antwan may be an asshole,
but he's not stupid.

1410
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:13,445
He'll figure out what you're up to and
he'll throw everything he's got at you.

1411
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:14,613
You're right.

1412
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:18,033
<i>Um, hi, Millie,
and other person I can't see…</i>

1413
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,493
<i>well, I have an idea.</i>

1414
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:21,411
<i>What if he has nothing to throw?</i>

1415
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:26,124
Everyone! Gather around!

1416
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:28,960
Thank you for coming.

1417
01:16:29,795 --> 01:16:31,004
Now, you know me, I'm Guy.

1418
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:32,672
Hi, Guy.

1419
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,341
Hi.

1420
01:16:35,217 --> 01:16:37,969
What I'm about to say
may be hard to understand.

1421
01:16:38,887 --> 01:16:40,263
Really hard to understand.

1422
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:45,227
But, are you sick
of living in the background?

1423
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:48,313
Aren't you sick of being shot at?

1424
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:49,397
Enough.

1425
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:51,108
- Taken hostage?
- No more.

1426
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,484
- Run over?
- We done with that.

1427
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:54,736
Robbed? Stabbed?
Used as a human shield?

1428
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,279
We are tired of being stabbed!

1429
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:57,614
- Buddy!
- Sorry.

1430
01:16:57,781 --> 01:16:59,407
What are you trying to say, Guy?

1431
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:02,536
I'm tryin' to say that things in
this city don't have to be this way.

1432
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:03,745
Things can be different.

1433
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:04,955
Different how?

1434
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:07,541
For starters,
you can put your arms down.

1435
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:08,625
Yeah.

1436
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:13,380
There you go. You got it. Yeah.

1437
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:15,048
Keep pushing. There you go.

1438
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,092
- Breathe through it. There you go.
- Do it. Do it. Do it.

1439
01:17:17,259 --> 01:17:18,635
- No, not gonna happen.
- Nope.

1440
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:19,886
That feels unnatural.

1441
01:17:20,053 --> 01:17:22,222
I mean, what about when someone
runs in with a gun?

1442
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:24,724
Having my arms up
is just a real time saver.

1443
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:29,604
Except, what if the guy
with the gun doesn't come?

1444
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:30,814
- What?
- What?

1445
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:32,566
There's always a guy with a gun.

1446
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:34,276
So many guys with guns.

1447
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:38,113
People, what if our world
doesn't have to be so scary?

1448
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,199
What if we can change it?

1449
01:17:41,366 --> 01:17:46,246
Millie! How many times a day
are the banks robbed in your world?

1450
01:17:46,413 --> 01:17:47,831
Hardly ever, Guy.

1451
01:17:47,956 --> 01:17:49,791
What about corpses, Millie?

1452
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:50,959
- What?
- You see a lot of those?

1453
01:17:51,126 --> 01:17:52,460
How many an hour?

1454
01:17:52,627 --> 01:17:54,045
None per hour, Guy.

1455
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:55,547
What about gun violence?

1456
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:57,757
See a lot of gun violence in your world?

1457
01:17:57,924 --> 01:18:01,094
Actually, that's a big problem, Guy.
It's a massive problem.

1458
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,014
I didn't see that coming.

1459
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:05,432
It's true. It really sucks.

1460
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:10,854
The point is, we don't have
to be spectators to our own lives.

1461
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:13,398
We can be whatever we want.

1462
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:15,066
We can't all be you, Guy.

1463
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:16,526
That's not true.

1464
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:21,031
What's inside of me
is inside of you, too.

1465
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,115
What?

1466
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:25,160
It's inside of each and every
one of you. You're growing.

1467
01:18:25,327 --> 01:18:28,455
I need more in my life than drip coffee.
I want to make…

1468
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:29,623
A cappuccino.

1469
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,374
A goddamn difference in the world.

1470
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,709
Much, much better.

1471
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:33,877
And a green tea boba.

1472
01:18:34,002 --> 01:18:35,587
- Holy shit!
- That's right!

1473
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:37,172
You go, girl.

1474
01:18:37,339 --> 01:18:38,423
Oh, my God, you're amazing!

1475
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,217
If I could just make it out
past that water…

1476
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,385
there's a world out there
where we can be free.

1477
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:44,554
Where we get to decide who we wanna be.

1478
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,015
Where we can matter.
But we have to fight for it.

1479
01:18:47,182 --> 01:18:48,934
We have to fight together.

1480
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,393
Yeah!

1481
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:53,563
You guys have always done
what's expected of you.

1482
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:55,232
But that shit ends today.

1483
01:18:55,357 --> 01:18:56,358
Yeah!

1484
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,610
I don't even know
what's happening right now!

1485
01:18:58,693 --> 01:18:59,694
But I love it!

1486
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:02,614
I love it!

1487
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:04,824
I love it!

1488
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:06,910
I love it, too!
Come on, guys, get in here!

1489
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:09,955
Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do!
Everyone in!

1490
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:17,879
Everybody get down on the ground!

1491
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:24,010
Hello?

1492
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,514
Where the hell is everybody?

1493
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:30,016
Hello?

1494
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:42,362
Where are all the NPCs?

1495
01:19:51,162 --> 01:19:53,832
<i>Look, I've been playing</i>
Free City <i>for, like, three years now.</i>

1496
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:55,417
<i>I've never seen anything like this.</i>

1497
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:56,918
<i>Up until recently,</i>

1498
01:19:57,002 --> 01:19:59,796
<i>I don't even know if I'd have noticed
a few NPCs going missing.</i>

1499
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:02,841
<i>And I don't know if this is just
some whack Reddit theory…</i>

1500
01:20:03,008 --> 01:20:06,636
<i>but some people are saying
that Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player.</i>

1501
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:09,514
<i>- That he's actual AI.
- AI?</i>

1502
01:20:09,681 --> 01:20:13,143
<i>Actual AI. You know, alive.</i>

1503
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,562
<i>It's why Blue Shirt Guy
is trending everywhere.</i>

1504
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:18,606
<i>Antwan, if you're watching this,
please fix the game.</i>

1505
01:20:18,773 --> 01:20:21,067
<i>- And most of all, bring back Blue Shirt.</i>
- Oh, my God. My God!

1506
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:22,569
Antwan, you should see this.

1507
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:26,614
<i>And you,
you tried to steal it from me</i>

1508
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:28,199
<i>with that Molotov chick.</i>

1509
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:29,284
<i>- Her name's Millie.
- Who?</i>

1510
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:30,368
<i>Millie.</i>

1511
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:33,580
Got her. Got her!
Got you! Got you!

1512
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:36,291
Mouser! Put him up on the screen.
Now. Put him up.

1513
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,001
That's it. Come on, quicker.

1514
01:20:38,168 --> 01:20:39,627
Yes, there he is.

1515
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:43,381
He's joyriding around Free City
with some player called Molotovgirl.

1516
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,384
AKA Millie Rusk.

1517
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,595
Millie Rusk?
Isn't that Keys' old partner?

1518
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:49,679
Yeah.

1519
01:20:49,763 --> 01:20:51,973
Also the one who's trying to hit me
with this bogus lawsuit…

1520
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,434
'cause she's desperate
for a piece of Soonami Kwan.

1521
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,061
Boot Molotovgirl now.

1522
01:20:56,227 --> 01:21:00,231
I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I can,
but her account's spoofed.

1523
01:21:00,398 --> 01:21:01,399
This woman is exceptional.

1524
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:02,984
Then kill her in the game.

1525
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:05,862
"What?" Yes, I said that. Kill her.

1526
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:09,366
Throw everything at them, all right?
Five badges, G.

1527
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:11,034
Yeah, just one problem.

1528
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:12,619
We don't have anything.

1529
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:13,870
Whatchu talking about, Willis?

1530
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:15,538
We don't have any defenses.

1531
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:19,042
We don't have police, military,
no nothing.

1532
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:20,752
It's what I've been trying to tell you.

1533
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:24,422
It's like every NPC went on strike.

1534
01:21:26,216 --> 01:21:28,551
Got a tall, half-caf,
double foam oat milk,

1535
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:30,136
matcha latte with cinnamon!

1536
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:31,554
- That's me.
- Hey.

1537
01:21:31,721 --> 01:21:33,014
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1538
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:34,307
Cheers.

1539
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,728
Go get 'em, Guy!

1540
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:42,524
It's like a digital walkout.

1541
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:44,776
No, it's not.

1542
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,861
They're doing this on purpose,
it's part of their plan.

1543
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:49,072
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna kill them in the game.

1544
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:51,157
Turn off respawn, kill them dead, now.

1545
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:53,660
But that means any players
who die will be done for good.

1546
01:21:53,827 --> 01:21:55,120
They'll freak out.

1547
01:21:57,372 --> 01:21:59,707
I don't care.

1548
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:04,254
Sir? Sir, just to be clear,
are you telling me that it's go time?

1549
01:22:04,379 --> 01:22:05,463
Are you looking
for some sort of banter thing

1550
01:22:05,547 --> 01:22:06,548
'cause you think we're friends now…

1551
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:08,049
and we're in some sort of gang together?

1552
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:10,176
Yes. Yes, that's exactly
what I'm looking for.

1553
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:11,302
Cool, we're a team.

1554
01:22:11,386 --> 01:22:12,387
We should come up

1555
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,513
- with a catchphrase, okay?
- All right.

1556
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:15,265
- On three. One, two, three…
- One, two, three…

1557
01:22:15,432 --> 01:22:17,308
Get back to work!

1558
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:19,644
Someone find me Keys!

1559
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:26,693
All right, people, you heard him.
It's go time!

1560
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:33,616
Okay, that's not good.

1561
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,036
He knows where we're going.

1562
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,961
All right, I got him. I got him.
Don't worry.

1563
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:46,796
Want some four wheels to the face?

1564
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:48,131
Take that. Boom!

1565
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:54,471
Rabbit's coming for you.
Apex predator.

1566
01:22:56,097 --> 01:22:57,098
Whoa!

1567
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:06,733
Here we go. Y'all watching this?

1568
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,193
I'm about to end this fool.

1569
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:12,739
Come on, come on, come on.

1570
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:14,741
Keys, if you're there,
a little help, please.

1571
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:30,298
God! Okay, who did that?
Who is doing that?

1572
01:23:30,465 --> 01:23:34,135
Don't play with me! Seriously!
I'm under way too much pressure!

1573
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,641
Come on!

1574
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:44,896
Go, go, go!

1575
01:24:00,662 --> 01:24:02,872
I just checked with security.
Keys hasn't left the building.

1576
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:04,082
Oh, sounds like
you've done everything possible.

1577
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:05,166
Time to give up? You wanna give up?

1578
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,251
No, I'm sensing you want me
to keep looking.

1579
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:07,335
- Go.
- I'll be back.

1580
01:24:07,502 --> 01:24:09,712
I have no idea
where these fools are running to.

1581
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:14,300
I do. Southern shore. Hitman's Beach.

1582
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:16,553
Well, that's stupid.
There's nothing out there but water.

1583
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,305
Game physics won't even let you
get past the shoreline.

1584
01:24:21,057 --> 01:24:23,059
Unless there is something out there.

1585
01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:26,062
Antwan, is there something there?

1586
01:24:27,564 --> 01:24:29,482
Screw it. Art nerds.

1587
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:31,025
Time for Dude.

1588
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:32,151
We're still working on him.

1589
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:34,445
I worked on him myself. He's perfect.

1590
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,030
Drop in Dude now.

1591
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:38,575
Just do it.
He's got, like, half a brain…

1592
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,953
he's barely written,
but sure, start the upload.

1593
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:50,712
What are we supposed to do now?

1594
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:52,672
Now Keys finds us a bridge.

1595
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:57,010
Come to collect those knives
you stabbed in my back, bro?

1596
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:00,597
You've been helping Millie Rusk
this whole time.

1597
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:02,098
She's looking for your build.

1598
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:03,641
What build, Antwan?

1599
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,810
It's not like you used
our code anyway, right?

1600
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,186
And if you didn't use our code…

1601
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:09,897
then how can our original build
be in the game, right?

1602
01:25:10,607 --> 01:25:12,483
Or am I missing something?

1603
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,361
Leave us.

1604
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:22,410
Okay, Keys, let's have a real talk.

1605
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:25,330
If I'd put out your dumb game,
it would have bombed.

1606
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:26,748
Antwan, you don't know
it would've failed.

1607
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:27,832
Yeah, I do know.

1608
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:31,002
I looked at the numbers,
the tracking, the focus groups.

1609
01:25:31,169 --> 01:25:34,797
Has it ever occurred to you that
some things matter more than numbers?

1610
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:37,383
What matters more than numbers?
Money?

1611
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:40,219
Yo, news flash, bro,
money is still numbers.

1612
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:41,721
Nothing matters more than numbers!

1613
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:43,264
You should be thanking me!

1614
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:44,432
I should be thanking you?

1615
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:46,851
What about the profits
that you got from our work?

1616
01:25:47,018 --> 01:25:49,062
You chose your side, little Padawan.

1617
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:52,774
And now, it's time for you to take
your place next to the Emperor.

1618
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:53,858
You get me, bro?

1619
01:25:54,942 --> 01:25:58,029
Yeah, I get you… bro.

1620
01:25:58,154 --> 01:26:00,573
Which leads me to this.

1621
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:17,090
Thanks, Keys.

1622
01:26:21,761 --> 01:26:23,388
What the hell was that?

1623
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:26,391
Hey, Antwan, things are getting hectic.

1624
01:26:29,686 --> 01:26:32,397
Oh, I thought you were
smarter than this, Keys.

1625
01:26:32,563 --> 01:26:34,649
You're obviously fired, you know that.

1626
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:37,860
And you, what is she still doing
in the game, man?

1627
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:38,945
Boot everyone.

1628
01:26:39,112 --> 01:26:41,197
Hold up.
You want me to boot all the players?

1629
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:43,116
Boot them out of the game, now!

1630
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:44,659
Cancel every player account!

1631
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,703
And where the hell is Dude?

1632
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:49,580
Security! Kick this punk out.

1633
01:26:55,503 --> 01:26:56,504
Guy!

1634
01:26:56,671 --> 01:26:58,464
- Millie!
- They're taking me out.

1635
01:26:58,548 --> 01:26:59,549
What's happening?

1636
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:00,675
It's on you now.
Everybody's watching.

1637
01:27:00,842 --> 01:27:02,009
You gotta keep going.

1638
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:04,429
Wait, wait, wait!
Will I see you again?

1639
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:06,264
You will if you make it
across that bridge.

1640
01:27:06,431 --> 01:27:08,391
Show the whole world our build.
That's the proof.

1641
01:27:08,558 --> 01:27:10,476
You do that, Antwan is done.

1642
01:27:10,935 --> 01:27:11,936
I'll make it.

1643
01:27:15,982 --> 01:27:17,066
I'll make it.

1644
01:27:18,234 --> 01:27:19,235
What the hell?

1645
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:22,947
What's going on?

1646
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,365
All right, let's all remember
this moment, before we were fired.

1647
01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:08,326
Oh!

1648
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:09,660
Wow.

1649
01:28:14,749 --> 01:28:15,917
Catchphrase.

1650
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,001
<i>Catchphrase?</i>

1651
01:28:17,835 --> 01:28:19,295
What? I haven't had time
to think one up yet.

1652
01:28:19,462 --> 01:28:23,049
Although "catchphrase" as a catchphrase
is a pretty cool catchphrase.

1653
01:28:27,261 --> 01:28:28,471
Whoa.

1654
01:28:29,764 --> 01:28:32,725
Get up, Guy. Get up.

1655
01:28:45,363 --> 01:28:47,198
Oh, no, no, no.

1656
01:28:51,577 --> 01:28:54,664
Guy, I came to save you.

1657
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:58,876
- Who is this?
- I don't know.

1658
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:00,253
He's glorious.

1659
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:03,256
I mean, he's just like you…

1660
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:04,841
but way better.

1661
01:29:06,634 --> 01:29:08,886
Way, way better.

1662
01:29:09,053 --> 01:29:10,721
- Thank you.
- No, that's not a compliment.

1663
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:12,181
I wouldn't touch him
if I were you, Buddy.

1664
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:13,641
What do you mean
you don't think I should touch him?

1665
01:29:13,808 --> 01:29:15,142
You don't mind this, do you?

1666
01:29:15,309 --> 01:29:16,978
'Cause I'm your buddy, too.

1667
01:29:21,107 --> 01:29:23,276
Yeah, I think he's gonna… hit you.

1668
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:24,443
He punches so hard.

1669
01:29:24,569 --> 01:29:25,570
But yet his hands are so soft.

1670
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:27,113
- Be strong.
- Okay, bye.

1671
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,240
Hey, it's like I'm a feather to him.

1672
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:30,867
Whee!

1673
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:32,368
Ha-ha!

1674
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:36,664
Oh…

1675
01:29:40,334 --> 01:29:42,670
<i>No, no, no! No!</i>

1676
01:29:42,837 --> 01:29:45,381
Get up, Guy, get up!

1677
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:47,592
Playtime's over. Catchphrase.

1678
01:29:47,717 --> 01:29:48,718
I don't know what that means.

1679
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:52,805
<i>Come on, man. Get up!</i>

1680
01:29:52,972 --> 01:29:53,973
Get up.

1681
01:29:55,308 --> 01:29:57,935
There are three things I love in life.

1682
01:29:58,102 --> 01:30:02,565
Kickin' ass, TBD, third thing here.

1683
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:08,779
<i>Oof! Oh, shit!</i>

1684
01:30:10,656 --> 01:30:12,199
Activate death blow.

1685
01:30:12,283 --> 01:30:13,284
Bye, Guy.

1686
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,957
Oh, shit, that's a death blow.

1687
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:23,127
Get up!

1688
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:25,671
Mom, he's coming in with a death blow!

1689
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:29,759
Get up, Guy.

1690
01:30:35,806 --> 01:30:36,891
Oh.

1691
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:40,686
What the shit?

1692
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:49,487
That was dope.

1693
01:31:05,795 --> 01:31:07,338
- Hold on. Is that…
- That's a…

1694
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:10,549
Yes! That's a lightsaber, Dude.

1695
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:11,842
Mm-hmm.

1696
01:31:17,014 --> 01:31:18,933
- Is that a lightsaber?
- It is.

1697
01:31:54,802 --> 01:31:55,803
Oh!

1698
01:32:02,309 --> 01:32:03,436
Guy!

1699
01:32:05,312 --> 01:32:06,814
Yes!

1700
01:32:06,981 --> 01:32:09,483
Yes! That's right.
Get up, Guy. Come on.

1701
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:31,380
There you go.

1702
01:32:32,298 --> 01:32:34,091
Do you see them all now? Yeah?

1703
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:35,551
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

1704
01:32:35,634 --> 01:32:38,471
Yeah, shiny things everywhere.

1705
01:32:39,889 --> 01:32:41,432
Yeah, there you go. Go get it.

1706
01:32:41,599 --> 01:32:43,434
Just lots of little snacks.

1707
01:32:47,063 --> 01:32:50,191
Yeah, not a dancer. No.

1708
01:32:50,733 --> 01:32:52,485
Run free, better me.

1709
01:32:53,778 --> 01:32:54,945
Let's go.

1710
01:32:55,112 --> 01:32:56,572
Where are we going?

1711
01:32:56,739 --> 01:32:58,449
We can't let them
get across that bridge.

1712
01:32:58,783 --> 01:33:00,242
You wanna finish this out with me?

1713
01:33:00,743 --> 01:33:03,704
Look, I don't even know what's going on,
but hell yes, I'm with you.

1714
01:33:03,788 --> 01:33:05,414
Ha-ha!

1715
01:33:05,498 --> 01:33:07,208
Let's go!

1716
01:33:32,316 --> 01:33:33,567
Antwan, come on, man.

1717
01:33:33,734 --> 01:33:36,070
What are we doing here?

1718
01:33:37,238 --> 01:33:38,739
Where are the servers to <i>Free City 1?</i>

1719
01:33:38,906 --> 01:33:41,659
No. Antwan,
what the hell are you doing?

1720
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:45,371
If they get past that horizon
to the build, I lose everything!

1721
01:33:45,788 --> 01:33:47,164
Wait, so you did steal their code.

1722
01:33:47,331 --> 01:33:49,625
Welcome to the conversation, genius.

1723
01:33:49,792 --> 01:33:50,918
Now, where are those servers?

1724
01:33:51,085 --> 01:33:52,962
It's all of these, but hold on.
I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

1725
01:33:53,129 --> 01:33:54,296
All these? This one? Right, this one?

1726
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:55,673
Yeah. How did you…

1727
01:34:02,179 --> 01:34:03,180
Run.

1728
01:34:07,977 --> 01:34:08,978
Antwan!

1729
01:34:19,363 --> 01:34:20,364
Stop!

1730
01:34:23,409 --> 01:34:24,660
Officer Johnny!

1731
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:26,078
- Come on!
- Come on!

1732
01:34:29,415 --> 01:34:31,917
Which server has the ocean
and the rest of the bridge?

1733
01:34:32,042 --> 01:34:33,043
I'm not gonna tell you.

1734
01:34:33,169 --> 01:34:34,170
You're just gonna destroy it.

1735
01:34:34,295 --> 01:34:35,546
Yeah. 'Cause it's my game.

1736
01:34:35,713 --> 01:34:38,966
Except it's not.
It's Keys' game.

1737
01:34:39,133 --> 01:34:40,634
You didn't do shit.

1738
01:34:40,801 --> 01:34:43,721
And guess what?
Keys is my boy.

1739
01:34:44,221 --> 01:34:45,222
Security!

1740
01:34:45,306 --> 01:34:48,767
Please escort this former employee
off the premises.

1741
01:34:48,934 --> 01:34:50,936
He can call you by your real name.

1742
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:11,332
Guy!

1743
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:13,792
- Buddy! Buddy!
- No, no! Keep going!

1744
01:35:13,959 --> 01:35:15,377
Go without me!

1745
01:35:15,961 --> 01:35:18,005
I've been scared my whole damn life.

1746
01:35:19,632 --> 01:35:21,550
But I'm not scared anymore.

1747
01:35:24,762 --> 01:35:25,930
I'm sorry.

1748
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,932
I'm not.

1749
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:32,770
It's been the best day of my life.

1750
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:35,356
You get to that build.

1751
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:38,275
You show 'em we matter.

1752
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:48,744
That security guard right there
was a goddamn hero.

1753
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:31,805
You did it!

1754
01:37:40,147 --> 01:37:41,732
Yes! Yes!

1755
01:37:41,899 --> 01:37:44,234
Suck it, Antwan! Whoo!

1756
01:37:45,778 --> 01:37:47,237
Antwan, stop!

1757
01:37:48,072 --> 01:37:49,323
It's over.

1758
01:37:51,575 --> 01:37:53,202
He made it.

1759
01:37:53,369 --> 01:37:56,872
Got your game's original build out there
for everyone to see.

1760
01:37:57,373 --> 01:37:58,957
Probably win your lawsuit, huh?

1761
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:00,667
Looks likely.

1762
01:38:00,834 --> 01:38:02,044
Cool.

1763
01:38:02,461 --> 01:38:06,173
And here's the thing, bro.
Here's the thing.

1764
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:09,134
Right here,
I got everything you care about.

1765
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:13,180
The sliver that's left of <i>Free City,</i>
all your little background friends…

1766
01:38:13,347 --> 01:38:15,641
including your digital boyfriend.

1767
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:17,601
Last server.

1768
01:38:18,685 --> 01:38:23,649
Look, I just want the world that I built
and the people in it.

1769
01:38:23,816 --> 01:38:25,234
What's in it for Antwan?

1770
01:38:25,401 --> 01:38:26,527
Everything else.

1771
01:38:26,693 --> 01:38:28,654
Meaning? Pretend I'm dumb.

1772
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:30,906
You have the rights to our code,
keep all the profits…

1773
01:38:31,073 --> 01:38:32,783
just give me what's left of <i>Free City.</i>

1774
01:38:33,242 --> 01:38:35,119
Let me build my own world from there.

1775
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:38,956
What about <i>Free City 2?
Free City 3?</i>

1776
01:38:39,123 --> 01:38:40,624
And all pursuant spin-offs?

1777
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:43,502
All yours. Just put down the axe.

1778
01:38:43,919 --> 01:38:46,422
You know that this is, like,
the dumbest deal

1779
01:38:46,505 --> 01:38:47,965
in the history of dumb deals, right?

1780
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:51,218
I mean, you're talking about giving up
millions of dollars.

1781
01:38:51,385 --> 01:38:53,345
Why would anyone do that?

1782
01:38:53,512 --> 01:38:55,722
'Cause Keys and I made something great.

1783
01:38:58,016 --> 01:39:00,477
And I don't need money or fame
to prove that to myself.

1784
01:39:00,936 --> 01:39:03,856
I'm done playing your game, Antwan.

1785
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:08,277
It's time I played mine.

1786
01:39:09,445 --> 01:39:10,737
Deal?

1787
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:22,040
<i>Popping today
and not in a good way.</i>

1788
01:39:22,207 --> 01:39:24,710
<i>Sales for</i> Free City 2
<i>continue to slip…</i>

1789
01:39:24,877 --> 01:39:29,006
<i>with numerous reports of bugs
in the code and lagging online play.</i>

1790
01:39:29,173 --> 01:39:31,550
<i>Embattled Soonami game founder
Antwan Hovachelik</i>

1791
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:32,759
<i>finds himself in the crosshairs.</i>

1792
01:39:32,926 --> 01:39:34,261
Crosshairs.

1793
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:36,054
He's in the crosshairs and embattled.

1794
01:39:36,221 --> 01:39:37,306
We're too busy to gloat.

1795
01:39:37,473 --> 01:39:39,475
<i>I'm a victim! I'm a victim!</i>

1796
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:41,477
Speaking of busy, we just doubled

1797
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,479
the amount of unique visitors
we can handle.

1798
01:39:43,645 --> 01:39:44,646
It's amazing.

1799
01:39:44,771 --> 01:39:46,106
Who'd have thought
that so many people…

1800
01:39:46,273 --> 01:39:49,234
would just wanna watch video game
characters instead of shoot at them?

1801
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:50,944
Hmm…

1802
01:39:51,778 --> 01:39:52,779
Oh, yeah, we did.

1803
01:39:52,905 --> 01:39:54,615
Yeah.

1804
01:39:55,908 --> 01:39:58,285
You know, you're pretty cute
when you brag.

1805
01:39:58,619 --> 01:39:59,828
<i>Antwan out!</i>

1806
01:39:59,995 --> 01:40:01,622
<i>Meanwhile, the game</i> Free Life

1807
01:40:01,705 --> 01:40:04,166
<i>is quickly becoming
the little indie that could.</i>

1808
01:40:04,333 --> 01:40:07,711
<i>Players are swarming to this

1809
01:40:07,878 --> 01:40:10,797
<i>where they interact peacefully with

1810
01:40:10,964 --> 01:40:14,009
<i>and is now no longer in the background,
a digital friend.</i>

1811
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,093
Uh, hey, Mills…

1812
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:19,723
Do you wanna come grab a coffee with me?

1813
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:22,267
Actually, I'm gonna jump back
into the game.

1814
01:40:24,102 --> 01:40:26,021
- Oh.
- Coffee?

1815
01:40:26,605 --> 01:40:28,398
Okay. Yeah. Sounds good.

1816
01:40:28,941 --> 01:40:30,400
I'll just, uh, grab you one.

1817
01:40:31,026 --> 01:40:32,027
Oh, Keys, uh…

1818
01:40:32,194 --> 01:40:33,695
I know, medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

1819
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:34,905
Yeah.

1820
01:40:45,165 --> 01:40:47,417
Hi, Randy. Milton.

1821
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,004
Hmm.

1822
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,423
I was wondering
when I'd see you again.

1823
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,718
Yeah,
life has been pretty crazy lately.

1824
01:40:57,219 --> 01:40:58,345
You should see it in here.

1825
01:40:58,512 --> 01:41:00,722
We're talkin' free
bubble gum ice cream for life.

1826
01:41:00,806 --> 01:41:02,516
Wow.

1827
01:41:05,018 --> 01:41:06,019
Hey, guys.

1828
01:41:16,071 --> 01:41:17,864
Look, Guy…

1829
01:41:18,073 --> 01:41:20,242
Wow, this is harder than I thought.

1830
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:22,661
Then let me do it for you.

1831
01:41:23,453 --> 01:41:24,997
Guy…

1832
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:30,961
you are dreamy.

1833
01:41:32,421 --> 01:41:37,009
Your taste in blue shirts
and five-octave musical superstars…

1834
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:41,388
it's deeply, deeply attractive to me.

1835
01:41:41,555 --> 01:41:43,682
But I can't keep spending
all my time with you.

1836
01:41:44,266 --> 01:41:49,187
I created this world,
but I can't live my life in it.

1837
01:41:53,859 --> 01:41:56,320
See? Was that so hard?

1838
01:41:57,404 --> 01:41:59,239
So, what are you gonna do?

1839
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,868
Anything I want. Thanks to you.

1840
01:42:04,244 --> 01:42:05,787
I'm not stuck in a loop anymore.

1841
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:07,456
Neither are you.

1842
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,543
I love you, Millie.

1843
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:16,006
Maybe that is my programming talking,
but guess what?

1844
01:42:17,382 --> 01:42:19,593
Someone wrote that program.

1845
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:23,847
I'm just a love letter to you.

1846
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:27,309
Somewhere out there is the author.

1847
01:42:45,452 --> 01:42:49,206
<i>You brought him to life.
You brought him to life.</i>

1848
01:42:49,373 --> 01:42:51,416
<i>And he was alive because
he met the one person</i>

1849
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,043
<i>he'd been waiting for his whole life.</i>

1850
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:56,421
And I had to make it realistic, so…

1851
01:42:57,673 --> 01:42:59,508
I based it off of…

1852
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:02,302
you.

1853
01:43:04,471 --> 01:43:06,390
The woman of his dreams…

1854
01:43:09,184 --> 01:43:10,936
she was the same as mine.

1855
01:43:11,103 --> 01:43:14,398
<i>So she liked bubble gum ice cream
and swing sets…</i>

1856
01:43:14,564 --> 01:43:18,402
<i>and she had this very cute
but oddly specific habit…</i>

1857
01:43:18,568 --> 01:43:21,113
<i>of always humming
this classic Mariah Carey track.</i>

1858
01:43:22,155 --> 01:43:25,200
<i>Like, all the time, she would… repeat.</i>

1859
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:29,454
Finally!

1860
01:43:36,253 --> 01:43:37,254
Keys!

1861
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:47,139
What are you…

1862
01:44:28,054 --> 01:44:29,514
You okay, little guy Guy?

1863
01:44:29,931 --> 01:44:31,725
You seem adjective.

1864
01:44:31,892 --> 01:44:34,519
I'm great. I'm great.
You could put me down, by the way.

1865
01:44:34,686 --> 01:44:36,354
Thank you. That was nice.

1866
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:39,983
No, I'm great.
You're great, Dude.

1867
01:44:41,485 --> 01:44:43,236
I just miss my best friend.

1868
01:44:44,863 --> 01:44:47,866
We used to do the same walk
together every day.

1869
01:44:48,033 --> 01:44:51,328
Except he wore a shirt.
And could complete a full sentence.

1870
01:44:51,495 --> 01:44:53,205
I can bench press a sentence.

1871
01:44:53,288 --> 01:44:56,792
Yeah, that's totally not
the same thing at all.

1872
01:44:56,875 --> 01:44:59,002
Harder laughter!

1873
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:00,712
Oh…

1874
01:45:00,796 --> 01:45:01,963
Guy?

1875
01:45:04,674 --> 01:45:06,510
- Buddy!
- No!

1876
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:07,844
Oh, my God! Guy!

1877
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:09,429
Buddy! I thought I'd lost you!

1878
01:45:09,513 --> 01:45:10,514
You didn't!

1879
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:12,849
One minute, I'm running
on a crazy bridge to nowhere…

1880
01:45:13,016 --> 01:45:15,268
thinkin' my sweet mundane life is over.

1881
01:45:15,435 --> 01:45:18,021
The next minute,
I'm like in some type of flyin'…

1882
01:45:18,188 --> 01:45:20,190
and some like fairy dust, pixie dust…

1883
01:45:20,357 --> 01:45:24,110
and then I plopped down
into this slice of heaven.

1884
01:45:24,277 --> 01:45:26,947
Man, I love it here.

1885
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:29,324
In fact, a couple of days ago,
I rode a centaur.

1886
01:45:29,491 --> 01:45:30,575
Now, it might sound weird…

1887
01:45:30,742 --> 01:45:34,120
I took a piggyback ride on a half-dude
and a half-horse…

1888
01:45:34,287 --> 01:45:36,540
whatever a centaur is, I did it.

1889
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:37,999
I rode a dude, too!

1890
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:39,376
Friendly gesture!

1891
01:45:39,543 --> 01:45:40,710
So friendly!

1892
01:45:41,169 --> 01:45:42,504
Come on, bring it in!

1893
01:45:42,712 --> 01:45:44,005
- Are we gonna hug?
- I'm coming for you!

1894
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:45,340
- No, you're not. I'm coming for you.
- Yes, I am!

1895
01:45:45,507 --> 01:45:46,675
You come here! I'm coming to you!

1896
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:48,468
I'm reeling you in. I'm reeling you in.

1897
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,139
Buddy, I missed you!

1898
01:45:53,306 --> 01:45:55,308
Hey, so where's the bank?

1899
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:58,061
There is no bank.

1900
01:45:58,228 --> 01:45:59,479
So what do we do?

1901
01:45:59,855 --> 01:46:01,898
Whatever we want.

1902
01:46:10,824 --> 01:46:12,576
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Guy.
