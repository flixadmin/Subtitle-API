1
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,882
- Hello to you.
- Hello to you.

2
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,300
I hope you're fine.

3
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,520
Now, let's try something
different: A challenge.

4
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:54,023
Who knows the electron wave functions...

5
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:57,027
for Kryptonian convalent bonding?

6
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,029
Sorry.

7
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,031
Leya?

8
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:05,035
The cube root of the wavelength
over the natural log...

9
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,038
of the integral of the speed of light...
I think squared.

10
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,042
Well, maybe that was a bit too easy.

11
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,339
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

12
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,301
- Hello, Kara.
- Hello to you.

13
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,979
<i>Oh, it is beautiful.</i>

14
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,440
What's that gonna be, Zaltar?

15
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:37,442
I think... a tree.

16
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,528
A tree.

17
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,613
What is a tree?

18
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,074
A lovely thing
which grows on Earth.

19
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,618
Earth? You mean
where my cousin went?

20
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,745
Hmm, and to where,
one day soon perhaps

21
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,872
I might venture as well.

22
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,667
I don't believe you. How?

23
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,047
- In that. Through there.
- The binary chute?

24
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,048
But you'd never survive
the pressure. It'll destroy...

25
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,592
In that I can.
Zip-zap and I'm gone.

26
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,595
But you'd never
leave us, Zaltar.

27
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,431
<i>- You'd never leave Argo City.</i>
- Indeed, I might, Kara.

28
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,099
Too much of a good thing here.

29
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:13,937
Perhaps I'll try Saturn instead.
Yes, I think I might.

30
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,440
Saturn is... is that
further away than Earth?

31
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,567
Silly question.

32
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,069
Didn't you study six-dimensional
geometry at school?

33
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:22,654
Do they not teach
anything anymore?

34
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:26,116
Well, of course they do.
I know the equations.

35
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,872
I just can't see
them in my head.

36
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:36,084
Most great artists find
mathematics troublesome, Kara.

37
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:39,588
- Only use your imagination.
- Mm-hm.

38
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,715
Saturn and Earth
are in outer space

39
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,469
but we, we are in inner space.

40
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,347
Our city has two great
power sources.

41
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,599
This is one of them. Look.

42
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,399
An omegahedron.

43
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,567
The Guardians let you have it?

44
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,987
Not exactly. I borrowed it.

45
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,407
You stole it. Oh, Zaltar,
they're gonna...

46
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:10,619
No, borrowed it...
for the afternoon.

47
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:15,915
- For inspiration.
- Inspiration.

48
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,065
But I think that
I shall never see

49
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,192
the branches of a living tree.

50
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,946
Why? An omegahedron
can create life, can't it?

51
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,783
It can't, child, it can't.
Just the illusion of life.

52
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,202
That's a fancy shadow
of the real thing

53
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,205
which is the most we can hope
for on this lonely old rock.

54
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,790
<i>Kara.</i>

55
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,293
- Kara!
- I'm here, mother, I...

56
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,341
Kara, I've been looking
for you for ages.

57
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,592
Oh, I'm sorry, mother.

58
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,928
- Zaltar.
- Alura, join us.

59
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:12,597
We're just inventing miracles.

60
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,810
Put your fingers here,
Kara, and press hard.

61
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,731
Good. Now try it.

62
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:24,943
Let your imagination explode
and give it a try. Go on.

63
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:28,488
Zaltar, my husband
tells me you talk

64
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:31,825
of leaving Argo City.
For where?

65
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,161
Parts unknown.
It is, alas, a fact.

66
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:36,121
<i>You and Zor-El have a life here.</i>

67
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,789
<i>You've each other and Kara.</i>

68
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:41,668
<i>But, Zaltar, you founded this city.
It's yours.</i>

69
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:45,213
As far as the eye can see,
right to the veil, smack

70
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,050
and then what?
What is beyond?

71
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,760
<i>Alura, I cannot contain
myself to Argo City only.</i>

72
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,097
<i>My head is boiling with ideas.</i>

73
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:56,016
<i>My imagination is too vast,
it's uncontrollable.</i>

74
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,727
If you want my opinion, Zaltar,
you're starting to repeat

75
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,731
yourself here with
all this airy, glittery stuff.

76
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:06,526
Exactly. That's why
I'm going to Venus.

77
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,072
Venus? When?

78
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:13,324
Tomorrow or the next day,
at the latest.

79
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:15,660
<i>Zaltar, have you
thought about this?</i>

80
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,704
<i>It doesn't make sense to me.</i>

81
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:22,042
<i>I have thought intensely.
My mind is made up.</i>

82
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,342
Kara! The power source!

83
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:19,637
Oh, Zaltar!
Save me. Please! Help!

84
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,853
- No!
- Kara!

85
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:27,899
Zaltar!
Help! No!

86
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,581
You took the omegahedron.

87
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,916
That's not correct,
I lost the omegahedron.

88
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,835
- No, father, I did...
- Shh, Kara.

89
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,253
No matter who.

90
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,881
Without it this city can't
survive more than a few days.

91
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,259
Our lights will grow dim and
the very air we breathe so thin.

92
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,261
I know. So I shall find it.

93
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,431
I shall go right to the end of
inner space and I'll return it.

94
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,518
Impossible. How? No one can
leave Argo City and you know it.

95
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,354
This is our universe and
you've destroyed it with a game.

96
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:10,108
- A childish game.
- I think it can be done.

97
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:14,821
Through there, the binary chute,
in the traveler.

98
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,283
<i>Like a coward you choose
instant destruction</i>

99
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,577
<i>while the rest of us
are doomed to stay here...</i>

100
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,728
Kara!

101
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,438
Kara, no!

102
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,581
- You lunatic!
- She'll be killed.

103
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,375
Oh, no, she won't.

104
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,712
She will be safe,
through the binary

105
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,005
through the warp,
into another register.

106
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,006
Another what?

107
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,883
<i>Gravitational radiation</i>

108
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:20,553
a pathway from inner space
to outer space.

109
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,473
Then she'll never
be the same, ever.

110
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,559
At least she'll be alive.

111
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,811
And my fate is sealed.

112
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,606
I've lost the omegahedron

113
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,192
I must be sent
to the Phantom Zone.

114
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,987
<i>Your suffering will be short,</i>

115
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:40,656
mine... forever.

116
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:00,570
Some more champagne,
my dear Selena?

117
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,115
What are you thinking about?

118
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,413
It's such a pretty world.

119
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:15,043
I can't wait until
it's all mine.

120
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,254
The only way you
can rule the world

121
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,839
is to become invisible,
my pumpkin.

122
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:22,174
Invisible?

123
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:26,178
You'd almost know
how to make me invisible.

124
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,722
Oh, I do know.

125
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:30,975
<i>Take five black beans
and the head of a dead man,</i>

126
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,688
place one bean in his mouth,
two beans in his eyes, then...

127
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,731
Nigel, enough.

128
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:40,526
But it works. Then you can
get anywhere, do anything.

129
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,197
Nigel, how long have
we been together?

130
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,616
Ooh. Months, darling.

131
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,786
Then why does
it seem like years?

132
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,707
Because you're so impatient.
You want everything yesterday.

133
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,209
It's a lifetime
to discover the secrets

134
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,213
of black magic from
the ancient grimoires.

135
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:03,049
More champagne, my sweetness?

136
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:09,056
Don't call me...

137
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,557
"Your sweetness."

138
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:14,561
I am not sweet.

139
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,564
I am Selena.

140
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:22,565
And I am a bitter, bitter pill to swallow.

141
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,365
Holy cow.

142
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,976
I wonder.

143
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:06,904
Immortality be upon this one.

144
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:12,156
She is a sharer
of the sun's everlasting life.

145
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:16,205
There will now
be no danger of death.

146
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:21,002
This world will
keep her forever.

147
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,671
What is it?

148
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,466
What's going on?
Hey, what's going on?

149
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,302
I've just outgrown you, Nigel.

150
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,095
These things happen.

151
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,765
You can't treat me
like this, Selena.

152
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:36,267
Without me you'd
still be reading tea leaves

153
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,103
at Lake Tahoe.

154
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:46,357
<i>Amsterdam and more. That's TWA.
Never has flying been easier.</i>

155
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,866
You can't run out on me, Selena.

156
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,368
I've got the keys, sweetheart.

157
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,163
<i>The president confirmed reports
that Superman has embarked</i>

158
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:59,707
<i>on a special peace-seeking

00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,292

<i>several hundred trillion
light-years from our own...</i>

161
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,903
Whoo-whoo!

162
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,117
<i>Now, here's the weather
from the general Chicago area</i>

163
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,660
<i>increasing cloudiness with
the possibility of showers.</i>

164
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,163
<i>Breezy but warm
with a high of 62.</i>

165
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,717
Bianca!

166
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:03,635
I'm home.

167
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,850
Bianca!

168
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,559
<i>Wha-at?</i>

169
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,479
Show your face.

170
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,734
I have a surprise for you.

171
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,493
<i>They've turned off
the hot water again.</i>

172
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:31,539
I'm really gonna have to kill
somebody down at the DWP.

173
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,209
The only way we're gonna
pay our bills next month

174
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,962
in this dump, is to just go
ahead and start our own coven.

175
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,964
No longer necessary.

176
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,133
I was reading in this book

177
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,926
"The Witches Guide
to Heaven and Hell"

178
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,679
if you start your
own coven all you've to do

179
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,265
is charge five bucks a head,
minimal admission. That's great.

180
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,642
- Chicken feed.
- That's better than goose egg.

181
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:54,520
What's in the Coffer of Shadow
there? Where's little Nigel?

182
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:56,939
Nigel, my dear Bianca,
is history.

183
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:58,399
Oh, yeah? How so?

184
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,111
The water department is history.
The car payments are history.

185
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,904
The mortgage
payments are history.

186
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:06,240
- How are the property taxes?
- History.

187
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,952
The world is at last my oyster.

188
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:12,996
If I can figure this thing out...

189
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:17,497
Would you mind letting Bianca in
on this unexpected bit of good luck?

190
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,504
Or whatever it is?

191
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:22,005
Ba-ad luck.

192
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:26,009
I have been chosen.
The powers of darkness...

193
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,013
I think may, at long last...
Have come to their senses.

194
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:33,016
You wanna hear some bad luck?
The phone company says...

195
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:36,520
unless we pay this bill today,
they're turning the phone off!

196
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,523
Shut up, shut up.
Watch.

197
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:43,777
Learn something for a change.

198
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:57,166
Oh, my god.

199
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,044
Are you doing that?

200
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:04,298
It's a trick, right?
It's a trick.

201
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:08,799
I think it's done.
Selena, I think it's done.

202
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,941
Oh, my god.

203
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,444
It's gonna take a little practice.

204
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,073
Now, this I like.

205
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,743
- Hello.
- "Hello," she says.

206
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:40,496
- Well, hello to you, honeybun.
- Hello.

207
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,249
I was wondering if you could
tell me where I am?

208
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,627
What do they call this place,
Eddie? Lovers' Lane, isn't it?

209
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,089
You got it in one,
Billy boy. Lovers' Lane.

210
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:53,050
Oh, no, you see,
what I meant was is

211
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:55,427
well, those lights over there.
What are they called?

212
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:58,430
Check out the view
from back here, Eduardo.

213
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,598
Ah!

214
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,183
Stop that.

215
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,563
You're, uh, Superman's
best friend, huh?

216
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:10,564
No. His cousin. I've come here
to search for the omegahedron.

217
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:14,446
It's a power source vital to
Argo City. That's where I live.

218
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:16,031
No kidding.

219
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,784
Eddie and me here

220
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:21,328
we're on a secret mission also.

221
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,998
We're out looking
for a good time.

222
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,835
And you just won
the brass ring, baby.

223
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:46,895
Oh, she works out, huh?

224
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,439
Why are you doing this?

225
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,442
It's just the way we are.

226
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:01,285
You shouldn't have
done that, baby.

227
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:05,122
Come on.

228
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,756
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

229
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:17,968
You really wanna play games,
eh, sweetheart?

230
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,596
Come on. Come...

231
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,764
Ow!

232
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,687
Huh?

233
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:33,938
Eddie, I think maybe we should

234
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:38,155
kinda keep this to ourselves.
What do you think?

235
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,455
Freddie, you little
devil. How are you?

236
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,334
Fresh ammunition, everybody.

237
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,095
Try telling your wife.
I need another.

238
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,513
Where is it? Where's
the little mystery ball?

239
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,308
Let me have a peek.
Maybe I can shed some light.

240
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:07,309
I hate light.

241
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:09,811
Is it electrical?
Is it hot to the touch?

242
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,106
- Where is it?
- Safe and sound.

243
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:15,066
Go mix.
Leave me to my thoughts.

244
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,528
Go mix? With these people?
You must be mad.

245
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,780
Who are they?
Wrinkly little wretches.

246
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:22,699
These are my
foot soldiers, Nigel.

247
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,327
My army of the night.

248
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:29,957
I'm considering nothing
less than world... domination.

249
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:33,251
World domination? So you start by
letting Bianca get on the phone

250
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:35,754
to the local psychical research
society and say,

251
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,757
"Hello, got anyone over there
wants to join a coven?"

252
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,260
There are time-honored ways
of doing this, honeybunch.

253
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:45,764
Centuries-old rules to follow.

254
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,766
I have a secret, Selena.

255
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,269
How exciting for you, Nigel.
Best write it down before you forget it.

256
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:52,145
After you left me in the lurch

257
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,357
I saw something that should
worry you greatly

258
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:57,025
<i>if you're serious about
taking over this planet.</i>

259
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,864
My secret was blue and red
and it knew how to fly.

260
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,659
I've a secret too, Nigel.

261
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,536
I have the power.

262
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,621
Get that through your head.

263
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,291
Selena is through worrying.

264
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,294
The shoe is on the other foot
and it's their turn to worry,

265
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:20,299
All those who mocked me
when my chips were down.

266
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:23,260
Oh, I bet they're
in for it now, eh?

267
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,262
Count on it.

268
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,312
I have in my time seen
a great number of things

269
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,813
even more impressive

270
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:37,816
than a human cigarette
lighter, dear lady.

271
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:40,193
To wit.

272
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,992
What is that?

273
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:50,662
Overreaching ambition.

274
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:51,830
Take heed.

275
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,751
Touched a little
nerve, didn't I?

276
00:29:58,045 --> 00:29:59,087
Hello.

277
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:00,798
Hello.

278
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,009
The red toad
that lurks in the briars

279
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:05,260
and brambles
is full of sorceries.

280
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:07,262
There's a little bone
on the left side.

281
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:08,096
A little bone?

282
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,058
A little bone, which
if bound to a man stirs up

283
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,851
the greatest lust.

284
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,272
- I wanna be rich and famous.
- Then stick with me.

285
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:20,359
I was put on this earth
to thrill millions.

286
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,737
Mmm, this is scrumptious.

287
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:27,366
<i>Why don't we go somewhere else
and dance cheek to cheek?</i>

288
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,128
Stop it, Selena!
That's not fair.

289
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,838
<i>Pick on me.</i>

290
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,056
- Thanks.
- Hey, no sweat.

291
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,725
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing much.

292
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:56,645
Get out of my house, Nigel

293
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,231
and don't come slithering back.

294
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:02,734
Listen, Selena, I'm the only one
who can save you from yourself.

295
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:07,239
- You need me.
- Like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower, kiddo.

296
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,117
I'm warning you, Selena

297
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,286
don't be so shortsighted.

298
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:23,254
Okay, folks. The show's over!

299
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:25,257
Let's party.

300
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:33,640
Freddie, darling, thank you for coming.
Goodbye!

301
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,642
- Good party.
- Thank you. Lovely to see you.

302
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,145
Bye!

303
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:47,025
Four people signed up. We got 20 bucks,
cash on the barrelhead.

304
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,031
- Four people?
- They loved the food.

305
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:54,035
They were real impressed with that
spinning top number you did on that girl.

306
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:56,538
But when Nigel walked out
the way he did,

307
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,040
I gotta say it hurt us.

308
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:02,544
They thought he was giving you
a warning to slow down.

309
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:05,547
Rome wasn't built in a day.

310
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:10,048
A warning?
A warning, they say?

311
00:32:12,054 --> 00:32:16,058
Nobody gets a warning anymore.

312
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,740
Good morning.

313
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,458
<i>Have you got it, Lucy?
Must be near that oak tree.</i>

314
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,794
<i>- Hurry up.</i>
- Found it, guys.

315
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,673
<i>What are you doing? You're
supposed to find the ball.</i>

316
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,096
<i>Come on, don't take all day.
You're holding up the game.</i>

317
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,599
- Hey, it's your turn to bat.
- Let's go. Let's go.

318
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,685
<i>Okay. Okay.
Let's play ball.</i>

319
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,604
Alright, batter.

320
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:13,490
I couldn't make it.
I have to finish my...

321
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,305
<i>Hey, toss the ball back, will you?</i>

322
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,736
<i>Come on, make it two in a row.</i>

323
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,030
Play ball.

324
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,302
<i>- Where have you been?
- With the principal.</i>

325
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,054
Danvers is doing
his usual number.

326
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,056
Jeez, another barfy new student.

327
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,976
They're really scraping the
bottom of the barrel these days.

328
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,062
Hang in there, Danvers.

329
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,688
Don't let them get to you.

330
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:31,401
Thirty days. Semester
just started. You'll be...

331
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,571
- Hello, I...
- Didn't knock.

332
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:37,073
Don't we teach you
manners around here?

333
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,951
Don't we try to impress
on our young ladies

334
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,869
that animals
in the jungle never knock

335
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:44,206
but Midvale girls always do.
Where you going? Come back here.

336
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,041
Come in.

337
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,502
I forgot, I'm just not used to...

338
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,170
Wait a minute.

339
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,091
Wait just one second.

340
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,178
I have never before
in my life laid eyes on you

341
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,346
have I, young lady?

342
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,223
- No, sir, I'm new here.
- New here?

343
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,017
Obviously you're new if I've
never laid eyes on you before.

344
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:06,769
The question remains,
just who on earth are you?

345
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,273
Umm...

346
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,569
On Earth, I'm Lee.

347
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,070
Linda Lee.

348
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,990
Where's your letter
of recommendation?

349
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,032
Letter?

350
00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:21,117
I must talk to you, principal.

351
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:24,287
- I am busy now.
- So are they, them.

352
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:26,664
All the little monsters
you admit to the place.

353
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,793
<i>They have nailed
my desk drawers shut.</i>

354
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,796
Never in all my years
as a school teacher...

355
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:33,964
Come, Danvers.

356
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,424
I will not be provoked.

357
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,010
I will not let him
get to me this semester.

358
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:39,636
I'll be strong.
Be strong.

359
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:41,263
Be like a rock.

360
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,236
What did you say your name was?

361
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,406
Oh, yes.
Linda Lee, huh?

362
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,324
Yes, my cousin
probably wrote you.

363
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:04,244
Umm, maybe you got
his letter under K for Kent?

364
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,704
In your files.

365
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,914
Kent?

366
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:08,206
Kent?

367
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,710
It doesn't ring any bells.

368
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:14,546
Doesn't even ring a...

369
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:18,800
Oh, here it is.
Big as life.

370
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,802
<i>“My dear Mr. Danvers,
I'm writing on behalf</i>

371
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,721
<i>of a very
special young lady."</i>

372
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:24,306
An orphan?

373
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,475
Don't expect to be treated
any differently

374
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,768
on that account, Miss Lee.

375
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:29,352
Oh, no, sir, I won't.

376
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,145
One way or another,
we're all alone

377
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,399
on this... miserable
little planet.

378
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,443
Yes, sir, I know.

379
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,279
<i>Since your school records were
obviously lost in the mail</i>

380
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,323
you'll have to start
at the bottom.

381
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,116
It's only fair
to the other girls.

382
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:46,995
You'll have English, Latin,
math, biology, computing...

383
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,371
All at once?

384
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,706
...and chemistry.

385
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:53,084
Idle hands are the
devil's playground. This way.

386
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,636
- Man on the floor!
- Man on the floor!

387
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,237
Open up, Lane, I know
you're in there.

388
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,573
I'm not decent,
Mr. Danvers sir.

389
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,326
And you never will be either.
You little liar.

390
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,540
Come on in. Come on in.
I haven't got all year.

391
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:32,999
No.

392
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,085
I'm supposed to have
a single this term.

393
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,337
We don't always get
what we want, Miss Lane.

394
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,589
Disappointments
thicken our skins.

395
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:41,716
Who wants thick skin?

396
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,178
I'm Linda Lee.

397
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,808
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

398
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:52,435
I'm Lucy Lane.

399
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:54,354
Lucy Lee, this is Linda Lane.

400
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,189
- No, it isn't.
<i>- What?</i>

401
00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:58,566
- She's Linda Lee and I'm...
- Lucy Lane.

402
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,527
You two know each other.

403
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:02,403
Oh, no. We just met.

404
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:04,739
- When?
- Just now.

405
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:07,367
But we've known each other
for years, haven't we, Linda?

406
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,661
- Oh, gee, I don't think I...
- Oh, of course.

407
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,038
The Daily Planet, of course.

408
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:15,792
Linda's cousin works there. And
your sister, what's her name?

409
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:18,211
The one that's always
calling me and bothering me?

410
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,922
- Lois.
- Ah, yes, that's the one.

411
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:24,801
Anyway, show our new
Miss Lee around, Miss Lane.

412
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:28,429
Oh, by the way, she's an orphan

413
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,016
but don't let her play
on your sympathies, hmm?

414
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:49,075
So, who's your cousin?

415
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:50,243
Clark Kent.

416
00:38:52,037 --> 00:38:53,538
You're kidding me.

417
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,458
Clark Kent's your cousin?
You're putting me on.

418
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,835
- You know him?
- Do I know him?

419
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,503
Does my sister know him?

420
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:04,298
- Now, that's the big question.
- Oh, I see.

421
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,051
I guess, if they worked
at the same newspaper

422
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,427
they must know each other.

423
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,263
- Well...
- Is this where I'll sleep?

424
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:12,974
Well, this is your bed,
but we don't sleep around here.

425
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,769
Nonstop excitement in this dorm.

426
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,939
All the real dementals
are sent here.

427
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,568
So, when's the rest
of your stuff arriving?

428
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,405
I don't have any other stuff.

429
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:28,281
What? It's all
in that little bag?

430
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,454
Oh, well, you see, I have the
means to buy more, it's just...

431
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,790
Well, I just haven't
had the chance since...

432
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,393
- Do you know him?
- Superman? Sure.

433
00:39:57,185 --> 00:39:59,770
<i>My sister's got something
goin' with the big guy.</i>

434
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,439
Listen, you can borrow
any of my clothes

435
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:04,817
any time you want.
Just dig in and help yourself.

436
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,320
Thank you.
You're very kind.

437
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,784
He's a real character.
A real hunk.

438
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:15,244
<i>I'll introduce you
to him someday</i>

439
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,830
<i>if we wind up getting along.</i>

440
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,881
Well, you haven't had
a chance since, what?

441
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:28,320
Did you have a fire at
your house or something?

442
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:29,050
Fire?

443
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:32,137
Well, you know.
How your parents got killed.

444
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:37,058
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Oh, sure.

445
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,562
I'm sorry. Me and my motor mouth.

446
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:43,606
Now, then, focus your tiny minds

447
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:45,942
on the kind of problem
that it used to take

448
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:48,862
weeks of thought
before the computer.

449
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,989
Even now it can take a long time

450
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,325
without certain algorithms

451
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:56,953
which... if you behave
for two seconds

452
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:59,455
I might reveal to you.

453
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,924
Love, hate, love, hate.

454
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,885
<i>Love.</i>

455
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,096
<i>The cards have decided</i>

456
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:17,265
<i>people will do
anything for love.</i>

457
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:20,226
They'll jump off
cliffs for love.

458
00:41:20,602 --> 00:41:22,937
<i>They'll drown themselves
like lemmings.</i>

459
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:27,646
So... I'll make
everybody love me.

460
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,528
Oh, no chance.

461
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:33,030
You're an awful person,
honey, remember? Forget it.

462
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,660
Use your imagination, pinhead.
That's what magic is all about.

463
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:41,455
Why are we not moving?

464
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,876
Because I'm in love.

465
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,964
<i>Come here, you beautiful thing.</i>

466
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,801
He's cute.

467
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,598
Hey, what's going on?

468
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:01,893
<i>Here's an exercise in
big numbers I want you to try...</i>

469
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:05,605
<i>It's trying to tell me something.</i>

470
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,024
Well, what?
That we're near danger?

471
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:09,859
I don't know.
How do I know?

472
00:42:15,657 --> 00:42:18,993
- I know.
- Well, tell me.

473
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,413
My prince has come.

474
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,873
<i>Oh, no.</i>

475
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:25,374
I saw him first, Selena.

476
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,711
That's not fair.
I copied his number first.

477
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:30,254
Well done.
Now, let's get out of here.

478
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,427
<i>...average size
of a Chinese family</i>

479
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:39,221
<i>average age of death
and marriage and pregnancy.</i>

480
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,808
<i>Use this equation to compute
the population of China</i>

481
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,727
<i>in the year 2040.</i>

482
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:46,771
Linda... are you with us?

483
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:51,400
Umm...

484
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,863
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Oh, are you?

485
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,281
Where, might I ask?

486
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,075
Well, here, sir.
On Earth... sir.

487
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,038
How fortunate
for the rest of us.

488
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:05,998
May I presume that whilst
you were staring at the wall

489
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,794
and not at your terminal like
your other little friends here

490
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:12,130
you were in fact, hard at work

491
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,383
solving this little equation?

492
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:17,593
Oh, yes, sir, I was.

493
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,471
- I mean, I was...
- Excellent.

494
00:43:19,846 --> 00:43:20,888
The answer, please.

495
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,726
Pay attention, class, Miss Lee
is about to enlighten us.

496
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:27,770
Five billion, two hundred
and seventy one million

497
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:29,021
nine thousand and ten.

498
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:37,113
Come on, let's get outta here
before he makes you stay.

499
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,157
<i>Come on, hurry.</i>

500
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,331
<i>Miss Lee.</i>

501
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,583
- Oh, shit.
- Yes, sir?

502
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,877
Have you been going
through my papers?

503
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,962
Of course not, sir.

504
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:55,214
Then how do you know
the correct answer?

505
00:43:55,423 --> 00:43:57,425
<i>- How?</i>
- I guess, I just...

506
00:43:57,634 --> 00:43:59,761
It's all this crazy weather
we've been having, sir.

507
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,889
<i>All the storms, shock waves,
electromagnetism.</i>

508
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,141
It makes people smarter
than they are for a second.

509
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,601
We gotta go, sir.

510
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,439
Oh, boy, thanks.
You know I gotta learn...

511
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:13,191
How did you know the answer?

512
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,361
I don't know.
Six-dimensional geometry.

513
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,488
- I never could do it before.
- Yeah.

514
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,615
Well, you want some
friendly advice?

515
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,660
Don't go showing it off
'cause nobody's gonna like you.

516
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:25,286
I'll see you later.

517
00:44:39,217 --> 00:44:42,219
Hey, Lucy, where's your roomie?
Out to lunch?

518
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,973
No, she heard you were gonna be here,
Myra, and she got sick to her stomach.

519
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,979
Hey, Linda, wait a minute.
Come on. Stay.

520
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,982
Yeah, aren't we good enough for you?

521
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:56,483
Can I have my books back, please, Myra?

522
00:44:56,484 --> 00:44:58,485
Say "please".

523
00:44:58,486 --> 00:45:01,989
- I just did.
- Say it again.

524
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,496
Please, can I have my books back?

525
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,500
God, what a wimp.

526
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:16,003
Geography? You're not taking
geography, are you, Linda?

527
00:45:16,504 --> 00:45:19,506
- "Midvale and its points of interest?"
- Good, short book.

528
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:23,510
I'm just trying to learn
a little bit about...

529
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:27,014
More in the... in the place that I...
I live.

530
00:45:27,515 --> 00:45:29,516
I have to go study.

531
00:45:29,517 --> 00:45:33,520
"Oh, I have to go study.
I'm not boring enough yet."

532
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:36,524
- Shut up, Myra.
- Make me.

533
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,694
Bug off.

534
00:45:43,698 --> 00:45:45,700
All right.
All right!

535
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:54,041
Now, who's gonna clean up this mess?
Not me.

536
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,630
Why didn't anybody
tell us she was coming?

537
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,555
We didn't care.

538
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:08,764
Ah!

539
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,976
Nice going.

540
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:14,854
You know she tripped
you on purpose?

541
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,483
Absolutely.
She's retarded.

542
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,112
<i>There's not much time left.
Come on, let's go.</i>

543
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,116
You take it, Myra.

544
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,246
Hey, Myra, see if you can
put Lane out for good.

545
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,334
<i>Come on, team. Come on.</i>

546
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,178
Hey, you guys alright?

547
00:46:48,596 --> 00:46:50,014
- Oh, God. What happened?
- Yes. You alright?

548
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,766
Myra, how'd she do that?

549
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,685
- It hit her shoulder.
- I don't know.

550
00:47:05,363 --> 00:47:08,866
Listen, you better keep an eye out
for Myra now. She's out to get you.

551
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,992
Me? Why?

552
00:47:10,004 --> 00:47:13,378
Because she hates
anybody who's not afraid of her.

553
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,255
Hey, you guys, did you see that
cute guy in the softball field?

554
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,548
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

555
00:47:24,257 --> 00:47:26,342
With the black hair
and the big muscles?

556
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:27,468
He was something else.

557
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:30,262
<i>- Did you talk to him?
- No, but I'm gonna.</i>

558
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,806
<i>Talk? Who'd
waste time talking?</i>

559
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,934
<i>He's working on the trees,
could be around for a while.</i>

560
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:39,438
- Are they in?
- Yes.

561
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,903
<i>Myra, you sure you wanna
go through with this?</i>

562
00:47:46,112 --> 00:47:48,239
<i>Hey, what's with you?
Chicken?</i>

563
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,367
<i>Oh, boy, I'm really
gonna enjoy this.</i>

564
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:53,869
<i>I can't wait to hear
them scream.</i>

565
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,248
Why don't you shut off the hot
and give them an ice bath?

566
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,584
<i>Are you kidding me?
That's nowheresville.</i>

567
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,920
If you shut off the cold
you'll scald them.

568
00:48:02,128 --> 00:48:04,505
So they lose a little skin.
Serves them right.

569
00:48:05,256 --> 00:48:07,049
<i>I want to see them suffer.</i>

570
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,219
A-ah!

571
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:17,893
I am wet!

572
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,145
Ow!

573
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,774
Don't leave me. Don't leave me!

574
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,903
I hate you!

575
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,571
You never looked better!

576
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,531
We'll get you all!

577
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:38,706
What do you think?

578
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:41,542
It looks the same to me.
It's kinda dull.

579
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:46,339
All you need is a couple of
streaks and your ears pierced.

580
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,132
I can do it free of charge.

581
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:49,842
My ears what?

582
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:51,927
Pierced. Like in you know,
I take a needle

583
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,515
I heat it up and then I dab it
with some alcohol and zap.

584
00:48:55,723 --> 00:48:57,141
All the guys go crazy.

585
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,811
Because I've holes in my ears?

586
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:01,603
What are you, putting me on?

587
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:04,189
Sometimes I can't
figure you out, Linda.

588
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,111
So, where are you
going this weekend?

589
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,321
<i>Nowhere.</i>

590
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,240
Nowhere? Well, you can't
stay around here.

591
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,908
This place is depressing.

592
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,868
<i>I mean, like the tombs.</i>

593
00:49:16,077 --> 00:49:17,620
- Why?
<i>- Why?</i>

594
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,705
<i>What, were you born yesterday?</i>

595
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,958
This is a three-day weekend.

596
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,002
A three-day weekend.

597
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:27,504
So, listen. Why don't
you come home with me?

598
00:49:27,922 --> 00:49:30,424
<i>I only live about five miles
from here and I got this guy</i>

599
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,009
<i>coming up from Metropolis.</i>

600
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,345
I think he knows
your cousin Clark.

601
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,472
<i>His name's Jimmy Olsen.</i>

602
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,100
<i>I think he's real stuck on me.</i>

603
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,937
Anyways, I could ask him
to bring a friend along.

604
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:46,815
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- Oh, nothing.

605
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:47,942
<i>Nothing.</i>

606
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,529
No, I think I'm gonna
stay here and study

607
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,489
get things organized.

608
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:56,909
Don't forget to
call me Saturday.

609
00:49:57,535 --> 00:49:58,744
Just a sec.

610
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:01,622
- Hey, Linda.
- Hi.

611
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:03,624
I'll see you later
at Popeye's then, okay?

612
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,877
- Alright, I'll try. I promise.
- You better. It's gonna be fun.

613
00:50:07,086 --> 00:50:07,961
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

614
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,088
Have a good time.

615
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,549
<i>Come along now, Lucy.</i>

616
00:50:12,717 --> 00:50:15,928
<i>- Oh, mom, how are you doing?
- I've had a terrible week.</i>

617
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:27,333
"Take a spider off his web...

"Uh, so long as the spider
is shut up in the nutshell.

630
00:52:11,085 --> 00:52:13,921
"Or one day goes by...

631
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:16,590
...whichever comes first."

632
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:18,634
Big deal, one day.

633
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:20,719
Why don't you just use,
you know.

634
00:52:20,928 --> 00:52:22,804
I'm saving it for bigger things.

635
00:52:23,097 --> 00:52:25,641
<i>Hi, folks,
you're missing the big sale.</i>

636
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,644
<i>Country and western boys
from the Chicago area.</i>

637
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:31,105
<i>Now to start off the hour.</i>

638
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:50,166
Bianca, get the door.

639
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,794
Bianca!

640
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,635
You rang?

641
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:01,593
Hey, you!

642
00:53:04,555 --> 00:53:05,556
I said...

643
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:07,725
...you rang?

644
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:08,851
Oh, yeah.

645
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,352
How you doing?

646
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:15,858
Uh, I'm looking for some person
called Mrs. Selena?

647
00:53:16,317 --> 00:53:19,611
<i>- Madame</i> Selena.
- Oh.

648
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,449
And you found her, lucky boy.

649
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,909
<i>Entrer.</i>

650
00:53:29,622 --> 00:53:31,707
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

651
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,834
I always see your truck
parked around.

652
00:53:34,043 --> 00:53:35,335
Oh, yeah.

653
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,839
Yeah, I get a lot of repeat
business. People like my work.

654
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:42,259
Yes, I'm sure they do.

655
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,807
- Wet your whistle?
- Huh?

656
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:51,518
Oh, yeah, yeah, as a matter
of fact, I don't mind if I do.

657
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:23,675
So, uh, where's
the one... ha-ha at?

658
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:24,802
It dropped dead.

659
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,429
Where at exactly?
Uh, out back?

660
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:29,056
We might get to know each other
a little more

661
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:33,765
before we dig in
and talk real turkey.

662
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,733
Well, uh, see, I'm kind of
a private person, you know.

663
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:41,443
I mean, I do my work, I go home.

664
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,446
- To your wife?
- No.

665
00:54:43,654 --> 00:54:45,781
At the present moment in time
I'm currently enjoying

666
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,825
a single status in
my personal life.

667
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,076
Cheers.

668
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,244
Bottoms up, huh?

669
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,413
Bottoms up.

670
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:01,046
I noticed you got a pretty
alkaline-looking soil out there.

671
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:02,965
What I want...

672
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,677
...are some houseplants
inside here.

673
00:55:08,012 --> 00:55:10,973
Something that goes well
with the house.

674
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,184
This is a house?

675
00:55:13,851 --> 00:55:15,435
Of course, it's a house.

676
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:18,605
There's the bedroom over there.

677
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,945
I think it's getting
dark in here.

678
00:55:25,988 --> 00:55:29,908
You know, what kind of plant
is gonna wanna...

679
00:55:30,117 --> 00:55:32,244
...grow in this dump?

680
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,913
I don't know.

681
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,249
Shade plants?

682
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,752
- Hmm.
- To us.

683
00:55:40,294 --> 00:55:42,921
Yeah, I'll drink...

684
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,422
...to that.

685
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,930
Hm, you probably killed him,
you know.

686
00:55:55,017 --> 00:55:57,394
Sleep well.

687
00:55:57,895 --> 00:55:59,187
And when you wake...

688
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:03,526
...drown in my eyes
and be all mine.

689
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,822
I'll get it.

690
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:16,913
Oh, hello, Nigel.
It's you.

691
00:56:17,748 --> 00:56:18,874
<i>Nice suit.</i>

692
00:56:20,084 --> 00:56:20,751
Subtle.

693
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,878
I want to see Selena.

694
00:56:23,087 --> 00:56:25,297
She's indisposed at the moment.

695
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:28,675
<i>Whoever it is,
we don't want any.</i>

696
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,220
It's Nigel and
he's not going away

697
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,264
until he talks to you.

698
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:37,017
What the devil do you want?

699
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:39,353
I want to make
a very serious proposal.

700
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,563
In that outfit?

701
00:56:41,939 --> 00:56:44,316
This is a leisure suit.
I've got three days off

702
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:45,943
from those little beasts
at Midvale

703
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,153
and I intend to let
my hair down.

704
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:52,654
Let's talk. Together we could really
rattle some cages.

705
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:55,911
- Know what I mean?
- I'm listening. Make it snappy.

706
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:04,044
Uh-oh.

707
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,007
That ball will not operate
at it's fullest

708
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:53,427
until you internalize
your power, Selena.

709
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,472
Some mosaic invocations.

710
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,140
- Some what?
- Come again?

711
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,267
<i>Exactly, that's my point.</i>

712
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,521
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

713
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:06,523
Because we own the matches.

714
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:10,527
I, of all people,
know a hustle when I hear one.

715
00:58:10,736 --> 00:58:11,778
Now, goodbye, Nigel.

716
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,198
- It was nice talking to you.
- No, it wasn't.

717
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:17,952
<i>I hate to seem pushy,
my fairest of the fair but...</i>

718
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,578
A word of advice, Nigel.

719
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,747
If I had your skin problems,

720
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,458
I'd stop bothering people,
put a bag over my head,

721
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,168
and go live under a bridge!

722
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,127
<i>Ouch!</i>

723
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:31,256
There's nothing wrong
with my skin.

724
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,470
You know, some people.

725
00:58:38,222 --> 00:58:39,473
Where is he?

726
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:42,142
Where is he?

727
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,028
Where is he?

728
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,156
Whoever he sees first,
he'll love with all his heart.

729
00:58:56,365 --> 00:58:57,949
What?
For a day tops, right?

730
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:00,035
He was too young
for you anyway, you know.

731
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:03,288
No, I do not know.
Where is he?

732
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:12,214
<i>Hey, I know that guy.</i>

733
00:59:18,262 --> 00:59:21,682
- Oh, the cable's out.
- Oh, what cable?

734
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:23,850
This is a mirror.

735
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:27,396
So, how come we could...

736
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,064
...ever see him in it?

737
00:59:29,273 --> 00:59:31,566
That was magic, dammit.

738
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,486
The power.

739
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:36,238
Oh, so make it happen again,
you know?

740
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:40,325
I... can't make it happen again.
I don't know how I did it.

741
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:41,576
Oh.

742
00:59:41,994 --> 00:59:44,538
Maybe, you should let
that thing out of it's box.

743
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,458
Maybe, it's more powerful
if you let it out of it's box.

744
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:48,625
- The box.
- The box.

745
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:50,502
- Where is it?
- The box?

746
00:59:50,711 --> 00:59:52,546
It's underneath the rug,
where you left it.

747
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,173
Go ahead.

748
01:00:01,388 --> 01:00:02,680
It's stuck.

749
01:00:06,393 --> 01:00:08,061
This is not my day.

750
01:00:09,271 --> 01:00:10,146
It's stuck?

751
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,565
How could it be stuck?

752
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,401
It's growing.

753
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,696
<i>How could it be growing?
It's made out of lead.</i>

754
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,917
Oh.

755
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,503
Too bad, there's no sound.

756
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,673
How come there's no sound?

757
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:38,550
Get off the road, turkey!

758
01:00:39,718 --> 01:00:41,636
<i>Hey, dummy, you wanna die?</i>

759
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,681
<i>Smoking, stupid?</i>

760
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:45,640
<i>You wanna kill yourself?</i>

761
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,819
<i>She saw a lawyer,
and now she's gonna file.</i>

762
01:00:58,028 --> 01:01:01,281
<i>! told her to take him for
every cent, clean him out.</i>

763
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,700
- Thank you very much.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

764
01:01:08,622 --> 01:01:12,167
Here you go, everybody.
Who wants onion rings?

765
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:13,418
<i>- Yeah, here.</i>
- Thanks.

766
01:01:13,627 --> 01:01:15,712
<i>- Some French fries?
- French fries are mine.</i>

767
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:18,089
Chicken for myself.
Thank you.

768
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,883
- Thanks.
<i>- Side order tomatoes?</i>

769
01:01:20,092 --> 01:01:21,426
Thanks for inviting me, Lucy.

770
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:22,969
I'm glad you could come, Jimmy.

771
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,431
<i>- You want a root beer?
- Yeah, thanks.</i>

772
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,475
Oh, there's Linda.

773
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:32,479
Hey, Linda!

774
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,982
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

775
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,525
That's Clark Kent's cousin?

776
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:38,026
<i>Who's Clark Kent?</i>

777
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:38,985
<i>Is that Linda?</i>

778
01:01:42,489 --> 01:01:43,865
- Guess what.
- What?

779
01:01:44,074 --> 01:01:45,825
There's this all-night party
tonight at Eddie's.

780
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,453
He's the guy with the tattoo.

781
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:49,037
His folks are out of town.

782
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,333
And the guy with the bow tie,
that's Jimmy.

783
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,334
So, you wanna come?

784
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:56,920
I don't know. I'm not
signed out for an overnight.

785
01:01:57,129 --> 01:01:59,756
So what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

786
01:01:59,965 --> 01:02:01,925
Mrs. Murphy's drunk
as a skunk by now.

787
01:02:02,259 --> 01:02:03,635
Totally on another planet.

788
01:02:03,844 --> 01:02:05,971
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

789
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,973
But that's why it'll be fun.

790
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,433
- Okay?
- Okay.

791
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,311
<i>Get off the road, buddy.</i>

792
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,604
<i>Hey, stupid.</i>

793
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,383
Hey, you, space cadet,
get out of the street!

794
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:18,870
Hey, idiot!

795
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,405
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

796
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,032
He's probably on drugs.

797
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,576
And he's gonna get creamed
if he's not too careful.

798
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,412
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- Oh, I'm Kara.

799
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:31,788
- Who?
- Who?

800
01:02:31,997 --> 01:02:33,081
Oh, I'm...

801
01:02:33,832 --> 01:02:34,999
...concerned.

802
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:37,127
Well, that if
we don't do something.

803
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,921
You go out there, try to help
a guy like that and he's

804
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:42,048
<i>probably got a gun or a knife.</i>

805
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,384
<i>It's not too safe.</i>

806
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:45,552
Hey, I'm starving.
Let's eat.

807
01:02:45,886 --> 01:02:47,220
Come on, Linda.

808
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:54,603
Power of shadow.

809
01:02:56,313 --> 01:03:00,813
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

810
01:03:34,184 --> 01:03:35,393
Whoa.

811
01:03:39,231 --> 01:03:41,691
Look at that.

812
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,824
<i>Hey, get out.</i>

813
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,997
<i>Look out.
Watch out.</i>

814
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,467
<i>My car!</i>

815
01:05:14,868 --> 01:05:16,578
You've never seen a tattoo
before, Linda?

816
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:18,455
- Look!
<i>- What's that?</i>

817
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,248
<i>There's somebody hanging
out of it.</i>

818
01:05:20,457 --> 01:05:22,125
<i>Doesn't look like
there's anybody driving.</i>

819
01:05:23,335 --> 01:05:25,879
Oh, my God.
It's a runaway.

820
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,719
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- Hey, what's she doing?

821
01:05:32,928 --> 01:05:34,888
Lucy, be careful.
Lucy!

822
01:05:36,014 --> 01:05:37,974
- Come on.
<i>- Lucy!</i>

823
01:06:12,092 --> 01:06:13,551
God, there's the pump?

824
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,251
<i>She's still in there.</i>

825
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,385
- Oh, excuse me. I'm in a rush.
- I know the feeling.

826
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:02,433
Are you okay?

827
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,228
<i>It's gasoline!
It's gasoline!</i>

828
01:07:46,853 --> 01:07:48,729
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

829
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,639
A storm dragon?

830
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,685
A Supergirl.

831
01:09:16,568 --> 01:09:18,236
Oh, my God!

832
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:25,452
Don't. Don't look at her.

833
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,626
You're gonna be alright.

834
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,920
There's no broken bones.

835
01:09:42,594 --> 01:09:43,636
I love you.

836
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:47,015
What did he say?

837
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:48,850
What did he say?

838
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,144
Looked like "I love you", to me.

839
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,189
No! No!

840
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:56,483
You love me?

841
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:00,111
With all my heart, forever.

842
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,489
A bird of free and careless wing

843
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,658
was I through many
a smiling spring.

844
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:06,409
The cold repulse,
the look askance.

845
01:10:06,618 --> 01:10:09,370
The lightning of
love's angry glance, stay.

846
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,456
Let me behold you.

847
01:10:27,472 --> 01:10:29,390
I have to go.

848
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,477
Like melting wax or withering flower,

849
01:10:33,478 --> 01:10:35,479
I feel my passion...

850
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,482
and thy power.

851
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:40,610
Oh, I have to go.

852
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:44,822
<i>Everything's under control.</i>

853
01:10:45,031 --> 01:10:46,198
Lucy!

854
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,535
<i>Just go on, back to your homes.</i>

855
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:49,536
Lucy.

856
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:51,829
- Oh.
- Thank God.

857
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,626
- You alright?
- I think so.

858
01:10:57,043 --> 01:10:58,085
I hit my head.

859
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:00,171
Nigel must know her.

860
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:03,633
She must be one of his students.
He must have put her up to it.

861
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,094
No. I don't think that at all.

862
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,471
Oh, she just happened
to be in the wrong place

863
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,431
at the wrong time, right?

864
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,018
Materializing
in a bulldozer, huh?

865
01:11:14,227 --> 01:11:15,394
She's a wimpy little thing.

866
01:11:15,645 --> 01:11:17,480
I don't know why you care
what she does, anyway.

867
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:21,150
Because nobody gets in my way.

868
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,652
Why don't you just leave
this poor kid alone

869
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,779
and worry about the
other one that flies?

870
01:11:25,238 --> 01:11:28,741
I worry about everything.
It's my job. Stand back.

871
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:32,536
Oh, come on now.
She's just a teenager.

872
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:37,246
What good is a sword
if it's not unleashed?

873
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:40,003
But she's a total zero.
You don't even know her name.

874
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:43,715
The naming of names
is not necessary.

875
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:47,010
Let us concentrate on her face.

876
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,513
And my Shadow will do the rest.

877
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:52,098
Your what?

878
01:11:52,682 --> 01:11:54,433
Power of Shadow...

879
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:57,186
...take shape.

880
01:11:58,313 --> 01:12:01,733
Look like a vicious dark star.

881
01:12:02,442 --> 01:12:06,154
Seek out, that
wretched young creature.

882
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:09,699
And destroy her wherever she...

883
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,411
...are.

884
01:12:13,745 --> 01:12:15,163
Oh, God.
That's awful.

885
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:16,831
That's never gonna work.

886
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:37,643
Oh, my God!

887
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:40,480
I'm scared.

888
01:13:06,172 --> 01:13:07,548
Next time...

889
01:13:09,175 --> 01:13:11,093
...remind me to
do this outside.

890
01:15:54,632 --> 01:15:57,843
Leave this place and do no harm.

891
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,639
There she is again.

892
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:04,559
What did she say?

893
01:16:05,393 --> 01:16:06,811
No, this is not possible.

894
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,397
This is not right.

895
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,982
Where's the wimp?

896
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:12,567
Ah!

897
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:14,944
Argh!

898
01:16:24,412 --> 01:16:25,496
Argh!

899
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,083
I think he can take care of her.

900
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:30,167
Ah!

901
01:16:31,544 --> 01:16:32,878
Argh!

902
01:16:52,273 --> 01:16:54,566
See?
What did I tell you?

903
01:16:55,443 --> 01:16:57,027
She quit, right?

904
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:58,071
Wrong.

905
01:18:04,053 --> 01:18:05,888
Every time!

906
01:18:06,097 --> 01:18:07,973
Every time!

907
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:11,144
Send a man to do a woman's job
and that's what you get.

908
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:15,564
Damn her eyes.
Who is she?

909
01:18:15,773 --> 01:18:18,817
- Are you asking me?
- I'm telling you.

910
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:20,736
Find out!

911
01:18:20,945 --> 01:18:24,782
Well, sure. But, you know,
I think I recognize the costume.

912
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:31,830
<i>Leave him alone. Let him.</i>

913
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,791
Where have you been?

914
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,668
- Outside...
- Look at you.

915
01:18:36,502 --> 01:18:37,878
Look at those clothes.

916
01:18:38,087 --> 01:18:39,421
Oh, I'll go change.
I'm sorry.

917
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:42,925
And you'll put on
your proper school uniform.

918
01:18:43,134 --> 01:18:45,636
And get out of that
ridiculous costume.

919
01:18:45,845 --> 01:18:46,804
Yes, ma'am.

920
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:49,098
- And cover your legs.
- Yes, ma'am.

921
01:18:49,807 --> 01:18:52,142
Don't you "yes, ma'am" me.

922
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:53,603
No, ma'am.

923
01:18:56,272 --> 01:18:58,148
I think you're blowing
this thing out of proportion

924
01:18:58,358 --> 01:18:59,359
if you want my opinion.

925
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,945
Oh, no. This box is
definitely getting bigger...

926
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,364
...and uglier.

927
01:19:05,573 --> 01:19:07,491
All I'm saying is
you can't go nuts

928
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,369
over a landscape guy and a
teenager in a blue suit.

929
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:11,996
She flies.

930
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,748
Can you get that through
your thick skull

931
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,460
and into your
tiny brain, Bianca?

932
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:20,088
The girl can fly.

933
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:38,564
Okay.

934
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,024
Now.

935
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:42,985
Let's get serious.

936
01:19:44,028 --> 01:19:46,780
Come to mama.

937
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:50,200
<i>- Oh.
- Oh.</i>

938
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:54,497
Oh.

939
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:55,623
Whoa.

940
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:58,394
- Selena, cut it out.
- I'm not doing it.

941
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,759
I think we're venturing where

942
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:32,929
you know, fools rush in
and angels fear to tread.

943
01:21:33,262 --> 01:21:36,265
I'm no angel.

944
01:22:25,606 --> 01:22:27,024
It's the wimp again.

945
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:30,027
And she's trespassing.

946
01:22:31,904 --> 01:22:33,905
First the school...

947
01:22:33,906 --> 01:22:36,908
Now here.

948
01:22:36,909 --> 01:22:40,912
You know, this thing reacts
whenever she's around.

949
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:44,416
And whenever she shows up,
that girl that flies...

950
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,418
that "Supergirl"...

951
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:49,921
Isn't far behind.

952
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:52,424
Maybe they're best friends.

953
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,486
Hello.

954
01:23:12,695 --> 01:23:15,030
Oh, no. Not now.

955
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:17,407
'Tis only but me, my love.

956
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:19,368
Please, you'll let
everyone know.

957
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:20,911
What?
That I love you?

958
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,663
I'd shout it from
the highest hill.

959
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:24,498
Please don't.

960
01:23:24,707 --> 01:23:27,459
I know you think me the fool,
at least tell me your name.

961
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,044
Linda. Linda Lee.

962
01:23:29,545 --> 01:23:30,462
Linda.

963
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:32,715
Lovely Linda Lee.

964
01:23:33,716 --> 01:23:35,843
These roses pale beside thee.

965
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:38,721
Oh.

966
01:23:40,264 --> 01:23:41,139
Well, thank you, but I'm...

967
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,684
And sweet chocolates
for my sweet Linda.

968
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:46,395
Hm.

969
01:23:55,905 --> 01:23:56,864
What are you doing?

970
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:00,534
Please?

971
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:03,746
Oh, no, I...

972
01:24:03,955 --> 01:24:04,789
Please.

973
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,916
Well, alright.
But just for a minute.

974
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:22,598
You hate me, don't you?

975
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:26,143
Hate you?
I don't even know you.

976
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:27,644
I don't even know your name.

977
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:29,522
Ethan.

978
01:24:30,273 --> 01:24:33,985
Say my name aloud but once
and I shall die the happy fool.

979
01:24:34,193 --> 01:24:35,444
- Look, Ethan...
- Huh!

980
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:39,990
Ethan.

981
01:24:41,867 --> 01:24:42,784
Ethan.

982
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:46,997
Your soft caress
did at once renew

983
01:24:47,206 --> 01:24:48,832
the beating of
this broken heart.

984
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,293
Are you crazy?

985
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:55,756
Marry me?

986
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:08,102
Marry you?

987
01:25:09,103 --> 01:25:11,230
- I don't...
- Don't say it. Don't, please.

988
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:12,231
I know.

989
01:25:12,773 --> 01:25:13,565
What?

990
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:16,318
We're from different worlds.

991
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:19,822
- You mean, you know where I'm...
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

992
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:22,575
Love makes everything possible.

993
01:25:23,242 --> 01:25:26,828
A poor uneducated gardener can
indeed worship a rich debutante

994
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:28,831
and make her happy
if she'd just...

995
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,499
Oh, Ethan.

996
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:32,834
I'm not rich.
I'm just...

997
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:35,296
Well, then I'll support us both.

998
01:25:36,839 --> 01:25:38,882
You're nuts, you know that?

999
01:25:39,091 --> 01:25:42,135
You're so sweet,
but you're out of your mind.

1000
01:25:44,096 --> 01:25:45,263
Over you.

1001
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:56,275
What a touching scene.

1002
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:29,100
Round and round they go.

1003
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:32,436
Where they stop.

1004
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:46,032
Boy, you're really getting
the hang of this.

1005
01:26:47,743 --> 01:26:48,994
Oh.

1006
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:56,001
Where is she?

1007
01:26:59,922 --> 01:27:01,423
Jesus.

1008
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:03,884
Who are you?

1009
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,762
I am Selena.

1010
01:27:07,596 --> 01:27:09,431
Diadanus of Catania.

1011
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,560
Priestess of Sechnid.
I am the ultimate Siren of Endor

1012
01:27:13,769 --> 01:27:18,269
and you, little lady, are
trespassing on private property.

1013
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:21,485
She means him.

1014
01:27:22,111 --> 01:27:24,196
I am Kara of Argo City.

1015
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,323
Daughter of Alura and Zor-El.

1016
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:29,409
And I don't scare easily.

1017
01:27:29,618 --> 01:27:30,577
No?

1018
01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:32,204
<i>No.</i>

1019
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,456
Try...

1020
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,167
...this.

1021
01:27:54,685 --> 01:27:58,230
This lady is improving by leaps
and bounds, I gotta tell you.

1022
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:22,939
You okay?

1023
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:24,817
No.

1024
01:29:26,902 --> 01:29:29,446
You want a hacksaw or somethin'?

1025
01:29:41,917 --> 01:29:46,004
Now I am really upset.

1026
01:30:34,386 --> 01:30:35,637
What's going on?

1027
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:37,973
Oh.

1028
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:39,975
Put me down.

1029
01:30:49,109 --> 01:30:50,860
<i>- Where am I?
- You're safe.</i>

1030
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:53,113
Safe? Where's Linda?

1031
01:30:53,322 --> 01:30:54,948
Put me down.

1032
01:31:00,245 --> 01:31:02,163
- Where's my Linda?
- Take it easy.

1033
01:31:10,089 --> 01:31:11,006
Ethan.

1034
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:13,175
Ha-ha. Very clever.

1035
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:15,760
That ought to keep her out
of your hair for a few hours.

1036
01:31:16,095 --> 01:31:18,722
Clever?
A cheap trick.

1037
01:31:22,851 --> 01:31:24,978
Power of Shadow.

1038
01:31:25,187 --> 01:31:28,773
Bring him to me.

1039
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:39,197
Bring him... to me.

1040
01:31:42,204 --> 01:31:43,121
Ugh!

1041
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,372
Didn't work, huh?

1042
01:31:44,581 --> 01:31:45,915
Maybe they're too far away.

1043
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:48,961
I can make the sky rain coconuts
with pinpoint accuracy.

1044
01:31:49,169 --> 01:31:52,964
But I still can't control
men's minds.

1045
01:31:53,799 --> 01:31:55,425
Not with her around.

1046
01:31:55,634 --> 01:31:56,676
So maybe...

1047
01:31:56,885 --> 01:31:58,887
Now, don't go through the roof.

1048
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:00,722
But maybe we ought to back down

1049
01:32:00,931 --> 01:32:03,725
and give old
you-know-who a call.

1050
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:05,727
You-know-who.

1051
01:32:05,936 --> 01:32:07,604
- Spit it out.
- Nigel.

1052
01:32:07,813 --> 01:32:09,397
I shall pretend
you didn't say that.

1053
01:32:09,606 --> 01:32:10,773
<i>But I did.</i>

1054
01:32:10,983 --> 01:32:12,526
All I'm thinking and forgive me

1055
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:14,695
for thinking out of turn here...

1056
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:17,114
...is that
he's been around.

1057
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:19,741
He knows things we don't.

1058
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:22,411
<i>Plus, the way you wrap
him around your little finger</i>

1059
01:32:22,619 --> 01:32:24,412
<i>I'm always amazed.</i>

1060
01:33:03,952 --> 01:33:07,955
- You must think me a babe in the woods.
- Not at all.

1061
01:33:07,956 --> 01:33:10,458
Scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours.

1062
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:12,294
What's in it for me?

1063
01:33:13,378 --> 01:33:14,420
Me.

1064
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:15,881
Ah-ha.

1065
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:20,590
Think of the combination, Nigel.

1066
01:33:20,594 --> 01:33:24,097
- The two of us.
- One more time, please.

1067
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:27,308
My dear Nigel, the way to
a woman's heart is through

1068
01:33:27,309 --> 01:33:29,394
the elimination of her rivals.

1069
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,979
Murder?
Are you proposing that...

1070
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:34,441
Oh, certainly not.
Leave that to me.

1071
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:37,861
You deliver the goods.
Her.

1072
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:39,613
Her? How?

1073
01:33:40,322 --> 01:33:41,740
By getting me...

1074
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,325
...him.

1075
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:46,161
- She'll follow.
- Well, I don't.

1076
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:49,164
- Follow any of this, I mean...
- Put that down.

1077
01:33:52,584 --> 01:33:54,544
Nigel, I want one thing.

1078
01:33:55,003 --> 01:33:57,463
Time to master my new toy.

1079
01:33:57,673 --> 01:34:00,174
<i>So, we can rule the world?</i>

1080
01:34:00,175 --> 01:34:02,510
We...

1081
01:34:04,012 --> 01:34:06,514
and she, I have become convinced,

1082
01:34:07,015 --> 01:34:11,515
poses some vague yet
potent and undeniable threat.

1083
01:34:12,396 --> 01:34:16,896
She's authentic, then?
The suit is not a joke. It's not rented.

1084
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,285
The cape flaps for real.

1085
01:34:18,297 --> 01:34:22,431
We have every reason
to believe it's legitimate.

1086
01:34:22,614 --> 01:34:24,449
And you want him here?

1087
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:26,159
Johnny Appleseed
in your living room?

1088
01:34:26,368 --> 01:34:28,328
Yes. In the flesh.

1089
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:29,913
So, she'll follow?

1090
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:32,958
- No other reason?
- None.

1091
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:35,460
You're sure of that?

1092
01:34:36,753 --> 01:34:40,715
<i>Whoops, I'm sorry.
The little spider got out.</i>

1093
01:34:41,383 --> 01:34:42,592
What?

1094
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,096
Where am I?

1095
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:50,559
- Who are you?
- Kara.

1096
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:52,060
Kara?

1097
01:34:54,438 --> 01:34:55,522
What happened?

1098
01:34:55,731 --> 01:34:57,899
You got hit on the head
by a coconut.

1099
01:34:58,567 --> 01:35:00,151
- Huh?
- Hm.

1100
01:35:00,903 --> 01:35:02,321
What's with
the Halloween costume?

1101
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:07,326
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

1102
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:08,619
What do you mean?

1103
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:10,871
Look, I have to go now.

1104
01:35:11,079 --> 01:35:13,331
I'll come back for you later.
I've just gotta get back to

1105
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:14,624
the amusement park.

1106
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:16,960
Amusement park?
Linda!

1107
01:35:19,004 --> 01:35:21,089
I gotta find Linda,
she was in trouble.

1108
01:35:21,798 --> 01:35:25,051
Well, Linda's alright.
She can take care of herself.

1109
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:26,427
<i>No, no. She can't.
Something's wrong.</i>

1110
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:28,513
She's in big trouble
and I love her.

1111
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:30,891
I love her.

1112
01:35:32,726 --> 01:35:34,352
Yeah, I do love her.

1113
01:35:37,522 --> 01:35:39,232
I have to go, Ethan.
Goodbye.

1114
01:35:39,691 --> 01:35:41,025
Yes, so do I.

1115
01:35:42,361 --> 01:35:43,737
Hey!

1116
01:35:48,867 --> 01:35:51,035
I told you Linda can
take care of herself.

1117
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:54,289
- You just flew over my head.
- I'll take care of everything.

1118
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:57,167
I said you just flew over
my head. True or false?

1119
01:35:58,335 --> 01:35:59,294
True.

1120
01:36:00,754 --> 01:36:02,130
Like Superman.

1121
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:03,673
He's my cousin.

1122
01:36:04,466 --> 01:36:06,759
- He's your cousin?
- Yes.

1123
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:08,678
I shouldn't be telling you
this though...

1124
01:36:08,887 --> 01:36:10,972
Wait one minute. I mean you can
do the whole number, leap tall

1125
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:13,391
buildings with a single bound?
And look right through things?

1126
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,893
- Yes
- Bend steel bars?

1127
01:36:16,436 --> 01:36:18,563
- Yes.
- Whoa!

1128
01:36:20,482 --> 01:36:22,692
- Oh, Selena. I have to go.
- Wait a minute.

1129
01:36:22,901 --> 01:36:24,152
- Selena has the Omegahedron.
- Please take me with you.

1130
01:36:24,361 --> 01:36:25,862
I have to find Linda.

1131
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:28,990
Well, Nigel. Are we in business?

1132
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:31,993
- I'm thinking about it.
- He probably can't even do it.

1133
01:36:31,994 --> 01:36:35,496
Oh, indeed I can, but I need
the little mystery ball.

1134
01:36:35,497 --> 01:36:39,501
- No way.
- No ball, no trick.

1135
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:43,005
Okay. But I keep hold of it.

1136
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:53,056
What is it?

1137
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,725
The Burundi Wand.

1138
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,061
Pure, unadulterated evil.

1139
01:36:59,229 --> 01:37:00,521
Ready?

1140
01:37:29,468 --> 01:37:30,927
But how can you love her?

1141
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,429
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

1142
01:37:34,264 --> 01:37:35,723
And she's in trouble,
then I got no business

1143
01:37:35,932 --> 01:37:37,808
standing here, talking with you.

1144
01:37:38,393 --> 01:37:40,061
Even if you are
what you say you are.

1145
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:42,522
Linda is not in trouble.

1146
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:45,817
Look, uh, don't make me
get rough, okay?

1147
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:48,194
You wouldn't stand a chance.

1148
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:50,321
Please trust me.

1149
01:37:50,989 --> 01:37:52,699
Linda is alright.

1150
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,326
How do you know?

1151
01:37:56,119 --> 01:37:57,537
I just...

1152
01:37:58,997 --> 01:38:00,081
...know.

1153
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,678
Linda.

1154
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:25,732
Oh, my God.

1155
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,692
How did you do that?

1156
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:34,240
Ethan.

1157
01:38:37,035 --> 01:38:38,077
Ethan!

1158
01:38:41,748 --> 01:38:45,293
Nigel, you are wonderful.

1159
01:38:45,961 --> 01:38:48,380
Pure genius.

1160
01:38:49,756 --> 01:38:51,382
You deserve...

1161
01:38:52,008 --> 01:38:53,259
...me.

1162
01:39:16,616 --> 01:39:18,492
And something else.

1163
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:28,420
Now, let's get out of this dump.

1164
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:31,965
<i>Did you see this thing?
Look at this!</i>

1165
01:39:32,632 --> 01:39:34,425
Hey, what's the matter?
Catchin' flies?

1166
01:39:34,634 --> 01:39:36,344
Lucy, look.

1167
01:39:38,972 --> 01:39:40,807
<i>One minute nothing.
The next minute this.</i>

1168
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:42,475
<i>What is it?</i>

1169
01:39:44,352 --> 01:39:46,479
<i>It's a mountain, Lucy.
Isn't it?</i>

1170
01:39:46,688 --> 01:39:48,314
<i>Tell me I'm not seeing things.</i>

1171
01:39:48,523 --> 01:39:49,607
<i>How did it get there, Jimmy?</i>

1172
01:39:49,816 --> 01:39:51,484
<i>I don't know.
It just appeared.</i>

1173
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:53,653
<i>How can a mountain just appear?</i>

1174
01:39:54,237 --> 01:39:56,197
<i>Hey, there's something on the top.</i>

1175
01:39:56,948 --> 01:39:58,658
<i>Looks like a castle.</i>

1176
01:39:58,867 --> 01:40:00,535
<i>Looks more like a fortress.</i>

1177
01:40:49,668 --> 01:40:50,627
Ethan?

1178
01:40:58,009 --> 01:40:59,010
Ethan.

1179
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:32,460
<i>Ethan!</i>

1180
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:34,420
Ah.

1181
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:02,824
Enjoy your prison, Supergirl...

1182
01:42:03,992 --> 01:42:07,537
...forever and ever.

1183
01:42:11,124 --> 01:42:13,042
No, Ethan!

1184
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:15,003
Don't do it!

1185
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:16,838
<i>Ethan!</i>

1186
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:49,263
Where am I?

1187
01:45:10,303 --> 01:45:12,305
<i>You can't arrest me
without a warrant.</i>

1188
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,058
I'm calling my lawyer.

1189
01:45:23,775 --> 01:45:24,609
Slow down.

1190
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:26,361
<i>We want Selena out.</i>

1191
01:45:28,029 --> 01:45:30,031
Smile, lunkhead.
You're not a gardener anymore.

1192
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,950
You're Prince Ethan, now.

1193
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,701
How much longer are the telephone lines
going to be closed?

1194
01:45:34,702 --> 01:45:37,204
My wife's very sick in the hospital
in Metropolis. I've got to get through!

1195
01:45:37,705 --> 01:45:39,706
When are you going to reopen the airport?

1196
01:45:39,707 --> 01:45:41,291
Are we gonna stand up
to her or not?

1197
01:45:41,501 --> 01:45:42,418
<i>Yes.</i>

1198
01:45:42,627 --> 01:45:43,753
Selena must go!

1199
01:45:43,962 --> 01:45:45,588
Who's this little twerpette?

1200
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:47,465
She's someone
who believes in freedom.

1201
01:45:47,715 --> 01:45:49,466
Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

1202
01:45:49,717 --> 01:45:51,510
<i>I don't know, who you are.</i>

1203
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:53,303
Or what evil force
you represent.

1204
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:56,641
But if you think you can get rid
of anybody who stands up to you.

1205
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,686
Just make them disappear.
Like my friend Linda.

1206
01:46:00,353 --> 01:46:01,270
Who?

1207
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:02,521
Linda, my roommate.

1208
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:04,773
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

1209
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:08,986
The wimp.

1210
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:12,281
Seize them!

1211
01:46:14,951 --> 01:46:16,160
<i>Leave her alone!</i>

1212
01:46:16,369 --> 01:46:17,536
<i>Drive off.</i>

1213
01:46:17,787 --> 01:46:19,288
Leave her alone.

1214
01:46:19,622 --> 01:46:21,457
Nobody messes around
with Jimmy Olsen!

1215
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:24,293
Now, let go of me.
I'm with the press!

1216
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,151
Zaltar.

1217
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,361
Squirt.

1218
01:48:16,197 --> 01:48:18,991
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

1219
01:48:21,244 --> 01:48:24,038
Zaltar, it's me.
It's Kara.

1220
01:48:24,247 --> 01:48:25,456
I know.

1221
01:48:27,709 --> 01:48:29,127
Squirt.

1222
01:48:34,298 --> 01:48:35,841
What is that?

1223
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:40,555
- Where are we?
- Where are we?

1224
01:48:43,266 --> 01:48:47,270
- Here.
- But where?

1225
01:48:47,937 --> 01:48:49,480
Nowhere.

1226
01:48:52,525 --> 01:48:53,901
The Phantom Zone?

1227
01:48:54,193 --> 01:48:56,486
It's lonely here, my Kara.

1228
01:48:57,780 --> 01:48:59,072
So sad.

1229
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,786
So long ago.

1230
01:49:04,787 --> 01:49:07,789
No, Zaltar, only days.

1231
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:10,792
And only days left.

1232
01:49:10,793 --> 01:49:12,794
Zaltar, we have to get back to earth.

1233
01:49:12,795 --> 01:49:15,297
We have to get the omegahedron
and get it back to Argo City.

1234
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:20,595
I've been here forever
and I shall stay here forever.

1235
01:49:23,806 --> 01:49:28,306
Zaltar, the person who has the
power source, she tricked me.

1236
01:49:28,311 --> 01:49:32,811
- She sent me here and I have to...
- Stay here forever, too.

1237
01:49:32,815 --> 01:49:37,315
She sounds formidable,
someone to be reckoned with.

1238
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,821
She's a sorceress, a wicked and desp...

1239
01:49:39,822 --> 01:49:43,450
More powerful than the guardians, is she?

1240
01:49:44,952 --> 01:49:49,452
- But the guardians are good.
- Zaltar is bad.

1241
01:49:51,459 --> 01:49:54,462
Worse than this wicked sorceress.

1242
01:49:58,466 --> 01:50:01,468
Self-pity.

1243
01:50:01,469 --> 01:50:04,972
You always taught me
to have pride, Zaltar.

1244
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:07,099
Pride...

1245
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:09,101
Should a man whose foolish ambitions

1246
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:13,602
destroy all that he loves have pride?

1247
01:50:14,107 --> 01:50:17,610
If you think that, then I am a fool
who has taught you nothing.

1248
01:50:23,616 --> 01:50:26,118
I guess our next move is
to take over the world, huh?

1249
01:50:26,119 --> 01:50:29,622
- I'm ready when you are, honey.
- First things first.

1250
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:31,624
- Ethan.
- Yes, my darling?

1251
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,627
Don't call me your "darling",
you despise me.

1252
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:38,131
- Bring me the coffer of shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

1253
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:44,633
I think we need something...

1254
01:50:46,681 --> 01:50:47,640
<i>There.</i>

1255
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:53,729
Oh, Jimmy.

1256
01:50:55,148 --> 01:50:56,691
Oh, terrific.

1257
01:50:56,899 --> 01:51:00,235
The old dangling-in-a-cage
routine.

1258
01:51:00,444 --> 01:51:02,529
Pathetic, Selena.

1259
01:51:04,323 --> 01:51:07,034
- Who's that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

1260
01:51:08,536 --> 01:51:11,037
I would have thought a ceiling fan, myself.

1261
01:51:11,038 --> 01:51:13,040
But it's your house.

1262
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:15,542
What are they for?

1263
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:19,547
Insurance.

1264
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:24,593
But you can't just give up.

1265
01:51:24,802 --> 01:51:26,845
You founded a whole city.

1266
01:51:27,054 --> 01:51:29,765
I did, and then
I doomed it to destruction.

1267
01:51:29,974 --> 01:51:32,226
That was an error.
A tragic one.

1268
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:34,562
When you're my age
and you make as many

1269
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:37,564
tragic errors as I do,
it is a different tune

1270
01:51:37,773 --> 01:51:38,732
that you will sing.

1271
01:51:38,941 --> 01:51:40,817
I will not.
I'll never give up.

1272
01:51:41,027 --> 01:51:43,571
I will never spend my entire
life in a place like this.

1273
01:51:43,821 --> 01:51:46,198
- I would die first!
- Strong words.

1274
01:51:46,407 --> 01:51:50,119
There are worse things than
dying and I deserve every one.

1275
01:52:07,094 --> 01:52:10,764
- What is this?
- A horse... I think.

1276
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:15,853
On earth I think
it's called a horse.

1277
01:52:16,562 --> 01:52:18,730
- And you made this here?
- Mm.

1278
01:52:21,651 --> 01:52:24,111
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1279
01:52:24,362 --> 01:52:26,614
Earth, Zaltar.
Earth, a tree, a horse.

1280
01:52:26,822 --> 01:52:28,240
You keep making things
from earth.

1281
01:52:28,449 --> 01:52:30,659
- The place intrigues me.
- Well, then, let's go there.

1282
01:52:30,868 --> 01:52:33,203
Certainly.
When is the next train?

1283
01:52:34,705 --> 01:52:36,039
What is a train?

1284
01:52:39,335 --> 01:52:42,504
What's so funny?
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

1285
01:52:43,798 --> 01:52:45,508
I'm only laughing at myself.

1286
01:52:45,716 --> 01:52:48,385
For you, I weep.

1287
01:52:49,637 --> 01:52:51,430
Is this train a way out of here?

1288
01:52:51,639 --> 01:52:54,058
There is no way out of here.

1289
01:52:54,725 --> 01:52:57,227
That is the point
of the Phantom Zone.

1290
01:52:57,645 --> 01:53:00,606
My neighbors now: The criminals,
the corrupt, the evil...

1291
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:01,857
...they're here.

1292
01:53:02,066 --> 01:53:03,650
Over the hill there.

1293
01:53:03,859 --> 01:53:05,527
With no way out.

1294
01:53:06,404 --> 01:53:09,907
But, there's always a way out.

1295
01:53:10,116 --> 01:53:12,785
<i>If there's a way in,
there's a way out.</i>

1296
01:53:15,871 --> 01:53:17,539
There is a way.

1297
01:53:18,874 --> 01:53:21,293
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

1298
01:53:21,502 --> 01:53:23,504
No, it wouldn't work.

1299
01:53:23,713 --> 01:53:25,089
<i>You'd be swept into
a singularity</i>

1300
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:26,590
if it didn't work. No.

1301
01:53:27,341 --> 01:53:29,968
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

1302
01:53:35,182 --> 01:53:36,892
I could do it.

1303
01:53:40,021 --> 01:53:42,732
Then, please.
At least teach me how.

1304
01:53:42,940 --> 01:53:44,858
There's nothing to teach.
You can't, as they say

1305
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:49,609
practice at the rift.
You get one chance only.

1306
01:53:50,364 --> 01:53:53,033
- The rift?
- Sure? You won't have a squirt?

1307
01:53:53,284 --> 01:53:56,412
Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.

1308
01:54:02,918 --> 01:54:04,127
You're right.

1309
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:07,798
You are absolutely right.

1310
01:54:10,801 --> 01:54:13,845
There is enough doom
and gloom in the air already.

1311
01:54:14,055 --> 01:54:16,265
And it is better
to accept defeat

1312
01:54:16,474 --> 01:54:18,976
than to take a chance and try
like fools to redeem ourselves

1313
01:54:19,268 --> 01:54:21,728
<i>and save our city and all those
who we love there.</i>

1314
01:54:21,937 --> 01:54:24,147
Plus all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress

1315
01:54:24,398 --> 01:54:27,192
is going to make suffer
just because of us. Cheers!

1316
01:54:31,781 --> 01:54:33,449
We could die trying.

1317
01:54:34,867 --> 01:54:36,451
But we won't.

1318
01:54:36,994 --> 01:54:38,996
Come on.

1319
01:55:15,741 --> 01:55:17,117
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

1320
01:55:17,535 --> 01:55:20,412
Thursday. Friday.

1321
01:55:20,621 --> 01:55:22,998
Just like here, we go
for the cops first, right?

1322
01:55:23,207 --> 01:55:24,875
And the army.

1323
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:28,045
By Saturday, we have
the continental United States,

1324
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:30,214
Mexico, Canada.

1325
01:55:32,049 --> 01:55:35,552
- Wish we'd kept our mouths shut.
- I'm not afraid to die.

1326
01:55:35,553 --> 01:55:38,305
I'm proud of us.

1327
01:55:40,808 --> 01:55:44,812
Lucy, there's something I've always
wanted to say to you.

1328
01:55:45,312 --> 01:55:48,440
Guess I'd better say it now.

1329
01:55:48,441 --> 01:55:52,941
Um, I've been in love with you f...
for many years.

1330
01:55:54,447 --> 01:55:58,947
- You have?
- Mm-hmm.

1331
01:55:59,452 --> 01:56:03,952
Remember when you used to visit
your sister in the newsroom?

1332
01:56:03,956 --> 01:56:06,458
You used to put your
fingerprints on my lens.

1333
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:09,961
Remember? I was trying desperately
to get you attention.

1334
01:56:09,962 --> 01:56:12,464
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1335
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:18,471
You mean, we could have...
we could have been...

1336
01:56:18,971 --> 01:56:21,473
You know what...
all this time?

1337
01:56:21,474 --> 01:56:23,976
You betcha.

1338
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:30,483
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You were supposed to guess.

1339
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:39,491
- Aah!
- Careful!

1340
01:56:39,492 --> 01:56:42,494
Kara! Kara! My child!

1341
01:56:42,495 --> 01:56:45,997
Where is it, Zaltar?
Where's the rift?

1342
01:56:45,998 --> 01:56:49,001
- Where is it?
- Everywhere. And nowhere.

1343
01:56:50,503 --> 01:56:54,005
We don't find the rift, we make it.

1344
01:56:54,006 --> 01:56:58,009
Zaltar, now of all times,
no double-talk, I beg you.

1345
01:56:58,010 --> 01:57:00,011
Double-talk?

1346
01:57:00,012 --> 01:57:04,015
Our life is too short to squander it
on double-talk.

1347
01:57:04,016 --> 01:57:07,519
Look: The Phantom Zone.

1348
01:57:09,021 --> 01:57:12,024
Get up.

1349
01:57:24,828 --> 01:57:27,247
<i>Oh, my God, Selena.
It's the box.</i>

1350
01:57:27,456 --> 01:57:29,708
- Hush it up.
- No.

1351
01:57:30,292 --> 01:57:34,045
What the box wants,
the box gets.

1352
01:57:50,312 --> 01:57:51,646
What is it?

1353
01:57:51,855 --> 01:57:53,523
Fascinating.

1354
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:57,944
I don't know.

1355
01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:01,073
Is this it?

1356
01:58:01,282 --> 01:58:02,449
Is this the way out?

1357
01:58:02,658 --> 01:58:06,411
Not yet!
This is the Quantum Vortex!

1358
01:58:07,121 --> 01:58:10,040
We must risk
our destruction in it.

1359
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:14,920
To move mountains,
you must make sacrifices.

1360
01:58:15,129 --> 01:58:17,047
Zaltar, I'm scared!

1361
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:19,925
Accept your fears.

1362
01:58:20,217 --> 01:58:22,344
Confront your demons.

1363
01:58:22,636 --> 01:58:26,181
Find your destiny
in the maelstrom!

1364
01:59:16,607 --> 01:59:18,817
Zaltar, I can't.
I can't.

1365
01:59:19,026 --> 01:59:22,070
You... can!

1366
01:59:46,887 --> 01:59:49,139
Two specks.
Look!

1367
01:59:55,437 --> 01:59:56,980
What do I do?

1368
01:59:58,023 --> 02:00:01,359
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

1369
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:08,325
She's with some old guy,
it looks like.

1370
02:00:08,534 --> 02:00:11,119
Move, huh.
Come on!

1371
02:00:11,328 --> 02:00:12,912
Calm down, okay.

1372
02:00:13,455 --> 02:00:17,208
Ah. This is what I want.

1373
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:21,254
The Salian Fireballs.

1374
02:00:21,463 --> 02:00:25,425
<i>Page 321. Chapter 6.</i>

1375
02:00:40,441 --> 02:00:41,442
Whoa!

1376
02:00:42,651 --> 02:00:44,152
What is that?

1377
02:00:48,657 --> 02:00:49,949
Watch out!

1378
02:01:17,936 --> 02:01:19,562
"Power of Rainmaking". No!

1379
02:01:19,772 --> 02:01:21,106
"How to separate
husband and wife."

1380
02:01:21,315 --> 02:01:22,816
No, not now.
Not now!

1381
02:01:23,025 --> 02:01:25,902
Well, you better find something
fast, like an atom bomb.

1382
02:01:37,956 --> 02:01:38,998
I found it.

1383
02:01:40,876 --> 02:01:45,376
"Summoning... the demon storm."

1384

<i>Hurry... go.</i>

1385
02:01:48,258 --> 02:01:51,594
Higher girl, higher.

1386
02:01:51,804 --> 02:01:55,766
- Come with me!
- I am with you!

1387
02:01:55,974 --> 02:01:57,475
On, girl.

1388
02:02:10,322 --> 02:02:12,198
I am with you.

1389
02:02:16,119 --> 02:02:17,745
Zaltar!

1390
02:03:11,258 --> 02:03:12,634
Oh, thank God.

1391
02:03:16,263 --> 02:03:19,599
You've had your fun, Selena.
The game is finished.

1392
02:03:19,808 --> 02:03:21,100
Hardly.

1393
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:24,396
One false step, bluebird.

1394
02:03:24,605 --> 02:03:28,775
And even if you don't,
your friends will get the point.

1395
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:32,946
<i>Hey, no!</i>

1396
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:41,329
I don't like this.

1397
02:03:42,039 --> 02:03:44,249
Don't worry, Lucy.
Don't worry.

1398
02:03:46,251 --> 02:03:48,253
I wouldn't if I were you.

1399
02:03:48,462 --> 02:03:50,839
Well, you're not me.

1400
02:03:57,471 --> 02:03:58,763
- Oh!
- Ah!

1401
02:03:59,389 --> 02:04:02,100
Quick, get out of the way.
Into the alcove over there.

1402
02:04:02,309 --> 02:04:04,686
- Come on, out.
- Hurry, Jimmy. Hurry.

1403
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:11,234
The Omegahedron, Selena.

1404
02:04:11,443 --> 02:04:12,861
I want it.

1405
02:04:13,153 --> 02:04:17,653
Well, then, Supergirl.
You shall have it.

1406
02:04:42,891 --> 02:04:43,850
Ah!

1407
02:04:51,024 --> 02:04:51,983
Ah!

1408
02:05:03,745 --> 02:05:05,580
Supergirl, above you.
Look out!

1409
02:05:10,085 --> 02:05:10,960
Ah!

1410
02:05:19,803 --> 02:05:23,223
I think I'll be going.
If you'll excuse me.

1411
02:05:28,478 --> 02:05:31,063
That's what I said.
I'm staying, I'm staying.

1412
02:05:45,078 --> 02:05:47,371
You have no friends, Selena.

1413
02:05:47,581 --> 02:05:49,916
You treat everyone as if
they were put on this earth

1414
02:05:50,125 --> 02:05:51,584
to serve you.

1415
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:54,212
More or less, I think they were.

1416
02:05:55,297 --> 02:05:57,299
You included.

1417
02:06:00,677 --> 02:06:02,762
Power of shadow.

1418
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:05,098
Appear!

1419
02:06:26,328 --> 02:06:28,246
Power of shadow...

1420
02:06:30,707 --> 02:06:33,459
...destroy her!

1421
02:07:13,625 --> 02:07:14,667
Ah!

1422
02:07:14,876 --> 02:07:15,751
Oh!

1423
02:07:29,224 --> 02:07:31,601
I... can't.

1424
02:07:33,145 --> 02:07:35,147
I can't!

1425
02:07:35,355 --> 02:07:37,607
<i>You can!</i>

1426
02:07:39,442 --> 02:07:41,694
<i>On, girl.</i>

1427
02:07:50,787 --> 02:07:51,829
Yes!

1428
02:08:02,007 --> 02:08:04,592
Confront her with it!
It's the only way!

1429
02:08:20,317 --> 02:08:21,568
O-oh!

1430
02:08:35,624 --> 02:08:37,250
No, no, no!

1431
02:08:47,886 --> 02:08:49,304
<i>Argh!</i>

1432
02:09:27,217 --> 02:09:27,967
Oh!

1433
02:09:28,843 --> 02:09:30,177
I have to go.

1434
02:09:30,387 --> 02:09:32,180
I have to return this
to where it belongs.

1435
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:33,931
<i>And I must
ask you all something.</i>

1436
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:37,101
It's alright, Supergirl.
We never saw you.

1437
02:09:37,310 --> 02:09:38,811
We never even heard of you.

1438
02:09:39,187 --> 02:09:40,313
Thank you.

1439
02:09:40,855 --> 02:09:42,773
<i>Ethan, Linda, she...</i>

1440
02:09:42,983 --> 02:09:45,110
Well, she had to leave
in a hurry, but she...

1441
02:09:45,318 --> 02:09:46,986
You don't have to say a word.

1442
02:09:47,821 --> 02:09:49,072
I know.

1443
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:57,038
I'll explain about Linda.

1444
02:09:58,623 --> 02:09:59,999
Thank you, Ethan.

1445
02:10:01,418 --> 02:10:03,044
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

1446
02:10:26,401 --> 02:10:29,362
Wow!
That was some kiss.

1447
02:10:29,571 --> 02:10:30,446
Wow!

1448
02:10:36,286 --> 02:10:38,787
Better get a shot of where
that mountain used to be.

1449
02:10:38,788 --> 02:10:42,792
Oh, Jimmy. Can't you stop thinking
of your career for a second?

1450
02:10:43,293 --> 02:10:44,794
Haven't we wasted enough time?

1451
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:53,802
Nigel!
I'm so glad to see you.

1452
02:10:53,803 --> 02:10:55,805
I've been trying to find you.

1453
02:10:55,972 --> 02:10:59,975
I wanted to know more about the little bone
in the right side of a frog.

1454
02:10:59,976 --> 02:11:02,979
Uh, it's a toad, my dear.
A red toad.

1455
02:11:03,063 --> 02:11:06,816
And that little bone is
in the left hand side.

1456
02:11:09,319 --> 02:11:10,945
Goodbye, Linda.

1457
02:11:42,936 --> 02:11:45,020
- You guys take it easy, okay?
- Take care.

1458
02:11:45,021 --> 02:11:47,023
- Good luck!
- Bye. See you soon.

1459
02:11:47,315 --> 02:11:49,025
Take it easy.
