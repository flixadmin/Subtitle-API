00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:33,525
[Lock clicks]

318
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,527
Mr. and Mrs., uh, who?

319
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:38,079
Drew Sharp's parents.

320
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:41,583
Drew Sharp-- that's the kid on TV.
The missing, uh--

321
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:44,953
So but why would you, uh--
Scratch that.

322
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:46,838
I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

323
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:50,542
Uh, thing is,
what those folks want

324
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,210
is to know what happened
to their boy.

325
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,045
Sack full of cash
on their doorstep--

326
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:56,548
that's just gonna
raise more questions.

327
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,518
Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
That's Mike's granddaughter?

328
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:04,005
- So this is Mike's money?
- It's mine.

329
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:06,007
It's your money.
Okay.

330
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,802
And you're giving it
to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...

331
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:10,760
It's what Mike wanted.

332
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:15,450
So you and Mike, uh...

333
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:17,518
You've been in touch?

334
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:25,543
So we're just
talking about charity?

335
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,712
Yeah.

336
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:30,081
Okay, look.
You know, um,

337
00:24:30,132 --> 00:24:33,751
shelling out money to the ex
and her little boy-- I kinda get it.

338
00:24:33,803 --> 00:24:35,970
I mean, kinda. But this--
[Laughs]

339
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:37,472
This is a bridge too far.

340
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:39,174
I'm sorry to say, kid,

341
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:43,044
but you're still gonna be
two miracles short of sainthood.

342
00:24:46,315 --> 00:24:49,150
Brass tacks, okay?
My job is to advise.

343
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:53,021
And my advice is...
Come on, already.

344
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:55,273
Mike left one step ahead
of the boys in blue,

345
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:57,525
and you better believe
his family's on the radar.

346
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,110
A couple million bucks
shows up,

347
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:01,112
they're gonna snatch it
<i>tout de suite.</i>

348
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:03,198
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twice.

349
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,399
What are you
you going for a hat trick?

350
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,702
- I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.
- No, no, no!

351
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:09,287
I was just--
I was thinking out loud.

352
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:11,789
Enough bullshit, Saul.
Are you gonna do this or not?

353
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:15,210
Yes, yes, absolutely.
I-- I live to serve.

354
00:25:18,347 --> 00:25:20,682
And, kid, you might
wanna think about

355
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:22,634
cleaning up a little,
getting some rest.

356
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:25,086
- You've looked better.
- Just get it done.

357
00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:36,030
You know who this is?
Don't hang up on me.

358
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,433
Yeah, there's a problem.

359
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:42,270
There's five million of them
here in my office.

360
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:46,324
No. No. Don't.
Just hold onto it.

361
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:51,112
Yes. Ye--

362
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,914
Yes.

363
00:25:52,948 --> 00:25:54,949
Calm down.

364
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:58,586
I'll handle it.

365
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,954

00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,720
[Knock at door]

00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:33,026
[Knock at window]

[Knocking continues]

Déjà vu, huh?

370
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,724
Jesus.

371
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:06,776
All right, look.

372
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:10,313
You wanna talk me through this?

373
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:12,698
What you were thinking?

374
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:18,287
What you asked Saul to do?
I mean, come on.

375
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:20,656
It's just nonsensical.

376
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,251
I mean, do you...

377
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:35,388
You have any explanation
at all?

378
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:39,258
[Mutters]

379
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:40,960
What?

380
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:44,680
It's like you said.
It's...

381
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,849
It's blood money.

382
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,568
I s--

383
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:53,523
[Sighs]
Jeez. Okay. Yes. All right.

384
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:57,026
I said that. I did.

385
00:27:58,695 --> 00:28:01,247
But it was in--
in the heat of the moment.

386
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:04,250
I was trying to win
an argument, all right?

387
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:08,171
And I was wrong.

388
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,373
This is your money.

389
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:12,758
Come on.
You've earned it.

390
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:35,681
Drew Sharp.

391
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:40,369
That is a terrible memory,
no doubt about it.

392
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,491
But, son...

393
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:49,195
you need to stop focusing

394
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:51,964
on the darkness behind you.

395
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,333
The past is the past.

396
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:02,008
Nothing can change
what we've done.

397
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,978
But now that's over.

398
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:09,899
You're out,

399
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,101
and so am I.

400
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:17,573
That's right.
I'm done.

401
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,411
I've been out
for about a month.

402
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:27,950
And there is nothing left
for us to do

403
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:32,788
except to try to live...

404
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,876
ordinary, decent lives.

405
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:54,860
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

406
00:29:58,282 --> 00:30:00,783
She needs someone
looking after her.

407
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:04,937
Mike is perfectly capable

408
00:30:04,955 --> 00:30:07,657
of looking after
his own granddaughter.

409
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:12,778
I don't think so.

410
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:15,748
I don't think he is capable.

411
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:19,001
I don't think he's coming back.

412
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:21,387
What--
what are you saying?

413
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:26,309
You doing what you did--

414
00:30:26,343 --> 00:30:29,011
offing Mike's guys?

415
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:32,014
If he was out there,

416
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:35,067
you would have to look over your
shoulder for the rest of your life,

417
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,069
and that's not
how you do things.

418
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:39,071
So I think he's dead,

419
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:42,692
and I think you know that.

420
00:30:44,995 --> 00:30:47,530
I don't know that.

421
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:52,168
I don't.

422
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,372
Listen to me.

423
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:59,625
I did not kill Mike.

424
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:03,162
The last time that I saw him,

425
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,931
he had his bag--
the one that I brought him--

426
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,267
and he got into his car,
and he drove away.

427
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:10,970
And for all I know,
he is alive and well.

428
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,893
And if-- and if
he does come back,

429
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:21,564
and he doesn't understand
why I had to do what I did...

430
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:25,618
well, then, that's on me.

431
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:31,741
Jesse...

432
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:36,746
I need you to believe this.

433
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:43,636
It's not true.
It's just not.

434
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:50,509
So he's out there.
He's okay.

435
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:52,378
Yes.

436
00:31:52,396 --> 00:31:54,480
Mike is fine.

437
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:56,982
Wherever he is.

438
00:31:57,017 --> 00:32:00,736
We both know that
he can take care of himself.

439
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:03,906
And he's certainly capable

440
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,942
to provide for
his own family, okay?

441
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,248
Jesse?

442
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,502
I need you to believe me.

443
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:24,543
Yeah. Like you said.

444
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,546
He's alive.

445
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,750
Yeah.

446
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:35,688
Mike's alive.

447
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:40,976
[Sighs]

448
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,263
Absolutely.

449
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:53,739
[Skyler] Well, you've gotta
have a college counselor.

450
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:55,207
Are they bringing in
someone new?

451
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,775
I don't know.

452
00:32:56,793 --> 00:32:58,494
Um, maybe she'll be back.

453
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:00,713
And what if she's not?
What are you supposed to do?

454
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:02,915
I mean, what's Louis gonna do?

455
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:05,584
- He's-- he's not worried.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

456
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:08,471
What's there to worry about?
It's only college, right?

457
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:10,139
Right.

458
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:12,558
College.
Nothing more important.

459
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:15,127
Oh. You know, Uncle Hank's
still not feeling well,

460
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:17,763
so bowling's off
tomorrow night.

461
00:33:17,797 --> 00:33:19,098
[Walter, Jr.]
Really?

462
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:22,601
Really. So you're spared
a night out with the family.

463
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:24,854
You do not have to look
so happy about it.

464
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:26,856
I'll be right back.

465
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:28,741
Um...

466
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,361
so if bowling's off,

467
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:36,365
can I--
can I get a late curfew?

468
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:48,260
Ah. Ugh.

469
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:51,497
[Retching]

470
00:34:48,238 --> 00:34:49,405
[Retching]

471
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,778
Are you gonna
turn off the light?

472
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:58,163
Have you seen <i>Leaves Of Grass?</i>

473
00:34:58,198 --> 00:35:00,082
Hmm?

474
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:02,501
My book.
Walt Whitman.

475
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:04,420
Dark green hardcover?

476
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:06,872
I didn't even know we had that.

477
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:09,894
Hmm.

478
00:35:15,217 --> 00:35:17,769
You don't think Junior...

479
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,821
You're kidding, right?

480
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:24,108
Well, it'll show up.

481
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,511
What's wrong with Hank?

482
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:47,682
Mm, it's a stomach bug,
sounds like.

483
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:50,885
He hasn't been to work
all week.

484
00:35:52,054 --> 00:35:53,921
[Sighs]

485
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:56,774
Well, good night.

486
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:00,524
Good night.

487
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:11,553
Mister, can you help me out?

488
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:13,889
Spare some change?

489
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:27,853
Hey. Come back.

490
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,372
Yeah. You. Come here.

491
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:32,408
I got something for you.

492
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:39,248
Here.

493
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:41,083
Take it.

494
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:42,801
Go ahead.

495
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:46,922
Just take it.

496
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:50,976
Take it.

497
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:56,815
Yeah.
[Engine starts]

498
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:12,364
[Barking]

499
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:28,747
[Grunting]

500
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:37,422
[Agent Scott] Anything you
want us to tell Steve Gomez?

501
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,108
He says he's worried about you.

502
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:41,810
Yeah. Tell him
I already got two grandmas.

503
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:47,483
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

504
00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:52,604
- We better hit it.
- Yeah.

505
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:54,907
See ya.

506
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:16,178
[Walt] - Hey, guys.
- Walt.

507
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:18,347
- How are you? Good to see you.
- How you doing?

508
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:21,133
Very good. Yeah. Well, you know.
I can't complain.

509
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:23,736
Hey, how's your son's arm, by the way?
I was thinking about that.

510
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,654
It's back to 100%.
We're going to District.

511
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:27,689
It's gonna be exciting.
When? This Saturday?

512
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:30,859
This Saturday morning. I think
first pitch is at 10:00 AM, so, uh...

513
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,194
- 10:00.
- Yeah.

514
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:33,862
Be there.
Should be a big crowd.

515
00:40:33,913 --> 00:40:36,281
Guys, you're still on the clock here!
Let's go!

516
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:37,449
See you, Walt.

517
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:38,784
- See you, Artie.
- See you, Walt.

518
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:40,318
All right, Scott.
Be well.

519
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,825
They're good guys, huh?

520
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:48,427
Yeah.

521
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:51,213
- Well, it's good to see you
up and about. - Yeah.

522
00:40:51,264 --> 00:40:53,465
- How you feeling?
- Well, you know,

523
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:57,035
I've been better, but...
I don't know.

524
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,771
You--
Did you get to see a doctor?

525
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:01,440
I mean,
when one of these things

526
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:02,908
lasts more than three days

527
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:04,659
you really should
get that checked.

528
00:41:04,694 --> 00:41:06,661
Yeah, no, I--
I did and I'm fine.

529
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:09,564
I'm, uh-- I'm what they say
on the upswing, you know?

530
00:41:09,582 --> 00:41:12,284
Mm. Good.
Good to hear.

531
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,286
Yeah.

532
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:17,289
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I--

533
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,960
Well, looks like you have
the work coming to you.

534
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:24,579
Perks of being the boss, huh?

535
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:26,631
Yeah, you know...

536
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,587
How's, uh--
how's things at the car wash?

537
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:34,639
- Good.
- Yeah?

538
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,608
Yeah, really good.

539
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:41,480
Hey, did you have
any of that potato salad?

540
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,317
- I don't know. Ma-- maybe.
- Yeah, I mean,

541
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:49,071
no one else got sick, so you
probably shouldn't worry about it.

542
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:56,495
Well, Skyler will be very happy to
hear that you're feeling better.

543
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:57,963
Which reminds me.

544
00:41:57,997 --> 00:42:00,048
I better get back to it.

545
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,621
If there's anything I can do...

546
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:14,629
Feel better.
[Pats back]

547
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:28,410
You know...

548
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,413
You're gonna laugh,

549
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:34,699
but I have to ask you
about this.

550
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:39,171
Believe it or not,
I found this on my car.

551
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:41,373
I mean, it looks just like
the GPS tracker

552
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:43,625
that we used on Gus Fring,
doesn't it?

553
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:47,546
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us?

554
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,601
You wouldn't know anything
about this, would you, Hank?

555
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,195
[Garage door closing]

556
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:11,536
You okay?

557
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:15,240
I gotta say, I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

558
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,748
Ugh!

559
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:25,800
[Groaning]

560
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:31,039
- Hank--
- It was you.

561
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:33,892
All along, it was you!

562
00:43:33,926 --> 00:43:36,178
You son of a bitch.

563
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:38,847
You drove into traffic
to keep me from that laundry.

564
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:40,982
Calm down.

565
00:43:41,017 --> 00:43:44,102
That call I got telling me
Marie was in the hospital...

566
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:46,721
that wasn't Pinkman.

567
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:48,723
You had my cell number.

568
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:52,444
You killed ten witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

569
00:43:52,495 --> 00:43:56,064
- Listen to me--
- You bombed a nursing home.

570
00:43:56,082 --> 00:43:59,534
Heisenberg. Heisenberg!

571
00:43:59,568 --> 00:44:02,370
You lying,
two-faced sack of shit.

572
00:44:02,404 --> 00:44:04,372
Hank, look,

573
00:44:04,406 --> 00:44:06,908
I don't know where this is
coming from, Hank, but just--

574
00:44:06,926 --> 00:44:10,929
I swear to Christ,
I will put you under the jail.

575
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:13,181
Just take a breath, okay?
Just listen to yourself.

576
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:16,017
These wild accusations--
they could destroy our family.

577
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:18,853
- And for what?
- Damn, like you give a shit about family!

578
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:27,946
Hank, my cancer is back.

579
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:31,283
Good.

580
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:33,618
Rot, you son of a bitch.

581
00:44:34,654 --> 00:44:36,655
I'm sorry you feel that way.

582
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,408
I wanna beat this thing.
I do.

583
00:44:40,442 --> 00:44:44,045
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

584
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:48,300
But the truth is in six months,

585
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:52,003
you won't have
someone to prosecute.

586
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,757
But even--

587
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:58,560
even if somehow

588
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:02,264
you were able
to convince anyone

589
00:45:02,298 --> 00:45:05,016
I was capable
of doing these things,

590
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:07,902
you and I both know

591
00:45:07,937 --> 00:45:10,939
I would never see
the inside of a jail cell.

592
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:20,248
I'm a dying man
who runs a car wash.

593
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:24,536
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

594
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:32,127
What's the point?

595
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:39,718
Have Skyler
bring the kids here,

596
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:42,270
and then we'll talk.

597
00:45:45,941 --> 00:45:49,344
That is not going to happen.

598
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:56,985
I don't know who you are.

599
00:45:58,988 --> 00:46:01,990
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

600
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:08,913
If that's true,

601
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:12,533
if you don't know who I am...

602
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,890
then maybe your best course...

603
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:23,928
would be to tread lightly.

604
00:46:38,473 --> 00:46:42,500
