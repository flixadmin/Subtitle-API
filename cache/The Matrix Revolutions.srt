1
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,790
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,458
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,421
- Should we try to contact them?
- Won't matter. My gut says they're down.

4
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,674
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

5
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,301
I was afraid you'd say that.

6
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,137
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

7
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,764
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

8
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:43,145
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- The sooner we find them the better.

9
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,904
- Thought you could use something to eat.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,990
Any change?

11
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,202
No.

12
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,206
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

13
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,917
At least until he wakes up.

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,296
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

15
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,632
He'd better have some good answers.

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,968
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

17
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:19,181
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

18
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:24,144
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

19
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:29,024
Roland, I'd like to run another
search through the Matrix.

20
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,527
- For what?
- For Neo.

21
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,947
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

22
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,824
Please, for me.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,545
This is what keeps bothering me.

24
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,297
What?

25
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,592
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

26
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,720
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

27
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:03,600
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

28
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,197
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.

29
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,575
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

30
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:24,246
Based on point of entry and the past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

31
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,583
Jesus H. Christ.

32
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,879
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

33
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,465
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

34
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:39,469
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.

35
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:44,057
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?

36
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,518
Operator.

37
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,897
It's Seraph.

38
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:55,027
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

39
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,998
Good morning.

40
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:12,794
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

41
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:17,299
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

42
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:21,678
Are you lost, Neo?

43
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:28,894
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

44
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,482
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

45
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,986
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

46
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,949
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

47
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,827
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

48
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,331
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

49
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,920
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

50
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:13,188
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

51
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,524
One thing I've learned in all my years...

52
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,902
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

53
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:23,532
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

54
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:29,538
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

55
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,124
I'm sorry this had to happen.

56
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,878
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

57
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,381
...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

58
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,219
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

59
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,971
What choice?

60
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,974
To help you, to guide Neo.

61
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:54,062
Now, since the real test for any choice
is having to make the same choice again...

62
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,066
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

63
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:02,321
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

64
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,324
...because here I am, at it again.

65
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:09,411
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

66
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,333
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

67
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,629
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

68
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:23,425
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

69
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,762
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

70
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,349
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

71
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,685
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

72
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,687
The Merovingian.

73
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:40,734
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

74
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:45,197
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

75
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,034
For years he has protected me.

76
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,663
I hope he can do the same for you.

77
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:57,084
Please, follow me.

78
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,130
Oracle...

79
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,508
I know, Morpheus.

80
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,470
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

81
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:13,267
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

82
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,143
I don't.

83
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,980
I expect just what I've always expected:

84
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:22,484
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don't.

85
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:28,115
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

86
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,869
He needs all our help.

87
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,746
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

88
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,164
No.

89
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:41,044
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

90
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,840
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

91
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,468
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

92
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,597
Yes, Papa.

93
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,979
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

94
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,524
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

95
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:07,738
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

96
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,990
We are most honored to meet you.

97
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,826
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

98
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:17,039
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

99
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:21,293
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

100
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,962
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

101
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:30,135
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

102
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,929
It's okay.

103
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,639
I don't have an answer.

104
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,559
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.

105
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:41,813
It is between your world and our world.

106
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,108
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

107
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,236
Why did I know you would say that?

108
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:51,573
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

109
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,368
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

110
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:58,497
I know that if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

111
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,875
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

112
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,669
Is that what you're doing here?

113
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,798
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

114
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,176
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

115
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,761
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,723
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

117
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,686
The answer is simple.

118
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,109
I love my daughter very much.

119
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,821
I find her to be the most beautiful
thing I have ever seen.

120
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,740
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

121
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,577
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

122
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,122
If it does not, it is deleted.

123
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,419
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

124
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,881
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

125
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,009
Heard a program speak of love.

126
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:56,555
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

127
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:02,603
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

128
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,982
I see that you are in love.

129
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:11,195
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

130
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,696
Anything.

131
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:19,745
Then perhaps the reason you are here is not
so different than the reason I am here.

132
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,837
That's him.

133
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,882
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

134
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,968
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

135
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:40,224
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

136
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,442
Oh, no!

137
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,039
Damn it!

138
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,254
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

139
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,090
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

140
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,719
- You think it has something to do with me?
- I cannot say.

141
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,722
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

142
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,725
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

143
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,686
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

144
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,397
She promised to watch Sati
after we said goodbye.

145
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,524
Goodbye?

146
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,360
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

147
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,573
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

148
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:23,327
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

149
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,455
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

150
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,833
Karma is a word, like love.

151
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,793
A way of saying:

152
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,213
"What I am here to do."

153
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:38,008
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

154
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:41,720
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

155
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:47,434
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

156
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:53,774
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

157
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,985
Can I carry that for you?

158
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,656
All right.

159
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,287
Hurry it up, I'm late!

160
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,795
- Who are you?
- He is a friend.

161
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,756
I know you.

162
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:22,636
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

163
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,180
I'll pay you whatever you want.

164
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,808
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

165
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,685
Oh, no, no, no.

166
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,771
You'll stay here until
the Merovingian says different.

167
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,481
If I know him...

168
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,360
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

169
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,406
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

170
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,200
I built this place.

171
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:51,164
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

172
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:59,673
Down here, I'm God.

173
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:05,804
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

174
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:23,071
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

175
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,492
No. We know what has to be done.

176
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,551
Shit.

177
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,830
You gotta be kidding.

178
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,625
Holy shit, it's wingless.

179
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,335
I get it.

180
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,547
You must be ready to die.

181
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,257
I need to speak with him.

182
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,720
Only way you're getting through
this door is over my big, dead ass.

183
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,682
So be it.

184
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,873
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.

185
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,501
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

186
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,088
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

187
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,132
And if we're unlucky?

188
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,635
There will be many men.

189
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:13,140
Can I take your...? Oh, my God.

190
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:37,409
What in the hell?

191
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,997
I don't believe this.

192
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,254
Hey!

193
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:56,595
The prodigal child returns.

194
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:02,768
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

195
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:06,230
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

196
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,566
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

197
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,569
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

198
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:18,325
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through hell to do so. Yes?

199
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,494
I'll tell you what I will do.

200
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,873
Put down the guns, and I will promise
you a safe passage out of here.

201
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:28,335
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

202
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:31,839
Of course.

203
00:19:56,405 --> 00:20:02,369
Who could have guessed we would see
each other so soon after our last meeting?

204
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,414
The Fates are too kind, eh?

205
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:09,084
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

206
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:14,089
I can only surmise that the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

207
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,551
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

208
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,221
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

209
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,725
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

210
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:29,980
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

211
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:33,400
You know why we are here?

212
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,737
Come now, what kind of question is this?
Of course I know.

213
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,989
It is my business to know.

214
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:42,659
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

215
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:49,166
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

216
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,460
- Do you know?
- No.

217
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,378
No?

218
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,714
I did not think so.

219
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,800
But it is always best to ask, huh?

220
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:02,471
We want to make a deal.

221
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:06,934
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

222
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:11,438
Okay. I have something you want.

223
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,565
To make a deal...

224
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:19,279
...you must have something
I want, yes?

225
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,784
And it so happens
there is something I want.

226
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:28,330
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

227
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,542
It is said they cannot be taken...

228
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,044
...they can only be given.

229
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:36,964
What?

230
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,052
The eyes of the Oracle.

231
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,891
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

232
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,811
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.

233
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,648
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

234
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:57,109
Where others see chance...

235
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:02,239
...I see cost.

236
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,577
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

237
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:10,163
...and I will give you back your savior.

238
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:15,335
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

239
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:18,213
Yes? No?

240
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,384
I don't have time for this shit.

241
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,417
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

242
00:22:55,626 --> 00:23:00,422
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

243
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:05,010
Interesting deal.

244
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:11,517
You are really ready to die
for this man?

245
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,645
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

246
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,648
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

247
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,067
She's in love.

248
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:25,572
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

249
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,324
Time's up.

250
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,536
What's it gonna be, Merv?

251
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:37,584
Okay. You got yourself in here...

252
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:41,797
...you can get yourself out.

253
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,303
Are you ready for us?

254
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,472
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.

255
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,766
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

256
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:39,354
No, sir. We read something,
but I couldn't tell what.

257
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,444
I can't leave yet.

258
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,823
I have to see her.

259
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,160
Now?

260
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,205
It's my last chance.

261
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,666
That's it. That's the secret.

262
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,336
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

263
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:06,590
Cookies need love like everything does.

264
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,550
Neo!

265
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:14,515
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

266
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,893
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

267
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,938
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

268
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,690
Okay.

269
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:27,861
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

270
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,617
So do you recognize me?

271
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:36,995
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

272
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,998
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

273
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:45,504
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

274
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:49,049
...but I still love candy.

275
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:51,385
No, thank you.

276
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,721
Remember how you were
when you first walked through my door?

277
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:59,893
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

278
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:03,564
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

279
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,775
You gave me a few surprises too.

280
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,236
I hope I helped.

281
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,906
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

282
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:14,783
Where is this going?

283
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:17,619
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

284
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:21,540
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...

285
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:27,171
...no one can see beyond a choice
they don't understand, and I mean no one.

286
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:31,216
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

287
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:34,011
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

288
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,139
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

289
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:40,851
- Of course not.
- Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?

290
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:46,023
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

291
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:50,360
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?

292
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,780
You know who.

293
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:57,951
Know Thyself

294
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,414
I did.

295
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:05,918
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

296
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,961
So do I.

297
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,924
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

298
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:15,302
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

299
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:20,599
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

300
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:24,728
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

301
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:28,482
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

302
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,901
- Where?
- The source.

303
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:36,073
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it.

304
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:43,372
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

305
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:48,669
The Architect said that if I didn't return to
the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.

306
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:53,131
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

307
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,385
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

308
00:27:56,593 --> 00:28:00,222
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

309
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,100
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

310
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:07,354
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

311
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:11,441
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

312
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,735
What's your purpose?

313
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:15,946
To unbalance it.

314
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,657
Why? What do you want?

315
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:22,327
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

316
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:25,706
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

317
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:28,834
The end of the war.

318
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,044
Is it going to end?

319
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,714
One way or another.

320
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:37,551
Can Zion be saved?

321
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:43,223
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

322
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:48,228
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

323
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:52,608
- Where?
- You know where.

324
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:56,195
And if you can't find the answer...

325
00:28:56,403 --> 00:29:01,325
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

326
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:05,621
What does that mean?

327
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:11,793
Everything that has a beginning...

328
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,421
...has an end.

329
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,549
I see the end coming.

330
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:20,594
I see the darkness spreading.

331
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,763
I see death.

332
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,600
And you are all that stands in his way.

333
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,769
Smith.

334
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:33,273
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.

335
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:36,193
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

336
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,571
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

337
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,114
What is he?

338
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,242
He is you.

339
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,827
Your opposite, your negative.

340
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:49,748
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

341
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:54,461
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

342
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,881
...this war is going to end.

343
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,970
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

344
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,473
...or in his.

345
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:25,534
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

346
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:35,002
I need time.

347
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:41,758
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

348
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,261
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.

349
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:48,056
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

350
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,524
I love that smell.

351
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:01,195
I sure am going to miss it.

352
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:04,489
- Oracle.
- I know.

353
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:05,866
I know.

354
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,661
Sati, honey.

355
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,206
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

356
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,125
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

357
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:20,214
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

358
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:25,385
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

359
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,409
I'm scared, Seraph.

360
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,955
Come.

361
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,834
He's following us.

362
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:46,800
Well, well, it's been a long time.

363
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:50,053
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

364
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,306
I have beaten you before.

365
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:58,687
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

366
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:02,274
And you must be the last exile.

367
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,986
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?

368
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:08,322
What did she say about me?

369
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,324
That you were a bad man.

370
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:16,705
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

371
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:49,947
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

372
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:55,702
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

373
00:33:55,911 --> 00:34:02,084
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised.
How can she be? She knows everything.

374
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:06,421
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

375
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,175
Why wouldn't she leave?

376
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,723
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

377
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:20,435
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

378
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:22,312
...deliberately, purposefully...

379
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:27,359
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

380
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:29,945
What did you do with Sati?

381
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:36,201
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

382
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,829
You are a bastard.

383
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:42,875
You would know, Mom.

384
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,921
Do what you're here to do.

385
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,592
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:40,766
I really wish I could help, but I just...
I don't remember any of it.

387
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:45,312
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

388
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:48,065
Yeah, definitely.

389
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,859
You're right about that, sir.

390
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:54,404
They look like they might be self-inflicted.

391
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:58,825
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

392
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:03,747
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

393
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:10,087
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

394
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:18,011
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.

395
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,348
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

396
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:24,893
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

397
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:29,064
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

398
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:35,362
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.

399
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,925
Sir, we found her.

400
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,177
- The "Logos"?
- Yes, sir.

401
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:01,847
About time we had
some goddamn good news.

402
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:34,379
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

403
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,215
No, sir. Nothing yet.

404
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:40,010
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's still intact.

405
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:44,723
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.

406
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:58,987
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

407
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:16,797
Careful, sir.

408
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:22,761
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

409
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:50,289
What was that?

410
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:55,460
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.

411
00:38:55,669 --> 00:39:00,132
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

412
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,887
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

413
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:09,391
We didn't know what happened after...

414
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:12,895
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

415
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:15,814
I'm happy to see you too.

416
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,858
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

417
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:20,194
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

418
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:23,280
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.

419
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:28,702
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.

420
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:32,915
Exactly what I needed to hear.

421
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:36,293
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

422
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:40,881
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside the city...

423
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,634
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

424
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,844
Thus, our primary objective must be...

425
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:49,473
...to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

426
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:53,894
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent
them from ever reaching the city.

427
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:57,189
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...

428
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,525
...will be at the entrance of the temple.

429
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:02,444
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

430
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:05,906
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

431
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:09,076
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

432
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:10,619
That is correct.

433
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:15,165
Precisely what size force are you planning
to commit to the primary dock objective?

434
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:18,877
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

435
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:22,089
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councillor...

436
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:25,551
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

437
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,594
...and march them into that dock.

438
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:30,514
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

439
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,766
Time will tell, councillor.

440
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:35,602
Commander, just one more question.

441
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:38,063
Has there been word
from the "Nebuchadnezzar"?

442
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:41,692
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

443
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,861
Perhaps.

444
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,654
But we can hope.

445
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:50,534
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

446
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,839
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

447
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,675
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

448
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:09,511
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

449
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,349
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

450
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:20,480
Kids, you stay here.

451
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:23,275
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

452
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,485
- I have to.
- Why?

453
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,322
Because I love him.

454
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,866
I love him the same as he loves me.

455
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:35,078
And if I were out there and he were here,
I know what he'd do.

456
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:40,292
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

457
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:44,171
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

458
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:48,217
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

459
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:52,012
...what would you do?

460
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:59,061
Make shells.

461
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,198
What the shit is going on over here?

462
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:14,868
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

463
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:17,204
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

464
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:20,082
A unit volunteer, sir.

465
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:24,503
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

466
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:29,383
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

467
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,635
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

468
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:35,305
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

469
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:36,473
Okay, I'm 16.

470
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:40,310
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

471
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:45,774
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

472
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:48,110
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

473
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,155
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

474
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:59,079
You do, and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

475
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:14,511
Okay, charge the igniter.

476
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:21,310
She lives again.

477
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:24,479
You want to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

478
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:29,568
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield
while you're at it?

479
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:35,490
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

480
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,953
Looking good, except...

481
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,331
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

482
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:45,709
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

483
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:50,214
{y:i}- What's going on in there?
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

484
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:53,133
The machines have taken Junction 21.

485
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:56,428
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

486
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:59,598
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

487
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:03,894
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can,
then blow our EMP.

488
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:09,566
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

489
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,488
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

490
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:16,156
No, it's not.

491
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:19,368
There's another way. A support line.

492
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:23,413
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

493
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:27,501
If we're lucky, we may be able to slip down
without them ever knowing.

494
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,920
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

495
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,172
- No one can pilot a mechanical.
- I can.

496
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:33,841
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

497
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:37,886
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

498
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:44,184
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

499
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:48,272
Hi.

500
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,026
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

501
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:56,989
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

502
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:59,283
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

503
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:02,661
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

504
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,497
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

505
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:08,166
To go where?

506
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,211
To the machine city.

507
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,466
I know it's difficult to understand.

508
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,344
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

509
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:20,888
I still have to go.

510
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:24,224
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

511
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:27,102
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

512
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:30,731
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

513
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:33,775
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

514
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:36,069
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

515
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:39,156
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

516
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:42,534
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

517
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:48,040
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

518
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:55,088
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

519
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:58,217
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

520
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:00,594
...with my ship
after that little speech.

521
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:05,599
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

522
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:09,353
If we leave inside the hour,
we should reach Zion as the machines do.

523
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:12,105
That's as good a plan as any.

524
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:17,486
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

525
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:24,743
Two ships, two directions.

526
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:28,580
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

527
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,917
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

528
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:35,254
Then why are you doing this?

529
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,465
I believe in him.

530
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:42,344
Thank you.

531
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:48,767
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

532
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:52,271
To make it easier for you to remember.

533
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:55,482
What if I don't want to remember?

534
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:57,734
Why would you want that?

535
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:01,822
What if I blew that EMP?

536
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,907
What if I did destroy those ships...

537
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:10,372
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

538
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:13,917
If I did that...

539
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:19,339
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

540
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:33,478
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

541
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,905
I'm ready.

542
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:45,866
Trinity...

543
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:50,162
...there's something I have to say.

544
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:55,584
Something you need to understand.

545
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,629
I know I'm supposed to go.

546
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:01,840
But beyond that...

547
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,468
...I don't know. I...

548
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:10,057
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

549
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:15,395
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

550
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:21,193
Just like you knew the moment you looked
at me that I was coming with you.

551
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:24,571
I'm scared, Trin.

552
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,366
So am I.

553
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:31,995
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

554
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:34,248
But I'll tell you something.

555
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:37,417
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

556
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:42,047
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

557
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:45,676
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

558
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:47,928
No.

559
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,764
Nothing.

560
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:04,903
{y:i}- Finished loading ammunition?
- Just about.

561
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,406
Let's move it. We are out of time.

562
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,908
You're not leaving them anything?

563
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:13,704
He said he didn't need it.

564
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:19,793
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

565
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:23,297
Thank you.

566
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:29,553
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

567
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:32,639
Me too.

568
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:38,437
It was an honor, sir.

569
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:44,735
No, the honor is still mine.

570
00:49:57,206 --> 00:50:01,251
{y:i}- We're ready, sir.
- About damn time.

571
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:06,507
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

572
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:10,636
Bye, baby.

573
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:14,139
Take good care of them.

574
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:37,788
Ready?

575
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:46,088
Engine's still firing.

576
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:50,384
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

577
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:06,650
- I should've known he'd send his bitch first.
- Bane.

578
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:09,945
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

579
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:12,114
Every time, I thought it was the last.

580
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:16,118
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

581
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:21,415
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

582
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:24,251
What are you talking about?

583
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:31,133
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

584
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:49,443
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

585
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:53,197
You're gonna pay for that.

586
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:56,283
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
{y:i}- We got an emergency.

587
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:58,994
- What is it, AK?
{y:i}- It's Maggie, sir.

588
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:01,288
{y:i}She's dead, murdered.
{y:i}I think it was Bane.

589
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:05,459
Goddamn it.

590
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:09,296
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

591
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,256
He fired that EMP.

592
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:15,093
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

593
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:19,681
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

594
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:23,685
- I know where he is.
- The "Logos".

595
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:25,604
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.

596
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:28,690
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.

597
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:30,776
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...

598
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:34,029
...he'll control another EMP.

599
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:39,409
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

600
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:41,870
Mr. Anderson.

601
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,291
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

602
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,001
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

603
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,129
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

604
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:54,174
...that appearances can be deceiving.

605
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:58,178
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

606
00:52:58,387 --> 00:53:01,515
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

607
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:03,767
Don't do it.

608
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:08,188
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

609
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:12,568
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.

610
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:16,822
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

611
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,493
- He can't.
- Do it.

612
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:32,546
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

613
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:40,846
Let her go.

614
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:55,611
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

615
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:59,907
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

616
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:05,204
I do. I think of nothing else.

617
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:12,419
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?

618
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:17,090
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

619
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:25,098
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

620
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:27,643
Disgusting.

621
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:35,067
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

622
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:43,742
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

623
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:49,748
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

624
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,875
Look past the flesh.

625
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:58,882
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

626
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:02,636
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

627
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:05,681
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.

628
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:08,767
There is nowhere I won't find you.

629
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:13,397
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

630
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:16,608
Inevitable.

631
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,944
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

632
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:22,281
This is it. It's gotta be.

633
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:08,994
Oh, no.

634
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:31,058
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

635
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:37,773
Blind messiah.

636
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:45,364
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

637
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:50,369
Helpless.

638
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:54,915
Pathetic.

639
00:56:56,375 --> 00:57:02,047
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

640
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:08,846
I can see you.

641
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:19,022
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

642
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:22,609
It's not over.

643
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:39,501
- Trinity!
- Neo.

644
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:42,504
Neo.

645
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:47,176
Oh, no. Your eyes.

646
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:50,637
I'll be okay.

647
00:57:50,846 --> 00:57:54,516
It's all right, Trin.

648
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:59,146
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

649
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:07,321
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.

650
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:11,200
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

651
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:16,038
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

652
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:19,166
Yes, sir.

653
00:58:47,653 --> 00:58:51,823
Come on, move.

654
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,064
All right!

655
00:59:24,273 --> 00:59:26,066
This is it.

656
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:31,905
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

657
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:35,909
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

658
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:41,582
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

659
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:44,668
...we give them hell before we do!

660
00:59:44,877 --> 00:59:48,255
Yeah!

661
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:05,314
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

662
01:00:05,522 --> 01:00:07,566
But I'll make you a deal.

663
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:12,237
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

664
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:16,366
Deal.

665
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:27,628
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.

666
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:30,756
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.

667
01:00:30,964 --> 01:00:35,636
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

668
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:41,058
- Give me full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.

669
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:54,404
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.

670
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:59,618
If we can just get close enough...

671
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:04,831
Six hundred meters.

672
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,210
There.

673
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:17,344
Shit!

674
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,639
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.

675
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:23,600
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

676
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:28,939
Ghost, you're the best gunner,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

677
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:48,792
I'm coming, baby.

678
01:01:56,175 --> 01:01:59,595
Here they come.

679
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:07,978
{y:i}- Slow down, this ain't the "Logos".
- Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.

680
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:19,823
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

681
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:13,168
Breach! The dock is breached!

682
01:03:32,688 --> 01:03:36,191
Knuckle up!

683
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:51,123
For Zion!

684
01:05:57,791 --> 01:06:00,961
Shit.

685
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:07,885
Come on, let's go.

686
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:15,058
Knuckle up!

687
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:31,533
Reload!

688
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:35,204
Reload nine!

689
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:43,170
Go, go! Move, move!

690
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:56,642
Watch your left!

691
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:00,521
Don't let them through!

692
01:07:02,022 --> 01:07:05,025
Zuka!

693
01:07:40,561 --> 01:07:43,814
Oh, my God.

694
01:07:56,034 --> 01:08:01,081
Where the hell's my infantry?
I want that goddamn machine taken down!

695
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:36,241
Dig this!

696
01:08:39,077 --> 01:08:41,747
Oh, shit!

697
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:04,811
- Bogey two at the breach point!
- Goddamn it!

698
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:33,006
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

699
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:45,769
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

700
01:10:16,216 --> 01:10:20,345
- You see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!

701
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:29,438
Damn it!

702
01:10:52,836 --> 01:10:55,756
Yeah.

703
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:09,353
Grab my belt.

704
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,240
Just give me one clean shot.

705
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:29,206
Damn it!

706
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:53,605
Charra!

707
01:11:57,109 --> 01:11:59,695
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!

708
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:02,823
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?

709
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:04,741
I think it's one of ours, sir.

710
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:07,870
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.

711
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:09,788
Contact them.
I want access codes.

712
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:13,667
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

713
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:16,545
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

714
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:22,009
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

715
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:35,522
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.

716
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:41,612
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

717
01:12:43,071 --> 01:12:47,492
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!

718
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:08,972
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the "Hammer", sir.

719
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:10,474
How can that be?

720
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:12,643
It's under attack, sustaining damage.

721
01:13:12,851 --> 01:13:15,604
At its present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.

722
01:13:15,812 --> 01:13:18,857
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

723
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:22,444
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

724
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:25,239
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

725
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:28,825
Sir, we already lost the dock.

726
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,331
Open the gate.

727
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:38,877
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

728
01:13:39,086 --> 01:13:42,756
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

729
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:52,432
There's the exit.

730
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:56,311
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

731
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,480
Full power...

732
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:01,358
...ninety degrees.

733
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:08,949
Now!

734
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:18,458
Hold on, baby.

735
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:23,463
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

736
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:27,134
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

737
01:14:28,343 --> 01:14:31,263
Sentinels are inside the dock.

738
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:34,016
Are we too late?

739
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:04,755
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

740
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:08,425
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

741
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:36,703
Reload!

742
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:39,623
He's pissing metal.

743
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:44,628
Go!

744
01:15:57,683 --> 01:16:00,477
Go!

745
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:24,126
Heads up! They're coming around!

746
01:16:35,637 --> 01:16:38,682
Behind you!

747
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:54,114
It's jammed!

748
01:16:58,327 --> 01:17:01,955
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

749
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:05,250
Got it!

750
01:17:32,361 --> 01:17:35,656
Captain Mifune.

751
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:39,618
Oh, no.

752
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:42,538
They're coming.

753
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:46,208
They're coming.

754
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:48,001
The "Hammer".

755
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:49,795
What?

756
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:53,340
You have to open that gate.

757
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:56,677
Cut the counterweights.

758
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:59,388
You can do it.

759
01:17:59,596 --> 01:18:03,183
Hurry. There's no time.

760
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:05,018
Captain...

761
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:09,022
...I didn't finish the training program.

762
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:14,027
Neither did I.

763
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:37,301
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!

764
01:18:37,509 --> 01:18:40,596
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

765
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:45,350
Come on, someone, please.

766
01:18:58,697 --> 01:19:01,909
Keep the weight forward.

767
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:05,704
Light as a feather.

768
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:14,087
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's APU
is up and moving to Gate Three.

769
01:19:18,675 --> 01:19:22,179
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

770
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,440
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

771
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:36,944
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

772
01:19:37,152 --> 01:19:40,906
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

773
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:42,533
Mifune...

774
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:44,368
...this is Lock.

775
01:19:44,576 --> 01:19:47,412
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

776
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:50,332
{y:i}... the "Hammer"'s two minutes away.

777
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:56,213
{y:i}You've got two minutes, captain,
{y:i}to get that gate open.

778
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:58,090
Link.

779
01:19:58,298 --> 01:20:02,010
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

780
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:40,299
Do it, kid.

781
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:47,264
Neo. I believe.

782
01:20:54,855 --> 01:20:58,025
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

783
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:01,695
We ain't come this far.

784
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:16,168
Almost home, almost home.

785
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:36,772
Burn it, Link!

786
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,923
- You did it.
- No.

787
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:05,634
We did it.

788
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:08,637
You're a hell of a pilot.

789
01:22:09,888 --> 01:22:13,267
Some things in this world never change.

790
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:16,353
But some things do?

791
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:18,146
Luckily...

792
01:22:18,355 --> 01:22:21,692
...some things do.

793
01:22:31,994 --> 01:22:33,704
Link!

794
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:36,999
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!

795
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:45,883
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

796
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:49,553
I made a promise.

797
01:22:56,852 --> 01:22:59,730
You did wear it.

798
01:23:00,105 --> 01:23:04,985
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

799
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:15,245
Three captains, one ship.

800
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:19,416
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

801
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,210
Good to see you too, Jason.

802
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:23,712
The Council's waiting to hear
an explanation.

803
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:28,592
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

804
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,345
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

805
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:33,388
That's the problem with you people.

806
01:23:33,597 --> 01:23:36,266
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

807
01:23:36,475 --> 01:23:40,020
That EMP knocked out almost every piece
of hardware and every APU.

808
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:43,273
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

809
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:48,570
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

810
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:56,328
Come on, get it cut.

811
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:59,248
The bridge is clear.

812
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:03,710
Do you hear that?

813
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:06,088
Get that cable run!

814
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:11,218
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.

815
01:24:11,426 --> 01:24:13,762
Order everyone to fall back.

816
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:17,224
Seal the shaft. Now.

817
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:20,561
Move it!

818
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:25,524
Oh, my God.

819
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:34,408
- All clear.
- Do it.

820
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:38,287
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!

821
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:55,637
Your move.

822
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:57,848
So you gave them your ship?

823
01:24:58,056 --> 01:25:03,562
- That is correct, councillor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?

824
01:25:03,812 --> 01:25:06,440
The Oracle said nothing of this?

825
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:11,320
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

826
01:25:11,528 --> 01:25:15,949
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

827
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:19,328
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

828
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:23,832
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

829
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:28,253
No, he wasn't.

830
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:32,549
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

831
01:25:32,758 --> 01:25:35,969
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

832
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:38,764
...if he'll reach the machine city.

833
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:43,352
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

834
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:49,733
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

835
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:52,819
...he will not give up.

836
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:56,031
And neither can we.

837
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:03,830
Temperature's dropping.

838
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:08,669
Here we go.

839
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:49,710
We're over the fields, aren't we?

840
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:51,795
How do you know that?

841
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:55,382
I can feel them.

842
01:27:02,598 --> 01:27:04,850
Over there.

843
01:27:05,058 --> 01:27:08,937
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

844
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:11,231
Power lines.

845
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,651
Follow them.

846
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:31,960
What are they doing?

847
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:34,588
I don't know.

848
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:37,216
Lieutenant?

849
01:27:51,813 --> 01:27:53,398
Goddamn it.

850
01:27:53,607 --> 01:27:56,276
What do we do now?

851
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:02,115
It is now a matter of time.

852
01:28:02,324 --> 01:28:05,953
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

853
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:11,124
I recommend that the Council join the other
non-military personnel inside the temple.

854
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:12,918
How long do we have?

855
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:17,297
Two hours. Maybe less.

856
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:23,262
My men have fortified the entrance
with enough artillery to make our last stand.

857
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,515
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

858
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:31,645
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

859
01:28:31,895 --> 01:28:35,315
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

860
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:37,526
I would ask him.

861
01:28:37,734 --> 01:28:42,865
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.

862
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:51,915
There. Those mountains.

863
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:54,626
That's it.

864
01:28:57,337 --> 01:28:59,506
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

865
01:28:59,715 --> 01:29:02,342
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

866
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:05,637
We'll make it.

867
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:10,350
We have to.

868
01:30:22,256 --> 01:30:25,384
Sentinels.

869
01:30:35,435 --> 01:30:38,188
There's too many!

870
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:55,247
Gotcha!

871
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:57,624
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.

872
01:30:57,833 --> 01:31:00,252
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

873
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:04,882
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.

874
01:31:05,424 --> 01:31:08,594
Then up we go.

875
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:45,756
Beautiful.

876
01:32:06,151 --> 01:32:10,197
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

877
01:32:16,203 --> 01:32:20,123
Again. Slowly.

878
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:24,586
Now!

879
01:32:48,652 --> 01:32:51,655
Trin?

880
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,908
Trinity?

881
01:32:55,117 --> 01:32:57,703
Trinity?

882
01:32:57,911 --> 01:32:59,997
- I'm here.
- Where?

883
01:33:00,205 --> 01:33:02,875
Here.

884
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:14,595
We made it.

885
01:33:14,845 --> 01:33:18,223
You said we would.

886
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:22,269
It's unbelievable, Trin.

887
01:33:22,477 --> 01:33:24,271
Light everywhere.

888
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:27,816
Like the whole thing was built of light.

889
01:33:28,025 --> 01:33:31,653
I wish you could see what I see.

890
01:33:31,862 --> 01:33:35,282
You've already shown me so much.

891
01:33:36,116 --> 01:33:40,621
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

892
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:44,750
I can't go with you, Neo.

893
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,960
I've gone as far as I can.

894
01:33:47,169 --> 01:33:49,880
What?

895
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:53,550
Oh, no.

896
01:33:53,759 --> 01:33:56,011
Oh, no. No, no.

897
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,306
It's all right.

898
01:33:59,306 --> 01:34:02,267
It's time.

899
01:34:02,434 --> 01:34:05,938
I've done all that I could do.

900
01:34:06,146 --> 01:34:09,066
Now you have to do the rest.

901
01:34:09,274 --> 01:34:11,485
You have to finish it.

902
01:34:11,693 --> 01:34:14,154
You have to save Zion.

903
01:34:14,363 --> 01:34:16,281
I can't.

904
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:20,160
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

905
01:34:20,369 --> 01:34:22,913
You will.

906
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:27,709
I believe it. I always have.

907
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:31,797
Trinity.

908
01:34:32,631 --> 01:34:37,511
Trinity, you can't die.

909
01:34:38,136 --> 01:34:40,305
You can't.

910
01:34:40,514 --> 01:34:42,057
You can't.

911
01:34:42,266 --> 01:34:45,853
Yes, I can.

912
01:34:47,563 --> 01:34:51,483
You brought me back once.

913
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:55,779
But not this time.

914
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:03,537
Do you remember...

915
01:35:03,871 --> 01:35:08,250
...on that roof, after you caught me...

916
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:11,628
...the last thing I said to you?

917
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:15,549
You said, "I'm sorry".

918
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:19,344
I wish I hadn't.

919
01:35:20,929 --> 01:35:24,683
That was my last thought.

920
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:29,188
I wished I had one more chance...

921
01:35:29,396 --> 01:35:33,066
...to say what really mattered.

922
01:35:34,234 --> 01:35:38,488
To say how much I loved you.

923
01:35:39,448 --> 01:35:44,286
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.

924
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:52,044
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

925
01:35:56,632 --> 01:36:00,594
But you brought me back.

926
01:36:02,012 --> 01:36:05,724
You gave me my wish.

927
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:13,065
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

928
01:36:16,318 --> 01:36:19,655
Kiss me.

929
01:36:21,156 --> 01:36:24,409
Once more...

930
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:27,496
...kiss me.

931
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:57,985
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
You got one chance to get this right.

932
01:36:58,193 --> 01:37:01,446
Get that damn thing mounted!

933
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:08,996
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

934
01:37:22,467 --> 01:37:23,927
Neo...

935
01:37:24,136 --> 01:37:28,015
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

936
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:37,394
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

937
01:39:37,603 --> 01:39:42,900
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

938
01:39:45,694 --> 01:39:47,446
Speak.

939
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:50,574
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

940
01:39:50,782 --> 01:39:54,161
He will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

941
01:39:54,369 --> 01:39:57,122
You cannot stop him.

942
01:39:57,831 --> 01:40:00,959
- But I can.
- We don't need you!

943
01:40:01,168 --> 01:40:04,338
We need nothing!

944
01:40:04,546 --> 01:40:09,968
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

945
01:40:13,555 --> 01:40:16,683
What do you want?

946
01:40:16,892 --> 01:40:19,603
Peace.

947
01:40:43,961 --> 01:40:47,381
What are they doing?

948
01:40:51,468 --> 01:40:54,930
What are you doing?

949
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:00,060
Morpheus!

950
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:26,378
And if you fail?

951
01:41:27,129 --> 01:41:30,591
I won't.

952
01:41:50,652 --> 01:41:52,154
Neo.

953
01:41:52,362 --> 01:41:55,532
He fights for us.

954
01:42:35,739 --> 01:42:38,617
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

955
01:42:38,825 --> 01:42:42,412
We missed you.

956
01:42:45,082 --> 01:42:48,377
You like what I've done with the place?

957
01:42:48,585 --> 01:42:51,046
It ends tonight.

958
01:42:51,255 --> 01:42:54,216
I know it does. I've seen it.

959
01:42:54,424 --> 01:42:58,178
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

960
01:42:58,387 --> 01:43:03,392
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

961
01:44:54,294 --> 01:44:57,172
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

962
01:44:57,381 --> 01:44:59,716
...closing in on you?

963
01:44:59,925 --> 01:45:03,220
Oh, I can.

964
01:45:03,428 --> 01:45:07,516
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

965
01:45:07,724 --> 01:45:11,562
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

966
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:16,733
The purpose of life is to end.

967
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:53,033
Why, Mr. Anderson?

968
01:48:53,242 --> 01:48:57,162
Why, why, why?

969
01:48:57,371 --> 01:48:59,164
Why do you do it?

970
01:48:59,373 --> 01:49:01,250
Why? Why get up?

971
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:04,711
Why keep fighting?

972
01:49:04,795 --> 01:49:07,256
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

973
01:49:07,464 --> 01:49:10,092
For more than your survival?

974
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:15,055
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

975
01:49:17,057 --> 01:49:18,809
Is it freedom or truth?

976
01:49:19,017 --> 01:49:21,311
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

977
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:25,148
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

978
01:49:25,357 --> 01:49:28,402
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

979
01:49:28,610 --> 01:49:33,407
...trying desperately to justify an existence
that is without meaning or purpose!

980
01:49:33,615 --> 01:49:37,035
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

981
01:49:37,244 --> 01:49:44,835
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

982
01:49:45,878 --> 01:49:49,298
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.
You must know it by now.

983
01:49:49,506 --> 01:49:54,178
You can't win.
It's pointless to keep fighting.

984
01:49:55,470 --> 01:50:00,225
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

985
01:50:01,977 --> 01:50:05,731
Because I choose to.

986
01:51:09,211 --> 01:51:13,715
This is my world! My world!

987
01:51:36,947 --> 01:51:38,657
Wait.

988
01:51:38,866 --> 01:51:42,035
I've seen this.

989
01:51:42,244 --> 01:51:45,998
This is it. This is the end.

990
01:51:46,248 --> 01:51:50,085
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

991
01:51:50,294 --> 01:51:52,588
And I...

992
01:51:52,796 --> 01:51:58,594
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

993
01:51:58,802 --> 01:52:00,387
I say:

994
01:52:00,596 --> 01:52:05,559
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."

995
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:18,071
What? What did I just say?

996
01:52:21,950 --> 01:52:27,289
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

997
01:52:33,295 --> 01:52:34,922
Get away from me!

998
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:37,257
What are you afraid of?

999
01:52:37,466 --> 01:52:39,092
It's a trick.

1000
01:52:39,301 --> 01:52:42,262
You were right, Smith.

1001
01:52:42,471 --> 01:52:45,849
You were always right.

1002
01:52:47,684 --> 01:52:50,812
It was inevitable.

1003
01:53:21,134 --> 01:53:24,137
Is it over?

1004
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:56,128
Oh, no, no, no.

1005
01:53:56,336 --> 01:53:59,256
No, it's not fair.

1006
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:55,938
It is done.

1007
01:55:26,385 --> 01:55:30,138
It doesn't make sense.

1008
01:55:32,641 --> 01:55:34,893
He did it.

1009
01:55:35,102 --> 01:55:37,396
He saved us.

1010
01:55:37,604 --> 01:55:40,148
He saved us.

1011
01:55:40,357 --> 01:55:43,610
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1012
01:55:43,819 --> 01:55:45,112
He did it! It's over!

1013
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:47,781
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1014
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:51,493
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1015
01:55:51,702 --> 01:55:53,120
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

1016
01:55:53,328 --> 01:55:55,247
The machines, they're gone.

1017
01:55:55,455 --> 01:56:00,252
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

1018
01:56:00,335 --> 01:56:03,714
Zion! Zion!

1019
01:56:03,922 --> 01:56:05,799
Zion, it's over!

1020
01:56:06,008 --> 01:56:07,467
It's over!

1021
01:56:07,676 --> 01:56:10,304
The war is over!

1022
01:56:10,512 --> 01:56:14,766
The war is over!

1023
01:56:34,703 --> 01:56:37,956
I have imagined this moment...

1024
01:56:38,165 --> 01:56:41,919
...for so long.

1025
01:56:44,338 --> 01:56:47,591
Is this real?

1026
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:58,519
Neo, wherever you are...

1027
01:56:58,727 --> 01:57:02,189
...thank you.

1028
01:57:44,773 --> 01:57:47,401
Good morning.

1029
01:58:07,171 --> 01:58:11,300
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1030
01:58:11,508 --> 01:58:13,635
You played a very dangerous game.

1031
01:58:13,844 --> 01:58:16,513
Change always is.

1032
01:58:16,722 --> 01:58:21,185
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1033
01:58:21,393 --> 01:58:25,063
As long as it can.

1034
01:58:26,899 --> 01:58:30,360
What about the others?

1035
01:58:30,569 --> 01:58:31,945
What others?

1036
01:58:32,154 --> 01:58:34,364
The ones that want out.

1037
01:58:34,573 --> 01:58:37,034
Obviously, they will be freed.

1038
01:58:37,242 --> 01:58:38,869
I have your word?

1039
01:58:39,077 --> 01:58:44,291
What do you think I am? Human?

1040
01:58:56,845 --> 01:58:59,932
Oracle!

1041
01:59:05,229 --> 01:59:07,356
We were afraid we might not find you.

1042
01:59:07,564 --> 01:59:10,526
Everything's okay now.

1043
01:59:10,734 --> 01:59:12,861
Look, look.

1044
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:15,948
Just look at that.

1045
01:59:16,156 --> 01:59:19,535
Beautiful.

1046
01:59:19,743 --> 01:59:22,329
Did you do that?

1047
01:59:22,538 --> 01:59:24,831
For Neo.

1048
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:27,000
That's nice.

1049
01:59:27,209 --> 01:59:29,336
I know he'd love it.

1050
01:59:29,545 --> 01:59:31,922
Will we ever see him again?

1051
01:59:32,130 --> 01:59:34,842
I suspect so.

1052
01:59:35,050 --> 01:59:38,220
Someday.

1053
01:59:41,557 --> 01:59:43,308
Did you always know?

1054
01:59:43,517 --> 01:59:47,104
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1055
01:59:47,312 --> 01:59:50,607
But I believed.

1056
01:59:50,816 --> 01:59:54,695
I believed.
