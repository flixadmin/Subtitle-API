1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,220
Nikolai. William's brother.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,800
She's not my girlfriend
and she's leaving now.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,320
I need some space!

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,440
I can't think properly
when I'm with you.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,980
If nothing feels more important
to you than being with William..

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,040
You have to try to make it work.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,740
Hi. Noora, wasn't it?

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,000
Some girls believe he's good deep down.
They believe he's going to be better for them.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,920
You're standing here, while he's out there 
somewhere sleeping with someone else.

10
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:15,340
<i>[Fuck I lost my phone between the bus seats yesterday, and 
only found it today. I'm in Lillehammer but it's shit and I miss 
you so much. Can we please be done with the space stuff soon?]</i>

11
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,440
<i>[Love you.]</i>

12
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,300
[Alcohol poisoning]

13
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,700
[Drugged?]

14
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,960
[Rape and sexual assault]

15
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:45,040
<i>[Hi. What happened on Friday?
I don't remember anything.]</i>

16
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:02,420
<i>[Hi. What happened on Friday?
I blacked out.]</i>

17
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,180
What's up? Have you locked your door?
-What is it?

18
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,480
William's outside.

19
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,000
Say that I'm not home.
-That'd be weird since I already said you're home.

20
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,620
Say that I'm sleeping or something.
Or that I'm sick.

21
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,940
He's really insistent. Can't you
just go out and talk to him?

22
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,780
Can't you just find an excuse, Eskild?

23
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

24
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,660
Are you ok, or?
-Eskild! I..

25
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,760
I just want to be alone, okay?

26
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,160
Is that impossible for you to understand?

27
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,540
Okay, that's fine.

28
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,380
Noora. Noora!
Two seconds.

29
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,980
I have a friend who's a journalist at Aftenposten.
They want an article from a young voice.

30
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,660
I showed him the article
you wrote last week.

31
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,820
He liked it a lot. I suggested
you could write the article.

32
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,100
Isn't that cool?

33
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,520
Yeah.. I'm just not sure I can.
If I have time now.

34
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,480
There's a week left. Don't you want
to become a journalist? You have to do this.

35
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,300
Yeah, okay. I can try.
-Cool. I'll e-mail you then.

36
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,260
You tried to call me on Friday?


37
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,220
Wrong number.

38
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,900
Six times?

39
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140
What's going on?

40
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,420
What's going on is that..

41
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,780
I said I want some space!
I asked for it, you have to give me space.

42
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,880
Whose locker is this?

43
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,900
Sana's.

44
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,820
What does it mean?

45
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,520
Whore.

46
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,460
Fucking hijab police.

47
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,480
They want war,
they'll get war.

48
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,960
Hello sunshine. What's up?
-I'll just have some food.

49
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,960
Should we go see Paradise afterwards?

50
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,520
Was it you who took my fishcakes?

51
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,160
Were those your fishcakes?

52
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,220
For fuck's sake, Eskild.

53
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,440
I can buy new ones in the morning.
I get my salary tomorrow.

54
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,560
I don't need fishcakes tomorrow,
I need fishcakes now!

55
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,460
I would've eaten two
fishcakes at five!

56
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,620
Now I don't have
anything to eat.

57
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,180
I can make something else
 that's nice for you..

58
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,820
You can't make something else!

59
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,480
You can't even cook, Eskild!

60
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,560
The only thing you can do.. You can't shit
other than benefiting from people!

61
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,820
She's kind of right.

62
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,640
What the fuck, Linn?
Are you serious?

63
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,280
Oh my god.

64
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,120
How did the talk
with William go?

65
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,700
I dropped it. I don't think
we fit really well together.

66
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,220
What happened?

67
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,220
We logged into my brother's computer, copied all
the kinky messages with Jamilah, and posted it on his wall.

68
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,960
Are you joking?

69
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,220
What did she say?
-She hasn't said anything.

70
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,380
Did you bring me lunch today?

71
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,800
No, I forgot.

72
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,880
Want to borrow some
money to buy something?

73
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,880
No, no. I'm fine.

74
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,500
Hey, Sana?
-What?

75
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,220
I think we really got ourselves into shit now.

76
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,440
What is it?

77
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,960
Allah9753 commented on a Riot picture:
"Good click yesterday, guys."

78
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,100
What does that mean?

79
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,700
It means the hijab
police is not behind the hate account.

80
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,680
I'm sure it's one
of the Riot guys.

81
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,320
Fuck, it's the asshole
from the bus party.

82
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,700
Eh, Sana?

83
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,320
Oh no.
-They're coming this way.

84
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,560
What do we do?
-Honestly, run!

85
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,140
Huh?
-Run!

86
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:52,700
<i>[Hi Noora. Didn't see your message til now. Nice to hear from you.
Don't worry. Absolutely nothing happened. Just a party. Nikko.]</i>

87
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,940
William, we have to go.

88
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,880
William! We have to pick
up the bus in 30 minutes.

89
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,740
What's going on?

90
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,720
We have to talk.

91
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,080
I have to talk.

92
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,160
I know I shouldn't have smashed that
bottle on the Yakuza guy's head.

93
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,900
But there isn't anything
we can do about that now, okay?

94
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,260
He has terrorised half of Oslo
and beat up innocent people.

95
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,120
Including my best friend.

96
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,960
I'm just really angry and
frustrated that they were beaten up.

97
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,180
It was me who Yakuza was really after.
It's me they were going to take.

98
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,540
Chris and the guys are the
only one who have been there for me.

99
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,600
Because I don't even
really have any family.

100
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,220
You don't?

101
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,720
Dad's a workaholic and mom's going
around taking valium with wine.

102
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,380
My brother is a complete psychopath.

103
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,980
Psychopath?

104
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,220
He's just really manipulative.

105
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,700
That's why I was such an
asshole that morning. In the kitchen.

106
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,000
Had he found out
that I have feelings for you..

107
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,160
He would have 
tried to fuck it up.

108
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,380
That's just how he is.

109
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,320
He doesn't tolerate that
others have something he doesn't.

110
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,100
I've taken a lot of shit from Nico.

111
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,960
That's because he's the only brother I have.
He's pretty much the only family I have.

112
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,540
But if he had tried to
fuck it up between the two of us..

113
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,960
.. I would've killed him.

114
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,940
I would've killed him.

115
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,580
I have to be together with you.

116
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,540
Say that we should be together.

117
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,320
Don't be so sad.

118
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,860
Fucking hell William,
we have to go.

119
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,860
I love you.

120
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:19,160
<i>[No way! Fucked up! Just found this picture on my phone,
and then remembered EVERYTHING! You were so horny.
Haha! Behaved yourself like a little whore.]</i>
