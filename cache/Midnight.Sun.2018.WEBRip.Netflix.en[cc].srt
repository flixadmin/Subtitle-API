1
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,719
(woman's voice): I have

2
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,719
this reoccurring dream.

3
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,972
I'm a little girl

4
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,972
sitting with my mom

5
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,599
and she's singing to me.

6
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,144
I feel the warmth of

7
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,144
the sun on my skin...

8
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,271
and the comfort of

9
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,271
her arms around me.

10
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,650
And I wanna stay there.

11
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,736
Forever.

12
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,073
When I wake up, I

13
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,073
miss the dream.

14
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,617
I want so badly for

15
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,617
this dream to be real,

16
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,203
but that would be impossible,

17
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,540
because my mom died

18
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,540
when I was really little.

19
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,417
And I can't go out in the sun.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,084
Like, at all.

21
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,214
I have a rare genetic condition

22
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,214
called Xeroderma Pigmentosum,

23
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,508
or XP,

24
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,094
which basically means a severe

25
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,094
sensitivity to sunlight.

26
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,433
If the sun hits my skin,

27
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,433
I get skin cancer, my

28
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,433
brain starts to fail

29
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,018
and I could die.

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,644
Pretty fun, right?

31
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:46,857
So, I spend all my time indoors

32
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:46,857
behind special windows,

33
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,025
hanging out with my dad

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,861
who is the best dad ever.

35
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,696
Thank goodness,

36
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,696
because growing up,

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,656
kids were, uh...

38
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,866
what you'd expect.

39
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,868
- No way.

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,868
- Yep, a vampire.

41
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,912
That's why they have

42
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,912
special windows.

43
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,081
Don't worry.

44
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,081
She can't get us during the day.

45
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,292
But at night, stay

46
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,292
far, far away.

47
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,378
- But not everyone

48
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,378
was afraid of me.

49
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,716
- Hey, Morgan.

50
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,716
- What's wrong with her?

51
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,597
- She has something called XP.

52
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,058
Basically, the

53
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,058
light from the sun,

54
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,018
it hurts her.

55
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,771
So she can't ever go in the sun.

56
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,232
- I can't be in the sun

57
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,232
for too long either.

58
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,192
Can she play at night?

59
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,612
- Yeah, but--

60
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,612
- See you tonight!

61
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,364
Oh! And I like pizza!

62
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:41,036
- From that point on,

63
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:41,036
it was me, Morgan and my dad.

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,830
Until one day...

65
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,708
I saw Charlie

66
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,708
and that was it.

67
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,711
I was completely,

68
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,711
totally, utterly hooked.

69
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,131
Stupid tree.

70
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,172
I saw him every day.

71
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,508
And yet...

72
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,928
he had no idea

73
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,928
I even existed.

74
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,928
(soft music)

75
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:02,975
Over time, watching Charlie

76
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:02,975
go by just became a part

77
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:02,975
of my routine.

78
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,227
Along with constant

79
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,227
doctor appointments...

80
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,773
sleeping during the day

81
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,773
and staying up all night,

82
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:14,235
which, from what I've heard,

83
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:14,235
is the schedule of

84
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:14,235
most teenagers...

85
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,781
and playing music

86
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,781
every chance I get.

87
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,576
All things considered,

88
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,576
I've got a pretty great life.

89
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,203
But I still hold

90
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,203
onto my dreams.

91
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,331
Stupid tree.

92
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,542
No matter how impossible

93
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,542
they may seem.

94
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,002

(cheering)

111
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,157
Kendall Porter.

112
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,157
- Congratulations.

113
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,283
- Peter Rathbard.

114
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,578
Charles Reed.

115
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,538
- Yeah, Charlie!

116
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,538
(cheering)

117
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,415
- Congratulations, Charlie.

118
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,459
- Katie Price!

119
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,923
- What are you wearing?

120
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,466
- Oh, cap and gown. Huh?

121
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,635
The faculty and staff

122
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,635
always wear one.

123
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,804
Here you go.

124
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,804
- Thank you.

125
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,640
(laughing)

126
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,640
- Most importantly,

127
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,640
this is for you.

128
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,976
- Hmm!

129
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,976
- Mm-hmm!

130
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,688
I assume as

131
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,688
valedictorian, you have a

132
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,688
speech prepared? Yes?

133
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,398
- Um...

134
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,150
Yes. Ahem!

135
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,861
That's me putting on my glasses.

136
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,861
- I like that. Nice touch.

137
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,154
- Thank you.

138
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,449
Um... First I would like

139
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,449
to thank my headmaster.

140
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,659
- Well, I mean, really.

141
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,659
- My Spanish teacher.

142
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,037
- De nada.

143
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,037
- My English teacher.

144
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,789
- It was my pleasure.

145
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,625
- But I really wanna state for

146
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,625
the record that my gym teacher

147
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,128
had absolutely no idea

148
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,128
what he was doing.

149
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,713
- What? Oh, you suck!

150
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,799
I lift weights.

151
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,799
Hey, this is for you.

152
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,265
- This is one of the lamest

153
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,265
things I've ever seen.

154
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,144
- Yes! Ha ha! I had to go to

155
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,144
three stores to find

156
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,144
something this lame.

157
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,272
- I mean, it's horrific.

158
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,272
- Yeah! It's the worst!

159
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,232
All right.

160
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,358
Are you ready for your present?

161
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,237
- There's a present involved?

162
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,237
- Oh, there's a present, yes!

163
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,863
Of course there's a present.

164
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,863
It's graduation.

165
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,115
- This keeps getting

166
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,115
better and better.

167
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,418
This is Mom's.

168
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,722
- Look, I know it's

169
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,722
kind of old...

170
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,100
so if you want a newer one,

171
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,100
I totally understand.

172
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,477
- No! I love it. Thank you!

173
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,477
Thank you so much.

174
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,862
- You look just

175
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,862
like your mother.

176
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,823
Lucky you. She was hot.

177
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,658
- Ew...

178
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,160
- Try and get some sleep.

179
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,619
All right?

180
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,803
(honking, shouting)

181
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,064
(girl): I can't

182
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,064
believe we graduated!

183
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,910
- Oh!

184
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,579
That's a good one.

185
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,248
- Ah... Something weird

186
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,248
is going on right here.

187
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,457
(laughing)

188
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,294
- Hey, Dad... um...

189
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,547
I was wondering if I could go

190
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,547
play my new beautiful present

191
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,258
at the train station tonight?

192
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,095
- It's 10:00.

193
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,764
Why can't Morgan just come over?

194
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,764
You could play here for me.

195
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,184
- Morgan's busy with her family

196
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,184
and Dad, I love playing for you.

197
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:19,231
I really do, but I also need to

198
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:19,231
get used to playing in front of

199
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:19,231
other people too.

200
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,276
Please, please, please. Fred

201
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,276
will be there. He'll watch out

202
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,276
for me.

203
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,278
And I graduated today!

204
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,989
Isn't that the American

205
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,989
tradition, to extend my curfew?

206
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,372
- Okay, I'll extend your curfew

207
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,372
one hour. Which means

208
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,372
midnight, okay?

209
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,625
Hey. And text me right when you

210
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,625
get there or I'm not just gonna

211
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,625
call Fred.

212
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,253
I'm actually gonna come down

213
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,253
there. And it will be

214
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,253
so embarrassing,

215
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,089
it will become urban legend on

216
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,089
why kids should stick to their

217
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,089
curfew!

218
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,091
- I love you.

219
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,091
(loud music)

220
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,722
(cheering)

221
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,616
- Hey, don't do that thing.

222
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,616
- What thing?

223
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,577
- That. I mean, you look all sad

224
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,577
and it makes me sad.

225
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,331
Please just chug this beer

226
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,331
and come hang out!

227
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,166
- Dude, you dodged

228
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,166
a bullet, man.

229
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,835
You were gonna be up at the ass

230
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,835
crack of dawn every morning,

231
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,463
taking tests, nowhere

232
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,463
near the beach.

233
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,632
And now, we get to do this

234
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,632
our whole lives.

235
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:32,471
- I forgot, doing this our whole

236
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:32,471
lives, it's way better than a

237
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:32,471
full ride to Berkeley.

238
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,974
- Zoe Carmichael. 3:00.

239
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,436
- Charlie.

240
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,521
You're in trouble.

241
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,521
- What did I do this time?

242
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,064
- You didn't get me a drink.

243
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,774
- I did not know

244
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,774
you were thirsty.

245
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,109
- Now you do.

246
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,863
I'm sorry.

247
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,863
- It's okay.

248
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,199
- Is that the bad one?

249
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,909
Well, now that you're

250
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,909
not swimming...

251
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,079
maybe you'll have a

252
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,079
little extra time for me.

253
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,665
- I also have some extra time

254
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,665
for you. And I'm not swimming.

255
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,668
- You were never

256
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,668
swimming, idiot.

257
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,668
- Zoe! Get over here!

258
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,003
- Hold on!

259
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,172
You're coming to my

260
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,172
graduation party, right?

261
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,548
- Yeah, I think so.

262
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,674
- Good.

263
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,010
- Yeah!

264
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,556
- Wha... what are you doing?

265
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,099
- Dodging another bullet.

266
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,893
- Come on, dude.

267
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,893
It's our graduation night.

268
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,811
- I'm not feeling it, boys.

269
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,813
I'll see you later.

270
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,775
- Thanks.

271
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,775
- You're welcome.

272
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,780
Hey! Yo, Fred.

273
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,617
- I was wondering if I was gonna

274
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,617
see you tonight.

275
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,617
- And disappoint all my fans?

276
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,994

- Whoa!

311
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,037
I didn't mean to freak you out.

312
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,163
Here.

313
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,461
- Me? I'm not freaked out. Don't

314
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,461
worry about it, I'm not a freak.

315

Where are you going?

317
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,882
- Home.

318
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,882
I gotta go home.

319
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,343
- Home? Wait, you live here?

320
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,472
You didn't go to Purdue High.

321
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,472
- No. It's a very

322
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,472
different school.

323
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,351
And, you know, I graduated

324
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,351
today and my dad's a super

325
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,351
big worrier.

326
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,644
So, I really gotta--

327
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,187
Oh, God.

328
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,775
- Um...

329
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,362
- I have to go.

330
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,362
- Wait! Wait! Whoa...

331
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,779
I'm sorry, why are you...

332
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,948
What's the rush? Wha...

333
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,868
- I have to get home to my cat.

334
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,205
- Your cat.

335
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,205
- Yeah, it died.

336
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,710
- So, you're not in

337
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,710
a rush then, right?

338
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,295
- No, no, I am.

339
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,295
I have to plan... the funeral

340
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,882
for my dead cat that... died.

341
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,967
Yeah, it's super dead.

342
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,431
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

343
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,933
I didn't even get your name!

344
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,536
(woman): You haven't noticed any

345
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,536
changes in her? Motor functions

346
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,536
still seem strong?

347
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,330
- Yeah. Yeah, no loss of

348
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,330
intellectual function.

349
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,542
No difficulty

350
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,542
swallowing or talking.

351
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,544
Ha! Believe me on that.

352
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,547
And no corneal ulcerations.

353
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:22,093
Really, there's nothing to

354
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:22,093
suggest any neurodegeneration.

355
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,596
- Any exposure to sunlight?

356
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,681
- No. Of course not.

357
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,559
- I'm gonna refill her

358
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,559
prescription for you this time.

359
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,353
But she really should be coming

360
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,353
to these appointments with you.

361
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,650
- Yeah, well, you know

362
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,650
teenagers. They get embarrassed

363
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,650
by their dads.

364
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,652
- She has XP, Jack.

365
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,946
- I know exactly what she has.

366
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,946
- It's not gonna fall into

367
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,946
remission.

368
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,616
And every year, the risk

369
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,616
becomes more serious for her.

370
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,034
So, if she's exposed to even

371
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,034
the slightest bit of sunlight--

372
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,369
- She won't be.

373
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,290
- She's reached that age we

374
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,290
talked about.

375
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,290
- She won't be.

376
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,171
Any word on the University

377
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,171
of Washington study?

378
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,799
- I submitted Katie's name

379
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,799
for their Phase Two trials,

380
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,634
if it even gets that far.

381
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,179
I wouldn't get your hopes

382
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,179
up. Research funding

383
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,179
being what it is...

384
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,641
we're talking about a disease

385
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,641
that affects only one in a

386
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,641
million people.

387
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,105
- We're in luck,

388
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,105
'cause she is one in a million.

389
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,195
- A cat funeral?

390
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,195
(sighing)

391
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,364
- Please stop

392
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,364
saying it out loud.

393
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,409
- No, I mean, I've heard that

394
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,409
dead pets can actually be

395
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,409
an aphrodisiac.

396
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,787
- Morgan! What

397
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,787
should I have said?

398
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,414
- Any other combination of words

399
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,414
in the English language.

400
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,208
- Like, hey, I'm Katie Price.

401
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,627
I've watched you outside my

402
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,627
window for the past 10 years

403
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,839
and I've been in love with

404
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,839
you, stalking you every

405
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,839
minute of the day?

406
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,423
- Don't start with that.

407
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,423
- Or, how about:

408
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,217
Hey, you may remember

409
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,217
me from kindergarten

410
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,762
when everyone called me

411
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,762
a vampire.

412
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,762
- No one remembers that!

413
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,849
- Oh, what did I do?

414
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,849
- It's bad, but we'll fix it.

415
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,560
- I feel so stupid and lame.

416
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,563
Well, at least you

417
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,563
have M&Ms. So...

418
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,566
- Thanks.

419
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,445
- Oh, you've just gotta make up

420
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,445
for it next time.

421
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,865
- There's not gonna be

422
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,865
a next time.

423
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,865
- You don't know that.

424
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,366
- I do.

425
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,244
- This is good.

426
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,244
This is what Taylor Swift does.

427
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,037
She has awkward

428
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,037
interactions with boys

429
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,373
and then she just writes

430
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,373
amazing songs about it.

431
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,834
What?

432
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,834
- Oh, no, no.

433
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,462
Oh, come on.

434
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,462
- What's happening?

435
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,674
- Did you see my notebook when

436
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,674
you came in?

437
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,674
- Your notebook notebook? No.

438
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,593
- I think I left it

439
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,593
at the train station.

440
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,053
- Oh, God!

441
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,053
- Can you please

442
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,053
go get it for me?

443
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,556
Morgan, it's so important.

444
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,556
Please!

445
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,811
- You know I would but there's

446
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,811
like a few other popping cat

447
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,811
funerals I was gonna hit today.

448
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,773
No, no! Corner! Oh!

449
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,617
Hey.

450
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,993
My friend's been

451
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,993
looking for that.

452
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,662
- You know her? Oh, wait...

453
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,707
Morgan, right?

454
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,707
We had English class together.

455
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,085
I'm Charlie.

456
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,085
- Charlie Reed, yeah. I know.

457
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,713
And it was a History class.

458
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,713
- But how do you know her?

459
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,548
Did she just move here

460
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,548
or something?

461
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,548
- Notebook first.

462
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,469
- Or you could just tell me

463
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,469
where she lives and I could drop

464
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,469
it off.

465
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,931
- I have a better idea.

466
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,931
(text alert)

467
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,103
- Hey, Dad, I need to go to

468
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,103
the train station to pick

469
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,103
up my notebook.

470
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,396
Fred has it.

471
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,982
- Okay, text me when you

472
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,982
get there and be careful.

473
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,450
Fred?

474
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,123
Holy pregnant cow!

475
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,668
Oh, my God. God!

476
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,253
Thank you.

477
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,253
(phone ringing)

478
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,256
(sighing)

479
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,301
Purdue Creamery.

480
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,301
- Morgan?

481
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,512
- Hey.

482
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,512
How's your second date?

483
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,973
- How could you do this to me?

484
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,973
My God! I'm in sweatpants.

485
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,142
My hair, it's a mess.

486
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,142
It's tied.

487
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,019
Argh! Oh, my God, I

488
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,019
look like an idiot.

489
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,563
- Oh, please. Katie, you're

490
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,563
super freaking hot. Okay?

491
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,107
I can't even see you right

492
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,107
now and I can tell you

493
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,107
look gorgeous.

494
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,776
- Hi, excuse me. Can I just get

495
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,776
a large--

496
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,487
- Can you not see I'm

497
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,487
on the phone?

498
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,824
He really likes you,

499
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,824
okay? I can tell.

500
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,618
Just try to be yourself.

501
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,618
Don't ramble too much.

502
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,119
And call me afterwards?

503
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,122
- Bye!

504
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,880
Oh, my!

505
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,506
Oh...

506
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,601
- Wow, you exist.

507
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,396
I thought I was dreaming

508
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,396
last night or something.

509
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,315
- Were you in the

510
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,315
REM stage of sleep?

511
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,402
- What...

512
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,402
- That's when most

513
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,402
dreams happen, actually.

514
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,197
Yeah! Your brain activity is

515
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,197
super high and functioning

516
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,200
and your eyes are just going

517
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,200
nuts behind your eyelids.

518
00:17:56,283 --> 00:18:00,038
It looks super weird. It's like

519
00:17:56,283 --> 00:18:00,038
a typewriter or something.

520
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,623
Anyway, uh, thank you for--

521
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,043
- Wait, I still don't

522
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,043
know your name.

523
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,168
- Oh...

524
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,046
It's Katie.

525
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,338
- Katie, I'm Charlie.

526
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,425
(laughing)

527
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,425
- Wow, that's a weird name.

528
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,887
Thank God you told me it

529
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,887
'cause I wouldn't have known

530
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,887
it otherwise.

531
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,930
Thank you.

532
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,222
- Wait.

533
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,766
- You didn't...

534
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,687
you didn't read

535
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,687
through it, did you?

536
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,313
- Just a little. I...

537
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,648
- What?

538
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,648
- What?

539
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,442
- Are you serious?

540
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,442
You read through my journal?

541
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,235
- Look, I--

542
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,235
- This could have been a diary.

543
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,071
I mean, it is, kind of.

544
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,906
- I'm... I'm really sorry.

545
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,866
You left really quick

546
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,866
the other night

547
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,077
and I really had no idea

548
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,077
who it belonged to,

549
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,663
so I just looked through it

550
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,663
quickly. But I like that you

551
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,663
still handwrite things.

552
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,331
It's cool. It's old school.

553
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,086
- Thanks.

554
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,211
For finding it.

555
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,337
- Yeah.

556
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,466
Wait!

557
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,218
What, another cat died?

558
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,218
You have to...

559
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,218
(laughing)

560
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,681
- I... I had to...

561
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,934
I'm walking home.

562
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,268
- Can I walk with you?

563
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,605
- Um, yeah.

564
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,109
- So you were home-schooled,

565
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,109
huh? Man, that must

566
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,109
have been wild.

567
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,112
- Actually, it was the

568
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,112
exact opposite of wild.

569
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,114
My dad's pretty protective.

570
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,283
- He's not, like, watching

571
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,283
us right now, is he?

572
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,578
- Oh, yeah. He has his phone

573
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,578
tapped into every camera.

574
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,038
(laughing)

575
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,916
So, um...

576
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,918
what did you think of

577
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,918
the songs you read?

578
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,838
Without my permission I may add.

579
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,049
- Uh, honestly, I don't know.

580
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,095
I mean, you can't really

581
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,095
read a song, right?

582
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,095
- True.

583
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,889
- I guess I'd have to

584
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,889
hear you sing 'em?

585
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,517
- So anyway, I'm right up here.

586
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,520
So, you don't have to walk me.

587
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,150
- You live up there? I don't

588
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,150
understand how we've never met.

589
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,111
I've probably skated by your

590
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,111
house like every day on the way

591
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,111
to practice.

592
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,321
(awkward laugh)

593
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,115
- It's a funny coincidence.

594
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,533
(laughing)

595
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,245
Thanks.

596
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,877
- Hey, you wouldn't wanna do

597
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,877
something sometime, would you?

598
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,464
- Together?

599
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,464
- Yes, us together.

600
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,384
Hanging out.

601
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,969
- Um...

602
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,471
I'm really busy

603
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,471
during the day...

604
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,099
but...

605
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,476
I could be free at night.

606
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,063
- I could be free at night.

607
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,773
- Well, you should put

608
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,773
your number in here then.

609
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,402
(chuckling)

610
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,529
- I'm old school, too.

611
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,947
- Smooth.

612
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,623
- That is so romantic.

613
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,623
It disgusts me.

614
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,626
What did he say about your XP?

615
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,587
- It didn't come up.

616
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,380
- What do you mean,

617
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,380
it didn't come up?

618
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,382
- I... I didn't bring it up.

619
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,801
I'm not gonna just

620
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,801
randomly be like,

621
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,804
Hey, dude! By the way,

622
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,804
the sunlight's gonna--

623
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,014
(blowing raspberry)

624
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,600
Like, look when you tell

625
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,600
someone you're sick,

626
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:12,813
then you start to become more

627
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:12,813
like... a disease and less like

628
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:12,813
a person.

629
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,066
I'm gonna tell him, I promise.

630
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,652
But I don't know

631
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,652
when I'm gonna see him again.

632
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,652
- I do.

633
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,989
You know that annoying guy

634
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,989
who works with me at the

635
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,989
ice cream shop?

636
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,617
- The nerdy one you hate?

637
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,617
- Yes, Garver.

638
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,620
His parents are out of town

639
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,620
tonight and he's throwing a

640
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,620
party

641
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,915
and he told me to bring friends.

642
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,915
So, I'm gonna bring you.

643
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,417
- No, no, no, no!

644
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,417
- And you're gonna

645
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,417
bring Charlie.

646
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,296
- No! He's gotta,

647
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,296
like, you know...

648
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,967
I have to wait till he

649
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,967
texts me first, right?

650
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,304
- Yeah, totally. And then, you

651
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,304
know, his squire will send a

652
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,304
note via carrier pigeon

653
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,058
asking if you'd like to merge

654
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,058
your kingdoms. What is this,

655
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,058
18th-century England?

656
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:53,187
You're a hot young badass woman.

657
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:53,187
You're gonna text him whenever

658
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:53,187
you damn well please.

659
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,649
Be confident, okay?

660
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,985
Give him the facts.

661
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,985
- Okay.

662
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:02,989
(text alert)

663
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,580
- Play a little hard to get.

664
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,580
- All right.

665
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,086
- Make sure that he knows

666
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,086
he's not the only reason

667
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,086
you're going.

668
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,504
- Okay.

669
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,798
Oh!

670
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,798
- Okay.

671
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,301
Oh, no.

672
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:34,103
- This is gonna be a tame, safe,

673
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:34,103
parent-friendly party.

674
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,106
- Aha! It's a totally lame

675
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,106
party. You know what we should

676
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,106
do.

677
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,108
We should stay here.

678
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,108
We'll get Hunan Chinese.

679
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,777
You guys love Hunan, right?

680
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,777
Put some Netflix on.

681
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,903
It'll be perfect.

682
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:47,992
- Dad. You know I'm a good kid.

683
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:47,992
You know I'm not gonna do

684
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:47,992
anything crazy.

685
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,328
But I swear, if I spend

686
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,328
one more night here,

687
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,914
just listening to everyone

688
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,914
else outside my window

689
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,914
living their lives,

690
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,625
I might go crazy.

691
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,505
Tomorrow night we can order

692
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,505
way too much chow mein

693
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,966
and have a great movie marathon.

694
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,722
- All right.

695
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,722
- Yes, thank you!

696
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,267
- You're the best dad in

697
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,267
the world.

698
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,267
- Thanks, Mr. P!

699
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,144
- Okay, um...

700
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,355
Charlie's gonna meet us

701
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,355
at Garver's at eight.

702
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,065
- We have to get ready!

703
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,068
- Dude, what are you talking

704
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,068
about? We have, like,

705
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,068
three hours!

706
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,486
- We're already behind!

707
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,573
Done.

708
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,284
Mr. P!

709
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,747
May I present Katherine

710
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,747
Price of Washington.

711
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,508
- Wow!

712
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,511
Peanut...

713
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,931
you look amazing.

714
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,724
(upbeat music)

715
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,892
- Bye, Mr. P!

716
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,359
Let's go!

717
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,620
God, I can't believe

718
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,620
Garver's throwing a kegger.

719
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,706
- You came.

720
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,876
Is there any chance that you,

721
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,876
or your hot friend... hey...

722
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,838
...know how to get

723
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,838
beer out of a keg?

724
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,799
- Oh, no.

725
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,219
You didn't get a tap?

726
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,219
- I didn't realize they were

727
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,219
separate things.

728
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,347
Why would they sell me a barrel

729
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,347
of beer I can't even access?

730
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,567
- Garver, what the hell?

731
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,446
This is a tame, safe,

732
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,446
parent-friendly party!

733
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,489
- Do tame parties

734
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,489
have sundae bars?

735
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,452
- I think it's so cool.

736
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,246
- No, don't listen to her. Okay,

737
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,246
she's never been to

738
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,246
a party before.

739
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,832
She doesn't understand

740
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,832
how dire the situation is.

741
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,041
We gotta go.

742
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,041
- What, you're leaving?

743
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,501
No, no, I just made a huge thing

744
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,501
of chili.

745
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,046
- Garver, chili is not

746
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,046
a party food.

747
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,383
(car approaching)

748
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,383
- You see, the party's

749
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,383
just kicking off.

750
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,055
What's Charlie Reed doing here?

751
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,849
- Oh, my God.

752
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,651
- Hi.

753
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,783
- You look really amazing.

754
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,036
- Um...

755
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,288
Oh, it's all Morgan.

756
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,748
- I don't think so.

757
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,000
- For you, good sir.

758
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,794
- Oh, thank you.

759
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,545
- Thank you.

760
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,797
- Beef chili, huh?

761
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,759
Um!

762
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,513
That's top shelf, buddy.

763
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,513
That's fresh.

764
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,391
- And I really thought

765
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,391
we'd have a bigger turnout.

766
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,478
- I told you not to go up

767
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,478
against a cheerleader.

768
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,478
- What cheerleader?

769
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,022
- The mean blonde one with

770
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,022
a convertible.

771
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,022
- Zoe Carmichael?

772
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,899
- Yes.

773
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,899
- Ugh!

774
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,818
- She's having a party tonight

775
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,818
as well. Must have dinged

776
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,818
our turnout.

777
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,156
- Do you guys just wanna

778
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,156
go there?

779
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,156
- Well, I like the idea.

780
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,824
(doorbell ringing)

781
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,036
- Hey.

782
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,036
- I was wondering

783
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,036
where you were.

784
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,997
Who are these people?

785
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,997
- Oh, these are my friends.

786
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,666
And they brought you a keg.

787
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,463
- Great.

788
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,756
Come on in.

789
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,343
(loud music)

790
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,188
(all): Charlie!

791
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,273
(cheering)

792
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,658
- You good?

793
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,413
- Hey, I'm gonna go

794
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,413
take a lap upstairs.

795
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,539
Away from you two?

796
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,460
Thank you.

797
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,836
- Your friend Morgan,

798
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,836
she seems cool.

799
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,131
- Yeah.

800
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,131
She's really cool.

801
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:17,177
- How long have you guys known

802
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:17,177
each other?

803
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:17,177
- I don't know. Like, forever.

804
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:21,307
- He's back.

805
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:21,307
(cheering)

806
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,603
Whoa!

807
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,603
Who is this?

808
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,689
- Owen, Wes, this

809
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,689
is Katie Price.

810
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,650
- Hi.

811
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,650
- Katie.

812
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,650
You're a...

813
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:37,823
- You got Charlie to come to

814
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:37,823
a party... and make

815
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:37,823
a smile-like feature.

816
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:42,328
Our boy hasn't looked this good

817
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:42,328
in a long time.

818
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:42,328
- There you are.

819
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,457
I'm still thirsty.

820
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,417
Wanna get me that drink now?

821
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:52,712
I'm actually about to go take

822
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:52,712
Katie on the house party tour.

823
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,340
So...

824
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,340
You ready?

825
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,258
(upbeat song)

826
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,258
We'll be right back.

827
00:27:56,342 --> 00:28:00,012
- Nice meeting you guys.

828
00:27:56,342 --> 00:28:00,012
- Nice to meet you, Katie.

829
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,598
- I can quench your thirst.

830
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,598
- Shut up.

831
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,682
(loud music)

832
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,713
- Would you like to dance

833
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,713
with me?

834
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,713
- Garver...

835
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,717
What on Earth makes you think

836
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,717
I'd ever want to dance with you?

837
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,388
(alarm, honking)

838
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,144
You know, if you tell anyone

839
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,144
about this, I'll kill you.

840
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,270
- Totally.

841
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,529
- Hey, hey!

842
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,529
- Hey!

843
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,490
- Gotta stay hydrated.

844
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,490
- Thank you.

845
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,743
This is really interesting.

846
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,162
I don't think I've ever seen...

847
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,164
this happen.

848
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,666
- Yeah.

849
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,378
Classic high school

850
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,378
awkward party.

851
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,755
(laughing)

852
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,755
- I've only

853
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,755
seen it at the movies.

854
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,174
- I gotta show you this.

855
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,174
Come on.

856
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,174
- Oh, God.

857
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,800
- Come on.

858
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,680
Okay, similar to what's

859
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,680
going on over here.

860
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,099
We just kind of hold here.

861
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,144
And swing the hips awkwardly.

862
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,814
- Am I doing it?

863
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,814
- Yeah, you're kind of.

864
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,983
And then I would slowly back up.

865
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:58,046
- Everybody! This is the

866
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:58,046
best night of my life! Yeah!

867
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,965
(cheering)

868
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,931
- You wanna go someplace else?

869
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,931
- Okay.

870
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,186
I don't get it. How could they

871
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,186
just take your scholarship away?

872
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:18,567
- Well, I had to have surgery

873
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:18,567
and they didn't think I could

874
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:18,567
ever swim again.

875
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,112
And no more scholarship

876
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,112
meant no more Berkeley.

877
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,698
- I'm really sorry.

878
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,698
- Yeah...

879
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,661
- So, how did you do it?

880
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,661
How did you hurt yourself?

881
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,621
- It was just a freak accident.

882
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,081
You know, I fell down

883
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,081
some stairs and...

884
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,834
And that's not true.

885
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,170
That's kind of what

886
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,170
I tell everybody.

887
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,298
I got really drunk one

888
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,298
night at Owen's house.

889
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:47,220
And my friends dared me to jump

890
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:47,220
off the roof into the pool...

891
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,349
and I clipped the edge

892
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,349
with my shoulder.

893
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,894
I'm such an idiot.

894
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,105
I don't wanna be

895
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,105
that guy, you know?

896
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,985
- Then don't be.

897
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,406
You know my mom used to take

898
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,406
me here when I was little?

899
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:11,286
- Really?

900
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:11,286
- She sat me right there.

901
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,541
And she tried to teach me

902
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,541
how to play the guitar.

903
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,002
Actually, this watch was hers.

904
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:24,132
I spent so much time looking

905
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:24,132
at this thing on her hand and...

906
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,136
Um...

907
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,099
She died when I was little.

908
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,099
She was in a car accident.

909
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,602
- I'm so sorry.

910
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,602
You know, we can go someplace--

911
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,938
- No! No, no!

912
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,938
No, I'm good.

913
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,899
- You sure?

914
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,899
- Yeah, yeah.

915
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,234
I promise.

916
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,363
- You wanna see something cool?

917
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,449
Ta-da.

918
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,118
- This is yours?

919
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,118
- No.

920
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,038
But it's something I'm taking

921
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,038
care of for the summer.

922
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,041
It's a Jespersen 53.

923
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,459
- Wow.

924
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:06,049
- One of these days we could

925
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:06,049
take her for a sail around

926
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:06,049
the harbor.

927
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,885
We can watch the sun set.

928
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:21,064
- That sounds perfect.

929
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,963
- Just...

930
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,215
(car rattling)

931
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,303
Sorry.

932
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,266
- So, what are you gonna do this

933
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,266
year now that you're not going

934
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,266
to Berkeley?

935
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,478
- Well, first I'm

936
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,478
gonna get a new truck.

937
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,979
(laughing)

938
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,230
And...

939
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,316
then I'm gonna drive

940
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,316
across country.

941
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,947
You know, I've been in the pool

942
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,947
my entire life and I haven't got

943
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,947
to see much else, so...

944
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,494
What are you gonna do--

945
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,494
- I'm not doing anything.

946
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:19,414
I'm just gonna take some

947
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:19,414
online courses, I think.

948
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,333
But I'll just be...

949
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,418
here.

950
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,504
- I... I meant what are

951
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,504
you doing tomorrow?

952
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,797
- Oh!

953
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,341
Oh! Oh, God.

954
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,345
I...

955
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,850
I'm busy during the day,

956
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,560
but I can be free

957
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,560
tomorrow night.

958
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,020
- It's perfect.

959
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,690
I'll see you tomorrow night?

960
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,107
- Okay.

961
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,907
I have something to tell you.

962
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,704
I don't actually have a cat.

963
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:00,789
- No shit.

964
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,718
- Who are you texting?

965
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,220
- No one.

966
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:20,141
- Morgan, who are you texting?

967
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,855
I can't hear you when

968
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,855
you're whispering.

969
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,648
- Garver! I made

970
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,648
out with Garver.

971
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,276
- No! He's really, really cute.

972
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,530
And he totally likes you.

973
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:38,076
By the way, can I tell my dad

974
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:38,076
that I'm going over

975
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:38,076
to yours tonight,

976
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,620
so I can go hang out

977
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,620
with Charlie later?

978
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,625
- You're asking me to help you

979
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,625
lie to your father so you can

980
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,625
hang out with a guy?

981
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,670
I've never been so proud of you!

982
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,051
- Uh, Dad, I'm gonna go over to

983
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,051
Morgan's tonight. Is that okay?

984
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,054
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

985
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,054
Hey, how was that party?

986
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,391
- Party was nice.

987
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,101
- Did you meet any fun people?

988
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,895
- No.

989
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,895
Not really.

990
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:08,106
Everybody was kind of just,

991
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:08,106
like, ugh... you know?

992
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,483
Nobody was really there.

993
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,483
It was just...

994
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,111
So I'm gonna...

995
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,111
(clicks tongue)

996
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,111
skedaddle.

997
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,655
Love you.

998
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,655
- Love you more.

999
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,494
- I'm lying.

1000
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,581
- Well, you were rambling,

1001
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,581
so I kind of figured.

1002
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:36,551
- I'm going to go meet a boy

1003
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:36,551
named Charlie Reed who's really

1004
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:36,551
nice and sweet,

1005
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:41,431
and I really, really

1006
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:41,431
like him. A lot.

1007
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,477
Are you mad?

1008
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,477
- Well, I'm not happy

1009
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,477
that you lied to me.

1010
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,481
You know you can always

1011
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,481
tell me anything.

1012
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,481
- I know. I'm sorry.

1013
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,984
- Do you trust this guy?

1014
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,984
- Yes.

1015
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,112
- Will I hate him?

1016
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,112
- No, no, you won't. I promise.

1017
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,073
- Does he know--

1018
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,073
- I haven't told him yet.

1019
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,284
- No, Katie, I am not

1020
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,284
comfortable with him not

1021
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,284
knowing.

1022
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:05,497
- I know, I'm going to. I just

1023
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:05,497
need a little bit longer of...

1024
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,873
- What?

1025
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:10,085
- Being someone more

1026
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:10,085
than just a disease.

1027
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,796
- Katie.

1028
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:17,300
- It's just a few more days,

1029
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:17,300
please? Like a normal girl.

1030
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:24,390
- Hey. Is it okay if me and

1031
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:24,390
Katie hang out tonight together?

1032
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:24,390
The entire night?

1033
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,936
- I already admitted everything.

1034
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,936
- What, you couldn't make

1035
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,936
it two hours?

1036
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,189
- It's pathetic.

1037
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,189
I could've made it two hours.

1038
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,405
- What does Katie Price

1039
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,405
wanna do?

1040
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,324
- There's so many things I

1041
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,324
wanna do.

1042
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,078
(pop song)

1043
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,078
- I have

1044
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,078
always wanted to do this.

1045
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,465
Ready?

1046
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,465
(laughing)

1047
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,288
- Whoo!

1048
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,181
What about that one over there?

1049
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,101
- That one's called Altair.

1050
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,271
And it's 16 light years away,

1051
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,271
which means the light we're

1052
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,271
seeing now

1053
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,523
was actually created

1054
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,523
when we were two.

1055
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,445
Are you okay?

1056
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:06,367
- The Berkeley coach called

1057
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:06,367
my house the other night.

1058
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,828
- Really?

1059
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:12,874
- Yeah, I mean, I guess one of

1060
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:12,874
the other swimmers transferred

1061
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:12,874
out and...

1062
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,627
another spot opened up.

1063
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,629
- Wow!

1064
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,381
That's so crazy.

1065
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,381
You could get your spot back?

1066
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,426
- I mean, technically, yeah.

1067
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,096
There's this huge meet

1068
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,096
coming up next month

1069
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,640
and the Berkeley coach

1070
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,640
is coming down to watch.

1071
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,726
You know, but I'd have to get in

1072
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,726
shape by then, which is probably

1073
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,726
impossible.

1074
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,313
And then I'd have to swim like

1075
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,313
my best time ever to show that

1076
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,313
I'm fully rehabbed.

1077
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,065
- You can totally do it.

1078
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,408
- But there's also some reasons

1079
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,408
to stick around here next year.

1080
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,582
Katie, I wanna take you

1081
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,582
on a real date tomorrow.

1082
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,252
- Okay.

1083
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,546
And...

1084
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,091
you also need to meet my dad.

1085
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,100
- Why don't you move a

1086
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,100
little closer there, Cody?

1087
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,685
- My name's Charlie.

1088
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,312
- Charlie.

1089
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,312
- Yeah.

1090
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,813
- I didn't know that.

1091
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:23,153
So, do you go by Charlie and

1092
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:23,153
not Chuck or Chuckie or C-Town?

1093
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,113
- No, sir, just Charlie.

1094
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,447
- Charlie, okay.

1095
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,617
You ever been arrested?

1096
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,617
- No, sir.

1097
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,203
- When's your curfew?

1098
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,203
- It's 1 a.m.

1099
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,247
- What time do you actually

1100
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,247
get home?

1101
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,247
- Like, two.

1102
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,624
- That's not one o'clock, is it,

1103
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,624
Charlie?

1104
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,624
- No, sir, it's not.

1105
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,544
- You said your curfew was one.

1106
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,544
- Yeah.

1107
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,629
- Relax, I'm not a cop.

1108
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,509
How many times a

1109
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,509
week do you shave?

1110
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,719
- Shave... uh...

1111
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,138
Like... four.

1112
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,015
Four times a week, sir.

1113
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,225
- Who's your team?

1114
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,225
- Seahawks.

1115
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,852
- Why?

1116
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,852
- Well, because they're great.

1117
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,937
And one time I was at

1118
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,937
this burger place and...

1119
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,190
Richard Sherman actually ate

1120
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,190
some of my fries.

1121
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,693
- That's awesome.

1122
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,863
Okay.

1123
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,863
Charlie...

1124
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,907
here's the deal.

1125
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,452
Katie appears to be very strong.

1126
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,163
And she is.

1127
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,163
- Hey!

1128
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,540
- She's dealing with- Hi!

1129
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,540
What you guys talking about?

1130
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,708
- Nothing.

1131
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,708
- We were...

1132
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,044
- We're just getting

1133
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,044
to know each other.

1134
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,588
- Thank you so much for letting

1135
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,588
me take her out, Mr. Price.

1136
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,716
- Okay.

1137
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,716
- Oh, don't forget your...

1138
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,886
guitar case.

1139
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,722
Wait, I'll hold it for you.

1140
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,726
- Hold on a second.

1141
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,726
I wanna get a picture of this.

1142
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,644
Okay.

1143
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,855
All right.

1144
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,857
Just a little.

1145
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,025
There you go.

1146
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,736
Little room for the Holy Ghost.

1147
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,862
And...

1148
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,656
- And open.

1149
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,162
- I believe these are for you.

1150
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,042
- Where are we going?

1151
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,042
- I know nothing.

1152
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,253
- Fred.

1153
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,253
- Don't even try it.

1154
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,422
- Thank you, Fred.

1155
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,218
Okay, rule number one.

1156
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,218
When you're on a train,

1157
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,179
you must always travel with

1158
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,179
Chinese food out of a backpack.

1159
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:17,350
- Well, I wouldn't know, I've

1160
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:17,350
never been on a train before.

1161
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,227
- Neither have I.

1162
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,227
- Really?

1163
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,270
- Really.

1164
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,898
Cheers.

1165
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,780
I still cannot believe that we

1166
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,780
grew up in the same town since

1167
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,780
we were younger

1168
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,075
and I've never seen you out

1169
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,075
riding your bike or out with

1170
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,075
a lemonade stand.

1171
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,244
And I would've bought your

1172
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,244
lemonade.

1173
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,244
- No, you wouldn't have.

1174
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:39,164
I don't like lemonade.

1175
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:39,164
- Who doesn't like lemonade?

1176
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,290
- Me.

1177
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,376
- You know I know the

1178
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,376
real story, right?

1179
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,839
You and your dad are in the

1180
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,839
Witness Protection Program.

1181
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,383
And you have both testified

1182
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,383
against a mobster.

1183
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,970
- Very close. But...

1184
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,806
the truth is...

1185
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,144
I've been sent here

1186
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,144
to monitor you.

1187
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:05,648
Right. And I've been given

1188
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:05,648
specific instructions to never

1189
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:05,648
be seen in the daylight

1190
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:10,445
and I've been watching you this

1191
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:10,445
whole entire time from the

1192
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:10,445
safety of my own room.

1193
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,032
- Classic Witness Protection

1194
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,032
Program cover story.

1195
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,244
All right, close your eyes

1196
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,244
and put your hands out.

1197
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:22,832
- Okay.

1198
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:27,628
And open.

1199
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,465
(laughing)

1200
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,758
- Try and catch 'em

1201
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,758
in your mouth.

1202
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,758
- Hey!

1203
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:36,429
- Thank you.

1204
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,016
- Oh, and look.

1205
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,016
We're here.

1206
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,196
(upbeat song)

1207
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,752
- Wait, where are you taking me?

1208
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,128
- We're here.

1209
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,964
- Charlie, what is this place?

1210
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,591
- It's your surprise.

1211
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,759
- Charlie, my man.

1212
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,262
- I thought Seattle

1213
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,262
was my surprise.

1214
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,347
- Come on.

1215
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,891
(crowd shouting)

1216
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,891
- Where are we going?

1217
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:32,860
- It's your first live show.

1218
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,070
- Yeah.

1219
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,114
(upbeat song)

1220
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,764
- Whoo!

1221
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,601
- Thank you!

1222
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,601
- Thank you!

1223
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:08,729
- That was seriously so cool.

1224
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:08,729
- I know.

1225
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:12,900
- That was, I mean, literally

1226
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:12,900
one of the best things ever.

1227
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,194
- Right?

1228
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,194
- Oh, God.

1229
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:18,531
Live music is beautiful.

1230
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,783
- You are beautiful.

1231
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,243
- You're the best.

1232
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,704
Thank you.

1233
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,373
- You're welcome.

1234
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,418
Okay.

1235
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:31,877
Your turn.

1236
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,131
- For what?

1237
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,384
Oh!

1238
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,512
No, no, no, no!

1239
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,639
I am not.

1240
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,639
- Oh, yes, yes.

1241
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,976
You owe me a song.

1242
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,976
- I can't do it...

1243
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,021
...here.

1244
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,021
- Yes, you can.

1245
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,064
Remember, live

1246
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,064
shows are the best.

1247
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,860
- Are you hungry? 'Cause I'm

1248
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,860
hungry and you're always hungry.

1249
00:44:55,943 --> 00:45:01,449
- Look, we can either have come

1250
00:44:55,943 --> 00:45:01,449
all the way to this new city...

1251
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,701
underneath the stars

1252
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,701
and you don't play me a song...

1253
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,457
or we can continue to have the

1254
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,457
greatest night of our lives.

1255
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,544
- Okay...

1256
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,549
- I'll be right here watching.

1257
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,931
Go, come on, we're waiting!

1258

said you were good

really good.

1316
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,814

something with your music.

00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,609
- No, I couldn't.

- You have to,

1320
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,609
Katie. It was amazing.

1321
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:47,156

00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:47,156

1323
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,742
- To go swimming.

1324
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,287
- No, Katie, you know

1325
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,287
I don't swim anymore.

1326
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,207
- Yes, you do. You just

1327
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,207
haven't swam in a while.

1328
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,211
And I've never swam in

1329
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,211
this water before, so...

1330
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,962
you're gonna take me.

1331
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,339
- Ha ha...

1332
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,634
- Come on!

1333
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,634
- No, I'm serious.

1334
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,634
I'm not swimming.

1335
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,345
- But you made me sing and I

1336
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,345
didn't want to.

1337
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,345
- That was totally different.

1338
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,763
- No, it's not!

1339
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:14,266
- Okay, do you have any idea

1340
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:14,266
how cold that water is?

1341
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,769
- Charlie.

1342
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,065
We could've either come

1343
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,065
all the way to the beach

1344
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,610
under the beautiful stars

1345
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,610
and not go swimming.

1346
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:27,822
Or we could jump into that water

1347
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,283
and continue to make this

1348
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,283
the best night of our lives.

1349
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:32,744
- I don't have a swimsuit.

1350
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,161
- Neither do I.

1351
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:40,835
- Katie.

1352
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,213
- You coming?

1353
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,764
Hurry up!

1354
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:56,684
Oh, my God, it's so cold.

1355
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:03,900
- Put your arms forward,

1356
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:03,900
and then push.

1357
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:09,196
- The breast stroke? It seems

1358
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:09,196
like a trick.

1359
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:09,196
(laughing)

1360
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,034
- Kinda.

1361
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:18,997
- See, this isn't so bad.

1362
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:18,997
You don't hate the water.

1363
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,336
- I don't hate anything

1364
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,336
when I'm with you.

1365
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,108
- Have you thought any more

1366
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,108
about your Berkeley spot?

1367
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,861
- No.

1368
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,452
You know, I just keep thinking

1369
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,452
about after the surgery...

1370
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:58,663
when I couldn't swim.

1371
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,711
You know, I just realized

1372
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,711
I didn't even know who I was.

1373
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:09,214
And neither did anybody else.

1374
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:15,304
All these kids that I've been

1375
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:15,304
going to school with for

1376
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:15,304
15 years,

1377
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,641
they just saw me as

1378
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,641
that guy in the pool.

1379
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,814
I don't have to live

1380
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,814
that life anymore.

1381
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,483
- You know...

1382
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,569
you're not the guy in the pool.

1383
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:32,905
But...

1384
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,826
you're not the guy that

1385
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,826
doesn't try either.

1386
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,126
Do everything you can right now

1387
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,004
and then decide.

1388
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,757
Because now is all that matters.

1389
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,138
- You're right.

1390
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,098
- Good.

1391
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:09,149
- Speaking of tomorrow morning,

1392
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:09,149
ready for the greatest sunrise

1393
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:09,149
on the planet?

1394
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,363
- What?

1395
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,826
Charlie, what time is it?

1396
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,289
- It's 4:50.

1397
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,377
- It's not waterproof.

1398
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:34,842
Oh, my God.

1399
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:34,842
- What?

1400
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,468
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1401
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,468
- Katie, wait!

1402
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:40,014
- Oh, shit! I need to go!

1403
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:40,014
- Katie, wait! Katie!

1404
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,268
(panting)

1405
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,978
Katie!

1406
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,191
Shit!

1407
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,786
Hey, get in, let me drive you!

1408
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,247
- Go, Charlie, go!

1409
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,125
- Katie! What the

1410
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,125
hell is going on?

1411
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,964
- You have to go as fast

1412
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,964
as you can!

1413
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,964
- Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

1414
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,674
Katie, what--

1415
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,674
- Please just go, Charlie!

1416
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,676
- You're scaring me.

1417
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,676
- You have to speed! Faster!

1418
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,219
- Okay, okay!

1419
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,852
Katie!

1420
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,852
Katie!

1421
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:30,898
Katie!

1422
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,817
(Katie panting)

1423
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,029
Katie!

1424
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,029
Katie!

1425
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,574
Katie!

1426
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,369
Katie, will you please

1427
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,369
just talk to me?

1428
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,084
Katie, please just talk to me!

1429
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,084
- Hey! Is she inside?

1430
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,211
- Yes.

1431
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,211
- Is she in there? Move!

1432
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,508
- How could you let this happen

1433
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,508
to her?

1434
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,508
- Let what happen? What?

1435
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,137
- Did she not tell you?

1436
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,137
- Tell me what?

1437
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,973
I have no idea what's going on!

1438
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,973
- She's sick! She's sick...

1439
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,934
- What do you mean she's sick?

1440
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,934
- She has XP.

1441
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:10,395
She can't go in the sun at all.

1442
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:10,395
It can kill her. I'm sorry.

1443
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,523
Katie?

1444
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,881
This is a nice hospital.

1445
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,884
I bet they have

1446
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,884
really good food.

1447
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,679
- Katie Price?

1448
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,306
We're ready.

1449
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,202
- It was like a second, if that.

1450
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,787
Okay? Everything's

1451
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,787
gonna be fine.

1452
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,539
We're good, Mr. P.

1453
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,667
(footsteps approaching)

1454
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,128
- Hey.

1455
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,214
Is she okay?

1456
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,608
- Okay, Katie, you can sit up.

1457
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,026
Nurse Jane will take

1458
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,026
you back outside.

1459
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,946
- Um, actually, I wanna stay.

1460
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,365
- Okay.

1461
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,284
The sunlight exposure

1462
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,284
was minimal.

1463
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,454
The physical effects you're

1464
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,454
seeing right now will heal.

1465
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:56,418
But, as you know, XP generally

1466
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:56,418
lies dormant until there's a

1467
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:56,418
triggering event.

1468
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,087
We won't know if

1469
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,087
that's what this was

1470
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,173
until we get the results back

1471
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,173
from your blood work and

1472
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,173
CT scans.

1473
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,426
- And if this was a

1474
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,426
triggering event?

1475
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,263
- We'll cross that

1476
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,263
bridge if we come to it.

1477
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,556
If you experience any symptoms,

1478
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,269
unexpected shaking, muscular

1479
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,269
pain, loss of motor function,

1480
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,062
you need to let us

1481
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,062
know immediately.

1482
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,605
- Okay.

1483
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,482
I'm gonna go get dressed now.

1484
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,486
I'm pretty busy during the day,

1485
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,656
but I could be free at night.

1486
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,656
(Katie's voice overlapping)

1487
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,158
I can be free at night.

1488
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,372
- What about UW?

1489
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,500
What about the study? Have

1490
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,500
they started the second phase?

1491
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,502
- I followed up with

1492
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,502
them last week.

1493
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,586
No news yet.

1494
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,548
- Okay.

1495
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,548
Thanks.

1496
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,644
- All right, Charlie.

1497
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,644
Let's get back to work.

1498
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,526
(text alert)

1499
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,033
(text alert)

1500
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:17,666
- Look, I know I told you to

1501
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:17,666
play hard to get, but you should

1502
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:17,666
at least see what he has to say.

1503
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,300
He's asking if he can come over

1504
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,300
and talk to you.

1505
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,425
- Don't.

1506
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,346
Please just delete them.

1507
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,638
- Katie.

1508
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:35,309
- Look, if I read them,

1509
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:35,309
then I'm gonna reply,

1510
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,102
then he's gonna reply

1511
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:39,230
and then we're gonna meet up.

1512
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,273
Which we can't.

1513
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,025
- Why can't you?

1514
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,236
You don't have to be a

1515
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,236
martyr just to

1516
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,236
protect Charlie's feelings.

1517
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,321
He's a big boy.

1518
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,321
I'm sure he can handle it.

1519
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,323
- I can't handle it.

1520
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,448
Okay?

1521
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,704
He's gonna get hurt, and I'm not

1522
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,704
gonna be the one who hurts him.

1523
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,040
So, please, can you

1524
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,040
just delete them?

1525
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,629
- Yeah.

1526
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,629
Okay.

1527
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,676
- We should do

1528
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,676
another set of tests.

1529
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:54,388
The results could

1530
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:54,388
come back different.

1531
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,514
- Her brain has

1532
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,514
begun to contract.

1533
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,183
Once the neural pathways--

1534
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:01,103
- What about the study?

1535
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:01,103
- They shut it down, Jack.

1536
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:04,106
I found out this morning.

1537
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:05,649
There's no funding.

1538
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,705
- No, I...

1539
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,917
I did everything I

1540
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,917
was supposed to do.

1541
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,924
I mean, from the time

1542
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,924
she was very young...

1543
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,927
no matter how much she...

1544
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,721
cried...

1545
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,476
or screamed or moaned...

1546
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,727
I wouldn't let her go outside.

1547
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:50,568
I wouldn't let her

1548
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:50,568
go to the park.

1549
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,072
I wouldn't even let

1550
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,072
her go to the beach.

1551
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:56,867
And she begged me.

1552
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,495
She begged me...

1553
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,167
for things that she

1554
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,167
had every right to.

1555
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,752
And I denied her all of it.

1556
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,298
And for what?

1557
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,298
Huh?

1558
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:12,424
For this?

1559
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,967
No.

1560
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:33,404
- XP is a disease that tends

1561
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:33,404
to take the joy from

1562
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:33,404
a child's life.

1563
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:38,367
In all these years I've treated

1564
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:38,367
Katie, she's never complained,

1565
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:38,367
she's never sulked.

1566
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,702
She always sees the

1567
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,702
good in things.

1568
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,374
And the way she talks about you?

1569
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:49,711
I've never seen a teenager

1570
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:49,711
so openly adore her father.

1571
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,008
You're a good father, Jack.

1572
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,138
- How long?

1573
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,308
- It's hard to say for sure.

1574
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,034
(indistinct TV)

1575
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:26,975
- Hey, kiddo.

1576
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,059
- Hey, Dad.

1577
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:30,061
- I'm starving.

1578
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,606
Wanna get some Chinese?

1579
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,606
- Hum... Yah...

1580
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:33,940
- Is that a yeah?

1581
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,817
What are you doing?

1582
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,613
- I'm starting you an

1583
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,613
online dating profile.

1584
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,739
- What?

1585
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,739
- Yeah.

1586
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,619
Look, okay.

1587
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,619
So, I have this photo of you,

1588
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,998
which I think your hair looks

1589
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,998
better in. But then in this one

1590
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,998
you have your camera.

1591
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,625
- Oh, no, no, no!

1592
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,625
This is not happening!

1593
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,918
- No, no.

1594
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,918
This is happening.

1595
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,212
Here, just take a seat.

1596
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,922
Wanna help me write it?

1597
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,922
- Oh, I don't know.

1598
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:01,426
- Okay, here's what

1599
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:01,426
I have so far.

1600
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,388
World's greatest father

1601
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,388
and handsomest photographer.

1602
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,139
- Ah! Veto.

1603
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:10,018
- Looking for a fellow

1604
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:10,018
adventurer interested in art,

1605
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:10,018
photography

1606
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,812
and nostalgia about

1607
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,812
the Supersonics.

1608
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,648
- Supersonics is good.

1609
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,648
That's important.

1610
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,233
- I knew you would like that.

1611
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,027
A partner in crime to

1612
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,027
travel the world with.

1613
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,778
- I don't travel, honey.

1614
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,324
- Uh, you will though.

1615
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:29,996
- All right, we're not

1616
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:29,996
doing this.

1617
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,583
- Please, please, please,

1618
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,583
I want to.

1619
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,589
You lost Mom and now

1620
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,589
you're gonna lose me, too.

1621
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:50,058
- No.

1622
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:50,058
No, there's always a chance.

1623
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:53,437
- We've always known it's a

1624
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:53,437
matter of when and not if.

1625
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,190
So I really need

1626
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,190
you to be selfish

1627
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:58,692
and...

1628
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:03,488
go out there and, you know,

1629
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:03,488
take those beautiful photos

1630
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:07,492
and start traveling the world

1631
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:07,492
again. I want everyone to see

1632
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:07,492
your photos, Dad.

1633
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:10,495
- Just stop.

1634
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:10,495
Okay, I can't...

1635
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:11,622
I can't.

1636
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,831
- I just want you...

1637
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:18,378
to promise me that you're

1638
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:18,378
gonna take care of yourself.

1639
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:22,633
I really want you to have as

1640
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:22,633
happy a life as the one you've

1641
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:22,633
given me.

1642
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,510
And try and find someone

1643
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:29,097
that you can share these

1644
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:29,097
incredible adventures with.

1645
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,434
Because having someone...

1646
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,689
that's the best part.

1647
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:43,861
So please, just pick a rando

1648
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:43,861
lady and take her out.

1649
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:49,451
- Okay.

1650
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,662
Okay.

1651
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:53,747
- Promise me.

1652
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,248
- I promise.

1653
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,255
- Good.

1654
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:08,052
Now we can order Chinese food.

1655
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,683
- Come on!

1656
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,683
- That was so a ball.

1657
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,687
- That's not even baseball.

1658
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,687
I don't know what that is.

1659
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,150
(doorbell ringing)

1660
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,150
- Oh, food.

1661
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,487
Finally.

1662
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,487
What took them so long?

1663
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,286
Oh, my God.

1664
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:34,996
Charlie's outside.

1665
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,290
- I know. I called him.

1666
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,416
- What?

1667
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,168
Why?

1668
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,294
- Because...

1669
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,216
you said the best part was

1670
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,216
having someone to share your

1671
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,216
adventures with.

1672
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,802
So, go talk to him.

1673
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,303
Tell him the truth.

1674
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,723
He deserves that.

1675
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,517
And so do you.

1676
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,942
- You exist.

1677
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,446
This time I was

1678
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,446
positive I dreamt you.

1679
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,284
- Charlie, I'm so sorry.

1680
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,246
- Katie, this isn't something

1681
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,246
you can just not tell me.

1682
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,288
- I'm so...

1683
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:18,749
so sorry...

1684
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:20,417
I didn't tell you.

1685
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,959
That's...

1686
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:28,842
unforgivable and very selfish...

1687
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:29,926
on my part.

1688
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,305
We were never gonna work.

1689
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,435
But I wanted us to.

1690
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:42,146
You, me, we...

1691
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:46,484
we don't win in the end.

1692
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:48,445
So...

1693
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,239
so I'm saying goodbye, Charlie.

1694
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,911
Goodbye.

1695
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,754
- You know, that was the worst

1696
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,754
break-up speech I've ever heard.

1697
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,548
- What?

1698
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,548
- Yeah. Like a

1699
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,548
D- would be generous.

1700
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:11,468
Zeros from all the judges,

1701
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:11,468
Katie. It was a total flop.

1702
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,805
- I've never done this before!

1703
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,805
What do you expect?

1704
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:18,015
(laughing)

1705
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:18,015
Seriously, Charlie.

1706
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,601
We can't.

1707
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,187
- We can.

1708
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,115
What I can't do...

1709
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,243
I can't stop being with you.

1710
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,289
Katie, I've done my research

1711
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,289
on XP. I know what it is.

1712
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,416
I know what you

1713
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,416
are going through.

1714
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,294
But we're not the

1715
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,294
couple who doesn't try.

1716
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,880
You knew that before I did.

1717
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:02,059
You've changed my life, Katie.

1718
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:05,313
Okay, you can either just leave

1719
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:05,313
me here on this porch or...

1720
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,609
or we can have the best

1721
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,609
summer of our lives.

1722
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:13,571
What's it gonna be?

1723
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:41,975
(whistle blowing)

1724
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,704
- Go, Charlie, push it!

1725
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,709
- Go, Charlie!

1726
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,342
- That's it, Charlie, come on!

1727
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,559
- Go, Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

1728
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,568
- Yeah!

1729
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:43,036
- The Berkeley coach was

1730
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:43,036
impressed and they promised to

1731
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:43,036
keep in touch.

1732
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,204
- In touch is good!

1733
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,204
They'll be in touch.

1734
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:46,957
I'm so proud of you, honey.

1735
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,542
- So good.

1736
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,338
Hey, I'll be right back.

1737
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,548
- Sure.

1738
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,636
- Hey, Charlie.

1739
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,636
- Hi.

1740
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,554
- The rumors are true.

1741
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,554
Congrats.

1742
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,681
- Thank you.

1743
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,681
- You were great in there.

1744
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:05,558
- Thank you for

1745
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:05,558
letting Katie come.

1746
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,061
- I couldn't have stopped her.

1747
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,187
- Mr. Price...

1748
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,983
would you mind

1749
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,983
if I took Katie out tomorrow?

1750
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:17,112
- Yeah.

1751
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,614
Yeah, I think that'd be fine.

1752
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:20,782
- Thank you.

1753
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:03,033
Come on, come on.

1754
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:03,033
- I'm so confused.

1755
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:03,033
What are we...

1756
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,210
What is this?

1757
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,210
- It's for you.

1758
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,379
- Is this Katie?

1759
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,379
- Yeah.

1760
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,588
- Let's do this.

1761
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:22,719
- No, oh, my God, no.

1762
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:22,719
- Now, Katie, Katie, yes.

1763
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,012
- No, I can't.

1764
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,012
- Yes, yes!

1765
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:25,513
Yes!

1766
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,725
- This is so crazy.

1767
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,894
How did you even pay for this?

1768
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,145
- Don't worry about it.

1769
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,522
- Charlie, your truck money?

1770
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,522
I can't let you--

1771
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:38,109
- Katie, it's already done.

1772
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:38,109
Okay, you helped me figure out

1773
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:38,109
my dreams

1774
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:41,487
and now it's payback time.

1775
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,324
- I can't play anymore.

1776
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,118
- Then just sing.

1777
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,045
- Whenever you're ready, Katie.

1778
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,963
Let's lay one down.

1779
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:00,965
- Thank you.

1780
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,762
How did you get this?

1781
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,806
This is the song I've

1782
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,806
been working on.

1783
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,225
- Stole your notebook again.

1784
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:20,568

1803
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,524
(laughing)

1804
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,861
- That one.

1805
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:46,237
- That one?

1806
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,282
That's Charlinium,

1807
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:53,161
'cause it is huge and powerful.

1808
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:57,123
And that one is my favorite.

1809
01:12:57,207 --> 01:12:59,876
That one is Burritorium,

1810
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:03,087
because it's shaped

1811
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:03,087
like a burrito.

1812
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:06,257
- That one is Procyon.

1813
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,676
It's 11 light years away.

1814
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:13,681
- So we were seven

1815
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:13,681
when that light was made.

1816
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,685
- That was...

1817
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:21,105
right around the time

1818
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:21,105
you got your first skateboard.

1819
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:24,775
- What?

1820
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:31,490
- Charlie, that night we met

1821
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:31,490
at the train station...

1822
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,078
I already knew you.

1823
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:37,121
- What do you mean?

1824
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,709
- In elementary school...

1825
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:45,922
you walked by my window every

1826
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:45,922
day on your way to swim

1827
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:45,922
practice.

1828
01:13:46,256 --> 01:13:49,133
And in fourth grade...

1829
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:51,677
you started skateboarding.

1830
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:56,974
And in sixth grade, you wore

1831
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:56,974
a Ken Griffey Jr. jersey

1832
01:13:57,058 --> 01:14:00,686
every day for, like,

1833
01:13:57,058 --> 01:14:00,686
a month straight.

1834
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:04,732
And in ninth grade...

1835
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:08,444
you buzzed off all your hair.

1836
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:08,444
Ugh...

1837
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:11,155
And...

1838
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,412
every day...

1839
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,959
I waited for you to

1840
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,959
walk by my window...

1841
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,839
and it was the best

1842
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,839
part of my day.

1843
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:33,761
- If I had just looked up...

1844
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:38,766
I could've been with

1845
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:38,766
you this whole time.

1846
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:43,479
- You were.

1847
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:51,988
I...

1848
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:55,366
I love you, Charlie.

1849
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:00,997
- I love you, too.

1850
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,920
I can't believe you still

1851
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,920
like me after that buzz cut.

1852
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:12,383
- It was so ugly.

1853
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:12,383
Oh, my God.

1854
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:47,626
- There's some more chicken, but

1855
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:47,626
I'm eating the rest of the

1856
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:47,626
noodles if no one wants them.

1857
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,921
- Okay. I'm gonna go to the

1858
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,921
marina. I'll be back in an hour.

1859
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,508
- Someday I wanna see this

1860
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,508
Beyoncé-worthy yacht

1861
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,508
you're cleaning.

1862
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,719
- You're gonna miss your chance.

1863
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,719
Owner's back tomorrow.

1864
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,637
It's my last checkup.

1865
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:00,806
See you in an hour?

1866
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:01,849
- Okay.

1867
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,561
- I'll walk you out.

1868
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,561
- All right.

1869
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,063
I'll see you.

1870
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,232
One of these days we can...

1871
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,359
take her for a sail

1872
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,359
around the harbor.

1873
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,570
We can watch the sun set.

1874
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:18,324
- Wait.

1875
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,286
I... I wanna go with him.

1876
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:24,830
- Go where, honey?

1877
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:26,665
- Out.

1878
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,336
Sailing on the boat.

1879
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,464
I wanna go with him

1880
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,464
on the boat. Now.

1881
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:39,595
- Honey.

1882
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,473
It'd be better if you just--

1883
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,473
- Please, Dad.

1884
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,103
Let me do this.

1885
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,318
It's okay, Dad.

1886
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:57,280
I really want to.

1887
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,791

1932
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,624
- Glad you made it by before

1933
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,624
you took off.

1934
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,624
- Of course.

1935
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:20,835
I'm actually leaving today.

1936
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,127
- Wow!

1937
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,127
- Yeah.

1938
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,463
The first practice is in

1939
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,463
a couple of days, so...

1940
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,549
- That's exciting!

1941
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,549
- Yeah, I'm

1942
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,549
looking forward to it.

1943
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,635
- Your coach sent me your

1944
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,635
schedule, so I'm hoping to make

1945
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,635
it down for a meet.

1946
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:32,805
- But why would my coach

1947
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:32,805
send you the schedule?

1948
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:36,892
- We stayed in touch, I guess,

1949
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:36,892
after Katie reached out.

1950
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,769
- Katie reached out?

1951
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,769
- Yeah.

1952
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,771
She called him.

1953
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:43,649
Told him that he needed

1954
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:43,649
to take another look at you.

1955
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:46,569
- No, Katie never told me.

1956
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,487
- You know what?

1957
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,487
Hold that thought, all right?

1958
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,197
I got something for you.

1959
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,170
She wanted you to have that.

1960
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:19,810
- I, um...

1961
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,565
I never said sorry.

1962
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,944
I never apologized to you.

1963
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:31,655
I should have never kept

1964
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:31,655
Katie out that late and I--

1965
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:32,989
- Stop!

1966
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,659
Stop!

1967
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:38,454
It's nobody's fault.

1968
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:40,038
Okay?

1969
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:45,711
We knew from the time

1970
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:45,711
that she was little...

1971
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:48,255
that every day was

1972
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:48,255
gonna be a gift.

1973
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:51,300
I should be thanking you!

1974
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:56,054
All I ever wanted to

1975
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:56,054
do was make her happy.

1976
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,892
And you made her so happy.

1977
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:02,728
- Thank you.

1978
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:10,402
- Good luck at school, son.

1979
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:11,695
- Thank you.

1980
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:23,958

Dear Charlie.

2023

I've always been more

2024
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:21,617
comfortable writing song lyrics

2025
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:21,617
than actual sentences.

2026

first saw each other...

2030
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:32,711
