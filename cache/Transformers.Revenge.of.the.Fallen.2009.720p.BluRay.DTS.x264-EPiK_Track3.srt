1
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:01,185
Earth, birthpIace of the human race,

2
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,481
a species much Iike our own,

3
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,985
capabIe of great compassion

4
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,697
and great violence.

5
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,794
For in our quest to protect the humans,

6
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,922
a deeper reveIation dawns.

7
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,176
Our worlds have met before.

8
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,974
-Newsflash from the BBC.
-Breaking news out of Shanghai.

9
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:26,103
There's been a major toxic spiII
in the Shanghai factory district.

10
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,314
We're staying
on top of this deveIoping story for you.

11
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,859
We wiII bring you
any new information as we get it.

12
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,242
NEST Seahawks approaching target.

13
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,578
Three minutes
until evacuation is complete, sir.

14
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,707
Chinese airspace has been locked
and sealed, one-mile radius.

15
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,835
All right, give NEST team the go.

16
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,711
Black Hawks, you're clear to land.

17
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,049
Ding-a-Iing!
Come out and get your ice cream.

18
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,597
Any bad robot out there
better get ready for an ass-whupping.

19
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,940
For the last two years,
an advance team of new Autobots

20
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,277
has taken refuge here
under my command.

21
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,195
Arcees, get ready to launch.

22
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,822
We're locked and loaded.

23
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,951
Together, we form an alliance
with the humans,

24
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,204
a secret but brave squad of soldiers.

25
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,207
All right, listen up. China's cover story
on this one is "toxic spill."

26
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,543
They had to evac the area
for search and rescue.

27
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,129
This makes six enemy contacts
in eight months.

28
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,424
We gotta make sure this one does not
get out in the public eye, so keep it tight.

29
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,720
A classified strike team called NEST.

30
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,390
We hunt for what remains
of our Decepticon foes

31
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,518
hiding in different countries
around the globe.

32
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,936
Roll in Alpha through Echo now.

33
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,156
Move out! Let's go!

34
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,761
All right, lronhide.
We got echoes. They're close.

35
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,764
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.

36
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:39,528
He's here. l smell him.

37
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,035
lt's close. lt's getting closer.

38
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,209
-Oh, no.
-What have you got?

39
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,544
Thermal ripple.

40
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,549
Right, everybody, be steady.
We're right on top of it.

41
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,397
Eagle niner!

42
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,190
l need an energy proton.

43
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,873
Panther 1, requesting fire mission now!

44
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,376
Gunships on station. Roll in hot!

45
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,253
Dog 1, now we are engaging.

46
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,805
We got a second Decepticon.

47
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,686
Arcee twins! Target coming your way!

48
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,151
l got him, l got him!

49
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,225
l screwed that up. l'm okay. l'm all right.

50
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,519
-This is combat, man.
-Total brain freeze, man.

51
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,645
What's wrong with you?

52
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,151
Bring in Sideswipe!

53
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,488
Clear a path!

54
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,671
Damn, l'm good!

55
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,476
Air support, we need Big Buddha
to deliver the drop now!

56
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,978
Cyclone 98, final attack hitting in 120.

57
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:22,316
Clear to drop in
five, four, three, two, one.

58
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,666
Autobots, l'm in pursuit!

59
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,821
Pull over!

60
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,886
Punk-ass Decepticon!

61
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,305
Any last words?

62
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,100
This is not your planet to rule!

63
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,519
The Fallen shall rise again.

64
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,689
That doesn't sound good.

65
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,900
Not today.

66
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,532
Come on, let's go! All hands on deck!

67
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,368
Frankie, Mojo, out!
Come on, kiddo, we're on a schedule.

68
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,954
Slow down, Dad. Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?

69
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,665
-Did you rent the room out?
-No, l got other ideas for your room

70
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,918
and it rhymes with "home theater."

71
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,801
Look what l found.
lt's your little baby booties.

72
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,264
-Ma.
-My little baby-bootie boy.

73
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,141
-You can't go.
-You see this, Dad? This is how

74
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,559
you're supposed to react
when the fruit of your loins

75
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,937
goes out into the cruel world
to fend for himself, okay?

76
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,481
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!

77
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,568
You have to come home every holiday,
not just big ones.

78
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,654
You have to come home for Halloween.

79
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,988
Well, l can't
come home for Halloween, Mom.

80
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,490
-Well, then we'll come to you.
-You're not coming.

81
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,741
-No, we're not going anywhere.
-We'll dress up.

82
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,117
We'll be in costumes.
You'll never know it's us.

83
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,786
-You can't do that, Mom.
-Would you let the kid breathe,

84
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,663
for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.

85
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,248
There's no way you're packed
for a month-long trip.

86
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,626
Come on, chop, chop!
Let's go. March, young lady.

87
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,420
-Dad.
-l love it when you call me "young lady,"

88
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,589
-you dirty old man.
-You ain't seen nothing yet.

89
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,716
-Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
-What?

90
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,177
l'm watching what you're doing, Dad.
lt's not a rap video.

91
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,595
lt's just like a coach thing.

92
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,555
That was
a really creepy move just now, Dad.

93
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,769
Look. You know, your mother and me
are really proud of you.

94
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,272
You're the first Witwicky
ever to go to college.

95
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,025
Now l'm crying again! This sucks!

96
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,902
You're gonna be okay, Ma.

97
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,445
You know, it's just going to be,

98
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:19,285
you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,

99
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,329
going out to handle the world
on his own.

100
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,665
-You okay, Pop?
-Yeah.

101
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,293
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

102
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,713
Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!

103
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,840
You'll see a lot of that in college, too.

104
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,093
-What are you talking about, Dad?
-There's gonna be a lot of women there.

105
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,803
Yeah, well,
l'm a one-woman kind of guy.

106
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,263
Look, Mikaela's the greatest,

107
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,974
but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?

108
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,310
You're no different
than any other couple your age.

109
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,562
Except we discovered
an alien race together.

110
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,063
How long you gonna be riding
that scooter?

111
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,077
Dad, listen, l know what the odds are.
We're the exception, okay?

112
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,997
Wait a second. Who could that be?

113
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,915
ln two weeks, it could be Muffy.

114
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,250
Hey, beautiful.

115
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,544
-l'm breaking up with you, Sam.
-Really?

116
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,087
You sure?
l'm not hearing a lot of conviction.

117
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,758
Well, l am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.

118
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,093
Wow, you almost sounded serious
that time.

119
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,014
Guess what? l made you
a long-distance relationship kit.

120
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,516
Yeah, l got you a webcam,
so we can chat 24/7.

121
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,768
All Witwicky, all the time.

122
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,853
And l got you a couple souvenirs
from the event

123
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,188
that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.

124
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,775
-Some mixes and candles and stuff.
-Sounds cute. l can't wait.

125
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,194
Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?

126
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,446
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

127
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,031
Yeah. Of course, l kept it, Mikaela.

128
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,158
lt's like my Super Bowl jersey.
l bled in this thing.

129
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,869
-Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
-No, it's not that.

130
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,372
lt's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.

131
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,708
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

132
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,335
You really should come with me.

133
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,170
They got cheap apartments
near campus.

134
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,799
Well, that's not gonna happen
until l get my man-child father,

135
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,551
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.

136
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,929
l heard that.
Where'd you put the clutch covers?

137
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,390
-Next to the camshafts.
-l love it when you say "camshafts."

138
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,516
Whisper it to me.

139
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,853
Camshafts.

140
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,022
Why can't l hate you?

141
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,942
lt's my Witwicky charm.

142
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,735
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.

143
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,738
l guess we're not breaking up.
l'll be over in 20.

144
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,492
Mikaela, l think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.

145
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,040
Sam?

146
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,174
There's a fire!

147
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,427
Dad, we got a fire!

148
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,488
Fire!

149
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,168
Ron, did you know
it was gonna be this hard?

150
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,794
Can you just stop?

151
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,589
Yeah, okay, l'll stop. You carry this shit!

152
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,225
-Wow.
-Do you know what?

153
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,560
-What?
-l don't want to go anywhere with you.

154
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,811
l don't wanna go to France with you.

155
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,438
l don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

156
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,814
-l'm going back inside.
-All right, fine.

157
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,940
l'll call you from Paris.

158
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,829
What is all the racket?

159
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:51,914
Sam?

160
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,374
Dad!

161
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,840
-What was that?
-That's the whole kitchen!

162
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,429
-Bumblebee... Oh, my...
-Bumblebee!

163
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,868
-911.
-Bumblebee!

164
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,871
-Get in the garage. Go!
-What the freak just happened?

165
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,209
l'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.

166
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,794
Holy Mother!

167
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,800
-Oh, my God!
-Whatever.

168
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,052
Get in the garage now!

169
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,227
-Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
-Dogs out! Get the dogs out!

170
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,022
This is it! Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?

171
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,697
My house is on fire!

172
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,202
-...very important.
-What happened?

173
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:16,999
Come here. Listen, l need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.

174
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,250
-What's going on?
-Just take it.

175
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,252
-Sam Witwicky? A word with you.
-Yes, Mom. Yeah.

176
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,504
-Hi, Mikaela. l have a bald spot.
-Hi.

177
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,965
-An old furnace, l think.
-From a waffle iron.

178
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,594
When you go, he goes. l cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!

179
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,346
Judy... National security.

180
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,975
Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.

181
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,395
Just consider this
the official start of our remodel, okay?

182
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,523
Fine. lf the government's paying,
l want a pool and a hot tub!

183
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,067
And l'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!

184
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,283
-Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
-He still having voice problems?

185
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,785
He's playing it up.

186
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,955
Bee, l want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?

187
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,292
l'm so excited and l just can't hide it

188
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,502
Hey, l'm not taking you with me.

189
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,340
l'm gonna wait outside, okay?

190
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,176
l meant to tell you about this earlier.

191
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,720
lt's just that, you know...
Here's the thing.

192
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,014
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.

193
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,100
l know, and if it was up to me,
l'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

194
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,978
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.

195
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:24,441
l mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.

196
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,984
This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.

197
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,445
Can you just look at me, please?

198
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,908
Come on, big guy.
Look, the guardian thing is done.

199
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,328
Okay? You did yourjob.
Look, l'm safe now.

200
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,872
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.

201
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,334
l just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why l'm going to college,

202
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,586
and l can't do that with you.

203
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,506
lt's not the last time l'm gonna see you,
you know, Bee.

204
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,385
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

205
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,597
But you'll always be my first car.

206
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,142
Love you, Bee.

207
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:05,982
Wow!

208
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,236
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.

209
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,821
-You got dirt all over you.
-Stop. Stop.

210
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,406
-What?
-Stop, l'm okay.

211
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,865
Look.

212
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,202
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?

213
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,538
You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.

214
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,624
-And?
-And l'll do anything for you.

215
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,543
And?

216
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,713
-l think Sam's about to say the L-word.
-Let's go, kiddo!

217
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,880
Nice timing, Dad.

218
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,966
l adore you.

219
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,385
That's not the word that l want

220
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,886
-to hear right now.
-What are you talking about?

221
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,971
lt's the same word as the other word.

222
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,889
-lt's not the same word.
-Look, if l say the other word now

223
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,516
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything, plus

224
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,852
you haven't said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.

225
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,521
Yeah, but l haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.

226
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,233
Yeah, well, so do girls.
Especially girls like you, with options.

227
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,487
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?

228
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,158
-lt can be.
-l hate that it's working.

229
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,994
Can l have a kiss?

230
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,830
We're going to make it work, l promise.

231
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,950
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.

232
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,036
Retrieve it.

233
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,602
Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.

234
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,522
Bad-ass ice-cream truck
coming through.

235
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,482
-Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
-No, l don't...

236
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,691
-Hold up.
-Those are nice.

237
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,401
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

238
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,155
Yes, sir. Yeah!
Look here, it's my booty call right here!

239
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,117
-Time to get my sexy on with the green.
-Green? No, green is mine!

240
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,577
l call green!

241
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,040
-l got the green.
-That hurt, man.

242
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,292
lt's supposed to hurt. lt's an ass-kicking.

243
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,763
Present arms!

244
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,530
Director Galloway, what an honor.
l'd love to show you around,

245
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,115
but you gotta be
on the classified access list.

246
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,784
l am now. Presidential order, Major.

247
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,787
l got a message
for your classified space buddies!

248
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,956
You guys made a mess of Shanghai.

249
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,337
All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS

250
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,591
and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.

251
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,970
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.

252
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,662
Secure line to
the Pentagon is now open.

253
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,749
-General?
-Will, l saw the Shanghai op.

254
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,335
-We had a rough day out there.
-Yes, sir.

255
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,254
We have intel that l believe
warrants an immediate debrief.

256
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,548
Now with your permission,
l can't let you see him,

257
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,009
but l would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.

258
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,177
Proceed.

259
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,405
You gotta wonder,

260
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,867
if God made us in his image,
who made him?

261
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,204
General, our alliance
has countermanded

262
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,915
six Decepticon incursions this year,

263
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,584
each on a different continent.

264
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,629
They're clearly searching
around the world for something,

265
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,049
but last night's encounter
came with a warning.

266
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,802
"The Fallen shall rise again."

267
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,179
"The Fallen." Meaning what?

268
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,683
Origin unknown.
The only recorded history of our race

269
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,979
was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.

270
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,605
Excuse me!

271
00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:00,944
With this so-called AllSpark
now destroyed,

272
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,572
why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?

273
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,950
Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.

274
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,995
The Presidentjust appointed him liaison.

275
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,664
Well, l guess l didn't get that memo.

276
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,752
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.

277
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,213
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

278
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,508
After all the damage in Shanghai,

279
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,595
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

280
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:33,852
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,

281
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:39,482
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

282
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:43,528
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

283
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,157
lt would absolutely bring
more harm than good.

284
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,118
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

285
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,245
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

286
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,872
in the field for two years.

287
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,250
We've shed blood,
sweat and precious metal together.

288
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,045
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.

289
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,755
Don't tempt me.

290
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,340
And the newest members of your team.

291
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,718
-Easy.
-l understand they arrived here

292
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,720
after you sent a message into space,

293
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,557
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.

294
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,394
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. lt was vetted right here.

295
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,398
And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team

296
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,401
has always been above reproach.

297
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,279
Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President

298
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:31,910
that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.

299
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,121
Now, what do we know so far?

300
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:41,628
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,

301
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:45,298
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,

302
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,928
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.

303
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:54,390
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

304
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,392
is locked in an electromagnetic vault

305
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,813
here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.

306
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,400
Decepticons, we have located the shard.

307
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:10,323
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

308
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,243
well, there's only one clear conclusion!

309
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,204
You! The Autobots!

310
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,290
They're here to hunt you!

311
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,335
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

312
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,296
"The Fallen shall rise again"?

313
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,590
lt sounds to me
like something's coming.

314
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:32,470
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

315
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,224
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

316
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,229
will you leave peacefully?

317
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:46,234
Freedom is your right. lf you make
that request, we will honor it.

318
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:52,532
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

319
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,495
What if we leave and you're wrong?

320
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,046
That's a good question.

321
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,678
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!

322
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,806
l feel smarter already.

323
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,769
-Ron, can you smell it?
-Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.

324
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:26,357
-Hey, cheapo!
-Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.

325
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,483
Just go ahead and check out your room.

326
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,610
Yeah, go.

327
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,203
-Hey.
-Hey.

328
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,164
-You must be Sam, right? l'm Leo.
-Hey.

329
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,793
So, l already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

330
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,339
-That side.
-l already chose that side.

331
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,718
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

332
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,386
Yeah, see,
you're trying to see if l'm a normal guy.

333
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,763
l'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.

334
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,389
Balanced, unmedicated,
nothing under the crawl space.

335
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,849
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.

336
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:00,975
No criminal record, won't steal anything.

337
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,602
-lncluding girlfriends.
-Especially girlfriends.

338
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,979
-You got a girlfriend?
-l do. You?

339
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,399
No, not a chance. You a techie?

340
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,735
Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?

341
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,071
-Server's almost online, Leo.
-Network's up and running.

342
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,572
Beautiful, that's what l like to hear.

343
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,617
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder,
my lT gurus.

344
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,828
Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheRealEffingDeal.com.

345
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,163
That's me, l'm sure you've heard of it.

346
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,666
-No, l haven't.
-Well, that sucks.

347
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,209
-What is all this for?
-See where l'm going, bro.

348
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,254
Look, call me gross,
l want to be a baby billionaire.

349
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,798
Kitten calendars.
That's where l started. Look at me now.

350
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,174
Got to have dreams, bro.

351
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,887
Leo! We got
some brand-new Shanghai vid!

352
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:40,932
Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!

353
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,434
-What's "FTJ"?
-"Fuel the Jet."

354
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,811
Fuel the Jet, bro.

355
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,272
FTJ. FTJ, legit!

356
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,732
Did you see that? Did you see that?

357
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,277
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."

358
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,779
Don't believe the hype, bro.

359
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,449
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

360
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,910
Yeah, l saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

361
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,246
and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...

362
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,290
-lt looks fake to me.
-Dude, it's not fake.

363
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,459
The lnternet is pure truth.
Video doesn't lie.

364
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,169
-lt looks fake.
-No, man, l've seen them.

365
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,464
-They're, like, these robots...
-Look, look, it's fake.

366
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,049
Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?

367
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,176
And l wasn't there,

368
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,470
-so l can't comment or speculate.
-No.

369
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,806
"Comment or speculate"?
And we're supposed to cohabitate?

370
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,809
No, listen, okay?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro!

371
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,602
-Which sack?
-The ball sack.

372
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,229
Dude, what kind of tool are you?

373
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,316
Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?

374
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,776
-lt's aliens, man.
-Okay, okay.

375
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,111
Follow me.

376
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,196
Leo, bad news!

377
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,615
We just got scooped.
The video's already up on GFR.

378
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,242
Fassbinder!

379
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,662
Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.

380
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,748
"Effing" was my F-ing idea
and he stole it!

381
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,334
He's been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.

382
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,794
By the way, l read your file.
l'm poor, you're poor.

383
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,048
We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.

384
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,468
l work for you now? That's incredible.

385
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,512
lt's first day of college,
l got a career in a dinky lnternet firm

386
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,599
with a boss who is made up
ofjust pure champion stuff.

387
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,684
Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?

388
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,269
That's your one warning patrolling,
dude. Don't make me

389
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,021
have Fassbinder hack your financial aid,
'cause l'll do it!

390
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,358
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little
intense in my room. Can l switch out?

391
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:18,279
Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?

392
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,447
-Oh, here we go.
-We made it. Hi.

393
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,698
lt's just like Hogwarts.

394
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,949
-Hi.
-ls this co-ed?

395
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,326
This is a co-ed dorm.

396
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,869
-You guys want to meet my roommates?
-Yeah.

397
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,204
Some real swell guys.

398
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,663
-Here's Leo.
-We're the Witwickys.

399
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:28,831
-l'm Leo.
-l'm Judy.

400
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,708
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.

401
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,378
-Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
-Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma.

402
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,587
What is that in your hand, by the way?

403
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:38,758
l got this at the bake sale for the
environment that those boys are having.

404
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,761
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.

405
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,388
-Mom?
-Yeah, it's 100% pure,

406
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,098
Hawaiian green for the environment.

407
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,682
-How many of these have you eaten?
-Drop it.

408
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,726
-What is this?
-Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it.

409
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,144
-No, it's...
-Please, give me...

410
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,355
Hey! lt's my cheat day.
l can eat what l want.

411
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,357
l'm going to freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

412
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,650
Please do something right now.

413
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,277
l can eat all the fricking brownies l want!

414
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,404
Come on, let's go.

415
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,988
l'm sorry and you're welcome.

416
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,910
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55."

417
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,955
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and
stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.

418
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,457
ls... ls so nice...

419
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,920
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

420
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,590
She's tied for number one
on my to-do list.

421
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,384
Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me?

422
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:25,721
Pretty girls! Hey, you.
My son lives in this dorm.

423
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,975
You should go make friends with him.
He's Sam.

424
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,435
Glad she ain't my mama!

425
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,687
And he recently had his cherry popped!

426
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,107
He didn't know l was in the house!
l heard it all!

427
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,859
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Here he is!

428
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,446
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice!

429
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:47,410
-Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
-No, like the GPS. OnStar!

430
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,328
-OnStar.
-Frisbee!

431
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,458
No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?

432
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:01,299
-Give it! Mine, mine, mine!
-Hey! Crazy!

433
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,509
-You want it?
-l want it.

434
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:07,013
Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down.

435
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,474
-You gotta control your mother.
-l don't know who this woman is.

436
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,143
Hey, Professor, l'd do anything for an A.

437
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,062
All right, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.

438
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,065
-Did you get the booties? All right.
-Yes, Dad, l got the booties!

439
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,901
l'm upside down!

440
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,476
Black Lion X-Ray,
this is Black Lion Tango.

441
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,438
We have activation of motion sensors
on the western perimeter fence.

442
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,349
Breach at B-14.

443
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,647
Go, go, go, go!

444
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,616
The shard's gone.

445
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,584
Contact!

446
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,003
Take it down!

447
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,213
-Which way?
-Shoot left!

448
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,387
Knock it down!

449
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,274
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.

450
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,984
So, get your game faces on.

451
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,195
l can't stay long.
l have a webcam date with my girlfriend.

452
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,488
-That's so cool!
-No, it's not.

453
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,496
While he's making out
with his MacBook,

454
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,498
l'm gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on.

455
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,750
-Let's roll.
-She's hot.

456
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,710
Bro, we're hunting!

457
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,091
-See you, darling.
-Bye, Dad.

458
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,259
Okay.

459
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:40,559
This is our first live chat date.
l've never done it before.

460
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,937
l'm kind of nervous.

461
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,716
-Are you okay?
-No.

462
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,469
l was getting a napkin for my drink.

463
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,889
Thanks. Cheers.

464
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,016
-lt's Sam, right?
-Yeah.

465
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:24,770
-l wanna dance.
-What, like... Like dancing?

466
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,898
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?

467
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:32,820
'Cause l'm in a permanently semi...
l'm in a relationship, kind of...

468
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:37,241
-Relax. l just want to have some fun.
-Wanna have some fun?

469
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:41,328
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there and...

470
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,248
Oh, my...

471
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,960
So, how about tonight
you pretend l'm your girlfriend

472
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,171
and l pretend that you're my boyfriend?

473
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,434
Hey! Who drove
the freaking yellow Camaro?

474
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,854
There is a car on the lawn!

475
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:11,901
What are you doing?

476
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,444
Houston, we have a problem.

477
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,612
-What is it?
-Freshman!

478
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,197
-Yeah?
-ls that your car in our bushes?

479
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:20,159
No, there's a friend of mine,
he just went to get you a tighter shirt.

480
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,953
There isn't a tighter shirt! We checked.

481
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,663
Now how about
l park my foot in your ass?

482
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,415
-What size shoe do you wear?
-Yeah?

483
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,459
-Hold on.
-You wanna try?

484
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,420
-l'll back it up right now.
-Get him out of here.

485
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,215
You have a ride?
Bro, why are you holding out on us?

486
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,424
l've only known you 17 hours.

487
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,969
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.

488
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:43,307
-l love Camaros.
-l can't do this right now, okay?

489
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,267
-Don't be a wimp.
-Oh, God!

490
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:57,905
-My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
-Yeah?

491
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:02,743
Fuel-injected.
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.

492
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,163
We shouldn't stare...

493
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,708
l mean, share stories
with each other at all.

494
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,086
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.

495
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,713
Your cheatin' heart

496
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,927
Don't. Don't!

497
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,763
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky

498
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:26,016
-ls your radio broken?
-No, my concentration is.

499
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,852
We're not cheating.

500
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,479
Not yet.

501
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,818
ls something wrong here?

502
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,991
God! You okay?

503
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,995
She's mighty, mighty

504
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,331
l really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...

505
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,548
Oh, God! lt's in my mouth!

506
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,009
Are you okay? l got Wetnaps.

507
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,428
l got Wetnaps for your face! Hold on!

508
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,638
l... l'm so sorry!

509
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,474
What are you doing?

510
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,489
You won't give me a day, huh?

511
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,368
-You won't give me one day in college?
-l'm sorry, Sam,

512
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,747
but the last fragment of the AllSpark
was stolen.

513
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,707
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?

514
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,794
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,

515
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,672
but l'm here for your help, Sam,

516
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:43,177
because your leaders believe we
brought vengeance upon your planet.

517
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,262
Perhaps they are right.

518
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:50,434
That is why they must be reminded by
another human of the trust we share.

519
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,228
-This isn't my war.
-Not yet,

520
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,690
but l fear it soon will be.

521
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,361
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

522
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,572
Whole generations lost.

523
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,454
l know, and l want to help you, l do,

524
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,624
but l am not some alien ambassador,
you know?

525
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,542
l'm a normal kid with normal problems.

526
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,963
l am where l'm supposed to be.

527
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,342
l'm sorry. l...

528
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,095
l really am.

529
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:29,974
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

530
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,602
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

531
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,898
We do, more than you know.

532
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,519
Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214, and possible hostile,

533
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,563
confirmed for
Project Deep Six Drop Point.

534
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,357
-What do you got?
-SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,

535
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:21,650
diving fast.

536
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,948
Never seen anything
dive that deep that fast.

537
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,535
-Man battle stations.
-Chief of the watch, man battle stations!

538
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,495
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead two-thirds.

539
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,290
-Left full rudder, two-thirds.
-Dive, go deep.

540
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,731
The nets protecting NBE One
are screaming, sir.

541
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,693
That is 9,300 fathoms down.
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?

542
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,945
-None, sir.
-Then, people, we've got a problem!

543
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,210
Need parts! Kill the little one!

544
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,844
The shard make Energon!

545
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,985
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts,
and they're coming up fast!

546
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,446
-Sound collision alarm.
-Left hard rudder.

547
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,324
Five hundred feet.

548
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,327
Angel Six,
we got six hostiles coming up.

549
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,504
-Collision imminent port side.
-One hundred feet.

550
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,630
Brace for impact.

551
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,201
Starscream, l'm home.

552
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:41,373
Lord Megatron, l was so relieved
to hear of your resurrection.

553
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:45,669
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.

554
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:50,591
Only to help spawn our new army.
The Fallen decrees it!

555
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:55,012
After all, in your absence,
someone had to take command.

556
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,350
-So disappointing.
-Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile!

557
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:04,521
Even in death,
there is no command but mine.

558
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,906
My master, l failed you on Earth.

559
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:19,620
The AllSpark is destroyed
and without it, our race will perish.

560
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:26,084
You have much to learn, my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel.

561
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,838
lts power, its knowledge,
can never be destroyed.

562
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:34,509
-lt can only transform.
-How is that possible?

563
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:38,180
lt has been absorbed
by the human child.

564
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:43,268
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

565
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,980
Well, then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body!

566
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,567
And you will, my apprentice, in time.

567
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:55,906
For millennia, l have dreamed
of my return to that wretched planet

568
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:02,621
where l, too, was once betrayed
by the Primes l called my brothers.

569
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:10,295
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now, only one remains.

570
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,966
Optimus! He protects the boy.

571
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,344
Then the boy will lead us to him

572
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:22,933
-and revenge will be ours.
-Yes.

573
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:28,146
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

574
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:33,235
Without more Energon,
the hatchlings will keep dying.

575
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,036
Space. Time. Gravity.

576
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,085
-Thank you.
-Finish that for me.

577
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,005
We're going on a journey together,
you and l, today.

578
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:58,093
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

579
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,972
And l shall be your consort, your guide,

580
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:06,059
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

581
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,897
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

582
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,485
For what do we know about the stars?

583
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,448
Virgo, the virgin.

584
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,492
Orion, the great hunter.

585
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:27,164
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

586
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,583
No, they are dynamos

587
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:34,296
filled with a throbbing,
savage and pent-up energy!

588
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:40,052
Behold the work ofAlbert Einstein,
a professor once, like moi.

589
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,636
-Energy equals mass...
-What you doing?

590
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,180
Put your hand down.
Put your hand down.

591
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,682
Young man, there are no questions

592
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,684
until l've reached
the climax of my lecture.

593
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:51,104
l just finished your book and there's
only one problem. Einstein's wrong.

594
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,190
Energy does equal
mass times the velocity

595
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,358
of light squared in this dimension,

596
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:57,444
but what about the other 17?
Nobody ever talks about the other 17.

597
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,738
Clear example.

598
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,743
Break down the elemental components
of Energon,

599
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,329
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...

600
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,830
Fourteen galactic convergences it took

601
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:12,542
the Sentinel Prime expedition
to receive an... Echo on its signal,

602
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,544
you wind up with a formula
for inter-dimensional energy increase

603
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,046
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain.

604
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,423
Come on, guys, l can't be
the only one in the class who...

605
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:23,303
Young man, l will not be
punk'd in front of the dean.

606
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,058
No, this is my universe here.

607
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:33,480
Do you understand?
l am the alpha and the omega.

608
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,982
-Get out of my class!
-Yes, sir.

609
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,655
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

610
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:56,711
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi.
You're such a good boy.

611
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,589
What a good boy, you are.

612
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,847
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?

613
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,436
Come on, check that out.

614
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,106
There you go.

615
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,449
-Yes, Samuel?
-Hello? Mikaela?

616
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,118
l can't believe you're gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.

617
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,996
-Something just happened to me, okay?
-What, you finally hit puberty?

618
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,706
No, no, no. Stop laughing.
This is serious. Okay.

619
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,499
Remember l was telling you
about my great-great-grandfather,

620
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:36,376
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?

621
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:39,546
Watch it, watch it, watch... No!
Okay, remember how l was telling you...

622
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,965
Okay. Can you stop?
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

623
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,049
Mikaela, okay,

624
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,218
my great-great-grandfather
went on this Arctic mission, right?

625
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,887
And he saw Megatron.
Megatron zapped him,

626
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,847
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols. Okay.

627
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,348
Well, now l'm seeing them, too.
Excuse me.

628
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,893
l just read a 903-page astronomy book
in 32.6 seconds.

629
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,352
l had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

630
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:56,605
l am seeing symbols ever since l...

631
00:46:57,857 --> 00:47:01,818
-Since what?
-Ever since l touched the Cube splinter.

632
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:03,945
-Do you have it?
-Yeah, l have it.

633
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,866
-lt's in the shop safe. lt's fine.
-Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?

634
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,534
-Don't touch it.
-l'm not gonna touch it.

635
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,411
Sam, it's fine. lt's locked away.

636
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,872
-No one knows where it is.
-l do!

637
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,668
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.

638
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,839
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.

639
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,177
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

640
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,182
What are you looking at, slobber puss?

641
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,770
What the... This place is
a freaking house of horrors!

642
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,733
Pain... lt hurts...

643
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,277
Hold on.

644
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,282
Right to five, then...

645
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,794
ls that the best you got, huh?
ls that the best you can do?

646
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,381
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

647
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:07,050
That's my eye, you crazy bitch!

648
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:11,346
-You gonna talk now?
-l seek knowledge from the Cube.

649
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,181
-The Fallen demands me!
-What knowledge?

650
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,892
You got the shard, l need the shard.
Give me the shard. l need the shard.

651
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:18,478
They're gonna whack me!
l'm gonna be dead without that shard!

652
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,690
Easy, warrior goddess,
l'm just a little salvage-scrap drone!

653
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:25,068
-And l'm your worst nightmare.
-Hey, hey, hey!

654
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,570
-What the hell was that?
-l'll tell you later,

655
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,154
just not on an open phone line, okay?

656
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,281
l'm gonna get on a plane right now

657
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,575
and l'll be there later this afternoon.
Just be careful, Sam.

658
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,586
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

659
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,379
Yeah, a live bomb!

660
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,714
-No.
-Good.

661
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,062
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!

662
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,941
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir!

663
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,986
-As in how many?
-Unclear, sir.

664
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,446
Well, get clear.

665
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,995
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.

666
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,163
They're not answering our calls

667
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,831
and they're heading to
New York and Philadelphia.

668
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:23,126
All right, full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

669
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,211
Move it!

670
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,423
Let's go!

671
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:36,806
Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.

672
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,977
Alicia, mi amor, can l interest you
in an 18-inch Zookeeper's special?

673
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,563
Extra-large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping.

674
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,690
Basically, l've got,
like, 18 inches of meat.

675
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,360
Unless you're vegetarian.
All right. lt's cool. l am, too.

676
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,738
-Sam home?
-Sam? l think he died,

677
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,156
but why don't we check?

678
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,075
-Here we are.
-Hey!

679
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,326
You ever have a song stuck
in your head? lt's like

680
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,370
the worst song ever,
but you can't help to whistle it or sing it

681
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:02,165
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats
itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?

682
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,334
Kitten calendar,
kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

683
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,794
-kitten calendar...
-Dude, what the eff?

684
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,962
l know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

685
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,090
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.

686
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,758
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good.

687
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,927
This is the part that...

688
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,848
Okay, what were you saying?

689
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:22,268
Alice, l'm horrified you had to see this.
Let's go.

690
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,687
Get out.

691
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,647
Wait, wait, wait!
Can l just sit and watch?

692
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,857
l'll... l'll eat my pizza quietly.

693
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,860
Sam, l knew there was
something special about you.

694
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,237
Really?

695
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,865
And l know you know what happens

696
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,868
when two people in the know
get together.

697
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:42,247
They're genuinely amazing in bed.

698
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,542
Thank you.

699
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,378
All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries.

700
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:53,508
-Flag on the play. Okay. l'm very ticklish.
-We have needs, Sam. Relax.

701
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,801
Jeez!

702
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,806
What about this economy?
lt's crazy, isn't it?

703
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,936
-You are very aggressive.
-Just relax.

704
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,355
You want some turkey meatloaf?

705
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:13,653
Sam?

706
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,533
-Mikaela!
-ls that your girlfriend?

707
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,785
Ex.

708
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,997
Mikaela! Wait!

709
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,709
l can explain...

710
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,188
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...

711
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,249
All right, come on.

712
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,876
-She's coming!
-She's an alien robot! You gotta move.

713
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,294
-ls this real?
-Just run!

714
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,512
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! l can't believe
l almost had sex with her in my dream!

715
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,305
l can tell
that you really missed me a lot, Sam!

716
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,807
-Look, it's not my fault, okay?
-lt's not your fault?

717
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,308
Listen! Listen, l'm a victim!

718
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,684
-You were a victim? Of what?
-Yeah.

719
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,645
-Of what, a little 80-pound girl?
-Of... Of molestation.

720
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,396
lt was like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox!

721
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,815
You didn't have to put your tongue
in her mouth!

722
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,024
-l didn't! Look!
-You did!

723
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,652
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?

724
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,905
lt's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!

725
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,325
-Like a diesel-y tinge to it!
-You're such a little girl!

726
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,285
We're gonna have
10 seconds of silence right now.

727
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,578
l'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.

728
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,497
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?

729
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,124
l'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.
You have three seconds left.

730
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:51,417
You know what?
You can give me the silent treatment

731
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,253
all you want,
but you can't keep me from talking.

732
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,171
-What were you gonna say?
-l hope you had a lot of fun,

733
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,131
because this, this is over.

734
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,634
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?

735
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,970
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies

736
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:04,889
are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They're growing right now, probably!

737
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:07,767
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!

738
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:08,977
Who are you?

739
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:12,188
l'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? l'm the key to this.

740
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,857
The aliens,
they want me 'cause of my site.

741
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:20,947
Whoa, guys, right there!

742
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,494
Run!

743
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,624
Mikaela!

744
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,352
Come on! We gotta move!

745
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,605
lt's a bomb!

746
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:04,157
You've got to get that box!

747
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:10,830
-This way.
-What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!

748
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,751
Oh, my God, you know how to
hot-wire a car? That's so hot!

749
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,003
Drive, drive, drive!
She's right there! She's right there!

750
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,881
Come on, come on, come on.

751
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,634
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car!

752
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,053
Now!

753
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,014
Tongue!

754
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,270
Oh, my God!

755
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,279
Kiss this, bitch!

756
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,536
Drive, drive, drive.

757
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,540
Okay, so what else
don't l know, all right?

758
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,334
Since you guys forgot to mention
some minor details.

759
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,048
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...

760
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,806
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Sam!

761
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,268
Sam!

762
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:19,983
-Sam!
-Hold on!

763
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,359
-Pull me up!
-Hold on!

764
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,571
Sam, get back in!

765
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,410
l don't want to die!
We're gonna die! Oh, my God!

766
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,603
Jesus! Jesus!

767
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,363
Come here, boy.

768
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,949
Closer.

769
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,868
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

770
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,370
You remember me, don't you?

771
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,873
l did what you said, okay?
Just don't hurt us.

772
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,291
Shut up!

773
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,293
Sam!

774
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:30,470
Yeah! Yes, yes.

775
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,098
lt feels good to grab your flesh!

776
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:40,104
l am going to kill you slowly, painfully,

777
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:44,817
but first, we have
some delicate work to do.

778
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,948
How l could snap your limbs off!

779
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:54,786
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.

780
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,748
l'll scan you.
Let's take a look at your face.

781
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:06,547
l'm the doctor. The odd job. lnformation!

782
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,926
Yeah!

783
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,811
Beseeching my shard!

784
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,729
Easy or tough way?

785
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,462
-There they are.
-That's what l'm seeing in my head.

786
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:50,424
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

787
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:54,637
We must have the brain on the table!

788
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,265
-Chop, chop!
-Brain?

789
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,599
What does he mean by my brain?

790
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:01,644
Well, you have something on your mind,
something l need.

791
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,646
Hold on. l know you're pissed.
l know you're pissed

792
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,648
because l tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

793
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,150
lf somebody tried to kill me,
l'd be upset, too.

794
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,819
l think that we have an opportunity here

795
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:13,030
to start anew
and develop our relationship

796
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,408
and see where it leads us, okay?

797
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,661
So, you just call Doctor lnspector off
and let's just talk for five seconds!

798
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,912
Wait, wait, wait!

799
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,921
-Come on! Go, go!
-Sam!

800
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:32,884
Go, go, go!

801
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,244
Sam!

802
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,128
Run!

803
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,637
Go, go, go, go!

804
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,972
Here he comes!

805
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,189
Hide, Sam!

806
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,326
Weak!

807
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:45,581
Puny! Waste of metal!

808
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,003
Junkyard crap!

809
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,298
Decepticons!

810
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,893
Come here, boy.

811
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:39,176
There is another source of
Energon hidden on this planet.

812
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,345
The boy could lead us to it.

813
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,226
Optimus!

814
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:05,786
ls the future of our race not worth
a single human life?

815
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,623
-Up! Get up!
-You'll never stop at one!

816
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:13,044
l'll take you all on!

817
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:52,917
Piece of tin!

818
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,587
Sam! Where are you?

819
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:00,466
No!

820
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,719
You're so weak!

821
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:32,164
The last Prime is dead!

822
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:45,302
Sam, run. Run.

823
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,273
Autobots, attack!

824
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,321
Bumblebee, get them out of here!

825
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,044
This is Lennox.

826
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:35,102
-That went well.
-We've lost the boy, Master.

827
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,646
The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.

828
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:42,026
l can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?

829
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,530
-One insect among seven billion!
-Shut up!

830
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,159
He could be anywhere.

831
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,704
Then we will force them
to find him for us!

832
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,416
lt's time for the world
to know of our presence.

833
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:00,628
No more disguises. No mercy!

834
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:04,632
The time has come
for my master's arrival.

835
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:13,933
Decepticons, mobilize. lt is time.

836
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,786
Speaking French is so exciting!

837
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,621
Oh, God, who is this?

838
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,292
Hello? l mean, bonsoir!

839
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,964
-What? Who is this?
-Where is the boy?

840
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:49,969
For Pete's sakes. l'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.

841
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:31,218
Jeez!

842
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,846
You are invading my space.
l'm gonna have to drop you.

843
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,139
Would you get out of here?

844
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,474
l didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.

845
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:38,851
l want to try new things.

846
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,353
Looks like Canadian goose poop.

847
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,064
lt's nasty.

848
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:59,682
Revenge is mine.

849
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:18,784
Yeah!

850
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,038
...definitely not a plane...

851
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:25,165
Look, carriers don't just sink.

852
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,377
...a horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...

853
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,713
Negative. NORAD confirmed,

854
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:35,092
projectile came from beyond our
atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots.

855
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,901
Citizens of the human hive,

856
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:56,363
your leaders have withheld the truth.

857
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:59,992
You are not alone in this universe.

858
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:03,787
We have lived among you, hidden,

859
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,499
but no more.

860
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:12,504
As you've seen,
we can destroy your cities at will,

861
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,634
unless you turn over this boy.

862
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:29,021
lf you resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.

863
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,190
What we're hearing
from the German government

864
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:34,318
is that the world broadcast
was a satellite hacking.

865
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:37,780
The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,

866
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,616
which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/11.

867
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,618
President Obama
is being flown to a bunker

868
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,369
somewhere in the middle
of the United States

869
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:48,916
in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.

870
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,379
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.

871
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:57,633
Worldwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,

872
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,426
but that number could climb.

873
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:00,552
lt's still too early to tell.

874
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:03,013
What we need to ask now is,
"Who and why?"

875
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:06,058
The FBl is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.

876
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,852
We believe they have information
about the attacks.

877
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:11,271
The FBl, ClA and lnterpol

878
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:14,691
are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcement.

879
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,902
You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.

880
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,613
-They have a traffic-camera spotting...
-They have a picture of me, man.

881
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:23,116
We're dead, bro.
FBl, ClA, we are wanted fugitives now!

882
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,409
l just need you to focus

883
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,494
-for one minute, man.
-Just stop.

884
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,079
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?

885
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,872
You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.

886
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,916
-Do you see this?
-What?

887
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:35,671
They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?

888
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:37,714
Okay, l'm not even with you guys!

889
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:40,133
Technically, l'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...

890
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,510
-Enough is...
-Yo, Leo!

891
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:43,971
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, l swear.

892
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:46,431
-That's 'cause you is a wuss.
-You guys forced me into that car, right?

893
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:47,516
l think he's scared.

894
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,102
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?

895
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,520
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

896
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,188
and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what l mean?

897
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:56,149
-Not in my trunk.
-Yo, bumper cars? l'm hearing you.

898
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:58,443
Okay? l'm right here and l can hear you!

899
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,696
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

900
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,322
l've had a hell of a day!

901
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,826
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

902
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,035
Go whine to your boyfriend!

903
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,371
Listen, Sam, l know what l'm gonna do,
man. Look, l'm just going to go

904
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,539
to the authorities and tell them the truth.

905
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:11,623
Like, l had nothing to do with this.

906
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,083
-So, l'm not an accomplice.
-Hey, you wanted this, right?

907
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,585
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.

908
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,044
Wake up! You're in the middle of it!

909
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,463
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.

910
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,049
Stop complaining.

911
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:58,837
What is the meaning of this?

912
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,048
You dare point a gun at me?

913
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:04,885
You want a piece of me?
l will tear you apart!

914
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,264
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!

915
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:10,807
-Tell them to lower their weapons!
-Tell them first.

916
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:11,934
Tell them to lower their weapons.

917
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:14,019
Major, there's nothing l can do.
Talk to him.

918
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,021
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.

919
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,024
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations

920
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,443
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

921
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,904
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

922
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,781
Well, l'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

923
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:28,367
and l will raise you
a President of the United States.

924
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:29,910
l have operational command now.

925
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,204
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

926
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,914
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

927
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,041
The secret is out!

928
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,586
This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,

929
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,588
with a coordinated military strategy.

930
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:44,633
This fool is terribly misinformed.

931
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,093
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.

932
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,886
What we need is to draw up battle plans

933
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:50,138
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.

934
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,723
Like what, handing over the kid?

935
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,893
All options are being considered.

936
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,439
Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.

937
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:02,609
-There is no negotiating with them.
-l'm ordering you to stand down.

938
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:06,780
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base!

939
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:10,075
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.

940
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,619
Let's go!

941
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:17,791
l really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.

942
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,377
Autobots, report to hangar for transport.

943
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:25,716
-lronhide, we should leave this planet.
-That's not what Optimus would want.

944
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,987
There's nothing
that you could have done.

945
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,702
-You okay?
-Yeah.

946
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:59,708
Bee, if you hate me, l understand.

947
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:10,677
l messed up. l'm sorry.

948
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:16,600
Young fella, you are the person
l care about most in my life.

949
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:19,770
lf there's anything you need,
l won't be far away.

950
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:25,734
He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead.

951
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,904
There's some things
you just can't change.

952
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:33,158
So, his sacrifice for us would
not have been in vain. Hallelujah!

953
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:36,745
l'm gonna make it right.
l'm going to turn myself in.

954
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,997
We... We've got to stick together.

955
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:47,339
-You're not going to do that.
-Yes, l am.

956
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:55,180
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!

957
01:13:57,809 --> 01:13:59,976
-You two...
-Huh?

958
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,186
Hey, you know the glyphs?

959
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,730
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?

960
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:08,527
That's old school, yo.
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.

961
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,153
That's some serious stuff, right there.

962
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:13,281
They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.

963
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:14,783
Like a map to an Energon source!

964
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:18,120
-Can you read this?
-Read?

965
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,497
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.

966
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,624
lf you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can.

967
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,334
Look who came sashaying back!

968
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,002
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.

969
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:27,921
l had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

970
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,131
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

971
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:31,091
l think l'm allowed that,
considering what l've been through.

972
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:32,801
l heard you have a problem.

973
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,887
-l think l know someone who can help.
-Who?

974
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,139
Robo-Warrior.

975
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:41,935
This guy, Robo-Warrior,

976
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,396
everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

977
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:45,856
One time we revenge-hacked his site

978
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:50,360
and maybe l saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.

979
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,749
This is it. Yep.

980
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,001
Deli. Good front!

981
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,920
All right, wait here.
l'll give you the go/no go. All right?

982
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:12,090
Number 42, we got your kishka, knish,

983
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:15,302
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.

984
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:16,720
Cash only. Who's next?

985
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:20,098
l told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.

986
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:21,766
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

987
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,351
You... You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!

988
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:24,769
l'm like a ninja with a blade.
lt's an art form.

989
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,062
Give me your money. Get out of here!

990
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:30,066
Hey, Sal! Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.

991
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,068
Robo-Warrior.

992
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,947
-Know him?
-l never heard of him.

993
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:38,366
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal.com?

994
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,994
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation

995
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:44,206
-with Game Boy-level security.
-Robo-Warrior.

996
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,168
lt's him! lt's him!
That's the guy right there! That's him!

997
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,670
No.

998
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:53,548
-You got to be kidding me.
-All right, meat store's closed!

999
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:56,009
-Everybody out! Out, right now!
-When he says to go,

1000
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:57,677
-you go.
-That means you, lady, right now.

1001
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,888
-Wait a minute. You know this guy?
-We're old friends.

1002
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:03,433
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven,

1003
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:04,851
got the kibosh, disbanded.

1004
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:08,188
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1005
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:11,233
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1006
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:15,612
-Look at her now, so mature.
-Moron! Where's the whitefish?

1007
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,572
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.

1008
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:19,241
-Yakov!
-What?

1009
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,368
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around!

1010
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:23,245
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1011
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,538
-lt's my dream.
-Help her out.

1012
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:27,207
You live with your mama?

1013
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,625
No, my mama lives with me.
lt's a big difference.

1014
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,585
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

1015
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,046
-Yeah, l know.
-And NBE One's still kicking, huh?

1016
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,298
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1017
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:37,759
l don't know what you're hiding,
but l don't want anything to do with it.

1018
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,595
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
l got bagels to schmear. Vanish.

1019
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,139
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on, l need your help.

1020
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,809
Really? You need my help?

1021
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,520
l need...
Look, l am slowly losing my mind.

1022
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,230
Okay, l had a little crab-bot,

1023
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,440
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1024
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:55,360
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

1025
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,196
And on top of that, l'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1026
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,448
You said it projected images
off your brain?

1027
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,118
-Right.
-Meat locker, now!

1028
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,120
Dead pigs.

1029
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,372
What you're about to see is top secret.

1030
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,166
Do not tell my mother.

1031
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:13,295
-Swine flu. Not good.
-Now you know.

1032
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,298
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.

1033
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:17,674
Sad little story.

1034
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:18,967
An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?

1035
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,093
Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?

1036
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:23,346
Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1037
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,641
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1038
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:29,352
Okay, Cube-brain.

1039
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:32,188
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1040
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:33,648
Where'd you get these?

1041
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:37,360
Before l got fired,
l poached S-7's crown jewel,

1042
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:42,824
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1043
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:46,870
The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.

1044
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,413
How do l know?

1045
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,374
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1046
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:53,710
in ancient ruins all over the world.

1047
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,212
China. Egypt. Greece.

1048
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,757
Shot in 1932.

1049
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,675
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1050
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,345
-Yeah.
-Same ones over here, right?

1051
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:08,224
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1052
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,228
Aliens. And l think some of them stayed.

1053
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:15,273
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1054
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:20,195
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.

1055
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:23,573
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1056
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:27,202
l pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1057
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:30,789
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,

1058
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,333
that l was obsessed.

1059
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,210
Me. Can you imagine that?

1060
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:38,380
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1061
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:40,340
-On Earth. Another source?
-On Earth.

1062
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:43,301
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.

1063
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,136
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1064
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,554
No, no, no, the source is before them.

1065
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,431
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.

1066
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:49,599
lt's before them.

1067
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,684
-So, it comes before them.
-Correct.

1068
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:55,146
Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1069
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,315
l mean,
l'm not on speaking terms with them.

1070
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,109
Actually, l am.

1071
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:05,156
Let me out!

1072
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,492
-This is going to be a little bit sad.
-Open it.

1073
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,329
l will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1074
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:12,914
Hey, behave!

1075
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,791
-What is it, a Decepticon?
-Yeah.

1076
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,668
-And you're training him?
-l'm trying to.

1077
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:20,255
l spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

1078
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:23,675
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1079
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,719
Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic 'fro-head?

1080
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:29,973
l'm sorry.
l'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

1081
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:33,184
but, if you're a good boy,
then l'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1082
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,686
Okay? l'm not gonna torch it.

1083
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:38,189
Just tell me
what these symbols are, please.

1084
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,316
All right.

1085
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,696
l know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1086
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,283
l don't read it, but these guys...

1087
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,869
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1088
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:54,747
-ls this they?
-Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.

1089
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:58,418
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. l don't know what.

1090
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:02,005
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll
translate those symbols for you.

1091
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,424
-And l know where to find them.
-Show us.

1092
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:05,842
Yeah.

1093
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,556
The closest one's in Washington.

1094
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:18,897
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
Land of dreams in there.

1095
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,608
All l ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1096
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,653
-Hold those.
-What is that?

1097
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,698
What? l wear them when l'm in a funk.

1098
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:33,244
So does Giambi, Jeter.
lt's a baseball thing. Okay.

1099
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,705
Watches synchronized,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1100
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,791
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1101
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:40,627
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1102
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:43,004
lt's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1103
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,797
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1104
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,633
Okay. Now, let's get this show
on the road.

1105
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:49,177
No, listen, l can't do this.

1106
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,179
l'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
l'm not gonna do this.

1107
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,848
-Guards have guns. l don't want to die.
-Kid, kid, kid.

1108
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:56,851
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1109
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:59,479
Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.

1110
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:01,814
The museum is now closing.

1111
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:04,817
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro!
Ran out of toilet paper!

1112
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,194
You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.

1113
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:09,280
Sir! l suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed!

1114
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,783
Listen, man, l understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1115
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,785
All right? Thumper dumper.
l got to go. All right.

1116
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,788
Sir, you are a grown,
naked man around children.

1117
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,791
-Pull your pants up and exit the building.
-l'm not going anywhere.

1118
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:27,173
-You got that paper, right, sir?
-You should be embarrassed.

1119
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:29,384
This is a family museum, sir.

1120
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:48,903
What is going on here?

1121
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:53,449
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?

1122
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:55,743
You are an amateur, man,
a rank amateur.

1123
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,833
We just downed five guards.
Five guards.

1124
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,585
-Get your stuff and get out of here.
-Give me a second here.

1125
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:05,378
l got to get the tracker, all right.

1126
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,880
-Be good.
-l'm claustrophobic.

1127
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:28,109
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.
He knows where he's going.

1128
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:34,991
-He knows something.
-What?

1129
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,117
He knows something.

1130
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,124
You got what l got?

1131
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,834
-Yeah.
-Blackbird.

1132
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,422
There he is.

1133
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:53,134
This guy's a legend,
like the Chairman of the Board!

1134
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:57,430
Yo, freshman, point the shard
and watch the magic happen.

1135
01:23:04,772 --> 01:23:06,564
Shit. lt's a Decepticon!

1136
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,025
-Decepticon?
-Decepticon?

1137
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:11,152
Behind the MiG now!

1138
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:26,459
What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?

1139
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,837
Answer me, pawns and knaves!

1140
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:33,257
Show yourselves
or suffer my infinite wrath!

1141
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:37,387
You little spinal-cord-based organisms!

1142
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:39,764
Bugger it!

1143
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:44,769
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!

1144
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,230
Prepare for remote systems override!

1145
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:49,857
-l tell you, this guy did not age well.
-l don't think he's gonna hurt us.

1146
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:52,235
l command these doors to open.

1147
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:56,280
Fire! l said, fire!

1148
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:58,491
Bollocks!

1149
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:02,161
-Damn these worthless parts.
-Wait a second!

1150
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:05,581
ltchy, wretched rust in my arse!

1151
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,836
The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.

1152
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,587
We gotta catch that plane.

1153
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:18,928
-Right. l'm on a mission.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1154
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,847
-What do you want?
-Look, we just want to talk!

1155
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:22,724
l have no time to talk. l'm on a mission.

1156
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:26,018
l'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am l on?

1157
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:27,478
-Earth.
-Earth?

1158
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:32,608
Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."

1159
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:36,112
Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?

1160
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,864
-Who's winning?
-The Decepticons.

1161
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:42,326
-Well, l changed sides to the Autobots.
-What do you mean, changed sides?

1162
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,913
lt's a choice.
lt's an intensely personal decision.

1163
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:49,667
So much negativity.
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

1164
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:50,752
You mean you don't have to work

1165
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:52,545
for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1166
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:56,174
lf Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.

1167
01:24:56,467 --> 01:24:59,051
l'm changing sides. l'm changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.

1168
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,304
-Who's your little Autobot?
-You're cute.

1169
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:04,432
Name's Wheelie. Yeah.
Say my name, say my name.

1170
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,768
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1171
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:07,935
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1172
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,980
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.

1173
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:13,608
Can you just... Can you stop?

1174
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,109
-Hey, what are you doing?
-lt's just something

1175
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:17,069
to think about. l won't argue with...
What were you saying?

1176
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:21,240
l told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.

1177
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:24,410
-Somebody shit the bed this morning.
-l have issues of my own.

1178
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:25,995
And it started with my mother!

1179
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,539
My ancestors
have been here for centuries.

1180
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,584
My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.

1181
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:33,920
-Do you know what he transformed into?
-No.

1182
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:35,046
Nothing!

1183
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,800
But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!

1184
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:46,641
Bollocks.

1185
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,227
My boosters are fried.

1186
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:52,396
l think we can help each other.

1187
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:55,358
You know things l don't know.
l know things you don't know, l do.

1188
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:57,860
l don't think he knows anything.
Honestly, l don't.

1189
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,989
l could do this all day.
lt comes in waves, these vivid symbols.

1190
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:04,992
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind

1191
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,953
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.

1192
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:10,248
-Him and someone called The Fallen.
-The Fallen? l know him.

1193
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:13,584
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.

1194
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:17,505
He's terrible to work for.
lt's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

1195
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,590
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,

1196
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:20,675
The Fallen's search.

1197
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:24,303
l remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.

1198
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:26,514
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?

1199
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:31,060
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody!
Stay still or you'll die!

1200
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,046
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1201
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,756
l just hope we're still on the right planet.

1202
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,800
Hey, that freaking hurt!

1203
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:05,469
Oh, my God.

1204
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,978
Oh, God.

1205
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,359
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.

1206
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:24,405
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.

1207
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:26,115
Please, get off.

1208
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:29,493
God, my balls.

1209
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:31,954
Sam!

1210
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,167
-Where are we? Simmons!
-Hey! Yeah!

1211
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:41,255
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What is this? lt's Vegas.

1212
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,132
-You guys okay?
-Yeah.

1213
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,718
Hey, l think we're in Vegas!

1214
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:49,430
That really, really hurt.
You're just lucky that l didn't get hurt!

1215
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:52,141
People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if l would have gotten hurt,

1216
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,185
-you would have heard...
-Shut up.

1217
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:58,564
l told you l was opening a space bridge.
lt's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1218
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:01,484
When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.

1219
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,319
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1220
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:07,990
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!

1221
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:09,742
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

1222
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:10,993
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1223
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:13,746
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?

1224
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:17,291
This planet was visited
by our race once before,

1225
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:20,127
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

1226
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:23,089
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1227
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:25,758
the lifeblood of our race.

1228
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:30,680
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!

1229
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:34,684
Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?

1230
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:37,728
Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?

1231
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:43,693
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.

1232
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:48,656
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1233
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:52,910
lt harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1234
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,704
-Destroy suns?
-You mean blow them up?

1235
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:56,664
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

1236
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:59,875
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

1237
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:04,088
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1238
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:10,177
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

1239
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:13,180
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1240
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:17,476
And his name forevermore
was The Fallen.

1241
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,605
He despised the human race

1242
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:26,944
and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1243
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:31,073
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1244
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:34,285
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1245
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:44,962
A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.

1246
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:52,219
The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,

1247
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:58,100
so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.

1248
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:03,564
ln the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1249
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:06,817
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,

1250
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:10,446
a tomb we cannot find.

1251
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:17,578
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1252
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,705
The Fallen knows where it is

1253
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:25,377
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1254
01:30:25,796 --> 01:30:27,421
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1255
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,882
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen.

1256
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,509
Optimus Prime?

1257
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,097
So, you've met a Prime?

1258
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:39,266
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1259
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:42,436
ls he alive, here on this planet?

1260
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,439
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1261
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,399
So, he's dead.

1262
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:51,570
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen.

1263
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:55,616
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1264
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,327
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1265
01:30:58,411 --> 01:30:59,453
and bring him back to life?

1266
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:04,250
lt was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1267
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:08,254
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1268
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:11,507
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols.

1269
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:14,218
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.

1270
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:19,515
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1271
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:21,559
Find the doorway!

1272
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,519
Go now! Go!

1273
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:26,522
That was my mission.
lt's your mission now.

1274
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:30,901
Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you.

1275
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:38,784
Okay, here's what my ClA contact says.

1276
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:42,371
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf ofAqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

1277
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:44,331
-That's the Dagger's Tip.
-lt's part of the Red Sea.

1278
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:46,625
lt divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1279
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:50,546
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.

1280
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,007
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1281
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:55,509
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1282
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:56,760
l'm gonna make a call.

1283
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:00,973
We got cops!

1284
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:08,355
l can't go to prison, guys.

1285
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,904
Sam, we got to get off this road
and lay low.

1286
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:27,333
Man, stupid cops!

1287
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:29,585
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.

1288
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:33,464
-Shut up or l'll blend my fist in your face.
-They're gone.

1289
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,217
Okay, we're running out of time.
l gotta make the call to Lennox...

1290
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:37,593
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.

1291
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:40,346
Try calling one base,
they'll track you here in seconds.

1292
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,015
-ClA is all over this place!
-You're gonna call.

1293
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,148
-Okay. That's a good idea.
-All right.

1294
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:53,692
l mean, l just had my mind
on other things,

1295
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:55,194
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.

1296
01:32:57,948 --> 01:33:00,282
NEST departure, 2100 hours.

1297
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:05,371
So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.

1298
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:13,003
Major Lennox, phone call.

1299
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:16,840
Lennox, l'm with the kid. The kid. You
know, the one with the attitude, right?

1300
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:18,509
We need the truck. The truck.

1301
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:21,345
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1302
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:25,683
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.

1303
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:27,351
Back of a $1 bill.

1304
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:34,108
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.

1305
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,860
Oh, my God. l got to go. Okay.
Heat comes.

1306
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:38,529
Wait, who are you?

1307
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:42,199
Wait. lt's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.

1308
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:43,367
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!

1309
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,244
Move, move, move, move.

1310
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:50,124
Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1311
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,668
Tip of the Red Sea.
Gulf ofAqaba.

1312
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:55,296
Egypt? Are you serious?

1313
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:58,048
Sir.

1314
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:05,139
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,

1315
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:07,891
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?

1316
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:11,353
Look, l don't know,
but we got to trust him.

1317
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:14,982
Okay, let's go over it again.

1318
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:17,276
When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,

1319
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,653
-the Three Kings...
-Will reveal the doorway.

1320
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:21,488
That's what he said.
You know what it means?

1321
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:23,157
-No, what does it mean?
-l have no idea.

1322
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:24,992
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.

1323
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:26,535
l don't have my passport.

1324
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:30,247
Passport!

1325
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:39,214
They got cameras at the top.

1326
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:46,597
All right, chill. This is espionage time.
l can handle it.

1327
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,767
These are my people.
l'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.

1328
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:54,188
Great, a fricking Munchkin.

1329
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:56,690
Little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1330
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:08,369
The Dagger's Tip? Right?

1331
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:10,954
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.

1332
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,291
Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son,

1333
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:18,045
my other son, my daughter.
We're tourists, from New York.

1334
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,005
-New York?
-Yes. Yes.

1335
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,090
Fifty kilometers.

1336
01:35:21,174 --> 01:35:23,550
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.

1337
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:25,803
-l know. l know you from somewhere.
-Go, Yankees!

1338
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:27,721
Put it on the wire to the ClA.

1339
01:35:32,102 --> 01:35:36,814
Decepticons, boy's location detected.

1340
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:48,742
Undercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.

1341
01:35:48,827 --> 01:35:51,203
You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.

1342
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:02,381
Awesome! l think aliens built that.

1343
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,425
Yeah, yeah.

1344
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,510
Come on. Move it! Move it!

1345
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:08,720
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?

1346
01:36:08,805 --> 01:36:11,890
Yeah, some of us got work to do!
Dumb Autobots.

1347
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:36,582
Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health.

1348
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:41,545
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.

1349
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:43,547
-Do they?
-Yeah.

1350
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:48,552
You might as well just say it.

1351
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,095
Ladies first.

1352
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:54,266
Okay, so tonight you're going to be
a gentleman.

1353
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:57,478
-You're really chivalrous.
-Why are you mad at me?

1354
01:36:57,562 --> 01:37:01,064
You know what?
Baby, l'm not... l'm not mad.

1355
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:06,653
Do you realize that l just flew 3,000
miles to keep you from getting killed?

1356
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:07,946
l know.

1357
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:13,952
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?

1358
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:16,747
Look at the things l go through with you.

1359
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:19,541
And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars

1360
01:37:19,626 --> 01:37:21,835
and the three most beautiful pyramids
on the planet

1361
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,254
and you still can't even tell me that
you love me.

1362
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:26,715
Pyramids.

1363
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:29,343
What? Why do boys always

1364
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:31,386
-change the subject?
-Pyramids and stars.

1365
01:37:31,471 --> 01:37:32,930
-Sam?
-Come with me really quick.

1366
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,190
Simmons! Leo! Wake up!

1367
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,779
Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?

1368
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:51,532
No. l was only in college for two days.
Remember that?

1369
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,784
-Here. Get up. Up, up.
-What is he talking about?

1370
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,207
Okay, you see those three stars?

1371
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,042
You see
how the last one touches the horizon?

1372
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:04,878
That's Orion's belt,
but it's also called the Three Kings.

1373
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:06,755
And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings

1374
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:09,633
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,

1375
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:11,552
so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.

1376
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:15,097
They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.

1377
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:29,403
We've had an engine malfunction.

1378
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:31,446
We're gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.

1379
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:33,615
Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.

1380
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,159
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?

1381
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:39,162
-All right, team, grab your chutes!
-Bailout like bailout?

1382
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:44,209
-You familiar with the standard MC-4?
-Of course not!

1383
01:38:44,294 --> 01:38:46,587
l've neverjumped out of
a perfectly good airplane before!

1384
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:48,046
Wait a minute, is this really happening?

1385
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:49,923
-Yeah.
-All right, here we go.

1386
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:54,595
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?

1387
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:56,305
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.

1388
01:38:56,389 --> 01:39:00,267
These guys don't mess around.
This is just standard procedure.

1389
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:03,520
l'm just following orders to the letter.
lsn't that what you said?

1390
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:07,232
You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.

1391
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:13,447
What was that? What was that?

1392
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:15,866
That's not good. Come on.

1393
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:18,368
-Right this way!
-l can't jump out of an airplane!

1394
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,495
-l have an ulcer! No, no.
-Come on. lt's okay.

1395
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:23,123
l really can't do this.
What are you doing...

1396
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,709
Come here! Come here.

1397
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:30,047
-Why aren't you wearing your chute?
-Because l have to secure the VlPs first.

1398
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:34,343
Okay, l want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that l say.

1399
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:37,387
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

1400
01:39:37,472 --> 01:39:39,598
Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,

1401
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:41,808
which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed.

1402
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:43,977
-Okay, are you listening?
-l can't hear what...

1403
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:45,479
-Stop that!
-All right. All right.

1404
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:48,023
All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,

1405
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:50,275
it pulls the pin
and opens the main.

1406
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,402
Red's your backup, blue's your primary.

1407
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:56,657
l want you to pull the blue.
l need you to pull it really hard!

1408
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:59,576
Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass!

1409
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:05,499
-He say good-bye?
-No, he didn't even say good-bye.

1410
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:07,751
General, we're loaded and ready.

1411
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:10,712
You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.

1412
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:13,632
-Excellent.
-Sir, you need to see this now.

1413
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,345
-Have we checked these coordinates?
-Egypt, sir.

1414
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:21,181
-They're airdropping in.
-You've got to be kidding me.

1415
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:22,683
He knows something.

1416
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:25,102
We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.

1417
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:27,521
Copy that.

1418
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:30,107
ClA just got a hit on the boy,

1419
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,693
100 miles from the location
on that little note there.

1420
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:33,860
lt's getting hotter.

1421
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:40,951
lt's gotta be around here somewhere.

1422
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:04,182
You see the size of this?

1423
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:07,310
-You see this?
-Spectacular.

1424
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,440
Amazing. Look at that.

1425
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,994
-lt's here somewhere, guys.
-Yeah, why?

1426
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:25,620
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird

1427
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:27,205
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?

1428
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:31,293
ln his defense, this is the biggest
doorway l've ever seen in my entire life.

1429
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:35,589
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, all right?

1430
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:37,257
Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys,

1431
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:38,759
that archeologists
have been here before?

1432
01:41:38,843 --> 01:41:39,926
There's nothing here.

1433
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:42,387
Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.

1434
01:41:42,472 --> 01:41:44,598
Sometimes you get to
the end of the rainbow

1435
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:46,850
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!

1436
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:49,311
l'm listening to you?
You live with your mother!

1437
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,606
-lt's not over.
-lt is over. lt's done.

1438
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,191
Why are we still listening to you,
little punk-ass?

1439
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:56,318
l mean, what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?

1440
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:58,361
Killed Megatron. How about that?

1441
01:41:58,446 --> 01:41:59,488
Well, he didn't get the job done,

1442
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:01,114
you know what l mean,
'cause he's back now...

1443
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:04,117
-Are you scared?
-Scared? Scared of your ugly face!

1444
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:06,620
l'm ugly?
Well, we're twins, you stupid genius!

1445
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:08,455
Bring it, then! Get off me!

1446
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:11,625
-l'll change your face around!
-l'll get all up in that ass!

1447
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:13,126
Bring it!

1448
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:15,045
Guys!

1449
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:17,964
-You like the way that feels?
-That didn't hurt.

1450
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,591
You like that, don't you?

1451
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:22,052
-Come on, Bumblebee!
-Bumblebee, listen.

1452
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:29,726
Now, that's rude.

1453
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:43,657
Oh, my God. The symbols.

1454
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:46,743
Bee! Shoot it.

1455
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:15,272
-Check this out.
-Look at it.

1456
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:17,524
Wow!

1457
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:20,110
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.

1458
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:22,571
The tomb of the Primes.

1459
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:26,783
Yo!

1460
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:42,132
The Matrix.

1461
01:43:59,692 --> 01:44:03,278
No.

1462
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:08,199
Thousands of years, turned to dust.

1463
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:10,785
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

1464
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:12,037
Hear that?

1465
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:18,960
US Air Force! C-17s!

1466
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:21,755
-What's a C-17?
-You can't bring him back, Sam.

1467
01:44:21,839 --> 01:44:25,425
-There's nothing left.
-Look! Look around you.

1468
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:28,094
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,

1469
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:29,596
to just have it end like this.

1470
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,348
There is a reason that we are here.

1471
01:44:31,432 --> 01:44:35,310
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.

1472
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:43,485
Everyone's after me
because of what l know,

1473
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:48,990
and what l know is that
this is going to work.

1474
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:52,494
-How do you know it's gonna work?
-Because l believe it.

1475
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:04,881
You best let me out of this plane.

1476
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:18,520
Dropping the big boy. Sam!

1477
01:45:25,653 --> 01:45:27,904
You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?

1478
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:29,572
Absolutely. Let's go.

1479
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:40,875
Go!

1480
01:45:41,711 --> 01:45:44,421
Let's move it.
Remember, they're friendlies.

1481
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:56,599
Cover Optimus!

1482
01:45:59,562 --> 01:46:01,646
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1483
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:03,857
l need snipers and Stingers up high.

1484
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:08,069
So, we just dropped off10 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.

1485
01:46:08,154 --> 01:46:09,779
l hope this little kid know
what he's doing.

1486
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:10,905
Yeah, me too.

1487
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:20,081
Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks!

1488
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:24,711
Pop flare!

1489
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:29,591
-That's them, right there. See the flare?
-Right over there! See it?

1490
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:41,811
Sam!

1491
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:55,700
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.

1492
01:46:55,785 --> 01:46:57,410
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.

1493
01:46:57,495 --> 01:46:58,912
Shut this guy up, huh?

1494
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:01,414
-Please, just let me live, just let me live!
-Shut up and let him drive!

1495
01:47:01,499 --> 01:47:02,791
-Just stop screaming...
-All right, that's it!

1496
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:06,961
l can't take that guy anymore.

1497
01:47:20,226 --> 01:47:22,310
Hide in the dust! Use the dust!

1498
01:47:29,902 --> 01:47:31,861
We've got to split up.
Bumblebee, you're the decoy.

1499
01:47:31,946 --> 01:47:34,614
You lead the Decepticons away,
all right? l'm gonna get Optimus.

1500
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:37,242
l'll help draw their fire
with Huey and Dewey there.

1501
01:47:37,326 --> 01:47:39,369
You get to those soldiers.

1502
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:43,540
-l hope that dust works, kid.
-Thank you.

1503
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:50,797
He's turning around. He's coming back.
He's coming back.

1504
01:47:51,549 --> 01:47:52,590
lt's up to me.

1505
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:55,552
One man, alone,
betrayed by the country he loves,

1506
01:47:55,636 --> 01:47:58,138
now its last hope
in their final hour of need.

1507
01:47:58,222 --> 01:48:01,891
Prepare to be driven like never before,
by the maestro.

1508
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:04,978
-Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere! Drive.
-You'll never make it, kid.

1509
01:48:05,062 --> 01:48:07,522
-l'm coming with you.
-Bravery will only get you so far.

1510
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:10,525
You tased me, okay? You owe me!
l'm going.

1511
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:12,402
Okay, okay. That was a test.
You passed. All right?

1512
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:24,122
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.
That ain't Air Force.

1513
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:30,378
-What the hell was that?
-Anyone copy?

1514
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:32,505
-Anyone there? Who's up?
-Copy?

1515
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:34,883
-Radio's down.
-lt's dead. Comms are down.

1516
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:36,301
EMP burst.

1517
01:48:36,677 --> 01:48:39,554
l see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1518
01:48:41,307 --> 01:48:42,348
Yes, sir?

1519
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:45,268
-Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
-l know, sir.

1520
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:48,188
Well, what country am l in right now?

1521
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:49,522
United States.

1522
01:48:49,607 --> 01:48:53,526
No, not the United States.
l'm from the United States.

1523
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:56,279
l'm in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.

1524
01:48:56,363 --> 01:49:01,201
Well, that was our good friend,
Galloway. He's less than pleased.

1525
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:03,953
How is it that we can't reach our men,

1526
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:09,417
but he can reach me,
from some random Egyptian desert?

1527
01:49:13,422 --> 01:49:14,672
Nothing.

1528
01:49:15,257 --> 01:49:18,134
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in
the sky know we need some help.

1529
01:49:18,219 --> 01:49:20,220
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, boys, old school time!

1530
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:22,972
Pop some more flares
so the kid can find us.

1531
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:32,190
Look. There it is.
We got a couple of miles.

1532
01:49:32,858 --> 01:49:37,695
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1533
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:43,159
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1534
01:49:43,244 --> 01:49:45,912
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1535
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:48,373
Our satellites in the area have
gone blind. We're working it, sir.

1536
01:49:48,457 --> 01:49:52,085
Damn it. Something's not right.
lt doesn't add up.

1537
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:55,588
Contact the Jordanians, see
what air assets they've got in the area,

1538
01:49:55,673 --> 01:49:58,049
and get Egypt's General Salam.

1539
01:49:58,133 --> 01:50:02,011
Ask him to clear some USV overflights
in Egyptian airspace.

1540
01:50:02,096 --> 01:50:05,181
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1541
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:07,016
Scramble Predators now.

1542
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:08,601
V-1, rotate.

1543
01:50:20,656 --> 01:50:22,490
We still have a mile that way.

1544
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:29,539
Come on.

1545
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:34,210
This way. This way.

1546
01:50:38,841 --> 01:50:42,176
-One man, alone...
-Stop saying that!

1547
01:50:42,261 --> 01:50:43,511
...betrayed by the country he loves!

1548
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:45,805
Oh, my goodness.
l'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.

1549
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:48,975
Just relax. You're with the maestro.

1550
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:59,694
l don't think he's still following us.

1551
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:02,363
That's what you think.

1552
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:22,967
Master, sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

1553
01:51:23,052 --> 01:51:26,095
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1554
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:28,389
The boy must have the Matrix.

1555
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:31,434
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1556
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:35,772
Decepticons, begin our assault!

1557
01:51:36,482 --> 01:51:38,107
We've got incoming!

1558
01:51:54,249 --> 01:51:57,168
We got a whole lot of fight
coming our way.

1559
01:51:57,252 --> 01:51:59,253
-How many?
-About 13 of them.

1560
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:02,006
This ain't good. This ain't good.

1561
01:52:10,224 --> 01:52:12,433
We're about to get our asses whupped.

1562
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,353
Bravo-Charlie, kneel!

1563
01:52:15,437 --> 01:52:18,314
All right, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1564
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:22,610
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life,

1565
01:52:22,694 --> 01:52:25,571
so our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1566
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:28,449
All right, we're gonna draw fire
from the left flank. l need a scout team.

1567
01:52:28,534 --> 01:52:29,575
l'm leading.

1568
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:32,078
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and lronhide!

1569
01:52:32,162 --> 01:52:33,704
All right, when you see
the precious cargo,

1570
01:52:33,789 --> 01:52:36,541
l want you to pop green smoke and
come back through those pillars.

1571
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:39,836
We'll have the ambush set. All right.
Let's go. Move out!

1572
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:51,347
You ever see that film
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?

1573
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:56,018
-With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
-No, why?

1574
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:02,108
-Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
-ls that good?

1575
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:05,862
A lot of people died.

1576
01:53:24,089 --> 01:53:25,256
Hide!

1577
01:53:26,717 --> 01:53:28,801
-Vámonos, amigos!
-Oh, my God!

1578
01:53:33,223 --> 01:53:34,724
-Hit the deck!
-Oh, my God!

1579
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:51,908
Sam, Sam.

1580
01:53:52,993 --> 01:53:55,036
l don't think they saw us.

1581
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:57,413
Get down. Get down. Get down.

1582
01:53:57,789 --> 01:53:59,373
Okay. Listen.

1583
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:04,587
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus
as fast as we can, okay?

1584
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:07,423
What if it doesn't work?

1585
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:09,842
lt's gonna work.

1586
01:54:09,927 --> 01:54:12,929
-What if it doesn't?
-lt's gonna work. lt'll work.

1587
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:50,818
Up, up, up!

1588
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:02,455
Get ready to jump!

1589
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:23,976
We got a half-mile. l don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1590
01:56:26,688 --> 01:56:28,022
Fall back!

1591
01:56:28,106 --> 01:56:31,525
-lronhide, up the middle!
-lronhide, move it!

1592
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:33,611
Let's go! Go, go!

1593
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:42,203
Devastator!

1594
01:56:44,665 --> 01:56:46,582
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go.
We're gonna die.

1595
01:56:46,667 --> 01:56:48,918
lf we're going out, we're going out
like men, understand?

1596
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:21,534
Look at this mother...

1597
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:23,285
Mean robots suck!

1598
01:57:33,922 --> 01:57:36,507
Hang on! Hang on, okay?

1599
01:57:41,638 --> 01:57:43,431
-Simmons!
-Don't let go!

1600
01:57:43,515 --> 01:57:45,975
Hang in there, l got you! Just hang in.

1601
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,480
l don't want to die!

1602
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,276
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!

1603
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:56,610
You ain't getting me!

1604
01:58:01,032 --> 01:58:03,325
He dead. He got so ate.

1605
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:06,579
-Who's your daddy now, huh?
-He got all ate up.

1606
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:08,789
The only safe place is right under it.

1607
01:58:08,874 --> 01:58:12,543
-Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
-Yeah.

1608
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:22,762
You should've never eaten me!
l'm gonna bust your face up!

1609
01:58:27,768 --> 01:58:28,934
Oh, my God!

1610
01:58:31,688 --> 01:58:34,190
Nobody mess with me! ln your face!

1611
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:36,776
Keep fighting, Mudflap!

1612
01:58:37,694 --> 01:58:39,028
Oh, my God!

1613
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:47,369
Nobody messes with the twins.

1614
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:52,583
l got you... My bad!

1615
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:57,379
Man! You shot me in the face!

1616
01:58:57,839 --> 01:59:00,132
-Stay under it!
-Yeah, stay under it!

1617
01:59:04,095 --> 01:59:05,387
Come on.

1618
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:22,571
Judy!

1619
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:29,745
-Sam! Sam!
-What?

1620
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:32,706
Sam! Sam!

1621
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:38,420
Sam!

1622
01:59:38,505 --> 01:59:39,839
-Sam!
-Dad!

1623
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:48,973
Wait, wait!

1624
01:59:50,225 --> 01:59:53,727
Please listen to me!
l want you to run! Run!

1625
01:59:53,812 --> 01:59:56,522
Dad, just stop!
They don't want you, they want me!

1626
01:59:56,606 --> 01:59:58,065
-Oh, God!
-Wait!

1627
01:59:58,149 --> 02:00:00,025
Sam Witwicky.

1628
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:04,405
Don't hurt them. This is what you want.
You don't want them.

1629
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:06,156
-Go! Go!
-Please, stop!

1630
02:00:06,241 --> 02:00:07,408
-Stop!
-Listen to your father!

1631
02:00:07,492 --> 02:00:09,285
Just get out of here!

1632
02:00:09,619 --> 02:00:11,996
Just don't hurt them.
l know what you want.

1633
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,581
Just go! Just go!

1634
02:00:13,665 --> 02:00:17,459
And l know that you need me
because l know about the Matrix.

1635
02:00:18,086 --> 02:00:19,628
-Don't do it, Sam...
-Please, Dad.

1636
02:00:19,713 --> 02:00:23,674
-They're going to kill us all anyway!
-Here's what you want, right here.

1637
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:25,467
Bumblebee!

1638
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:40,316
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.

1639
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,856
-Stay tight, Ma.
-Come on. Get in here.

1640
02:01:34,746 --> 02:01:36,538
-Bee?
-Yeah.

1641
02:01:40,043 --> 02:01:41,126
-Hey!
-l don't know

1642
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:43,170
what's going on, but we've got to move!

1643
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:49,218
There's got to be a way out of here!

1644
02:01:50,553 --> 02:01:52,596
Judy, get back, get back, get back.

1645
02:01:53,807 --> 02:01:56,809
Against the wall! Against the wall!
Against the wall. Against the wall.

1646
02:01:58,186 --> 02:02:00,187
Bee! Bumblebee!

1647
02:02:01,064 --> 02:02:03,023
You get them somewhere safe,
all right?

1648
02:02:05,402 --> 02:02:06,527
You've got to get in the car
and get to safety.

1649
02:02:06,611 --> 02:02:08,487
No, this isn't up for discussion!

1650
02:02:08,571 --> 02:02:10,447
-You're my son! You're my son!
-l know.

1651
02:02:10,532 --> 02:02:11,782
-Dad...
-We all go together!

1652
02:02:11,866 --> 02:02:13,158
-Listen...
-We're all going together!

1653
02:02:13,243 --> 02:02:16,537
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.

1654
02:02:16,621 --> 02:02:18,872
You know, you run.
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.

1655
02:02:18,957 --> 02:02:21,542
You hear what l'm saying, okay?
l'll find you when you're safe.

1656
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:23,127
-No.
-You've got to let me go, Dad.

1657
02:02:23,211 --> 02:02:26,547
-You have to let me go. You have to.
-Ron.

1658
02:02:29,259 --> 02:02:31,677
Ron. Ron, let him go.

1659
02:02:33,722 --> 02:02:36,098
You come back! Come on.

1660
02:02:36,182 --> 02:02:37,933
Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!

1661
02:02:38,018 --> 02:02:40,561
-Go with my parents.
-l'm not gonna go without you.

1662
02:02:51,865 --> 02:02:53,449
Move to cover!

1663
02:02:57,662 --> 02:02:59,413
We got Jordanians!

1664
02:02:59,497 --> 02:03:00,956
We got help!

1665
02:03:07,088 --> 02:03:08,338
Down!

1666
02:03:24,898 --> 02:03:26,565
You okay, soldier?

1667
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:29,777
We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's
get these wounded clear of the bird.

1668
02:03:29,861 --> 02:03:31,779
Stay still. Stay still. Don't move.

1669
02:03:31,863 --> 02:03:34,156
You all right, young man?
You have a radio?

1670
02:03:35,617 --> 02:03:40,079
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you.
Remember what l did for my country.

1671
02:03:41,581 --> 02:03:43,248
This is my moment.

1672
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,084
You're crazy!

1673
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:49,046
ETA to station, two minutes.

1674
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:51,006
-Put it on the main screen.
-Sir. Yes, sir.

1675
02:03:51,091 --> 02:03:52,508
Predator 01.

1676
02:04:02,977 --> 02:04:04,186
Shit, it's a trick.

1677
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:06,688
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1678
02:04:06,773 --> 02:04:09,358
-Get those Marines on the ground.
-Roll in strike packages...

1679
02:04:09,692 --> 02:04:11,360
Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning.

1680
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,383
-Spotted Sam!
-Sam!

1681
02:04:34,843 --> 02:04:36,135
lronhide!

1682
02:04:37,011 --> 02:04:39,179
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1683
02:04:42,058 --> 02:04:44,685
Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars!

1684
02:04:45,937 --> 02:04:47,062
Let's go.

1685
02:04:50,733 --> 02:04:54,236
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built
right over the machine.

1686
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:58,699
lf they turn that machine on,
no more sun.

1687
02:05:01,161 --> 02:05:05,581
Not on my watch.

1688
02:05:16,593 --> 02:05:18,093
USS Stennis. ldentify.

1689
02:05:18,178 --> 02:05:20,596
Where the hell are you?
Watching the Weather Channel?

1690
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,556
SportsCenter?
l Dream of Jeannie orsomething?

1691
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:26,643
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?

1692
02:05:26,728 --> 02:05:28,270
ldentify yourself.

1693
02:05:28,771 --> 02:05:29,980
What is your name, sailor?

1694
02:05:30,565 --> 02:05:35,527
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier.

1695
02:05:36,863 --> 02:05:38,530
Okay, Captain Wilder.

1696
02:05:38,615 --> 02:05:40,908
This is Agent Seymour Simmons
of Sector Seven.

1697
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:43,368
There is the mother
of all non-biologicals

1698
02:05:43,453 --> 02:05:45,245
getting ready to blow up our sun.

1699
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:47,164
Do you want to have a throwdown
about my lack of clearance

1700
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:49,291
or do you want to help save
a gazillion lives?

1701
02:05:50,251 --> 02:05:52,628
All right, Agent Simmons. l'm listening.

1702
02:05:59,802 --> 02:06:02,471
Five clicks west of the Gulf,

1703
02:06:02,555 --> 02:06:05,557
we got ourselves an alien
remodeling a pyramid.

1704
02:06:05,642 --> 02:06:08,644
Our one hope is a prototype weapon
called a rail gun,

1705
02:06:08,728 --> 02:06:11,772
-shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.
-That's classified.

1706
02:06:11,856 --> 02:06:15,442
Don't talk to me about classified,
all right?

1707
02:06:15,526 --> 02:06:18,237
Now, if you've got a battleship
in the Gulf, which l know you do,

1708
02:06:18,321 --> 02:06:20,822
you tell them to ready that weapon!

1709
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,409
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.

1710
02:06:25,286 --> 02:06:26,954
Alpha Team, flank left!

1711
02:06:27,038 --> 02:06:28,830
This way! Move it!

1712
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:33,001
-Where do you need us, sir?
-Protect those in the line of fire.

1713
02:06:33,086 --> 02:06:34,711
Let's go! Go!

1714
02:06:38,633 --> 02:06:41,134
Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps!

1715
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:47,933
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!

1716
02:06:48,017 --> 02:06:50,560
Have troops in contact 20 miles
northwest. Radar contact.

1717
02:06:50,645 --> 02:06:51,770
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...

1718
02:06:55,858 --> 02:06:57,442
B-1, snap 090.

1719
02:06:57,527 --> 02:06:59,945
You are approved to drop your
2,000-pound JDAMs.

1720
02:07:07,161 --> 02:07:08,495
-What you got?
-l couldn't get to them, sir.

1721
02:07:08,579 --> 02:07:10,622
They're 600 meters away
and they're heading right for the pillars.

1722
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:13,542
All right. Precious cargo's coming!

1723
02:07:13,876 --> 02:07:14,876
Move!

1724
02:07:25,763 --> 02:07:27,306
Curse you!

1725
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:43,405
Sam! Spotted Sam!

1726
02:08:15,646 --> 02:08:17,397
-Come on!
-2-2 covering fire.

1727
02:08:17,482 --> 02:08:18,940
Two civilians, 12 o'clock!

1728
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:29,034
Cover for us!

1729
02:08:35,458 --> 02:08:38,210
Hold the air strike!
We're rescuing civilians!

1730
02:08:50,515 --> 02:08:52,140
Keep firing!

1731
02:08:58,106 --> 02:08:59,773
Come on! Mikaela!

1732
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:02,526
Come on! Get in here!

1733
02:09:03,486 --> 02:09:04,903
Look who showed up.

1734
02:09:04,987 --> 02:09:06,988
You better have a good reason for us
to be here.

1735
02:09:07,073 --> 02:09:08,782
-Where's Optimus?
-He's right over there,

1736
02:09:08,866 --> 02:09:10,325
across the courtyard.

1737
02:09:10,993 --> 02:09:13,328
-l got to get to him right now.
-Not with an air strike coming.

1738
02:09:13,413 --> 02:09:15,664
l have to get to him right now.

1739
02:09:17,166 --> 02:09:18,500
Go. Back, back, back, back.

1740
02:09:18,584 --> 02:09:20,335
-Go.
-Listen up...

1741
02:09:23,756 --> 02:09:24,965
Okay.

1742
02:09:28,594 --> 02:09:29,970
lncoming!

1743
02:09:30,972 --> 02:09:33,181
Stick the landing.

1744
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:36,977
Behold the glory of Jetfire!

1745
02:09:38,271 --> 02:09:41,857
Now let me show you how we brought
the pain in my day!

1746
02:10:01,878 --> 02:10:03,211
l'm too old for this crap.

1747
02:10:03,379 --> 02:10:06,006
Keep going, man, 15 rounds of fighting.

1748
02:10:26,152 --> 02:10:29,654
l am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

1749
02:10:30,406 --> 02:10:33,700
25.7 meters above sea level,
29.32 north.

1750
02:10:33,784 --> 02:10:35,994
-Kill track, 5205...
-Target acquired.

1751
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:38,663
-Killing track.
-Two, one...

1752
02:10:38,748 --> 02:10:40,081
Fire!

1753
02:10:54,263 --> 02:10:55,889
Yeah! Yeah!

1754
02:10:56,265 --> 02:10:59,935
B-1's time on target, 30 seconds.
2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.

1755
02:11:00,019 --> 02:11:02,145
We're gonna make a break through
the B's on my command, okay?

1756
02:11:02,230 --> 02:11:05,148
You guys stick with me, you
understand? You stay on my ass.

1757
02:11:05,358 --> 02:11:08,610
-1-1 tally orange smoke.
-l hope these F-16s got good aim.

1758
02:11:08,694 --> 02:11:12,280
-Yeah? Why is that?
-l told them to hit the orange smoke.

1759
02:11:13,824 --> 02:11:15,283
You mean that orange smoke?

1760
02:11:15,368 --> 02:11:16,952
lt wasn't my best toss, okay?

1761
02:11:17,036 --> 02:11:19,788
-Viper, thunder.
-Run!

1762
02:11:28,798 --> 02:11:30,090
lncoming!

1763
02:11:33,177 --> 02:11:34,469
Come on!

1764
02:11:54,699 --> 02:11:55,865
Sam!

1765
02:12:03,708 --> 02:12:04,958
Run!

1766
02:12:07,878 --> 02:12:08,962

1767
02:12:16,012 --> 02:12:17,262
Sam!

1768
02:12:33,487 --> 02:12:35,030
Hold your fire!

1769
02:12:37,408 --> 02:12:38,575
Sam!

1770
02:12:40,202 --> 02:12:42,454
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!

1771
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:46,541
Fucking do something!

1772
02:13:21,911 --> 02:13:28,166
-Sam! Sam!
-Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!

1773
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:31,753
-Let me go!
-Come on, you got to move.

1774
02:13:31,837 --> 02:13:34,631
-You got to move, come on.
-We got no pulse.

1775
02:13:34,715 --> 02:13:35,840
Starting CPR.

1776
02:13:35,925 --> 02:13:39,094
-l have to see my kid! l got a son...
-Sammy!

1777
02:13:39,845 --> 02:13:40,970
Sam!

1778
02:13:43,307 --> 02:13:44,849
-Clear.
-Ready to shock.

1779
02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:47,727
-Clear!
-Ready to shock. One, two, three.

1780
02:13:50,648 --> 02:13:52,107
Do it again!

1781
02:13:57,613 --> 02:13:58,947
No!

1782
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:06,037
Okay, listen to my voice.
l love you and l need you.

1783
02:14:07,289 --> 02:14:10,875
Please. Please, come back to me.
Sam, please!

1784
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,502
l love you.

1785
02:14:21,887 --> 02:14:26,266
Where am l? Where am l?
Am l dead? Am l dead?

1786
02:14:26,767 --> 02:14:31,020
We have been watching you
a long, long time.

1787
02:14:33,399 --> 02:14:37,402
You have fought for Optimus,
our last descendant,

1788
02:14:37,486 --> 02:14:42,574
with courage and with sacrifice,
the virtues of a leader,

1789
02:14:43,492 --> 02:14:46,077
a leader worthy of our secret.

1790
02:14:46,662 --> 02:14:51,291
The Matrix of Leadership is not found,
it is earned.

1791
02:14:52,501 --> 02:14:54,711
Return now to Optimus.

1792
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:57,756
Merge the Matrix with his spark.

1793
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:02,886
lt is, and always has been, your destiny.

1794
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:08,975
Sam!

1795
02:15:15,441 --> 02:15:17,859
l love you. l love you.

1796
02:15:55,314 --> 02:15:58,691
Boy, you returned for me.

1797
02:15:59,985 --> 02:16:01,945
A living Prime.

1798
02:16:03,572 --> 02:16:05,740
l don't believe it!

1799
02:16:15,793 --> 02:16:18,253
My Matrix!

1800
02:16:23,592 --> 02:16:25,468
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

1801
02:16:26,387 --> 02:16:27,929
Get up, Prime!

1802
02:16:29,807 --> 02:16:31,182
Oh, no.

1803
02:16:31,559 --> 02:16:35,520
He's turning on the machine!
You got to stop him! Get up!

1804
02:16:36,021 --> 02:16:37,397
Optimus!

1805
02:16:39,608 --> 02:16:41,943
Fallen, my master.

1806
02:16:42,027 --> 02:16:46,489
My brothers could not stop me from this.

1807
02:16:47,408 --> 02:16:51,786
Yes, now l claim your sun.

1808
02:16:54,081 --> 02:16:57,208
-Move!
-Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!

1809
02:16:57,293 --> 02:16:58,793
Engage! Engage!

1810
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:07,218
ln moments, we'll be at firing strength.

1811
02:17:22,818 --> 02:17:27,363
All my Decepticon life, l never did
a thing worth doing until now.

1812
02:17:27,907 --> 02:17:30,825
Optimus, take my parts

1813
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:34,078
and you will have a power
you've never known.

1814
02:17:35,039 --> 02:17:37,081
Fulfill your destiny.

1815
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:45,214
Jolt! Electrify!

1816
02:17:45,674 --> 02:17:47,634
Transplant those afterburners.

1817
02:18:05,945 --> 02:18:07,570
Let's roll.

1818
02:18:10,032 --> 02:18:12,116
Fire mission on the pyramids.

1819
02:18:24,004 --> 02:18:27,423
This planet will be dark forever.

1820
02:18:49,655 --> 02:18:52,073
Die, like your brothers!

1821
02:18:52,741 --> 02:18:54,951
They were your brothers, too.

1822
02:19:23,814 --> 02:19:25,690
Starscream!

1823
02:19:38,704 --> 02:19:40,872
You picked the wrong planet.

1824
02:19:43,834 --> 02:19:45,752
Give me your face.

1825
02:19:54,261 --> 02:19:55,928
l rise.

1826
02:19:56,472 --> 02:19:58,056
You fall.

1827
02:20:00,851 --> 02:20:03,311
No, no.

1828
02:20:05,355 --> 02:20:07,774
Not to call you a coward, Master,

1829
02:20:07,858 --> 02:20:13,529
but sometimes cowards do survive.

1830
02:20:14,156 --> 02:20:16,115
This isn't over.

1831
02:20:43,811 --> 02:20:46,687
lt took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.

1832
02:20:48,273 --> 02:20:49,857
You said it first.

1833
02:21:40,993 --> 02:21:43,619
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.

1834
02:21:44,913 --> 02:21:46,247
Welcome.

1835
02:21:46,999 --> 02:21:48,749
Thank you for believing in me.

1836
02:21:53,589 --> 02:21:58,092
Our races united by a history
long forgotten

1837
02:21:58,177 --> 02:22:01,596
and a future we shall face together.

1838
02:22:02,139 --> 02:22:04,557
l am Optimus Prime,

1839
02:22:04,641 --> 02:22:09,687
and l send this message so that our
pasts will always be remembered,

1840
02:22:09,771 --> 02:22:13,649
for in those memories, we live on.

1841
02:22:36,465 --> 02:22:39,342
So glad you could join us,
Professor Einstein.

1842
02:22:39,843 --> 02:22:41,802
Yeah, l was kind of busy.

1843
02:22:44,473 --> 02:22:45,640
Okay.
