1
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,850
What was that?

2
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,390
Nothing.

3
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,590
Okay, just give me one little hint.

4
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,570
No, no hints.

5
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:52,950
We're almost there.

6
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,410
Okay, I'm going to take this off.

7
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:54,870
No, no, no.

8
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,010
Hey, you said you like surprises.

9
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,790
Yeah, I do.

10
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,070
When I know what they are.

11
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,590
You're going to love it.

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,570
I promise.

13
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,590
Yeah, I already love the view.

14
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,310
Uh-huh.

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:10,970
Hello?

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,450
There's a burning train.

17
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,090
A burning train.

18
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,450
Alright, we're...

19
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,110
What's your stop?

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:31,430
What's your stop?

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,830
I can't see.

22
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,130
Alright, stop.

23
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,730
I'm taking it off...

24
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,230
now.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,080
I didn't even know this place was open yet.

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,800
Pulled some favors and got us on the list for opening night.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Oh!

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,470
Are you sure I'm dressed all right?

29
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,170
You look like a million bucks.

30
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,750
Come on.

31
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,350
And it burns, burns, burns.

32
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,510
The ring of fire.

33
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,730
The ring of fire.

34
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,010
Hey!

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,390
Don't steal points from the fountain.

36
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,430
It's bad luck.

37
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,290
Sorry, sir.

38
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,710
Go on.

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,220
Smile.

40
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,560
Here's your ticket.

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,280
Thank you.

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,300
Did you catch that, everyone?

43
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,300
You coming?

44
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,690
Take the next one.

45
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,670
Aw, come on.

46
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,530
We can fit you in.

47
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,490
Thanks.

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,960
Going up.

49
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,160
Oh, excuse me.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,640
Sorry, it does that sometimes.

51
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,620
Facts about the Skagway Tower.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,040
It's 494 feet tall and weighs over 9,000 tons.

53
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,540
It's made of steel and reinforced concrete and glass.

54
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,000
And even more impressive, the entire project was completed five months out of Skagway.

55
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,080
It's not a good thing.

56
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,980
It's a good thing.

57
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,520
What a time.

58
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,690
Oh, I'm sorry, but we're already over.

59
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,790
Capacity for opening night, we cannot accommodate you.

60
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,470
If you wouldn't mind us stepping aside.

61
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,170
Thank you so much.

62
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,870
It's okay, I worked it out with Jake.

63
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,370
Is he here?

64
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:11,770
I could speak to him.

65
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,050
We let Jake go this morning.

66
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,510
Thank you so much.

67
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,850
What's going on here?

68
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,750
One second, one second.

69
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,210
Oh, sir.

70
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,530
I'm a very important man, but maybe you could help me out.

71
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,140
Please, you're tearing me apart.

72
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,720
But I'm sorry, I can't help you.

73
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,980
If you wouldn't mind.

74
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Oh, Mr. Fuller, how nice to see you.

75
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,940
We have a lovely table for you.

76
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,560
Thank you.

77
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,320
This way, please.

78
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,260
Let's go to the bar.

79
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,260
I'm natural.

80
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,180
Wait a few.

81
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,210
What?

82
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,860
I'm scared of heights.

83
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,400
Oh, no.

84
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,060
I've just never been this high up before.

85
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,380
I'm so sorry.

86
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,360
This night's such a disaster.

87
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,580
I really wanted it to be perfect.

88
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,100
Hey.

89
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,070
It is perfect.

90
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,910
Because I'm with you.

91
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,190
Ah.

92
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,350
Are you okay?

93
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,470
I think I'll live.

94
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:36,830
Yeah.

95
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,060
Hey, look, free champagne.

96
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,900
That's my favorite kind.

97
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,420
Can I run it?

98
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,110
Okay.

99
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,450
I'll be right back.

100
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,590
Excuse me, where's the ladies room?

101
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,910
Other side of the dance floor.

102
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,870
Thank you.

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,080
Hi, sweetie.

104
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,720
Is everything all right?

105
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,200
I'm fine.

106
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:03,980
Thank you.

107
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,320
How far along are you?

108
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:08,900
What?

109
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,580
Oh, no.

110
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,800
No, I'm not.

111
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,730
I don't know exactly.

112
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,230
Maybe one or two months.

113
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,190
That's wonderful news.

114
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,850
Isn't it?

115
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,100
I haven't told my boyfriend yet.

116
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,780
Does he love you?

117
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,940
Yes.

118
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,060
Then he won't let go.

119
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,140
Thank you.

120
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,880
Of course.

121
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:54,680
Bye.

122
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,260
Okay.

123
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,600
It's almost over.

124
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,160
Oh.

125
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey, what?

126
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,440
Are you okay?

127
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,880
Yeah.

128
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,600
I think so.

129
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,540
Come on.

130
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,380
Let's get some fresh air.

131
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,860
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,160
Don't worry.

133
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,260
I wanted to...

134
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,510
You go first.

135
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,150
Okay.

136
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,150
I was gonna do us a dinner.

137
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,490
But seeing as we have this view...

138
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,390
Hey.

139
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,370
Don't throw that penny.

140
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,450
You could kill somebody.

141
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,630
Oh, I'm so sorry.

142
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,250
Of course.

143
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:53,810
Yeah.

144
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,730
Fatass.

145
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,030
Um...

146
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,950
These past few years...

147
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,850
I've been absolutely magical.

148
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,690
And that's, uh...

149
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,710
That's because of you.

150
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:12,890
Iris...

151
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,370
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

152
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,430
You mean...

153
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,790
With us?

154
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:28,840
What?

155
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:31,870
Sorry.

156
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,180
I...

157
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,520
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

158
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,020
What?

159
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,980
You're not upset?

160
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,980
Are you kidding me?

161
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,200
No, this is...

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,440
This is incredible.

163
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:47,980
Really?

164
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,340
We're gonna start a family.

165
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,860
Um, so...

166
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,860
Will you?

167
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,780
Yes.

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,640
Ah!

169
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,240
Um...

170
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,960
Is it too tight?

171
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,060
It's perfect.

172
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,080
Hey.

173
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,860
Let's go sober.

174
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,310
Shut up.

175
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,700
No!

176
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,260
No!

177
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,140
No!

178
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:01,950
Well...

179
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,410
I realize vector multiplication is scary, but it's not that scary.

180
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,910
All right, that's it for today.

181
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,190
We'll start prepping for the final next week.

182
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,950
Ms. Reyes!

183
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,290
We need to talk.

184
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,070
Don't throw that penny.

185
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,110
You could kill somebody.

186
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,030
Oh, this dream is ruining my life.

187
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,430
Mine too.

188
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,590
Every night, Steph...

189
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,570
God, I'm not getting any sleep.

190
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,990
Shit, I'm sorry.

191
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,510
Um...

192
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,730
Can I tell you something?

193
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,370
Yeah?

194
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,290
What's up?

195
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,890
So the woman in my dream, her name is Iris, right?

196
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:07,910
Okay.

197
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,430
That was my grandmother's name.

198
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,950
I, uh, I think I'm dreaming about her.

199
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,250
Are you serious?

200
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:15,750
Yeah.

201
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,370
The thing is, I never even met her.

202
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,390
I don't even know if she's alive.

203
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,430
Okay, well...

204
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:29,930
Either go home and find out about Grandma and hope that stops the dreams, or stay here and die in your sleep.

205
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,550
For real.

206
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,110
Because I will murder you.

207
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,150
I'm sorry.

208
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,630
Yeah, yeah, okay.

209
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,130
Love you.

210
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,150
Love you too.

211
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,050
Go home.

212
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,270
Quietly.

213
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,860
Hey, there she is.

214
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,560
Hey, Dad.

215
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,740
Welcome home, sweetie.

216
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,280
I'm so glad you're here.

217
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,020
Yeah, me too.

218
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,280
I know.

219
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,680
So great to see you.

220
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,920
Thank you, thank you.

221
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,080
Hey, sorry.

222
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,660
Charlie took your room a while ago, and my files are in his room, so I made up the pullout for you.

223
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,520
Is that okay?

224
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,300
Yeah, yeah, no, that sounds totally fine.

225
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,780
Uh, hey, do we still have that box of Mom's old stuff?

226
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,100
It had, uh, some photos, like an address book.

227
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,700
It's phone numbers in it.

228
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,260
Uh, why do you want that?

229
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
Oh, it's not a big deal.

230
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,880
I just, I thought I saw it lying around here somewhere.

231
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,580
Stephanie, what's going on?

232
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:09,020
Okay, this is gonna sound really, really weird, but I, uh, I just need to find Mom's mom, Iris.

233
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,380
Uh, okay.

234
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,760
Yeah, that is weird.

235
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,680
And you know, I got rid of those boxes years ago, after Mom left.

236
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,060
Oh, hi, Charlie.

237
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:23,900
Hey.

238
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,340
Um, hi, Steph.

239
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,340
How are you?

240
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,640
It's so nice to see you.

241
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,500
Yeah, sure.

242
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,360
Uh, going to the cousins?

243
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,040
Whoa, now?

244
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,900
Look, your sister just got home.

245
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,680
I thought we might, uh...

246
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,300
Actually, you know what?

247
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,440
I can, I can drive you.

248
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,120
I was wanting to see them anyways.

249
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,440
That's fine.

250
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,220
Hey, if you're gonna see your cousins, please don't talk about Iris.

251
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,680
Don't go out.

252
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,260
Yeah.

253
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,860
Yeah, no problem.

254
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,560
All right.

255
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,240
Bye, love you.

256
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,100
Love you, too.

257
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,120
Charlie?

258
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,000
Charlie?

259
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,220
Can you just take these out, please?

260
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,220
I'm trying to talk to you.

261
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,060
What's your problem?

262
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,840
What?

263
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,220
You haven't said anything this entire time.

264
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,060
What?

265
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,220
Steph, why are you here?

266
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,440
I mean, I'm only coming home for holidays.

267
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,260
I have to tell you something.

268
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,100
But you have to promise not to tell Dad.

269
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,700
Are you pregnant?

270
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,240
No, I'm not pregnant, Charlie.

271
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,820
I don't know.

272
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,820
That's not...

273
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,720
I mean, you're in college.

274
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,700
Can you just promise me you won't tell Dad?

275
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,220
Why would I tell Dad?

276
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,580
It's serious, Charlie.

277
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,560
Okay.

278
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,400
Um...

279
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,240
I am on academic probation.

280
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,190
Whoa.

281
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:53,940
Stop!

282
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,660
If I don't get my grades up...

283
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,460
This is kind of a big moment for me.

284
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,260
This is kind of funny.

285
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,620
You're a class president, Miss Valedictorian.

286
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,220
If I don't get my grades up, I will lose my scholarship.

287
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,020
Oh.

288
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,820
I'm both, sorry.

289
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,340
What happened?

290
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,920
I can't sleep.

291
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,560
Every time I close my eyes, I have this same recurring nightmare about Iris.

292
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,720
Our grandmother.

293
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,960
I don't...

294
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,500
I mean, it has to mean something.

295
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,740
I don't know.

296
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,420
I dream weird things.

297
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,080
I dreamed a hot dog ate me last night.

298
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,860
Like, the hot dog was eating me.

299
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,600
Okay.

300
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,120
Ah!

301
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,320
Ah!

302
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,780
Dude, can you just do something?

303
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,220
Just move a little bit.

304
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,420
I have to look underneath.

305
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,340
Do me a kindness.

306
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,780
Do you remember what happened last night?

307
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,800
What's going on?

308
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,260
I can't find Paco.

309
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,460
Dude, again?

310
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,800
Who's Paco?

311
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,380
Hey, cuz.

312
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,340
Oh my gosh, hey, can you help us look?

313
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,220
And just watch your feet where you're stepping.

314
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,500
Yeah, yeah, sure.

315
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,660
I gotta talk to your dad first.

316
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,080
What the fuck are you doing home?

317
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,740
Oh, dude, she's fucking out of school.

318
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,060
Hey, welcome to the club.

319
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,780
Eric, dude, have you looked anywhere?

320
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,000
Paco's not upstairs.

321
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,620
Oh, but look who's down here.

322
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,580
Hi, Julia.

323
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,100
Oh my gosh.

324
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,560
Hi, Ben.

325
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,160
Charlie.

326
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,920
There's my little Romeo.

327
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,900
So, we had to prom-pose him with Jenny-go.

328
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,920
She said yes.

329
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,900
Oh my gosh.

330
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,440
Who's Jenny?

331
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,840
Oh, he met her in Junior Lifeguards.

332
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,220
Junior Lifeguards?

333
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,300
Charlie, I didn't know you were doing Junior Lifeguards.

334
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,880
Okay, so what are you gonna wear?

335
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,540
I'm just gonna keep it simple.

336
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,640
Black blazer.

337
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,640
Stephanie!

339
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,180
Oh my gosh.

340
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,600
Hi, honey.

341
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,380
How long are you here for?

342
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,240
Not long.

343
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,780
Is Uncle Howard around?

344
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,300
Yeah, yeah, he's up back.

345
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,780
I'll get him.

346
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,140
Howard!

347
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,300
Stephanie's here.

348
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,740
Come in.

349
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,240
Great.

350
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,940
You look a little tired.

351
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,780
Is everything okay?

352
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,640
Stephanie!

353
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,360
Look at you!

354
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,460
Come here, come here.

355
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,300
Oh, sweetie.

356
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,280
Oh, it's so good to see you.

357
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,420
Hey, are you hungry?

358
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,260
I was gonna make some lunch.

359
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,220
No, actually, I came here because I wanted to talk to you about your mother.

360
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,380
Iris.

361
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,720
I know you don't like to talk about her.

362
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,380
There's not much to tell.

363
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Hey, kids, come on, lunch!

364
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,760
It's just that I've been having this recurring nightmare about her.

365
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,720
Oh, honey, it's probably just a stress.

366
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,300
You should try melatonin.

367
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,420
Okay, but the weird thing is, I've been dreaming about a real place from 50 years ago.

368
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,240
It was like a restaurant called The Skyview.

369
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,570
You know what it is?

370
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,750
Did Iris tell you about it?

371
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,410
What did she say?

372
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,730
Okay, did she say anything?

373
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,490
Maybe if I could talk to her...

374
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,090
Talk to who?

375
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,530
Steph is dreaming about Grandma Iris.

376
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:02,790
Psycho granny?

377
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,990
I thought she was dead.

378
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,650
Well, she's dead to us.

379
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,010
Stephanie, Iris Campbell is a very deeply disturbed woman.

380
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,170
Look, if I could just talk to her, then maybe I can get these dreams to stop.

381
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,090
Steph, just drop it.

382
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,170
I don't get it.

383
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,650
What happened that was so bad?

384
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,730
For one thing, she's the reason that your mother's so screwed up.

385
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,170
What?

386
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,910
Look, I just don't want to talk about this anymore, okay?

387
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,130
Uncle Howard, please, I just need to know.

388
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:33,690
Look, Stephanie, after our father died, Iris just snapped.

389
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,630
She wouldn't let us go to school.

390
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,470
She locked us inside the house.

391
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,170
She obsessed about all the horrific ways we could die.

392
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,718
And eventually it got so bad, I mean so bad, 

393
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:50,325
that the state came in and they took your mother and I away from her.

394
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,130
But it didn't end there.

395
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,384
She tracked us all through foster care, and when the kids were born, 

396
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:58,736
she started sending us these horrible letters,

397
00:27:58,736 --> 00:28:02,910
 that were full of obituaries and these disturbing pictures of dead bodies.

398
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,350
We had to move so she couldn't contact us anymore.

399
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:12,450
So, uh, do you still have any of those letters?

400
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:12,990
No.

401
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,630
I...

402
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,010
Stephanie, listen to me.

403
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,890
That woman is a sick and dangerous person.

404
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,250
And for your well-being and your safety, stay the hell away from her.

405
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:29,970
I believe you.

406
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,700
I found Paco!

407
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,300
I'm sure he'd love to be in the living room right now.

408
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,460
Come on, guys.

409
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,680
How did he ever get in there?

410
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,900
I need you to help me.

411
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,520
You heard your uncle.

412
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,060
Just let it go.

413
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,280
Just let it go.

414
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,680
You don't understand.

415
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,520
My whole life is falling apart because of this dream.

416
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,060
And not only that, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

417
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,380
Please, you are the only person who can help me.

418
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,960
Howard would never forgive me if I put you in touch with Iris.

419
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,000
Please.

420
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,100
Please.

421
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,750
Whatever you do, do not look in the bottom drawer of the dining room cabinet.

422
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,960
Hi, um, I'm here to see Iris Campbell.

423
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,300
Did you not see the signs?

424
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,320
Uh, uh, yeah, yes, I did.

425
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Then get the fuck out of here.

426
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,640
I'm your granddaughter.

427
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:18,040
Stephanie, empty your pockets.

428
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,200
Phone, keys, everything.

429
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,820
Well, I'm not dangerous.

430
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,600
It's not you I'm afraid of.

431
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,520
Uh.

432
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,700
Come in slowly.

433
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,650
Shut the door.

434
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:07,650
Quick, quick, quick.

435
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:11,890
Don't move.

436
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,380
Oh my god.

437
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,100
It really is you.

438
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,600
I can see your mother in you.

439
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,320
Hi, um.

440
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,740
Stop, stop.

441
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,680
Don't move.

442
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,820
Not until I tell you.

443
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,330
Trying to trick me, aren't you?

444
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,010
Getting me to let my guard down.

445
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,430
I.

446
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,010
There you go.

447
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,450
Run.

448
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,510
Sit.

449
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,330
Okay, um.

450
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,260
That's it.

451
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,500
So.

452
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,080
How is Darlene?

453
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,180
Your mom?

454
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,620
Okay.

455
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,400
Uh, no, I don't know.

456
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,100
She left when I was ten.

457
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,540
So we don't see her anymore.

458
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,360
Oh.

459
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,589
But you saw my letters.

460
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,950
That's why you're here, right?

461
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,089
No.

462
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:19,769
Um.

463
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:24,910
I'm actually here because I've been dreaming about the sky view.

464
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:26,830
Yeah.

465
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,930
Yeah, every single night for the past two months it's the same dream.

466
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:39,350
In it, you're on a date but then the dance floor breaks and then there's an explosion and then you fall and die.

467
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:39,690
Yeah.

468
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,570
Yeah, everyone dies.

469
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,850
It wasn't just your dream.

470
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,610
It was my premonition.

471
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:55,290
Years ago at the sky view I got a glimpse into the future and saw what death was about to do.

472
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,420
Hey, don't throw that penny.

473
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,520
You could kill somebody.

474
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,680
Oh, I'm so sorry.

475
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,280
Of course.

476
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,740
These past two years have been absolutely magical and that's all because of you.

477
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,020
No, no, no.

478
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,800
This isn't right.

479
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,560
Is that a no?

480
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,440
Everyone's going to die.

481
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,220
The whole building is going to come down.

482
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,340
Are you serious?

483
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,060
The penny.

484
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:33,980
Iris?

485
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,700
Give it to me.

486
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,300
What are you doing?

487
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,220
What the fuck is wrong with you?

488
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,120
Iris?

489
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,180
I saved a lot of lives that night.

490
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,280
They were meant to be saved.

491
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,720
They closed the restaurant after that.

492
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,060
Said it needed additional renovations.

493
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,360
But it never reopened.

494
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,420
Eventually they tore it down.

495
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,140
So you stopped the disaster?

496
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:39,840
Yes.

497
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,780
But death doesn't like it when you fuck with his plans.

498
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,220
So over the years he came back and he killed everyone who was there that night.

499
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,040
Including my Paul.

500
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,730
Wait a minute.

501
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,150
I'm sorry.

502
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,550
Did you say death came back?

503
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,590
He's a relentless son of a bitch.

504
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,250
Won't stop till he finishes the job.

505
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,670
But I taught myself how to see him coming.

506
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,370
To anticipate his every move.

507
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,470
Been keeping him at bay for years now.

508
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,170
And now he's got me.

509
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:15,890
Cancer.

510
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:16,810
Oh.

511
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,350
Believe that shit?

512
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:19,430
Sorry.

513
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,290
Got the diagnosis two months ago.

514
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,670
Wait.

515
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,270
That's when I started having my dream.

516
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:24,910
See?

517
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,750
It's a sign.

518
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,830
Okay, but why am I dreaming about what you saw?

519
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,490
Maybe my cancer passed my premonition on to you.

520
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,090
Maybe it's fate's demented sense of humor.

521
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:34,950
Who the hell knows?

522
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,830
What matters is that when the universe speaks you pay attention.

523
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,470
I see you, you fuck.

524
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,610
Huh?

525
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,550
Um.

526
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,590
Who are you talking to?

527
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:02,450
Death.

528
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,330
He thinks I'm distracted because you're here.

529
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,830
I have to teach you everything in this book.

530
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,350
It'll take some time to learn the basics.

531
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,010
So you'll need to stay here.

532
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,730
Stay here?

533
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,210
The outside world is too dangerous.

534
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,290
I haven't stepped out there in twenty years.

535
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,330
In here, we can be safe.

536
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:22,370
Oh.

537
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,090
See that?

538
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,330
Yeah.

539
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,110
This is all my research.

540
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,450
My life's work.

541
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,290
Look, I'm sorry.

542
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,290
I can't.

543
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,549
I can't stay here.

544
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,789
I have to get back to school, but, you know, I'll come back and I'll visit.

545
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,250
No!

546
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,330
I'm sick!

547
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,830
I won't be alive that long.

548
00:38:38,909 --> 00:38:39,990
You can't leave.

549
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:41,169
Don't you see?

550
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:44,250
Death is coming for our family.

551
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,790
You don't believe me?

552
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:49,670
No.

553
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,070
I think I made a mistake.

554
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,110
I think it was probably just a dream.

555
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:56,870
No, wait!

556
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,490
At least take the book!

557
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,580
This book is a lifeline.

558
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,580
It will show you everything you need to know to keep our family safe.

559
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,980
You still don't believe me?

560
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Step back.

561
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,300
Seeing is believing.

562
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,920
Hey, Steph.

563
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,140
Her face really exploded right in front of you.

564
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,460
Hey!

565
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,540
Just leave her alone.

566
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,540
It's my bad, Steph.

567
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,220
I'm just curious.

568
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:21,610
Hey.

569
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,210
How are you holding up?

570
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,430
Sorry Uncle helped.

571
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,170
You were right about ours.

572
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,190
I never should have went there.

573
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,730
Honey, there's no need to apologize.

574
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,370
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

575
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,390
She said something to me before she died.

576
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,150
She said death was coming for our family.

577
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,330
That's crazy, right?

578
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,660
I can't believe it.

579
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,540
I emailed her.

580
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,940
I just didn't think she'd show up.

581
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,540
Come on.

582
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,820
Is that Mom?

583
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,060
Yeah.

584
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:16,900
Really?

585
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,860
Wow.

586
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Don't be ridiculous.

587
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,460
Come on.

588
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,780
Get down here.

589
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,120
Come here.

590
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,430
Welcome to the barbecue.

591
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:36,610
Steph.

592
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,570
If she's going to Uncle Howard's house, then I'm not.

593
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,730
You can get a ride with Dad.

594
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,690
You're not even going to talk to her?

595
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:43,970
Come on.

596
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,790
You don't remember her like I do.

597
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,450
Just give her a chance.

598
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:47,850
Why?

599
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,990
Charlie, she abandoned us and now she rolls in here?

600
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,570
After all these years and wants to act like nothing happened?

601
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,150
Because who would do that, right?

602
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,790
Wait, what?

603
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:01,210
Nothing.

604
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:01,790
No.

605
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,770
What's that supposed to mean?

606
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,570
I tried calling you so many times and nothing.

607
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,650
Same with Julia.

608
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,630
You used to be best friends.

609
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,610
You don't even talk anymore.

610
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,050
Okay.

611
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,190
Well, I'm sorry.

612
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,790
I've just been distracted the last couple of months because of this and this nightmare.

613
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:17,610
What about before that?

614
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,010
It's been like this ever since you left.

615
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,270
You're mad at Mom, but you haven't been around either.

616
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,330
I'm not like her.

617
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:25,890
Okay?

618
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,730
I'm not crazy.

619
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,650
No, you're right.

620
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,390
You're not crazy.

621
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,510
Okay.

622
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,890
You just don't care.

623
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,820
Now you got it, watch out for splinters.

624
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,080
Hey, there she is.

625
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,340
Hey.

626
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,180
Come here.

627
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,900
I'm so glad you made it.

628
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,240
Of course.

629
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:31,660
Come on in.

630
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,660
Hey, everybody.

631
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,120
Come on.

632
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:33,620
Come on over.

633
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,340
I made cookies.

634
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,120
That's great.

635
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,040
Can I try one?

636
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,060
Yes, of course.

637
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,260
Does this have peanut butter?

638
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,300
Yeah.

639
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,210
Are you trying to kill my brother?

640
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:54,770
Oh, my God.

641
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:55,310
Bob is allergic.

642
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:55,990
Yeah.

643
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,350
I totally forgot.

644
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,190
I'm so sorry.

645
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,250
The important thing is that you're here.

646
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,110
So, Bobby Bartender, drinks.

647
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:01,990
Drinks all around.

648
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,540
Family.

649
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,700
You don't get to pick the one you get.

650
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,120
You just got to love the one that you got.

651
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,620
Now, our mother, she lived alone until the day that she died.

652
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:30,082
And her death should be a reminder to all of us to enjoy life,

653
00:45:30,082 --> 00:45:36,320
and spend the time that we have together because we're not going to get any back.

654
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,040
I love you guys.

655
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,340
Cheers.

656
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,660
Cheers.

657
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:42,900
Cheers.

658
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:43,720
Cheers.

659
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,640
Oh, my God.

660
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,880
There's a bug in there.

661
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,840
Oh, my God.

662
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,273
I got it.

663
00:46:28,473 --> 00:46:30,413
- I think, you got it.
- Just watch.

664
00:46:34,144 --> 00:46:37,617
- I'm trying to get a new job.
- That's great!

665
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:38,490
Charlie!

666
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,250
Get up here.

667
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,920
Do you want me to join you?

668
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,099
Good to see you.

669
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,340
The setup you've got here.

670
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:37,380
Well, I wanted the kids to have a happy childhood unlike some people I know.

671
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,580
You're not talking about us, are you?

672
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,020
Oh, no.

673
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,080
We had a great childhood.

674
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,660
Look at me.

675
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,060
I turned out fabulous.

676
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,560
Yep.

677
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:54,950
Howard.

678
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,230
What is that?

679
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,110
It looks like a house key.

680
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:00,870
Come on.

681
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,538
You know, we got the spare room, 

682
00:48:02,738 --> 00:48:05,163
and it's got to be better than bouncing around trailer parks.

683
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,470
I don't think this is a good idea.

684
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,410
It's never too late for a second chance.

685
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:21,310
I'm sorry.

686
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,550
They're better off without me.

687
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,990
Pick up.

688
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:31,350
Pick up.

689
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:31,730
Come on.

690
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,110
You got to me, all right?

691
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,350
You got to me.

692
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,250
Hey, guys, come show us your back flip.

693
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:52,390
What?

694
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,150
No, no, no.

695
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,610
Yeah, come on, Uncle Howard.

696
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,610
Come on, Howard.

697
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,230
Howard.

698
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:06,620
Oh, yeah.

699
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,320
There you go.

700
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,680
All right, here we go.

701
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,160
Watch out.

702
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,240
Wait, stop!

703
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,120
Nice catch, Andy.

704
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,560
Alright, here we go.

705
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,540
Come on, Howard.

706
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,220
Here we go.

707
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,420
Careful, Howard!

708
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,680
Stephanie.

709
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,580
I'm glad you decided to come.

710
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,720
Now the whole family's here!

711
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,720
I'm okay.

712
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:24,940
Alright.

713
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,100
Good.

714
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,720
And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.

715
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,610
What is all this stuff?

716
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,060
Okay.

717
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,300
I found these papers in Iris' book.

718
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:12,101
They are obituaries and articles for the people who were at the Skyview,

719
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:14,479
on the night that Iris had her premonition.

720
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,700
Each one of these people went on to die in some weird and messed up way.

721
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,800
And not only that, they all died in the same order as Iris' premonition.

722
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:29,200
Hundreds of people were supposed to die that night, but Iris stopped the disaster.

723
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,540
So, death came back for them one by one.

724
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:38,820
Since there were so many survivors, it took years for death to get to all of them.

725
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,740
But eventually it got to Iris.

726
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,420
I mean, she was the last to die in the premonition.

727
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,200
It was her and a little boy.

728
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,120
But she was prepared.

729
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,300
She single-handedly held off death for decades.

730
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,480
Stephanie, sweetie.

731
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,360
I don't think this is the appropriate time for this.

732
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,140
Yeah, I mean, none of this even has anything to do with us, right?

733
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,560
Why are we even here?

734
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,320
It has everything to do with us.

735
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:11,720
Because death took so long to make its way through the survivors, these people went on to have families.

736
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,780
Families that they never should have had.

737
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,240
So death took them too.

738
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,020
Don't you see this?

739
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,280
Death is coming for us because we were never supposed to exist.

740
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,240
Okay, so why everybody in this room is on death's hit list?

741
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,300
Bobby, Doc, that's what she's saying.

742
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,400
No, no, no.

743
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,280
Dad and Aunt Brenda are safe because they're not part of Iris' bloodline.

744
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,200
Okay.

745
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,940
Following the pattern, death makes its way down each branch by age.

746
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,260
So because Uncle Howard was the oldest, it'll start with his family first, meaning Eric, you're next.

747
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,200
Go fuck yourself.

748
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,900
Then it'll go for Julia, then Bobby.

749
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:57,440
Then it'll come for our branch, starting with Darlene, then me, then Charlie.

750
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,220
Charlie.

751
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:01,960
You buying this?

752
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,140
I don't know.

753
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,140
This is so messed up.

754
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,860
I mean, you're turning our dad's death into some kind of fucked up conspiracy theory.

755
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,060
What is wrong with you?

756
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,940
No, no, no, no, no.

757
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,060
It's not, it's not a conspiracy theory.

758
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:14,920
That's enough.

759
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,820
We're all gonna die.

760
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,060
Stop!

761
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,540
I can't listen to this for one more minute.

762
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:24,060
That crazy woman's nonsense has caused enough pain and suffering for this family.

763
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:24,600
Hang on.

764
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,300
Aunt Brenda, please just leave it alone.

765
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,380
Okay, in Iris' book, she mentions somebody who cheated death and survived.

766
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:31,840
Stephanie.

767
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,920
Eric, no, wait.

768
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,500
I'm worried about you.

769
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,420
Stop it.

770
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,240
I'll be taking care of this.

771
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:39,900
Come on, Bobby.

772
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,260
Brenda.

773
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:40,760
Let's go.

774
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,180
No, no, no, you can't.

775
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:42,480
I'm sorry.

776
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,160
Please.

777
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,080
You believe me, right?

778
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,380
I'm sorry.

779
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:46,800
Julia.

780
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,240
Look, I love you.

781
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,840
But sometimes I really hate you.

782
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,340
I know.

783
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:18,700
I know how convincing all of this can be, but it's not real.

784
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,860
How can you say that?

785
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,120
I know Iris taught you all of this.

786
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:28,920
Don't let my mom's beliefs derail your life the same way they did mine.

787
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:37,330
Thank you so much for that advice, but I really don't need a mom anymore.

788
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,800
All right, open wide.

789
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,500
Very good.

790
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,100
Just gonna pinch hard.

791
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,480
Ready?

792
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:55,500
Five, four, three, two.

793
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,340
Good job.

794
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,780
I'm gonna hit the club.

795
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,120
I need you to lock up.

796
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,000
And don't touch any of my liquor.

797
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,260
No, no, you didn't say anything about locking up.

798
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

799
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,580
I didn't say shit about closing, dude.

800
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,580
And cry me a river.

801
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,740
I hope you burn in hell.

802
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,520
You believe that shit?

803
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,780
My old man just died.

804
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:22,300
I come in as a favor to that asshole, and now he wants me to lock up.

805
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,060
You know what that is?

806
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,140
It's inconsiderate.

807
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,920
Anyway, you're all done.

808
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,500
Thank you.

809
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,120
Hey, five-star review, yeah?

810
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,160
Like and subscribe and all the things.

811
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:10,350
No, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving, but

812
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:15,310
I guess that's just the way the story goes.

813
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:26,430
And now it's only fair that I should let you know what you should know.

814
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:34,770
I can't live, if living is without you.

815
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:39,910
I can't give.

816
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:43,306
I can't give anymore.

817
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,937
God dammit.

818
01:00:57,399 --> 01:00:59,182
Charlie, wake up.

819
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,800
I've been trying to call Eric all night.

820
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,000
He's not answering me.

821
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,880
I don't know where he is.

822
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,940
I'm worried.

823
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,540
I'm sure he's fine.

824
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,100
Well, have you heard from him?

825
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,240
I'm going over there.

826
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,220
I need to check on him.

827
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,080
You're coming too, Charlie.

828
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,380
I think he's gone to voicemail.

829
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:26,530
Is that him?

830
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:30,230
My friend just set the test recorder to burn down last night.

831
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:30,910
What?

832
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:32,750
Steph, Steph!

833
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:35,350
Ow!

834
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:38,640
Eric?

835
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,280
Oh, yeah, no, of course it's you.

836
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,330
Dude!

837
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:48,290
We heard about the fire.

838
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:48,950
We thought you were dead.

839
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:49,830
I'm fine.

840
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:51,730
Are you okay?

841
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,590
I'm so worried about you.

842
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:53,190
Yeah, fuck.

843
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,790
Fire said I was lucky as fuck that I was wearing that leather jacket.

844
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,890
Barely got burned.

845
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:59,190
Really my favorite jacket, though.

846
01:01:59,370 --> 01:01:59,970
What is this?

847
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,070
Oh, yeah, check it out.

848
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:03,090
I got branded.

849
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,570
Sick, right?

850
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:05,850
You like it?

851
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,330
You said you were asleep.

852
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,590
You're blowing up my phone like a goddamn stalker.

853
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,110
What do you want me to do?

854
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:11,070
No, I don't get it.

855
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:11,630
You should be dead.

856
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,710
Right, yeah, yeah.

857
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,810
Or, you know, maybe...

858
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,730
Maybe death's not actually coming for our family.

859
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,070
Because that would be fucking crazy.

860
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:24,970
Jesus shit!

861
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,160
Or maybe I'm invincible.

862
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,440
Eric?

863
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:33,840
Eric!

864
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:34,960
Yeah?

865
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:35,660
Eric, wait.

866
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,320
Stop.

867
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,120
Just wait, okay?

868
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,040
Just because death didn't kill you last night doesn't mean that you're safe.

869
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,460
Stay away from that tree trimmer!

870
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:44,680
Ooh.

871
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:45,800
Ooh.

872
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,280
Gonna move on its own, Steph?

873
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,240
Is that what it's gonna do?

874
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:50,860
It could fall.

875
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,160
And stay away from these kids.

876
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,220
I'll take my chances.

877
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,880
Steph, how's a couple kids with a soccer ball gonna kill him?

878
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,560
I mean, I don't know.

879
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:05,429
The trimmer could fall and hit the leaf blower guy, 

880
01:03:05,629 --> 01:03:10,571
which causes him to blow stuff into the kids' eyes and then take the ball into his face.

881
01:03:10,771 --> 01:03:11,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

882
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,620
Soccer ball in my face?

883
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,100
That does sound deadly.

884
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,540
I should be more careful.

885
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:22,370
Hey!

886
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:23,310
What's up?

887
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:24,090
What happened to you?

888
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:25,690
Charbroiled by death.

889
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:26,390
Eric, huh?

890
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:28,550
Kiki, that was pretty bad.

891
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,290
Oh, wait, let me see that.

892
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:32,190
Eric, just stay away from the truck.

893
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,010
Oh, what?

894
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:34,470
This truck?

895
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:34,770
Stop!

896
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:35,790
Oh, my God.

897
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:36,510
Please.

898
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:38,110
This truck right here?

899
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:39,990
But it's such a beautiful truck!

900
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:40,110
Stop!

901
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:40,210
Stop!

902
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:40,790
Don't touch it!

903
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:41,790
Eric, just wait!

904
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,070
Stop!

905
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,330
You like that?

906
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:47,850
Oh, my God.

907
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,090
Uh-oh!

908
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,770
Eric's testing death again!

909
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:53,970
What's gonna happen?

910
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,110
Stop doing that!

911
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,750
What's gonna happen?

912
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:01,320
How about that?

913
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,660
I'm just trying to help you.

914
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:02,980
Okay.

915
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,420
Honestly, we're so done with your garbage.

916
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:08,720
Can you please...

917
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:13,100
For the 1500th time, no one gives a shit about your stupid little death curse, okay?

918
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:17,100
So take a hint and leave us alone, because death's not coming for our family.

919
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:19,540
Whoa!

920
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:17,550
Whoa!

921
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,420
Should've believed you, Steph.

922
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,980
No, I, uh...

923
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:06,390
I screwed up the order, and now Julia's dead.

924
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:07,490
It's my fault.

925
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,640
What happened was traumatic and awful.

926
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,860
It's not your fault.

927
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:19,410
It's my fault.

928
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:21,590
Well, it's not your fault.

929
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,870
It is my fault.

930
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:29,530
Stephanie, you were only wrong about the order, because there's something you shouldn't know.

931
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,860
Eric isn't Howard's biological son.

932
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:42,670
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

933
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:48,410
And, Stephanie, I didn't believe you, so I didn't say anything to you, and now my little girl's dead.

934
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,190
Well, I don't understand why you had an affair.

935
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:53,930
You and your father and I were having such a hard time.

936
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,630
But it was good, because I got you.

937
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:57,670
I got you out of it.

938
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:58,730
I was gonna read that, but I'm just gonna read that.

939
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:02,290
It doesn't matter, because Howard loved you so, so much.

940
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:02,750
Who is it?

941
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,030
Who's been around all that?

942
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:10,790
Gerard Fenbury.

943
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:12,510
Oh!

944
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:14,550
Gerard Fenbury?

945
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:15,690
Yes.

946
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,570
Oh, shit.

947
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:18,590
No, no, no, no!

948
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:20,490
Gerard fucking Fenbury?

949
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:22,330
You don't know what we're going through.

950
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:23,590
Oh, God.

951
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,730
What, is this why you always wanted to play catch?

952
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:26,250
Oh.

953
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:33,590
Okay.

954
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:42,030
So, that means that if it's going in the right order, then I'm next, right?

955
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,980
You gotta help me, Steph.

956
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:54,480
I don't think that I can.

957
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,580
I mean, I thought I did, but I don't...

958
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:58,980
No, but you can.

959
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,960
I mean, you predicted exactly what was gonna happen.

960
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:07,580
You just got the order wrong, because you didn't have all the information, Charlie.

961
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,160
What do you mean, predicted?

962
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,980
She saw everything.

963
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:15,500
The trimmer, the blower, the soccer ball, like...

964
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,880
It was like there were pieces to a puzzle, and she just had to put them together, you know what I mean?

965
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:20,560
Is that true?

966
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,880
Darling, please, do not encourage this.

967
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,580
Marty, I mean...

968
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,760
I mean, it's everything in Iris' book, it's...

969
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,860
It's like, it's like an equation, it's math.

970
01:08:33,059 --> 01:08:37,380
Stephanie, if you can see how all of this fits together, we might have a chance.

971
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:44,820
Steph, you devastated this family when you walked out, but we've been okay without you.

972
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,360
I'm begging you not to traumatize our kids anymore.

973
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:50,600
It's real this time.

974
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:56,900
I'm going for a walk.

975
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:10,691
I can appreciate that our family is clearly gonna need some counseling in the future, but...

976
01:09:10,891 --> 01:09:14,350
can we focus on the fact that we're all about to die, right?

977
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:15,660
I mean...

978
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:23,020
I mean, Steph, didn't you say that Iris knew someone that cheated death or something?

979
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:24,580
Yeah, um...

980
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,580
Right here, somewhere, it says...

981
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,680
That, um...

982
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,180
Right here.

983
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:38,100
J.B. found someone who survived, but it doesn't say anything about who this J.B. was or...

984
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,160
Wait a minute, I know that name.

985
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,672
My mom used to write me letters, 

986
01:09:41,872 --> 01:09:47,139
and she sometimes would talk about a friend of hers named J.B. who worked at a hospital.

987
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:49,700
Um...

988
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:57,880
Um, something, uh, something river hospital, uh, uh, deep river, uh, peace river hospital, uh, clear...

989
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,860
Hope, Hope River?

990
01:09:59,280 --> 01:09:59,740
That's it!

991
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,880
Shit, it's like an hour away.

992
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:02,900
I'm going.

993
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,000
I'm gonna go find him and talk to him myself.

994
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,380
Well, I'm coming with you.

995
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,820
That's it, okay, yeah, yeah, let's, let's go.

996
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,280
Ozzy, I...

997
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:12,980
What?

998
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,920
You need to stay here with your mom and save her.

999
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,820
Yeah, fuck that, are you kidding me?

1000
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,140
I'm not staying here by myself.

1001
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,760
It's too dangerous on the road for you, you can't...

1002
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,020
No, I read Gammy's death book, okay, alright?

1003
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:30,260
I mean, there's like a thousand house-related deaths in that thing, man.

1004
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:33,600
You trip down the stairs, fall...

1005
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,960
down a toilet or something, I don't, I don't know, but I'm not, I'm not...

1006
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,220
No way, I'm not staying here.

1007
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:40,440
Hang on, hang on.

1008
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,960
Hey, okay, too fast.

1009
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,420
Okay, okay, we'll go slow, we'll go slow.

1010
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,580
I'm gonna go open up the truck.

1011
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,580
Charlie, check the back.

1012
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:46,980
Got it.

1013
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,400
Be careful, the steps are slippery sometimes.

1014
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:55,660
Oi!

1015
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,720
Any of you fuckers doing nut check?

1016
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,440
Excuse me?

1017
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,480
You made cookies in that thing with peanut butter in them just a few days ago.

1018
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,580
This poor bastard so much as even touches a nut, his throat is gonna close up tight and...

1019
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,340
You understand, where's the peanut butter?

1020
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,220
Cabin and about the sink.

1021
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,100
Thank you.

1022
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,440
I'm so sorry, Bobby, I just...

1023
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,180
Hey, okay.

1024
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:27,220
All clear.

1025
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,480
Thank you.

1026
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,240
You're a good brother, Eric.

1027
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,020
Nut check.

1028
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:32,380
What?

1029
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,240
Oh!

1030
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,520
God!

1031
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:36,380
Oh!

1032
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,320
It was good, I get it.

1033
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:40,420
Come on.

1034
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:42,080
It's only getting worse.

1035
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,580
Dammit.

1036
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,320
Wait!

1037
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,280
I'm coming with you, bro.

1038
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,740
Someone's gotta protect you.

1039
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,820
Dad's calling, again?

1040
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,260
Tell him we just went for a ride with Mom.

1041
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,600
He's not gonna believe that.

1042
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,100
At least it'll buy us some time.

1043
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,340
Time?

1044
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,640
Death doesn't get us your dead will.

1045
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:23,130
I always keep them where I can see them.

1046
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,780
I mean, you could've just had the real thing, but it's okay, not everyone wants to be a mom.

1047
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,580
Is that what you think?

1048
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,820
That I don't wanna be a mom?

1049
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:43,720
Look, I was raised by a woman who taught me to see death everywhere.

1050
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,707
I thought I could put it behind me, but then when I had you and your brother, 

1051
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:53,257
all I could see were a hundred different ways that you and Charlie could die.

1052
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,700
I didn't want you to leave the house.

1053
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,720
I would freak out on you guys over nothing.

1054
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:06,072
One day, I looked at your face, and I saw the same scared little girl that I was growing up, 

1055
01:13:06,272 --> 01:13:08,976
and I knew that if I stayed, I was gonna ruin your life.

1056
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,260
I have no idea if I did the right thing.

1057
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,500
But I'm here for you now.

1058
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:58,860
The front desk is this way.

1059
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:09,250
Hi, um, we're looking for JB.

1060
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,250
And who are you?

1061
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:15,010
The front desk told us we could find him down here, is that you?

1062
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,280
William John Bloodworth.

1063
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,060
But my friends call me JB.

1064
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,100
I've been waiting for you, Stephanie.

1065
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,460
Charlie.

1066
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,760
So, which one of you...

1067
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,500
I was sorry to hear about Iris.

1068
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,160
She was a special woman.

1069
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,360
How did you know her?

1070
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,020
She saved my life.

1071
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:58,980
When?

1072
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:03,530
The sky view.

1073
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:11,190
I went to work that night.

1074
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:14,850
JB, honey, I told you, you gotta stay back there while I'm on stage.

1075
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:16,930
I wasn't supposed to be there.

1076
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:19,010
Except, of course, to die.

1077
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:54,050
So all that time, she wasn't just protecting our family, she was protecting you too.

1078
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,370
Years later, she tracked me down.

1079
01:15:58,030 --> 01:15:59,430
Helped me see the truth.

1080
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,670
We traded ideas.

1081
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,030
I helped her fortify her cabin.

1082
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:06,230
We became friends.

1083
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:12,090
I even helped her get the best medical care I could, considering her condition.

1084
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:15,730
Iris said that you'd found somebody who stopped death and survived.

1085
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:16,730
Yes.

1086
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,990
And how do we do that?

1087
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,930
There are only two ways.

1088
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,790
By killing, or by dying.

1089
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:29,510
If you take a life, you get the time that person had left.

1090
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:30,010
What?

1091
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:32,290
No, I'm not gonna kill someone.

1092
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:33,810
Maybe we should let the guy finish.

1093
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:37,550
Then to truly break the cycle, you have to die.

1094
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:39,610
What does that mean?

1095
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:48,770
A long time ago, a young woman named Kimberly Corman found herself on death's list, just like you.

1096
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:52,590
And when her turn finally came, she died.

1097
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:53,930
Flatlined.

1098
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:59,190
But her doctor managed to bring her back, and that broke the chain.

1099
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:00,850
Well, alright then, we'll do that.

1100
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,210
What are you talking about?

1101
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:05,589
Why didn't Iris try that?

1102
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:06,650
It's risky.

1103
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:12,849
And if you fuck with death and lose, things can get very messy.

1104
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,900
Hang on, hang on.

1105
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:18,380
Okay, wait.

1106
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,940
There has to be another way.

1107
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,619
Please, you have to help us.

1108
01:17:23,099 --> 01:17:25,740
For years, people have been coming to me for advice.

1109
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,540
Well, I'm tired.

1110
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,460
I'm done with all that.

1111
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,900
And now I'm sick, just like Iris.

1112
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,920
There's no running this time.

1113
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,500
Fact is, you're all gonna die.

1114
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:42,160
And after that, I will too.

1115
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:49,090
Now that my old friend is gone, I'm retiring.

1116
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:49,990
So what?

1117
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,230
You're just gonna leave us here?

1118
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:57,110
I intend to enjoy the time I have left.

1119
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:00,690
And I suggest you do the same.

1120
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:02,750
Life is precious.

1121
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,850
Enjoy every single second.

1122
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,270
You never know when.

1123
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,140
That's fantastic.

1124
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:24,780
No.

1125
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,880
No, that can't be it.

1126
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:28,180
No.

1127
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,720
There has to be something here.

1128
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,360
There has to be another answer.

1129
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:36,980
He gave us an answer.

1130
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:38,840
Bobby's gotta die.

1131
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:39,880
Eric!

1132
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:41,880
Are you fucking insane?

1133
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:42,760
We're not killing Bobby.

1134
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,140
Am I the only guy that just listened to that dude?

1135
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,600
There's only one way.

1136
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:47,340
We kill Bobby.

1137
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,660
We resuscitate him, and then boom, you're all off death's list.

1138
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,160
Congratulations.

1139
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:53,060
There has to be something else, right?

1140
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:55,340
I mean, there has to be another solution, right, Steph?

1141
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:56,900
No.

1142
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,620
No, there's nothing else we can do.

1143
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,540
Okay, it's over.

1144
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:07,100
Hey, you gotta trust me on this, okay?

1145
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,480
She's giving up on you.

1146
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,540
I'm not going to.

1147
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:12,760
Look, Iris found a way to hold death off for decades.

1148
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:16,520
So will we.

1149
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,620
I trust that guy.

1150
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,760
Do you trust that guy?

1151
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,760
He was awesome.

1152
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,000
He was awesome.

1153
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,640
He was charismatic, and you know that as well.

1154
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,750
Eric and Bobby are gone.

1155
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:40,850
Shit.

1156
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:41,290
Shit!

1157
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,150
I don't think I like this.

1158
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:45,710
Hey, dude, we're in a hospital.

1159
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,130
Remember, there's doctors everywhere.

1160
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:50,530
We kill you, they bring you back, everybody's safe.

1161
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,990
We're heroes.

1162
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:54,170
That is literally the opposite of keeping you safe.

1163
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,670
Huh?

1164
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:58,570
You want to kill someone and take the time they have left?

1165
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:00,110
How?

1166
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:01,910
How would you even know how many years they have?

1167
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,040
No.

1168
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:15,070
Well, I mean, no.

1169
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,170
No, of course not.

1170
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:18,110
No, we would never.

1171
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:19,150
Don't touch those babies.

1172
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:23,010
Look, bottom line, flatline is your best option.

1173
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:25,310
What do you have to lose?

1174
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,960
How would we even do that?

1175
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,240
See, I got an idea.

1176
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:34,340
Yeah.

1177
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:37,540
But it's a little nuts.

1178
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:45,330
Your allergy is deadly, right?

1179
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:52,010
Well...

1180
01:20:52,010 --> 01:21:01,920
Look, all right, if I'm going out, it's not going to be on those sort of insulted bitches,

1181
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:02,460
all right?

1182
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,380
Give me those.

1183
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:07,780
Nice choice.

1184
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:19,530
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

1185
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:20,090
Come on.

1186
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,830
Hey, all right, come on.

1187
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:25,470
You know, maybe this is a sign so we can just...

1188
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:27,130
Ow!

1189
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:30,130
Hey, dude, maybe we can just bail now.

1190
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:31,390
I'm not giving up.

1191
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:37,410
Can you help?

1192
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:38,950
It's all right, we work here.

1193
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,030
Maintenance, it's fine.

1194
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:42,190
Put your headphones back on.

1195
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,330
Dude, it's going to fall.

1196
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:44,390
It's going to fall.

1197
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:47,310
It's falling!

1198
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,830
Hold it!

1199
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:56,680
Easy work.

1200
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,800
Now what?

1201
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:07,630
Hey, hang here.

1202
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:08,330
I've got to get something.

1203
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:10,850
Don't move.

1204
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:12,590
What are you talking about?

1205
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,040
Where's the bathroom?

1206
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:04,520
They weren't in the RV?

1207
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,080
No.

1208
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,660
Look, if Eric was trying to cut Bobby, where would they be?

1209
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,160
I don't know, but there's a million ways to die in a hospital.

1210
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:11,100
Can I help you?

1211
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,680
Excuse me?

1212
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,300
No, just...

1213
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,100
Lovely day today.

1214
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:23,820
Got much time left?

1215
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,120
I hope so.

1216
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,500
All the talent belonging to man devices there.

1217
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:38,990
Dude, turn the car back on.

1218
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:40,490
Come on, sit down.

1219
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,430
Sit, sit, sit.

1220
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:49,430
I'll be right back.

1221
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:50,610
Hey, where's your EpiPen?

1222
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:52,690
It's right here.

1223
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:53,150
Give it to me.

1224
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:54,330
Why?

1225
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:57,630
What is that?

1226
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:58,310
Give it.

1227
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:01,690
Listen, the whole idea is that you have to die.

1228
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:03,610
Remember, this keeps you alive.

1229
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:04,090
Now sit.

1230
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:06,790
Dude, we need to hurry.

1231
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:07,390
Come on, go.

1232
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:09,910
All right, meet up.

1233
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:20,240
Hey man, the plan's great, but, you know, if it doesn't work out...

1234
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,480
It's going to work, Bobby.

1235
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:21,960
Yeah.

1236
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:32,790
Yeah, but, you know, just in case, and I die for real, will you just, um...

1237
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:34,610
Will you look after Paco?

1238
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:36,650
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1239
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:42,610
Dude, I'm just saying, turtles live to be like 100 years old, and it's like, look at me, look at me.

1240
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:46,830
Brother, I'm not going to take care of Paco because you are going to be okay.

1241
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:51,250
Me and you, we are going to fix things for everyone, right now.

1242
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,150
Honestly, I'm not going to let you die.

1243
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,360
Technically, I'm not going to let you die, but then I'm going to bring you back.

1244
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,280
Come on.

1245
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:09,820
You got this.

1246
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,080
Oh my God.

1247
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,240
What?

1248
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,260
It's very good, I know.

1249
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:46,640
So what?

1250
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,860
Okay, other than good, what are you feeling?

1251
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,000
Nothing.

1252
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:55,060
You got to be kidding me.

1253
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,460
What, you're telling me you're not allergic anymore?

1254
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:57,280
I don't know, man.

1255
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:09,980
Hey, you're doing it.

1256
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:10,940
Hey, you're doing it.

1257
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,240
Bobby, you're doing it.

1258
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:14,440
Hey, I'm here with you.

1259
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:15,740
I'm here with you.

1260
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,160
Hey, hey, I can't give you that.

1261
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,000
Bobby, Bobby.

1262
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,600
Hey, hey.

1263
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:22,960
Wait.

1264
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:25,380
Bobby, just go for it and play.

1265
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,070
Bobby, in the wheelchair.

1266
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,220
Try calling him again.

1267
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,440
This is the only way we can do this.

1268
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:47,030
Oh my God.

1269
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:28,530
Yeah.

1270
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:03,360
Why is Eric dead if he's not related to Iris?

1271
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:11,600
When you fuck with death, things get messy.

1272
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:17,840
We have to get out of here.

1273
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:20,950
It's not safe.

1274
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:23,450
And go where?

1275
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:26,330
Nowhere is safe.

1276
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,010
Except Iris' cabin.

1277
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,090
She was able to survive there for decades.

1278
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,530
Yeah, and then she got her face blown off.

1279
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:39,430
She only died because she left the cabin.

1280
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:44,110
Outside is dangerous, but inside is the safest place that there is.

1281
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,840
It's the only place where we have any advantage.

1282
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:55,520
So we just lock ourselves in a cabin forever?

1283
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:01,360
Not you.

1284
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:04,200
Me.

1285
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,060
Mom, you can't leave.

1286
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:08,040
We just got you back.

1287
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:12,280
If anybody's gonna live in that cabin, it's me.

1288
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:16,560
And as long as I am alive, death can't touch you.

1289
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:18,220
Mom, let me do this.

1290
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:20,000
He'll never let you get there on your own.

1291
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,000
But I can see him coming.

1292
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,740
We have to do this together.

1293
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:33,240
You better.

1294
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:42,940
Let's go.

1295
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,360
Okay.

1296
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:06,860
You should drive.

1297
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:07,620
Yeah.

1298
01:32:09,311 --> 01:32:10,140
Shit!

1299
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,020
Look at this place.

1300
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:21,090
It's gonna be impossible to get through that gate.

1301
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,920
He's about to make a move.

1302
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,180
I don't know what it is.

1303
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,960
We need to get you inside now.

1304
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:49,040
Wait.

1305
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,220
Wait, what?

1306
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:06,250
Stop!

1307
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:27,520
Okay, let's get inside.

1308
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,380
Shoot!

1309
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:34,560
What?

1310
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:42,840
No, no, no.

1311
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:43,880
Don't wait for me.

1312
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:44,620
Just get inside.

1313
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,600
Steph, if you get inside, I'll be safe.

1314
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:47,380
Go.

1315
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:48,720
Okay, come on.

1316
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:40,210
I'll save you, sister.

1317
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:44,720
I'm gonna stay alive as long as I can.

1318
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:15,970
Charlie.

1319
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:20,090
Are you okay?

1320
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:23,210
Just breathe.

1321
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:24,230
Breathe.

1322
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,680
Charlie, what happened?

1323
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,120
Are you okay?

1324
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:38,840
You died, and I brought you back.

1325
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,980
You brought me back.

1326
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,780
We're safe now.

1327
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,940
Mom.

1328
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:04,160
She saved us.

1329
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,000
Mom.

1330
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:22,620
Let's go home.

1331
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:11,530
Well, there he is.

1332
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:13,050
Wow, okay, Charlie.

1333
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:15,050
All right, give us a spin.

1334
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:20,620
You look really good.

1335
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:22,500
I'm a great stylist.

1336
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,400
Come on, we'll be late.

1337
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:34,460
Where's Jenny?

1338
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:38,100
I think she's still inside, didn't we?

1339
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,760
Here, let me fix this.

1340
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,770
I'm really happy you could be here for this.

1341
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:46,750
Me too.

1342
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:49,290
Oh.

1343
01:39:50,330 --> 01:39:50,770
You okay?

1344
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,070
Yeah.

1345
01:39:56,590 --> 01:40:03,220
Can I have one cookie, please?

1346
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:40,010
Thank you.

1347
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:42,350
Steph, I want you to meet Jenny's dad, Dr. Reddick.

1348
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:44,070
Hey, Bart, nice to meet you.

1349
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:44,690
You too.

1350
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:46,670
We just adore Charlie.

1351
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:48,830
And I understand he's quite the lifesaver.

1352
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:50,430
Oh, yeah, you heard about that.

1353
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:52,970
He brought me back from the dead.

1354
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:58,750
Yeah.

1355
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:00,450
What?

1356
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:02,030
Well, technically, you weren't dead.

1357
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:04,710
What?

1358
01:41:04,710 --> 01:41:08,374
Well, I mean, if you were unconscious and Charlie got you breathing again, 

1359
01:41:08,574 --> 01:41:10,011
then your heart didn't stop.

1360
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:12,470
But regardless, way to go, Charlie.

1361
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:14,930
So she wasn't dead?

1362
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:15,910
Exactly.

1363
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,820
She was lucky Charlie was there.

1364
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,360
Yeah, everything happens for a reason.

1365
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:25,140
Jenny!

1366
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:27,280
Jenny.

1367
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:32,500
Jenny, you look like a million bucks.

1368
01:41:41,606 --> 01:41:42,680
You okay?

1369
01:41:47,909 --> 01:41:49,589
Run!

1370
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:03,730
- Oh my god, that was close.
- Are you okay ?

1371
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:05,068
Yeah.
