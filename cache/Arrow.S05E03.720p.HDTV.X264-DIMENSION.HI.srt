00:00:00,795 --> 00:00:02,642
Oliver:
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,983 --> 00:00:04,248
After 5 years in Hell,

3
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:06,249
I returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:07,717
to save my city.

5
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,919
Today I fight that war
on two fronts.

6
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:12,722
By day, I lead Star City
as its mayor,

7
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:14,824
but by night,
I am someone else.

8
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:17,093
I am something else.

9
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:19,596
I am the Green Arrow.

10
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:21,564
Previously
on "Arrow" and "Flash..."

11
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:22,999
Felicity:
You ran back in time

12
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:24,367
and then came back

13
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:25,568
and noticed that things
were different?

14
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,736
Who's that young boy
with Dig?

15
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:27,742
He didn't have
a kid before?

16
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:28,503
Baby Sarah.

17
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:29,573
Baby John.

18
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:30,573
John: No!

19
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:31,574
You son of a bitch!

20
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:32,709
Walker: I used your gun.

21
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:35,745
No one will ever
believe your story.

22
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:37,080
Police never caught
your brother's shooter.

23
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:38,314
You leave Andy out of this.

24
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:40,116
Oliver: Floyd Lawton,
he is the sniper.

25
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:41,884
I'll kill you
for what you did to Andy.

26
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:43,586
I got space for you
right here,

27
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:46,155
right next to your brother.

28
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,624
Oliver:
I can't do it alone.

29
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:49,158
I need a team.

30
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,661
You're not just joining
up with the Green Arrow.

31
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:53,129
You'd be joining up
with me.

32
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:54,130
I'm in.

33
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:55,598
Me, too.

34
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,377
So what are we
looking at here?

35
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:08,411
Carl Roberto.

36
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:09,912
Frequent flyer
at Iron Heights.

37
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:11,147
Seems like the only
thing he's good at

38
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:12,181
is getting arrested.

39
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:13,216
Curtis:
He's not much of a challenge

40
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:14,617
for the Green Arrow.

41
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:15,752
Felicity: He's not looking
for a challenge.

42
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,086
This is about teaching
the 4 of you

43
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:18,121
what happens out there
and how to handle it.

44
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:19,656
Well, I'm up
for any lesson

45
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:21,224
that doesn't involve him
punching us in the face.

46
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:24,527
Wait. He hits you guys?

47
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:31,834
Oh, man. Dude's going
to get it now.

48
00:01:37,676 --> 00:01:39,809
Always assume that
the target is armed.

49
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,377
Always assume
that they're dangerous.

50
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,846
Stardust.

51
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:45,114
Who's Stardust?

52
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:46,716
It's not a "who."
It's a "what."

53
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:48,017
Latest designer drug.

54
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:50,520
Makes PCP look like
children's aspirin.

55
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:52,388
I want your supplier.

56
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,290
I can't.
He'll kill me.

57
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:56,359
What do you think
I'm going to do?

58
00:01:57,896 --> 00:02:00,863
His interrogation technique
is a little unrefined.

59
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:03,333
He's not going
to kill him, is he?

60
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:06,169
That's a--that's
a terrific question.

61
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:07,403
You're not going
to do it.

62
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:10,006
Give me a name,
and I won't have to.

63
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,040
Word's out on you, man.

64
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,075
You'll kill,

65
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:14,410
but only when
you have to.

66
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:17,547
Son of a bitch!

67
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:18,781
Oh, don't worry.

All right!

70
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:23,252
All right.

71
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:25,188
His name's Sampson.

72
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,255
Derek Sampson.

73
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:27,390
Where can I find him?

74
00:02:27,392 --> 00:02:28,958
I don't know.

75
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,059
I pick up a package
on a different corner each night,

76
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,060
and never from him.

77
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:32,061
Give me the package.

78
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:33,062
The Stardust?

79
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:34,831
Sure, it's in my pocket.

80
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,101
Good idea.

81
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:39,869
You really could
use a high,

82
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,105
chill out a bit.

83
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:45,675
I'm not going to kill you,

84
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:49,846
but I can't guarantee
you'll walk away from this.

So what did we learn?

88
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:01,257
Don't piss
Oliver off.

89
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:02,759
Like we needed
that lesson.

90
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,394
Information, ok,

91
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:05,728
is the currency
of our business.

92
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,096
When Oliver
gets back here,

93
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:08,698
he's going to ask me
to analyze the drugs

94
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,666
so we can find out
where it's being manufactured.

95
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,335
I hate drugs.

96
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:14,070
Not in a recreational sense.

97
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,738
I have a life,
like anyone else.

98
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,673
It's just--I saw what
all the gang violence

99
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,475
did to my hometown.

100
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:21,744
Um, I'm going
to make DVDs

101
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:23,312
of tonight's
surveillance footage.

102
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:24,847
Oliver wants you
to study them

103
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,482
like a football player
would break down a game tape.

104
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:27,850
And then he'll let us
get on the field?

105
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:29,285
I'm guessing not.

106
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:31,020
That guy is seriously
overestimating my patience.

107
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:32,722
Oliver: I am,

108
00:03:32,724 --> 00:03:34,457
because I didn't think that
you had any patience, Rene.

109
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,092
- Cute.
- Let's analyze this

110
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:38,227
and see if we can figure out
where it was manufactured.

111
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:40,496
Look, analysis and forensics
is cool and all,

112
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:42,298
but that stuff
takes time.

113
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,901
I know the neighborhood
where this dealer's slinging out of.

114
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:46,969
I think I can guess where
the Stardust is being made.

115
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:49,739
Rene, we don't deal
in maybes and guesswork.

116
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,340
Or maybe rich boy
Mayor Queen

00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:53,509
doesn't know
the streets so good.

to your training.

Sorry about the fake
radio call,

but I didn't have
your e-mail address,

we should meet.

was the backup plan.

164
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:40,416
You believe me, right?

165
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:42,051
Johnny, how can you
even ask that?

166
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,586
Lyla, I love you.

167
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:47,189
Tell John Jr. I love him
and that I'll be all right.

168
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,903
Hey, get me out of here!

169
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:03,673
You can't leave me
here with him!

170
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,274
Hey, John.

171
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:08,110
Looks like we're
cellmates again.

172
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:11,247
Ain't that something?

173
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,356
Your honor,
we need to talk.

174
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:21,657
Where'd you go last night?

175
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:22,692
I looked around the theater
after the movie,

176
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:24,093
and I couldn't find you.

177
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:25,194
Mr. Mayor, we need to take
your security detail

178
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,195
more seriously.

179
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:27,430
I was serious when I said

180
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:28,931
that I didn't want
a security detail.

181
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:31,267
Look where that got me.

182
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:33,069
Late for a meeting.

183
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:36,505
What are you doing here?

184
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:37,907
You weren't supposed
to be here until 9:00.

185
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,842
Our meeting was
scheduled for 8:00.

186
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:41,944
Exactly.

187
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:44,513
Who's this?

188
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:45,982
This is Susan Williams,

189
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:47,783
and she is officially
my least favorite person

190
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:49,318
this is Susan Williams,
on the planet.

191
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,620
Susan: It's not just
that Oliver Queen's

192
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:51,654
pick for deputy mayor

193
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:54,123
has a history
of alcohol abuse.

194
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,158
Recent reports confirm
that Quentin Lance

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,326
suffered a relapse

196
00:06:57,328 --> 00:06:59,295
right before Mayor Queen
appointed him.

197
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:01,030
I told you not
to offer Quentin

198
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:02,298
a job in the administration,

199
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,367
and you decide to offer him
Deputy Mayor?

200
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:06,869
Ok, so that's what those
5 voicemails were about.

201
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:08,270
The thing that
I told you not to do?

202
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:10,439
I listened to what you
told me not to do,

203
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:13,442
but then I decided to do what
I thought was right, anyway,

204
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,811
and guess who I got
that one from.

205
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,113
I'm an elected official.

206
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:19,515
I have to answer to voters
and a free press.

207
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,751
Unravel this, Speedy.

208
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:23,052
Make it go away.

209
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:24,387
That's going to be
a little hard to do

210
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:25,521
now that the story's
already out there.

211
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:26,789
I don't care.

212
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,993
You made this mess.
You clean it up.

213
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:38,000
Anatoly: Some nights,
I still feel the sea,

214
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:40,302
rocking, rocking.

215
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:44,006
In that cage,
on that boat, the Amazo.

216
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,007
Do you remember?

217
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,008
Yeah.

218
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,410
Then I wake up.

219
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:51,113
I realize where I am
with family, friends.

220
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:52,348
You are only one

221
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,949
who knows what
I went through,

222
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:55,518
that nightmare.

223
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,753
Here. I brought you
something to drink.

224
00:07:57,755 --> 00:08:00,256
No. No, I can't.

225
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:01,357
Not vodka.

226
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,925
It's water.

227
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:06,662
How you feel, my friend?

228
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:07,897
Like I might have
made a mistake.

229
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,099
But what of Kovar?

230
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,834
You still wish
to kill him, no?

231
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:14,103
I told you before,
Bratva only way.

232
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:15,905
I think I'll take
my chances.

233
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:18,374
This about other men
being killed?

234
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:19,709
This was first test.

235
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,710
Two more left.

236
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,144
What was the point
of the test?

237
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:24,113
To trust Bratva.

238
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:25,648
Well, I'm sorry, Anatoly,

239
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,383
but I don't trust Bratva

240
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:31,253
after I watched them
execute 3 innocent men.

241
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:34,090
Ah...

242
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,392
There is miscommunication.

243
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:40,096
You want to leave, leave,
but come with me first.

244
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:43,165
I have something
I need to show you.

245
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:49,805
I cannot believe
I let you talk me into this.

246
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:51,407
Yeah.

247
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,477
I'm a little surprised,
too, but it's just recon.

248
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,045
If it's just recon,

249
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:57,480
then how come we didn't
bring along Rory and Curtis?

250
00:08:57,482 --> 00:09:00,015
Because Curtis would just
tell mommy and daddy.

251
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,684
And Rory?

252
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:04,120
Guy just weirds me out.

253
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:06,322
Ready?

254
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,575
Knew this would
be the place.

255
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:28,177
When's Queen
going to trust me?

256
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:29,345
Evelyn: I'm sure it'll be
right after he finds out

257
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:31,313
we went here without
his permission.

258
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:32,715
The night's still young.

259
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:33,783
Bring the Green Arrow back,

260
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:35,017
bust this place up.

261
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,186
You mean he will
bust this place up.

262
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:40,122
He'll never let us
get out in that field.

263
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,795
It's easier to ask
for forgiveness than permission.

264
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:46,996
You brought that?

265
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:48,697
What happened to this
just being recon?

266
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,933
We did the recon part.

Mrs. Conahan, this person

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,115
I have the anti-crime unit
working overtime on this.

272
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,121
Trust me.

We will get justice
for your husband.

Thought that was my job.

275
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:32,661
Good-bye.

276
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:34,630
I'm sorry. You are?

277
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:36,565
Pissed. Royally. Off.

278
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm getting that.

279
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:39,368
What I don't understand
is who you are

280
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,136
and what you're doing
in my office.

00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,637
I'm sorry
that we haven't met.

284
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,738
I'm buried
up to my eyeballs

285
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,306
in motion practice
and indictments

286

with a staff who's
barely made it past

287
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,309
3 rounds of budget cuts,

288
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,444
so how about we save
the pleasantries

289
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:53,511
for the next fundraiser

290
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,013
and get down
to why I am so...

291
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,514
You're so pissed off.

292
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,515
Royally.

00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,817
Remember Vertigo?

Believe it or not,
I tried to buy some once.

295
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,553
Yeah, I believe it.

00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:02,554
Well, what's hitting

worse.

Stardust.

299
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,424
I'm not as out of touch
as most people think,

300
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,393
but I do have some work
to get done, Mr. Chase,

301
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,528
so why don't we get to the bottom
of why you're so pissed off?

302
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,930
I've been building a case
against the dealer,

303
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,131
Derek Sampson.

304
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,232
I was going to flip him,

305
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,234
but last night
somebody killed him.

306
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,235
Rival dealer?

307
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,737
A vigilante.

308
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,938
That doesn't sound
like the Green Arrow.

309
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,410
Not him. Some idiot
in a hockey mask.

310
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,913
I'm sorry. Did you say
a hockey mask?

311
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,783
Everything ok, boss?

312
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,352
A Stardust dealer was killed
last night by a vigilante.

313
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,387
Lots running around
the city these days--

314
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,388
Wearing a hockey mask!

315
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,655
Hey, short fry
was there, too!

316
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:38,690
Thanks, Rene.

317
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,758
Rory and I didn't,
though,

318
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,126
just for the record.

319
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,193
Rene: Ok, I ain't going
to deny I was there,

320
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,528
but neither
were you, man.

321
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,296
This guy was all sorts
of nutso, loco!

322
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,598
It was either him or me!

323
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,267
You never should have
been in that position.

00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,036
with one less dealer
on the streets?

326
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,438
Have you told
the mayor that?

327
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,574
You have no ability
to think big picture!

328
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,443
Stardust is still
out there.

329
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,711
The D.A.'s office
had a plan,

330
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,146
they were going
to flip Sampson,

331
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,615
and then he was going
to give up the suppliers.

332
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,383
They can't do that anymore!

333
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,785
How about you put
an arrow in my other leg,

334
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,753
and we'll call it even?

335
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:13,291
Last week you said
you needed to be able to trust me.

336
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,592
Fine.

337
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,095
Well, I need to be
able to trust you.

338
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:22,300
If I can't, then why am I
wasting my time with you?

339
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,974
Never in my entire life
did I think

340
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,611
that I would meet somebody
more stubborn than him.

341
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,915
I would have lost
that bet.

342
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,787
Is this normal behavior
around here?

343
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,622
More than
I like to admit.

344

346
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:54,666
Sorry.

347

My friend's visiting
from Marseilles.

348
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,303
No problem, Miss Williams.

349
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,738
I really appreciate you taking
the time to meet with me.

350
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,440
Anything for a fan.

351
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,844
I'm assuming you watched
the other night's broadcast.

352
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,545
Yes, actually, I--

353
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,014
I really appreciated
all the wonderful things

354
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,485
you were saying
about my brother's administration.

355
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,620
Can you give us
a minute?

356
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,356
You're right.

357
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,124
I was out of line.

358
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,260
My producer, he's always
pushing me to be edgy,

359
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,029
to do stories that will generate
Internet traffic.

360
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,698
Sometimes I push
too far.

361
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, thank you.

362
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,535
I really appreciate that.

363
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,703
Of course.

364
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,404
I mean, we're
coworkers in a way.

365
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,139
Um, coworker to coworker,

366
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,308
I was hoping
you'd do me a favor.

367
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,245
I need you to walk back
your story.

368
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,081
The truth is Oliver
hasn't appointed

369
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,582
Quentin Lance
Deputy Mayor yet.

370
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,017
Well, that's not what
my sources tell me.

371
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,819
Well, they're wrong,
because, honestly,

372
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,087
my brother
doesn't even know

373
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,490
that I offered him the job.

374
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,692
Well, that certainly
changes things.

375
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,561
- Yeah.
- I'll update the story.

376
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,695
Really?

377
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,697
Coworkers, right?

378
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,937
How the hell
are you alive?

379
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:10,074
Great question,
but you know the answer.

380
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,709
They never found
your body.

381
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,078
A hell of a world
we live in, ain't it?

382
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
I survive a freaking
building exploding under me

383
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,650
only to get pinched
a couple months later,

384
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:22,287
and it is hard going on the lam
with an eye patch.

What's your excuse
for being here?

00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,495
I reenlisted
back into the army.

00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:33,531
It didn't go good.

388
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,167
I can't really picture you
ever giving up your day job

00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,569
as a superhero.

390

I just couldn't
do it anymore.

00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,338
Why's that?

I'm not here to play 20 questions
with you, Lawton.

Found in a body
of unknown chemicals.

398
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,760
Based on the lack
of epidermis erosion,

399
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,129
the chemicals
were non-acidic.

No...Which makes you
not my type.

oh, yeah, I promised--

anything, Felicity.

sent the missile
to Monument Point.

I sent the missile
to Havenrock.

444
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,945
I killed tens
of thousands of people.

Hey, Rory,
thanks for coming back.

Oliver should be here

What happened?

458
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:12,518
First metahumans,
then magic,

459
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,386
and now you can add
into the mix zombies.

460
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,754
The guy that Rene killed

461
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,190
is kind of still
walking around.

462
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,758
Sampson is not a zombie.

463
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,427
According the coroner's
toxicology workup,

464
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:23,629
Sampson's body was infused
with a mixture of chemicals

465
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:25,164
that must have put his body
into a state

466
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,498
that fooled the paramedics.

467
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,666
It was only a matter
of time before he woke up.

468
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,001
And kicked Oliver's ass.

469
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:30,269
He didn't kick Oliver's ass,

470
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:31,637
and can we please
not say things like that

471
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:34,740
when Oliver could enter
in, like, any second?

472
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:35,974
Like now, see?

473
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:36,975
Oliver:
I need to find this guy

474
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,444
before he hurts
anyone else.

475
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:40,679
I'm tapped into all
satellites and C-C feeds.

476
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,247
What happened?

477
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,116
Physiology changed.

478
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,985
Enhanced strength,
and I don't think he can feel pain.

479
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,353
Felicity thinks
it's from exposure

480
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,721
to whatever chemicals
were in the vat

481
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,323
that Rene
dumped him into.

482
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:52,691
Any way to reverse it?

483
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,193
I could run some tests,
but it would take time,

484
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:55,727
and I'd rather keep my eye

485
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,496
on the "find Sampson before
he hurts anybody else" ball.

486
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:59,398
Curtis: Well, good thing
I was a biochemistry major in college.

487
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,333
I'll get on it.

488
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,336
Text me as soon
as you have anything.

489
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,904
We can't let the cops
get to him first.

490
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,873
I want to help, too.

491
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,374
I think you've
done enough.

492
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,310
I'm sorry about before,
but I get it now.

493
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:12,711
I'll do whatever
you need.

494
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,046
Oliver: What I need

495
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:15,681
is to trust that when
I do ask for your help,

496
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:18,016
you're not immediately going
to make the problem worse.

497
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:19,751
Rory: He said
he was sorry.

498
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:21,053
Let us help.

499
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:22,888
Yeah. We could
canvass the city.

500
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,390
After what happened the last time
you went looking for Sampson?

501
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,392
Pass.

502
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,511
Da.

503
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,588
Thank you.

504
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,011
The recruit
was a murderer?

505
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,345
Yeah.

506
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:21,480
Police catch him,

507
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:22,948
but he's son
to friend of Kovar

508
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,583
so he goes free.

509
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,952
Bratva step in
to bring justice.

510
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,321
How is recruiting him
into the Bratva justice?

511
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:31,757
But he was not
recruited, was he?

512
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,493
What if I wasn't the one
to ring the bell, Anatoly?

513
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,094
We still bring justice.

514
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,462
If you're trying
to convince me

515
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,564
to trust the Bratva,

516
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,098
you are not doing
a very good job.

517
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,634
You must trust process.

518
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,903
Not everything
what it seems.

519
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:47,606
To defeat Kovar,
you need army.

520
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:51,109
Bratva army.

521
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:52,844
You've come this far.

522
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:54,780
Why give up now?

523
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:01,954
6 of hearts.

524
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:04,990
Come on, 6 of hearts,
where are you?

525
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,592
My kingdom
for a 6 of hearts.

526
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,061
You shut up 5 for minutes,
I won't have to kill you.

527
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:11,163
Whoo! There's that temper.

528
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:12,664
Good thing your kid won't
have to grow up with it

529
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,866
like your brother did, huh?

530
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,368
What'd you say to me?

531
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,770
How's all that
going, anyway?

532
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,807
You ever find that group
that paid me to off him?

533
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:22,841
They didn't.

534
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,977
What's that, now?

535
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:28,146
They didn't
want him dead.

536
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:30,048
He was alive.

537
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,384
Like I said,
hell of a world, ain't it?

538
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,453
I mean...

539
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:40,158
Wait, why did you say
"was alive" just now? Huh?

540
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,027
Hello, John?
Anybody home?

541
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,629
Because I killed him.

542
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:50,869
So all that hate
that you poured into me

543
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,537
for killing your brother,

544
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,907
you really should have been
pouring it into yourself.

545
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,448
I was just on my way
to see you.

546
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,583
What can I help you with?

547
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:06,351
SCPD is working
on locating Sampson.

548
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:09,187
I want to start with
a search of his last known address,

549
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:10,856
but Judge Pittson won't
sign the search warrant

550
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:12,991
on Sampson's
prior residence.

551
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:14,393
Pittson. I helped
Pittson get elected.

552
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:15,761
Which is why I'm
talking to you.

553
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:17,029
Could you lean on her?

554
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:19,097
Absolutely.
All hands on deck.

555
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,432
Thank you.

556
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:22,434
Hey, you--you probably
don't remember this,

557
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:24,236
but we actually
met 12 years ago.

558
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,804
You tried to pick up
my girlfriend.

559
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:27,272
Ha ha ha!

560
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:29,241
I did a lot of things
back then

561
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,776
that I'm not
especially proud of,

562
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:33,211
but I'm sure she ended up
with the better man.

563
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:34,212
Hell, no.

564
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:35,213
She went home with you.

565
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,548
Heh heh heh!

566
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,684
It's ok.
I don't hold grudges.

567
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:40,852
Looks like your Chief of Staff
needs a minute.

568
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:41,887
Let me know when you've
talked to Pittson.

569
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:42,888
I appreciate it.

570
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,256
Of course.

571
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,695
How did it go
with that reporter?

572
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,763
Well, I thought
it went well.

573
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,131
Thought?

574
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,299
Um...

575
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:56,968
Susan, on screen:
Unfortunately, Mayor Queen

576
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,537
doesn't seem to have
the first clue

577
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,073
of what's going on within
his own administration.

578
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:02,708
- For those of you...
- I'm so sorry.

579
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,609
What did you say
to this woman?

580
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,745
That part's coming next.

581
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:09,214
Susan, on screen: But "chosen" may be
too strong of a word.

582
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,983
Not only was a disgraced
public official rehired by the city

583
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,485
in an even
higher position,

584
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:16,154
Mayor Queen wasn't
even aware of it.

585
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:19,291
The decision was made
by his sister.

586
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,593
Ok, look, I am going
to issue a statement

587
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:24,262
taking full responsibility
for this, ok?

588
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:25,931
And then I am going
to offer you

589
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,933
my letter
of resignation.

590
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,267
- Thea--
- No, Ollie, look,

591
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,302
you said it yourself.

592
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:33,171
I made this mess.

593
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,474
I'm going to go
clean it up.

594
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,347
You know it's only
a matter of time

595
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:43,715
before Rory
figures it out.

596
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:44,983
What?

597
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,818
The you and Havenrock
connection.

598
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,986
I mean, you can't seem
to be around the guy

599
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,020
for more than
two minutes

600
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:50,422
without acting widgy,

601
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:51,690
and sooner or later,
he's going to ask why.

602
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:53,525
Well, I will take
the "later." Thank you.

603
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:55,327
Have you talked this
out with Oliver?

604
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,829
No. Oliver and I don't have that type
of relationship anymore,

605
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:58,830
and you're right,

606
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,298
I am acting widgy

607
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,800
because having him
on the team

608
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:03,335
is like having a constant
reminder about what I did.

609
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,636
So clear the air.

610
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,938
If the past 4 years have
taught you anything,

611
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,574
it should be that keeping
secrets never works out.

612
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:10,542
I hardly even know Rory,

613
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:11,943
and what I do know
about him

614
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:13,512
is that he has several-
thousand-year-old rags

615
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,147
that he can mystically
use to strangle me.

616
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,282
He must be great
at parties.

617
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:19,651
I think that you need
to just trust the fact

618
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,453
that he will
not kill you

619
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:23,889
and trust that he may be able
to see things clearer than you do

620
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,825
and know that this
wasn't your fault.

621
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,197
Whoever called
this meeting,

622
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,799
you best step out.

623
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,435
The text I got came
from Sampson's cell.

624
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:38,737
Sampson is dead.

625
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:42,073
Sampson:
What'd Mark Twain say?

626
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,542
"Reports of my death

627
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:47,612
have been greatly
exaggerated."

628
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:49,748
Man, he wasn't kidding.

629
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,583
Man: Righteous.

630
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:54,619
So we're back in business?

631
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,620
Stardust.

632
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:57,689
No, I'm thinking...

633
00:25:57,691 --> 00:25:58,890
Bigger.

634
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,058
You go bigger,

635
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,359
you draw attention
from Tobias Church.

636
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,195
I'm not afraid
of Church no more.

637
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,497
He should be
afraid of me.

638
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:09,935
You ever see
"Lethal Weapon"?

639
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:12,938
My favorite scene.

640
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,973
Gary Busey, man.

641
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:17,509
That guy, he could act.

642
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:24,382
If you can't feel pain,
you can't be stopped.

643
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,917
So we all get
this treatment,

644
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,055
and we take back this
city from Tobias Church!

645
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,224
[Men hooting and cheering]

646
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,087
I didn't know
you were still here.

647
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:47,488
Ohh.

648
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,357
That looks painful.

649
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,059
It's par for the course.

650
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:53,528
How'd things go
at city hall?

651
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,662
[Sighs]

652
00:26:54,664 --> 00:26:55,730
Ooh, that bad, huh?

653
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:57,532
Channel 52.

654
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:02,003
Susan, on monitor:
Unfortunately, Mayor Queen

655
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:03,604
doesn't seem to have
the first clue

656
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:05,740
of what's going on
within his own administration...

657
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:07,208
I already
don't like her.

658
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,711
Well, I can't keep
my people in line

659
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,881
as mayor
or as Green Arrow.

660
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:17,251
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

661
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:18,252
Shakespeare.

662
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:19,687
Or Tupac.

663
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:22,490
So is this Green Arrow
brooding or mayor brooding?

664
00:27:22,492 --> 00:27:23,691
What's happening
with Susan Williams

665
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:25,059
is just politics.

666
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,327
Green Arrow brooding.
That's excellent,

667
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:27,762
because I have more
experience at that.

668
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:30,832
Rene didn't listen
to what I said,

669
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:34,202
and he created
a superhuman.

670
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:36,137
Well, I used
to have a dog.

671
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:37,939
Lucky.

672
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:41,409
He was adorable
but peed on everything.

673
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,110
My trainer told me that
next time it happened

674
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:44,779
that I should roll up
a piece of newspaper

675
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:47,615
and smack myself
on the head

676
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:49,750
because it was
my fault.

677
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,853
Lucky was just doing
as dogs do.

678
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:53,087
You're pushing this
"Wild Dog" codename thing

679
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,288
a bit too far.

680
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,090
My point is,
when you're in charge,

681
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,959
everything your team
does is on you.

682
00:27:57,961 --> 00:27:59,694
Even what Rene did?

683
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:01,462
He was right about being able
to locate Sampson's operation.

684
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:02,730
If you listened to him

685
00:28:02,732 --> 00:28:04,065
instead of shutting
him down--

686
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,466
Right. Then none of this
would have happened.

687
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:07,602
And we both know why
you shut him down.

688
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:10,805
Because I don't
trust him.

689
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:12,406
Like you said,
if you don't--

690
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:14,108
if you won't,

691
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,144
why are you
wasting your time?

692
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:18,512
[Beeping]

693
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:19,647
What's that?

694
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:20,748
I'm running
an algorithm to ping

695
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,583
in case anything
unusual happens.

696
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:24,619
Unusual? That's casting
a pretty wide net.

697
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,054
Well, all my other nets
are coming up empty.

698
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,589
Break-in at Allman
Industrial.

699
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:29,790
That could be anyone.

700
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:30,925
Well, do you know anyone
besides Sampson

701
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:32,093
who can get shot
by security guards

702
00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:33,594
and then just shrug off
the bullets?

703
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:35,162
- What'd he steal?
- I don't know.

704
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:36,797
It's going to take a lot
of time and typing.

705
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,100
Their warehouse
is the size of 3 football fields.

706
00:28:39,102 --> 00:28:40,301
Let me know
what you find out.

707
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,335
Ok.

708
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:42,803
Wait--wait.
Where are you going?

709
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,605
To get the team.

710
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:50,645
I ran Walker
through every data base.

711
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,113
Initially,
he came up clean,

712
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:54,715
but there are
some financial irregularities.

713
00:28:54,717 --> 00:28:56,817
I want you to stop.

714
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,186
What?

715
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:01,322
Stop digging.

716
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,291
I'm not going to fight
these charges.

717
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:04,659
Johnny, that's insane.

718
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,993
Actually,
it's the first thing

719
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,896
that's made sense to me
in a long while.

720
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:10,364
Ever since I killed Andy.

721
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:12,466
You think you need
to be punished?

722
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,235
I know I do.

723
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:24,745
Lyla, I didn't have
to pull that trigger,

724
00:29:24,747 --> 00:29:28,683
but I did.

725
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,084
Something's wrong
with me, baby.

726
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:31,652
Then let me help you.

727
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:34,822
We will figure
this out together.

728
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:36,357
When I thought Lawton
killed Andy,

729
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,561
all I wanted to do was bring
his murderer to justice.

730
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:43,631
I still do.

731
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:45,933
Floyd Lawton was
an assassin for hire.

732
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:48,602
You're a good man,

733
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:50,137
and you're alive.

734
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:51,872
Floyd Lawton
is long dead.

735
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,275
No, Lyla, he's not.
He's--

736
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,348
Lyla: Johnny?

737
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,583
Johnny.

738
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,921
Stop fighting
for me, Lyla.

739
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:11,392
I have.

740
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:23,871
You won't get me
this time.

741
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:25,906
I've won 8 in a row.

742
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,008
Aah!

743
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,809
Are you sure
you were an Olympian?

744
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:30,044
Having quick reflexes

745
00:30:30,046 --> 00:30:32,013
is not the only quality
in an Olympian.

746
00:30:32,015 --> 00:30:33,180
Ok, there are
other things

747
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:35,716
like determination
and stubbornness.

748
00:30:35,718 --> 00:30:37,585
I guess a sense of fashion
isn't one of them.

749
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:39,887
Come on, man.
Where did you get that jacket?

750
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:41,922
It's retro in all
the wrong ways.

751
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,958
Wait, you don't know
"Fair Play,"

752
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,326
Terry Sloane?

753
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:47,895
Terry Sloane?

754
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:49,363
Mr. Terrific?

755
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:52,066
The greatest wrestler
in the history of wrestling.

756
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:53,801
He was so good
that he wore an outfit

757
00:30:53,803 --> 00:30:54,935
with the words
"Fair Play"

758
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:55,936
written across it.

759
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,304
Like, I'm so good,

760
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:58,806
I don't even need
to cheat to beat you.

761
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:00,408
He's kind of my idol.

762
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,809
Did you have a little
crush on him, too?

763
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:04,145
Hey, that's
besides the point.

764
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,485
Something
on your mind, boss?

765
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,154
You have a good
natural form.

766
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:14,388
Because it's
not natural.

767
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,956
I've been working
on it for years.

768
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,591
Rene, if I've been
too hard on you

769
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:19,060
it's because I want
to make sure

770
00:31:19,062 --> 00:31:20,661
that you're taking this
as seriously as I am.

771
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:23,064
I wouldn't be here if I
wasn't taking it serious.

772
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:25,833
You were right about
Sampson's operation.

773
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:26,934
You have a knack for this,

774
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:30,805
and I should have
trusted you.

775
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,173
Whoa.

776
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,008
That almost sounded
like an apology.

777
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,543
I'm still learning to.

778
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:36,577
Felicity: All right,
guys hug it out,

779
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:37,611
you should really
see this.

780
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:38,646
I found out
what Sampson stole

781
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:39,780
from Allman Industrial,

782
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:41,949
a Molecular
Transmodality Processor.

783
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:42,950
What?

784
00:31:42,952 --> 00:31:44,018
It replicates chemicals

785
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,152
based on their
molecular structure.

786
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,654
What would Sampson
need with that?

787
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,456
The vat that you
dropped him in.

788
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,623
Rene: It was full
of Stardust.

789
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,092
When we were fighting,
a pipe burst,

790
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:52,993
and some liquid drained
from it into the vat.

791
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,361
Sounds like he stumbled
on the recipe

792
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:56,664
for making a superhuman
killing machine.

793
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,299
And now he's going
to use the...

794
00:31:58,301 --> 00:31:59,967
Molecular Transmodality
Processor...

795
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:01,368
To make more of them.

796
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,603
Curtis: And he'll need
the original mixture,

797
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,004
which means that
he'll return to--

798
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,407
oh. I've always
wanted to say this--

799
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:08,709
the scene of the crime.

800
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:12,213
If Sampson is building
an army,

801
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:14,148
then I'm going
to need mine.

802
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,349
For real?

803
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,917
For real.

804
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,188
Suit up!

805
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,523
Oh.

806
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:23,724
I thought we were
all going to--

807
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:24,959
like, it was going
to be a nice moment

808
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:25,960
where we all say it
at the same time.

Anatoly: Bratva.

If you are hungry,
brothers will feed you.

If you are hurt,

brothers bring 10 times
pain to men responsible.

871
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:01,533
If one brother succeeds,
all brothers rich.

872
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:06,771
If one brother fails,
all brothers suffer.

873
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:08,573
Your brothers would
kill for you,

874
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:10,041
would die for you,

875
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:14,513
as you would kill
and die for them.

If these men are supposed
to be my brothers,

These men are not
here to fight you.

879

Most of the men
in this room

And with these knives,
they could,

882
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:31,229
but you must trust
they will not.

your brothers?

as fast as the Flash,

894

or he's got a new team
behind him.

to get easier, does it?

Thank you all for coming.

906
00:39:00,787 --> 00:39:02,354
I'd like to address
head-on

907
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:03,788
and with brutal honesty

908
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,156
some of the recent
reports

909
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:06,825
regarding
my administration,

910
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:08,059
reports that suggest

911
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:10,061
while the voters
may have elected me,

912
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:12,797
others have been making
decisions in my stead.

913
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:14,966
The truth of the matter

914
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:17,335
is that every decision
made by any member

915
00:39:17,337 --> 00:39:18,937
of my administration

916
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,305
is my decision.

stops with me,

918
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,843
because when you
are in charge,

919
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:28,046
everything that
your team does is on you,

920
00:39:28,048 --> 00:39:31,549
and I trust my team.

921
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:34,185
That team will include
