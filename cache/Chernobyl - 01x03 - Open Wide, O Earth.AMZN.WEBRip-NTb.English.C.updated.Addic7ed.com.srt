1
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:09,451
Where are you going?

2
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:11,743
Chernobyl.

3
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:19,032
Ignatenko, fire and rescue
unit. I need to find him!

4
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:21,241
Moscow. Hospital number six.

5
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:23,449
Are you here because of the fire?

6
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:25,285
Anything we should be worried about?

7
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,243
No.

8
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:30,743
It cannot go over the core.

9
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,366
The nuclear plant in Sweden
has detected radiation.

10
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:40,451
At least evacuate Pripyat.

11
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,283
When the lava enters these tanks,

12
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:44,866
it will instantly superheat,

13
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:48,575
causing a significant thermal explosion.

14
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:50,283
And how long before this happens?

15
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:52,533
Approximately 48 to 72 hours,

16
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,658
but we may have a solution.

17

18
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:27,933
Is it possible that the
water has already killed them?

19
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:29,958
Yes.

20
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,661
Then what?

21
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
If it doesn't work?

22
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:10,032
Get them in the truck.

23
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:12,434
Get the hoses in! Start pumping!

24
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:31,592
Uh, I'm here to see my
husband, Vasily Ignatenko.

25
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:34,357
He's a firefighter from
Chernobyl. I have permission.

26
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,159
Chernobyl? I'm sorry, no visitors.

27
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:41,563
Well, but Major Burov told me,

28
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:42,997
- he said...
- No exceptions.

29
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,833
Please. I've come all the
way from Kievskaya Oblast.

30
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:13,494
Excuse me.

31
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,303
Excuse me, excuse me.

32
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:17,831
Who are you? What are you doing here?

33
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,601
- I have a pass.
- You can't be here. It's not safe.

34
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:22,268
I am here to see my husband.

35
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,604
Vasily Ignatenko.

36
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:25,238
He's a firefighter from Chernobyl.

37
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,908
I know who Ignatenko is, but you can't.

38
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,043
I have permission. I-I've...

39
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,467
You can see him for 30
minutes, not a minute more.

40
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,555
And you cannot touch him in
any way. Do you understand?

41
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:44,491
- Yeah.
- Room 15.

42
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:48,194
Thank you.

43
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:50,196
- You're not pregnant, are you?
- No.

44
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,705
I won't have to give that to you.

45
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:01,040
There they are.

46
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,942
No, wait, wait, wait.
I haven't finished yet.

47
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,344
No, he hasn't.

48
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:06,279
Yeah, that's good.

49
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:10,683
Yeah, better.

50
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:15,221
Look who the cat dragged in.

51
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,025
What did I tell you?

52
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:22,928
There's no hiding from you, is there?

53
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,733
Easy, easy. It's okay.

54
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:31,137
We're all okay. Yeah, we're okay.

55
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,575
How, how, how did this
happen? Who gave them the idea?

56
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:46,577
- Are you suggesting I did?
- Someone did.

57
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:50,080
Someone decided that the evacuation zone

58
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:53,605
should be 30 kilometers,
when we know, here,

59
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:56,342
Cesium-137 in the Gomel district.

60
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:58,812
- That's 200 kilometers away!
- It was decided.

61
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:01,158
- Based on what?
- I don't know!

62
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:06,396
Forgive me. Maybe I've just
spent too much time in my lab.

63
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,265
Or maybe I'm just stupid.

64
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:11,534
Is this really the way it all works?

65
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:13,503
An uninformed, arbitrary decision

66
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,838
that will cost who knows how many lives

67
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,909
made by some apparatchik,
some career party man?

68
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,314
I'm a career party man.

69
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:28,050
You should watch your
tone, Comrade Legasov.

70
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,964
Comrades...

71
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,789
We have visual confirmation that
the fire is nearly extinguished.

72
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:36,058
There has also been a
reduction in iodine 131

73
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,956
and cesium-137 emissions.

74
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,095
Good. Yes?

75
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:43,132
But the temperature is rising.

76
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:44,667
And, uh...

77
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:54,911
There's a spike in zirconium-95.

78
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:59,348
It's from the cladding on the fuel rods.

79
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,818
Meaning what?

80
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,453
The meltdown has begun.

81
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,525
Get it off me!

82
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:49,497
Get it off me!

83
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,339
Stop moving!

84
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:01,108
Get off him! You're hurting him!

85
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,978
- You can't be in here.
- What's happening to him?

86
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,799
Get out!

87
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:07,643
You can't be in here!

88
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:51,617
Yes?

89
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,226
Comrade Shcherbina
is on the phone.

90
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:54,727
Put him through.

91
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,363
Well?

92
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:59,065
The fire's nearly out.

93
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,901
The bubbler tanks are being drained.

94
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:04,068
We have successfully eliminated
the risk of a thermal explosion.

95
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:08,273
And?

96
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,310
The situation inside the core

97
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:14,146
is deteriorating
faster than anticipated.

98
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:17,082
The concrete pad will last
for six to eight weeks,

99
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:20,419
but after that, Legasov
estimates a 50% chance

100
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:22,587
that the fuel will breach the pad

101
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,057
and melt down into
the groundwater itself.

102
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:28,393
And where does this groundwater go?

103
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:30,495
The Pripyat River,

104
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:33,432
which feeds into the Dnieper.

105
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:37,068
The primary water supply for
approximately 50 million people,

106
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,937
not to mention crops and livestock,

107
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:41,072
would be... unusable.

108
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:44,008
We're recommending we install
a heat exchanger under the pad

109
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,111
to lower to core temperature
and halt the meltdown.

110
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:51,282
And in order to do that,
I'm told that we will need...

111
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:56,788
all of the liquid nitrogen
in the Soviet Union.

112
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,891
Oh.

113
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,628
- All right.
- Yeah, and of course, we'll also need...

114
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,229
Whatever you need, you have it.

115
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,698
- That should be clear by now.
- Yes.

116
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,331
- Anything else?
- No, no, no. Thank you.

117
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,301
Yes. I'd like to address the
30-kilometer exclusion zone.

118
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:14,505
Wait, what? Professor
Legasov, is that you?

119
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:15,572
What exclusion zone?

120
00:13:15,574 --> 00:13:17,774
Minor details, General Secretary.

121
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:20,377
Um, Premier Ryzhkov
has determined that...

122
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,749
If he determined, then he determined.

123
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:24,280
Look, Professor Legasov,

124
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:26,383
you are there for one reason only.

125
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:28,519
Do you understand? To make this stop.

126
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:29,920
I don't want questions.

127
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,722
I want to know when this will be over.

128
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,957
If you mean when will
Chernobyl be completely safe,

129
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,160
the half-life of
plutonium-239 is 24,000 years.

130
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:40,463
So perhaps we should just say,
"Not within our lifetimes."

131
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:54,677
I think you and I should take a walk.

132
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,812
It's late. I'm tired.

133
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:00,349
We're taking a walk.

134
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,391
Was it it you want? An apology?

135
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,461
Not gonna sit back and...

136
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:17,566
What will happen to our boys?

137
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:19,968
Which boys? The divers?

138
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,372
The divers, the firefighters,
the men in the control room.

139
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:27,042
What does the radiation
do to them precisely?

140
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:31,346
At the levels some of them were exposed?

141
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:35,250
Ionizing radiation tears
the cellular structure apart.

142
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:38,920
The skin blisters,
turns red, then black.

143
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,757
This is followed by a latency period.

144
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:45,660
The immediate effects subside.

145
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:48,797
The patient appears to be recovering.

146
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,265
Healthy, even. But they aren't.

147
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:56,404
This usually only
lasts for a day or two.

148
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:00,075
Continue.

149
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:04,946
Then the cellular damage
begins to manifest.

150
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:10,384
The bone marrow dies,
the immune system fails,

151
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:14,188
the organs and soft
tissue begin to decompose.

152
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,292
The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves,

153
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:20,829
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

154
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,165
for the pain, which is... unimaginable.

155
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:28,769
And then three days to
three weeks, you are dead.

156
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:33,440
That is what will happen to those boys.

157
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:37,077
And what about us?

158
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:41,949
Well, we've...

159
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:46,219
We've gotten a steady
dose, but not as much of it.

160
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:48,355
Not strong enough to kill the cells,

161
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:51,458
but consistent enough to damage our DNA.

162
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:56,163
So, in time... cancer.

163
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:59,466
Or aplastic anemia. Either way, fatal.

164
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,803
Well...

165
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:11,311
in a sense, it would seem we've
gotten off easy then, Valery.

166
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,858
I've seen them before.

167
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:34,900
Now you know why I
wanted to take a walk.

168
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:37,403
We can presume the work site is bugged.

169
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:42,040
And our rooms, even our bathrooms.

170
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,577
They've been here the whole time.

171
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,712
Of course they've been
here the whole time.

172
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,550
But if we're seeing
them out in the open now,

173
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,486
it's because they want us to know.

174
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:37,728
You've seen that?

175
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:42,098
The fuel is melting
faster than we expected.

176
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,235
I know. I have a plan.

177
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:47,971
Heat exchanger, I hope.

178
00:17:47,973 --> 00:17:49,506
Yes.

179
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:54,510
There's something I've
wanted to ask you, comrade,

180
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:57,914
but I see you're already asking
yourself the same question.

181
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:04,288
Why did it explode?

182
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:08,024
I've worked the numbers over and over,

183
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:11,960
presuming the worst possible
conditions in an RBMK reactor.

184
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,299
And I always get the same answer.

185
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:17,866
Which is?

186
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:21,504
It's not possible.

187
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:23,071
And yet...

188
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:28,411
You're not going to solve this here.

189
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,547
Not on paper.

190
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:34,950
Everyone who was in the control room,

191
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:37,353
Dyatlov, Akimov, Toptunov,

192
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:41,524
they're all in Moscow,
Hospital Number 6.

193
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:44,793
We need to find out exactly
what happened that night,

194
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:48,463
moment by moment, decision by decision.

195
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,966
Go now while they're still alive.

196
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:53,935
Talk to them.

197
00:18:53,937 --> 00:18:56,904
Because if we don't find
out how this happened,

198
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:59,307
it will happen again.

199
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,568
And, Khomyuk...

200
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:06,630
be careful.

201
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,007
Well, fuck you!

202
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,112
Hey, here's one, here's one.

203
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:40,147
What's as big as a house,

204
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,084
burns 20 liters of fuel every hour,

205
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:45,263
puts out a shit-load
of smoke and noise,

206
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:49,056
and cuts an apple into three pieces?

207
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:54,527
A Soviet machine made to
cut apples into four pieces!

208
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:37,036
- Who's in charge here?
- I'm the crew chief.

209
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,140
I am Shadov, minister
of coal industries.

210
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:42,841
We know who you are.

211
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,445
How many men do you have?

212
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:51,050
On this shift, 45 here,
a hundred in total.

213
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:55,120
I need all 100 men to gather their
equipment and get in the trucks.

214
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:58,690
Do you? To where?

215
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,525
That's classified.

216
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,033
Come on, then.

217
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,734
Start shooting.

218
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,072
You haven't got enough
bullets for all of us.

219
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,140
Kill as many as you can, whoever's left,

220
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,186
they'll beat the living
piss out of each of you.

221
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:21,479
- You can't talk to us like that!
- Shut the fuck up!

222
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,415
This is Tula. This is our mine.

223
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,452
We don't leave unless we know why.

224
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:30,503
Mm.

225
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,560
You're going to Chernobyl.

226
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:41,031
Do you know what's happened there?

227
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,333
We dig up coal, not bodies.

228
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,604
The reactor fuel is going
to sink into the ground

229
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:49,792
and poison the water from
Kiev to the Black Sea.

230
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:51,328
All of it.

231
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,978
Forever, they say.

232
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,149
They want you to stop
that from happening.

233
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,519
And how are we supposed to do that?

234
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,189
They didn't tell me,
because I don't need to know.

235
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,160
Do you need to know, or
have you heard enough?

236
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:54,036
Now you look like the minister of coal.

237
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,025
Vasya?

238
00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:19,827
Vasya?

239
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:27,835
No, no, no.

240
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:30,204
They told you no touching.

241
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:32,473
It's not safe.

242
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:34,875
They touch you.

243
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:38,012
If it's safe for them, it's safe for me.

244
00:23:47,957 --> 00:23:49,957
Where are the others?

245
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:52,526
They took them to a special room.

246
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:55,262
They won't tell me where.

247
00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:02,035
Will you open the curtains?

248
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:05,405
- Hmm?
- Open the curtains.

249
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,511
Aah.

250
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:30,396
Please, tell me what you see outside.

251
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:31,998
Tell me everything.

252
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,907
Huh.

253
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:44,610
I can see the Red Square.

254
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:49,415
And...

255
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,184
the Kremlin.

256
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:55,889
Spasskaya Tower, the Mausoleum.

257
00:24:58,126 --> 00:25:00,760
You see St. Basil's?

258
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,995
Yeah.

259
00:25:02,997 --> 00:25:04,930
Ah.

260
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:06,765
Yes, it's beautiful.

261
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:10,236
I told you.

262
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:13,639
I told you I'd show
you Moscow, remember?

263
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:16,676
- Huh?
- Yeah. Yes.

264
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,317
Thank you.

265
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:14,299
I'm not eating that. It's shit.

266
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:17,334
Get me something else.

267
00:26:17,337 --> 00:26:20,104
I'm not a nurse, Comrade Dyatlov.

268
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:22,106
I'm a nuclear physicist.

269
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:25,477
Well, then, Comrade Nuclear Physicist...

270
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:31,248
unless you happen to have a
butter and caviar sandwich on you,

271
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:34,552
you can get the fuck out of my room.

272
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:53,663
What?

273
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:57,487
I'm not good at this, Boris.

274
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,323
The lying.

275
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:06,877
Have you ever spent time with miners?

276
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:09,812
No.

277
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,482
My advice: tell the truth.

278
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:16,186
These men work in the
dark. They see everything.

279
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,056
Andrei Glukhov, crew chief.

280
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:37,674
Do these work?

281
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:39,543
To an extent.

282
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,746
Of course.

283
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:58,726
So what's the job?

284
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:03,531
We need to install a liquid
nitrogen heat exchanger

285
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,700
underneath this concrete pad.

286
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:10,704
There's no way to approach from
the interior of the building,

287
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:13,207
so you have to get at
it from underground.

288
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,710
- And what's above the pad?
- The core of the nuclear reactor,

289
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:19,747
which is melting down.

290
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,383
What? Like...

291
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:25,153
Essentially.

292
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:28,356
Is it gonna fall on top of us?

293
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:30,390
Not if you're done within six weeks.

294
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:34,261
Dimensions?

295
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:39,199
Break ground here,

296
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:41,534
dig a tunnel 150 meters to here,

297
00:29:41,536 --> 00:29:44,771
excavate a space 30 by 30 meters

298
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:46,498
for the heat exchanger.

299
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:49,709
And because we need to keep disruption
of the ground above to a minimum,

300
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,644
you can't use any heavy machinery.

301
00:29:51,646 --> 00:29:53,113
It has to be done by hand.

302
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:55,482
Then I need more men.

303
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,318
Four hundred at least.

304
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,954
We'll have to work around the clock.

305
00:30:00,956 --> 00:30:02,856
How deep do you want
this tunnel? Six meters?

306
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:05,891
- Twelve.
- Twelve? Why?

307
00:30:05,893 --> 00:30:08,461
For your protection.

308
00:30:08,463 --> 00:30:12,365
At that depth, you'll be shielded
from much of the radiation.

309
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:16,702
The entrance to the tunnel
won't be 12 meters below ground.

310
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:19,838
No.

311
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,941
And we're not 12
meters below ground now.

312
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:30,516
No. We're not.

313
00:30:33,187 --> 00:30:35,676
We have some equipment here on site.

314
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,524
More will arrive by midnight.

315
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,493
You can start in the morning.

316
00:30:41,495 --> 00:30:43,128
No. We start now.

317
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:47,165
I don't want my men here one
more second than they need to be.

318
00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:52,671
If these worked, you'd be wearing them.

319
00:31:02,516 --> 00:31:04,315
Are they all like that?

320
00:31:04,317 --> 00:31:06,752
They're all like that.

321
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:32,135
Yes?

322
00:32:32,138 --> 00:32:34,771
- What's it up to?
- Uh, 50 degrees.

323
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:40,085
Fuck!

324
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:46,292
Hey!

325
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:47,727
Hey you!

326
00:32:57,262 --> 00:33:00,363
- We need fans.
- For what purpose?

327
00:33:00,365 --> 00:33:02,298
What do you mean, "For what purpose?"

328
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,099
To dig your fucking tunnel, that's why.

329
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:07,036
- Who's talking to you?
- Whoa, whoa. Comrades.

330
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:09,472
It's 50 degrees down there.

331
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:11,207
We can't breathe without the masks,

332
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:12,775
we can't breathe with the masks.

333
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:16,045
It's like a fucking
oven. We need ventilation.

334
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:18,881
Fans will put dust in the air,
the dust will go in your lungs.

335
00:33:18,883 --> 00:33:21,617
I've been breathing dust
in my lungs for 20 years.

336
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:24,353
- Not this dust.
- I'm sorry.

337
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:27,623
For your own good, no fans.

338
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:57,753
My name is Ulana Khomyuk.

339
00:33:57,755 --> 00:34:01,356
I'm a nuclear physicist with
the Chernobyl Commission.

340
00:34:03,094 --> 00:34:05,326
I want you to tell me
everything that happened

341
00:34:05,328 --> 00:34:07,494
on the night of the accident.

342
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,164
Is that all right?

343
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:13,961
Yes.

344
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:18,284
I want to tell.

345
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:19,886
All right.

346
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:36,057
Your official title was?

347
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:43,329
My name is Leonid Fedorovych Toptunov.

348
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:49,569
I am the senior reactor
control chief engineer

349
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:52,272
at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

350
00:34:55,811 --> 00:34:58,278
Senior engineer?

351
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:02,048
How old are you?

352
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:08,822
I'm 25.

353
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,469
Lyusya? Lyusya?

354
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:00,972
Yes, I'm here, I'm here. I'm...

355
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:17,989
Have you been here this whole time?

356
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:20,691
No one said I should leave.

357
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:22,060
I did.

358
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:23,427
Thirty minutes, I said!

359
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:26,964
Well, where have you
been? When he's in pain?

360
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:28,298
When his sores stick to his gown?

361
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,000
When he soils himself
five times a night?

362
00:36:30,002 --> 00:36:32,027
I've been looking after
him. Where have you been?

363
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,925
I've been In the north and west wing,

364
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:37,097
where there are dozens of patients
from Chernobyl exactly like him.

365
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,176
- It isn't safe for you here.
- He's my husband.

366
00:36:39,178 --> 00:36:40,310
Not anymore.

367
00:36:40,312 --> 00:36:42,246
He's something else
now. Do you understand?

368
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:45,048
He's dangerous to you.

369
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,718
He's burned.

370
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,420
Go home.

371
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:51,589
Please.

372
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:57,561
It won't take much longer. I, uh...

373
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:04,001
I don't want him to die alone.

374
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:08,571
Stay on the other side of the plastic.

375
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:12,009
Or I'll have you removed by security.

376
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:13,436
- Lyusya?
- Yes, my love.

377
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:19,175
Is it day?

378
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:21,510
No, it's nighttime now.

379
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,383
I think I had a dream,

380
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:29,352
it's just gone.

381
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,588
Vasya.

382
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:40,296
We're going to have a baby.

383
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,500
The fire's out.

384
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,534
It's out, Valera.

385
00:39:23,806 --> 00:39:26,441
The miners are making
incredible progress.

386
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:30,711
They say the whole job will
be finished in four weeks.

387
00:39:32,315 --> 00:39:34,315
Four weeks.

388
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:36,484
Can you believe that?

389
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,492
I know the job isn't over.

390
00:39:45,962 --> 00:39:48,063
But it's the beginning of the end.

391
00:39:53,536 --> 00:39:56,503
I'm sorry to bother you,
Deputy Minister, but...

392
00:39:58,374 --> 00:39:59,873
it is the miners.

393
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,355
What?

394
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:52,325
You wouldn't give us fans,
it's too hot for clothes.

395
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:55,061
So we're digging the old way.
This is how our fathers mined.

396
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,897
We're still wearing the fucking hats.

397
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:00,766
What do you want?

398
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:06,539
You're not as protected now.

399
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:09,308
Are you telling me it
will make a difference?

400
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:16,649
When this is over,

401
00:41:16,651 --> 00:41:18,651
will they be looked after?

402
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:23,956
I don't know.

403
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:36,434
You don't know.

404
00:41:55,089 --> 00:42:00,258
So the power level jumped
from 200 to 400 megawatts?

405
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,127
Yes.

406
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,797
Very fast.

407
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:09,701
Why didn't you initiate
an emergency shutdown?

408
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:12,469
Why didn't you press the AZ-5 button?

409
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:15,339
We did.

410
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:19,010
I reported the increase to Akimov,

411
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:21,145
and he pressed the button.

412
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:25,583
Leonid, that's... that's not possible.

413
00:42:26,986 --> 00:42:28,853
He did.

414
00:42:28,855 --> 00:42:30,888
I s-swear.

415
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,091
I saw him do it.

416
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,930
And that's when it exploded.

417
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,051
What?

418
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:58,282
Um...

419
00:42:59,352 --> 00:43:02,453
- Which room is Akimov?
- Twenty-seven.

420
00:43:17,168 --> 00:43:21,203
I pressed it... before the explosion.

421
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:22,972
Before.

422
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:27,744
But why?

423
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:29,845
Why would that happen?

424
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:34,751
I shut it down. I pressed AZ-5.

425
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,492
Thank you, Comrade Akimov.

426
00:43:47,265 --> 00:43:49,365
I did everything right.

427
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:52,935
I did everything right.

428
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:25,534
Get out.

429
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:27,168
Get out. Get out of here.

430
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,571
Let me go! Let me go!

431
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:32,207
Stop it! Stop it!

432
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:37,593
You let her in that room?
Inside the plastic, touching him?

433
00:44:37,596 --> 00:44:40,323
- Did you know she's pregnant?
- It's not true!

434
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:41,491
What have you done?

435
00:44:41,494 --> 00:44:44,033
What kind of place is this?
Where is her protection?

436
00:44:44,036 --> 00:44:46,823
- Do you have any idea what you're dealing with?
- Of course I do.

437
00:44:46,826 --> 00:44:48,490
- Please, I do not...
- No.

438
00:44:48,492 --> 00:44:50,792
- People are going to hear about this.
- Wait.

439
00:44:50,794 --> 00:44:52,594
People are going to
hear. Do you understand?

440
00:44:52,596 --> 00:44:54,596
Everyone is going to hear.

441
00:44:54,598 --> 00:44:56,731
What is everyone gonna hear?

442
00:45:02,805 --> 00:45:04,772
I am with the official
Chernobyl Commission,

443
00:45:04,774 --> 00:45:07,341
and I've been authorized
by Valery Legasov.

444
00:45:07,343 --> 00:45:10,277
- You can check this. My name is Ulana...
- We know who you are.

445
00:45:13,616 --> 00:45:15,940
What is everyone gonna hear?

446
00:45:36,272 --> 00:45:38,339
You have your notes?

447
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:39,941
Yes.

448
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:44,210
Khomyuk was arrested last night.

449
00:45:44,212 --> 00:45:46,713
What? Why?

450
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:48,249
I don't know.

451
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:52,985
- Was it...?
- Of course it was.

452
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:55,555
I'm working on it.

453
00:45:55,557 --> 00:45:58,458
- Boris...
- I'm working on it.

454
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:01,828
What more do you want from me?

455
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,396
Fix your tie.

456
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:11,337
They'll see you now.

457
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:25,017
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

458
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,822
successfully extinguished the fire.

459
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,221
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

460
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:31,424
that the fuel does not
reach the groundwater.

461
00:46:31,426 --> 00:46:33,625
And furthermore, there is no longer

462
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:35,627
a threat of additional explosion.

463
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:40,532
The Soviet people have faced the
challenge and risen to the task,

464
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:42,868
and they and everyone in
this room are to be commended.

465
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:50,709
Lastly, Professor Legasov
and I have been vigilant

466
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:53,178
to protect the security
interests of the State.

467
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,848
And since the unfortunate
release of information

468
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,215
directly following the accident,

469
00:46:57,217 --> 00:47:00,251
we believe that there
has been no further lapse.

470
00:47:00,253 --> 00:47:02,788
Comrade Charkov,

471
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,825
we hope we have lived up to the
highest standards of the KGB.

472
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:07,959
You have.

473
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,694
Thank you.

474
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,199
Professor Legasov will now speak about

475
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:15,733
the work that remains.

476
00:47:17,608 --> 00:47:19,341
Thank you.

477
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:25,910
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

478
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:27,945
and it is good.

479
00:47:27,947 --> 00:47:30,548
The immediate danger is over.

480
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,751
Now, I'm afraid, a long war must begin.

481
00:47:34,787 --> 00:47:37,655
There is an enormous
amount of radioactive debris

482
00:47:37,657 --> 00:47:39,857
and contamination
spread out across a zone

483
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:42,393
of approximately 2600 square kilometers.

484
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:47,864
This entire region must
be completely evacuated.

485
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:52,036
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

486
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:57,974
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

487
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:01,011
whether domesticated or wild,

488
00:48:01,013 --> 00:48:05,015
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

489
00:48:05,017 --> 00:48:08,452
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

490
00:48:08,454 --> 00:48:11,955
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

491
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:17,527
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

492
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:21,798
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

493
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,568
which will be carried by the
wind and the rain if left exposed.

494
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,003
So we will have to raze entire forests.

495
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,138
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

496
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,540
and bury it under itself,

497
00:48:30,542 --> 00:48:34,110
approximately, 100 square kilometers.

498
00:48:35,714 --> 00:48:39,182
Um, and finally, we
will need to construct

499
00:48:39,184 --> 00:48:44,220
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

500
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:47,824
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

501
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,395
There will be deaths.

502
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,567
What amount of time,

503
00:48:57,569 --> 00:48:59,235
and how many men do you require?

504
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:03,106
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

505
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:05,475
and approximately 750,000 men,

506
00:49:05,477 --> 00:49:10,980
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

507
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:13,549
How many deaths?

508
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,551
Thousands.

509
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:18,154
Perhaps tens of thousands.

510
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,262
Begin at once.

511
00:49:32,496 --> 00:49:35,129
- Comrade Charkov.
- Valery!

512
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,306
Yes, Professor?

513
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,210
My associate was arrested last night.

514
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,512
Oh?

515
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,850
I mean no disrespect, but I was
wondering if you could tell me why.

516
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:50,218
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

517
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,088
She was arrested by the KGB.

518
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,224
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

519
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:57,757
I am.

520
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,728
That's why I don't have to bother
with arresting people anymore.

521
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,231
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

522
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,035
I think the deputy chairman is busy.

523
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,204
No, no. It's perfectly understandable.

524
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:13,275
Comrade, I know you've
heard the stories about us.

525
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:15,677
When I hear them, even I am shocked.

526
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,679
But we are not what people say.

527
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,515
Yes, people are following you.

528
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,017
People are following those people.

529
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,352
You see them?

530
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,490
They follow me.

531
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:32,660
The KGB is a circle of accountability.

532
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:33,961
Nothing more.

533
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:36,430
You know the work we're doing here.

534
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,501
- You really don't trust us?
- Of course I do.

535
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:43,549
But you know the old Russian proverb:

536
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:45,652
"Trust but verify."

537
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:51,445
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

538
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:52,880
Can you imagine?

539
00:50:53,883 --> 00:50:56,450
It was very nice speaking with you.

540
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:58,119
I need her.

541
00:51:00,623 --> 00:51:03,290
So you will be accountable for her?

542
00:51:07,796 --> 00:51:09,430
Then it's done.

543
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:13,334
- Her name is...
- I know who she is.

544
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,236
Good day, Professor.

545
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:28,482
No, that went surprisingly well.

546
00:51:28,484 --> 00:51:30,718
You came off like a naive idiot.

547
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:34,888
And naive idiots are not a threat.

548
00:51:50,338 --> 00:51:53,072
I'll come back when the
paperwork is complete.

549
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:03,650
- Are you all right?
- They didn't hurt me.

550
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,953
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

551
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:11,190
It doesn't matter.

552
00:52:11,192 --> 00:52:13,926
They were stupid. I was stupid.

553
00:52:15,296 --> 00:52:17,362
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

554
00:52:18,465 --> 00:52:22,167
Akimov, yes, Toptunov, yes, but...

555
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:24,903
Valery,

556
00:52:24,905 --> 00:52:26,471
Akimov...

557
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:29,374
his face was gone.

558
00:52:32,045 --> 00:52:33,812
You want to stop?

559
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:38,149
Is that a choice I even have?

560
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:49,727
Do you think the fuel will actually
melt through the concrete pad?

561
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:53,331
I don't know. A 40% chance maybe.

562
00:52:55,768 --> 00:52:58,636
I said 50.

563
00:52:58,638 --> 00:53:01,004
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing:

564
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:03,140
"Maybe."

565
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:08,312
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

566
00:53:08,314 --> 00:53:10,781
Maybe the miners who I've
told to dig under the reactor

567
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,250
will save millions of lives.

568
00:53:14,454 --> 00:53:16,987
Maybe I'm killing them for nothing.

569
00:53:20,793 --> 00:53:22,893
I don't want to do this anymore.

570
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:25,896
I want to stop.

571
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:29,099
But I can't.

572
00:53:30,202 --> 00:53:33,370
I don't think you have a
choice any more than I do.

573
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:38,108
I think, despite the stupidity,

574
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,602
the lies, even this...

575
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:43,071
you are compelled.

576
00:53:43,074 --> 00:53:45,615
The problem has been assigned,
and you will stop at nothing

577
00:53:45,617 --> 00:53:47,117
until you find an answer.

578
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,387
Because that is who you are.

579
00:53:52,124 --> 00:53:54,091
A lunatic, then.

580
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:58,161
A scientist.

581
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,084
Did you know that they
were running a safety test?

582
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:26,055
- Yeah.
- There's something else.

583
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:30,593
Akimov says they shut the reactor down,

584
00:54:30,595 --> 00:54:32,995
and Toptunov confirms it.

585
00:54:32,997 --> 00:54:36,723
- They pressed AZ-5.
- Apparently not soon enough.

586
00:54:36,726 --> 00:54:38,325
No.

587
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:43,031
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5,

588
00:54:43,034 --> 00:54:45,735
and then the reactor exploded.

589
00:54:47,378 --> 00:54:50,246
If it had been just one of
them, I would have put it under

590
00:54:50,248 --> 00:54:52,614
faulty memory or delusion even,

591
00:54:52,616 --> 00:54:56,485
but they both agreed. They were adamant.

592
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:02,491
Comrade?

593
00:55:04,495 --> 00:55:08,597
- Do you think it's possible?
- I think it makes no sense.

594
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:11,800
I think it's what I would say if I
was trying to cover my own mistakes.

595
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:13,435
But?

596
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:16,304
I believed them.

597
00:55:18,342 --> 00:55:19,908
Then you should pursue it.

598
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:23,979
We have to pursue every possibility,

599
00:55:23,981 --> 00:55:26,615
no matter how unlikely,

600
00:55:26,617 --> 00:55:29,685
no matter what or who's to blame.

601
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:35,457
I'll go back to the hospital and
reinterview Akimov and Toptunov.

602
00:55:38,028 --> 00:55:39,728
If they're still awake.

603
00:55:40,788 --> 00:55:42,455
They're not.

604
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,689
Khomyuk.

605
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:06,254
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

606
01:03:08,558 --> 01:03:10,571
To hell with our lives.

607
01:03:12,118 --> 01:03:14,133
Someone has to start telling the truth.

608
01:03:15,309 --> 01:03:17,646
You think the right question
will get you the truth?

609
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:19,977
I know they're listening!

610
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,213
There is no truth.
