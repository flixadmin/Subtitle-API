1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,462
Hey, hold on a second.

2
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,967
Oh.

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,552
Did I scare you?

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,555
I didn't mean to.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,725
-Sorry.
-Oh. No, it's okay. I'm good.

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,268
What are you doing here anyway?

7
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,312
You know, just...

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,231
-What about you?
-Oh.

9
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,191
I was reminded of this place
all of a sudden so I stopped by.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,402
You know, before the break...

11
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,572
There was a kid
that committed suicide here.

12
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,283
He jumped off.

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,285
I was in the same class as him.

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,620
What...

15
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,042
do you mean you were reminded
of this place?

16
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,918
I thought of him today.

17
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,380
I wasn't close to him.

18
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,549
Park Wonseok.

19
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,094
But I saw him fall off

20
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,597
and I called the cops.

21
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,269
I wonder why Park Wonseok...

22
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,897
...jumped from there...

23
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,400
What drove him to kill himself?

24
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,986
Is there really nothing

25
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,448
after death?

26
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,409
Those questions
just came to mind all of sudden.

27
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,704
By the way, the sports teams
aren't even in session right now.

28
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,040
-What are you doing ditching class?
-Well, what about you?

29
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,167
Weren't you already missing
from school for a few days?

30
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,088
-I thought you had dropped out of school.
-Huh?

31
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,131
-Why would I do that?
-Huh?

32
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,509
A senior ditching school for a week
for no reason?

33
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,593
Isn't that the same as dropping out?

34
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,055
I missed Lunch.

35
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,807
That's why
I couldn't keep ditching anymore.

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,391
Lunch?

37
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,018
Are you serious?

38
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,312
You came back to school
just to have lunch?

39
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,837
This is Lunch.

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,631
Granted, I'm the only one
that calls him Lunch since I named him.

41
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,552
Seems like he was pretty hungry.

42
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,932
If...

43
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,851
I don't show up again
for the next couple of days,

44
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,769
could you take care of him for me?

45
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,857
Sure...

46
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,321
Time to have lunch.

47
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,955
How did you end up reporting

48
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,251
-Wonseok's death to the police that day?
-What?

49
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,004
Oh...

50
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,256
I had been feeding Lunch over there,

51
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,967
then I heard a thud.

52
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,011
So I went over

53
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,098
and saw Park Wonseok lying over there.

54
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,092
-Are you gonna play basketball?
-Yo, Ji Sooheon!

55
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,220
-You gotta be kidding me.
-What happened to you?

56
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,555
Seriously, you just show up for lunch
after being absent for a week?

57
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,099
So you're telling me you only come
to school for lunch, huh?

58
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,851
You don't deserve this pineapple.

59
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,561
What's wrong with you?

60
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,396
You know you missed
the practice test, right?

61
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,940
I got a copy of the test for you,
so come by later to get them from me.

62
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,775
Oh, thanks.

63
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,193
Now, spill.

64
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,737
What were you doing this the past week?

65
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,989
I just had this sudden urge to go
and see the sunrise at the East Sea.

66
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,699
So I did.

67
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,784
You're crazy.

68
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,704
I was riding my bike down the beach,

69
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,414
watching the sun rise in the horizon.

70
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,168
How could I make myself care
about standardized tests?

71
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,003
Huh?

72
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,173
You're a madman, truly a madman.

73
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,300
-Hey, sit.
-I'm off, enjoy your food.

74
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,802
-I'm leaving.
-Let's eat.

75
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,642
Sure.

76
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,894
Kick it, kick.

77
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,646
One more time.

78
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,106
-Come on, come on.
-Let's go!

79
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,732
Seriously, he sucks. He sucks ass.

80
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,359
Hey, take a look, here.

81
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,574
I told you guys, didn't I?

82
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,285
Brain tumor?

83
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,829
Yes, and it's a very dangerous one.

84
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,915
Will I die at a young age?

85
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,043
How long do I have left?

86
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,045
Six months.

87
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,548
Or it could even be a year.

88
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,301
There's still a possibility
that the tumor will stay in this state.

89
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,846
I just decided to pretend not to know.

90
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:12,270
I didn't hear anything
at the hospital that day.

91
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,370
Ugh, what's with that stare of hers?

92
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,872
It looks like
you're going to eat me alive.

93
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,708
Huh?

94
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,255
Seonha! Min Seonha!

95
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,425
Ugh, shit!

96
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,431
What? You have something to say?

97
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,725
Come on!

98
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,063
What's wrong with him?

99
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,398
-Let's go.
-Go.

100
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,524
Ah...

101
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,740
Shit, fuck off!

102
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,995
How the hell did Sa Junggyeong
manage to get back into school?

103
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,330
Do you know what's going on?

104
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,084
The girl was in the photography club
with Sa Junggyeong, that bastard.

105
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,127
Fuck, don't snitch on me!

106
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,923
That girl is a junior.

107
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,342
Last semester,
that bastard Sa Junggyeong...

108
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,718
Junggyeong, I'm sorry, please.

109
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,928
...sexually assaulted her
in the dark room.

110
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,179
What a piece of trash.

111
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,139
Shouldn't he be locked up by now?

112
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,182
If I remember correctly,

113
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,559
I think the police couldn't find
enough evidence. It just ended after that.

114
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,019
What a joke.

115
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,980
The school disciplinary committee
still found him guilty of verbal abuse,

116
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,024
so he was supposed to be suspended
and transferred to another school.

117
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,485
How the hell did he come back?

118
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:02,255
REVENGE OF OTHERS

119
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,385
No, it isn't me.

120
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,765
Hey, shit, let me go.

121
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,475
-Bastard...
-Come on, give it to me.

122
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,935
Hey, shit, what the...

123
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,603
-You think you can take me?
-What the...

124
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,067
Look here...

125
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,403
-What the hell...
-Who the hell is she?

126
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,779
What are you doing?
Aren't you gonna leave?

127
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,864
This school feels like
a totally different place.

128
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,031
I think I left my wallet somewhere.

129
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,700
I don't think I brought it
to the cafeteria, did I?

130
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,244
-Seriously, this school feels off.
-Oh shoot, try looking for it again.

131
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,203
Huh?

132
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,706
Now that Park Wonseok's gone,
you're the top dog, aren't you?

133
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,624
He was pretty tough, huh?

134
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,835
Fuck off. You're embarrassing me.

135
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,881
Do you really think I'd feel good
about Park Wonseok dying?

136
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,305
I should've beat him up
while he was alive.

137
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,265
-That's what I regret the most.
-Oh...

138
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,518
Man, it's a shame
that bastard is dead, right?

139
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,728
You!

140
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,024
Don't you have any respect?

141
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,028
Is that how you talk about the dead?

142
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,783
I knew I didn't like you.

143
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,078
Who do you think you are?
It's my mouth, so I can say what I want.

144
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,163
What's with all your bullshit?

145
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,207
If you're going to talk shit,
then just shut the fuck up.

146
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,001
You low life piece of shit.

147
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,340
Everyone always has something
to say before getting beat to a pulp.

148
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,091
You're so scary.

149
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,719
-Huh?
-Stop it.

150
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,269
She's right. That's not how
you speak about the dead.

151
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,981
Hey.

152
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,775
Why don't you just fuck off
since you couldn't even graduate?

153
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,236
You think your father's money
will keep you safe, don't you?

154
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,366
Come with me. You're dead.

155
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,867
Sa Junggyeong!

156
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,663
This isn't what you agreed to back
when we were in the principal's office.

157
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,624
Just stop it.

158
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,341
Fine.

159
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,679
Ugh, I'm sorry.

160
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,264
Fuck you.

161
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,059
Sorry, guys, just carry on
with your bullshit.

162
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,961
WOOSEONG HOSPITAL

163
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,256
This white area
you see is the tumor.

164
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,928
If the tumor wasn't in the frontal lobe,

165
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,764
surgery would have been possible
even if it were bigger.

166
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,391
Ji Sooheon, in your case,

167
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,102
there's a chance the surgery
could result in respiratory paralysis.

168
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,812
Or you might experience
cerebral palsy after the surgery.

169
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,148
That's why I told you a surgery
isn't an option.

170
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,567
Then...

171
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,194
what should I do?

172
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,448
You must delay the growth with medication.
It will also alleviate the pain.

173
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,200
Have you had any other symptoms recently?

174
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,245
What other symptoms are there?

175
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,914
You might experience some changes
in your personality.

176
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,000
Changes in personality?

177
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,252
You might experience some changes
in personality or behavior

178
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,963
that you've never exhibited before.

179
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,425
You might become overly timid
or extremely violent.

180
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,928
Depression or manic symptoms
may occur as well.

181
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,598
The most important thing
is to remain calm.

182
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,268
I know it's not an easy thing for you,
but you must do your best to try.

183
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,362
This medication will last a month.
Take it with meals.

Oh!

192
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,910
-How are you doing, Mr. Principal?
-Thank you for your hard work.

193
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,913
-Coach, this is Seok Jaebum.
-Oh!

194
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,498
I see. It's nice to meet you.

195
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:51,877
Thanks for letting him in here, Coach Oh.

196
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,921
Not a problem at all, Mr. Principal.

197
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,549
I hope this can be beneficial for him.

198
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,884
I'm certain that watching
the shooting practice

199
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,928
will definitely help Jaebum recover
part of his memory.

200
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,389
Jaebum, your mother made
a smart decision, don't you think?

201
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,933
Hey, Chanmi!

202
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,309
Ok Chanmi?

203
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,734
She's our pistol shooter
in the 25m competition.

204
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,693
Hmm.

205
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,028
Ah, I think a pistol
would be the best choice for Jaebum

206
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,321
to get acclimated to shooting.

207
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,948
I see.

208
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,658
Chanmi, you'll be helping him out.

209
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,702
You'll be his coach from now on.

210
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,995
Me?

211
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,249
Help Jaebum start off with the basics,
so that he can get used to shooting.

212
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,086
-Ah, okay...
-I'm looking forward to working with you.

213
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,338
Okay.

214
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,096
Seok Jaebum, stretch your arms straight.

215
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,351
Maintain your posture.

216
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,897
Lower your arm.

217
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,109
Ready!

218
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,446
Keep your eyes on the target.
Raise your gun.

219
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,907
Raise your gun.

220
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,953
Relax your shoulder.

221
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,622
Extend your arm straight.

222
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,707
Tilt your chin downward.

223
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,876
Maintain your posture.

224
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,753
Keep your eyes on the target.

225
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,298
Focus.

226
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,841
Hey, Seok Jaebum.

227
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,511
Focus! Eyes on the target!

228
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,596
I said focus!

229
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,600
Keep it up.

KING KONG BOWLING ANNUAL

Welcome.

232
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,524
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

233
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,122
Hong Ajung, it's been a while.

234
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,376
Ji Sooheon, I heard you ditched classes
for a week? To visit the East Sea?

235
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,127
Well, you know,
I just went off-grid is all.

236
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,673
Manager Hwang must have gone
crazy tracking Hong Ajung's phone

237
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,758
when he realized
that she was at the East Sea.

238
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,053
That's hilarious.

239
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:10,015
He must have gone insane
since he couldn't catch me.

240
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,018
-Did that bastard ever call you?
-Only once.

241
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,436
Hey, you know what though?

242
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,771
He was totally panicking
when I answered his call.

243
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,897
Like, who is this?

244
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,816
When I told him that I was your boyfriend,
he cussed me out and hung up.

245
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,901
That's crazy.

246
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,738
By the way, do you know
whose number this is? I got 10 messages.

247
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,699
This is Hong Ajung's
cell phone number, right?

248
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,742
I'm Ok Chanmi,
a new transfer student to class 3.

249
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,411
Class 3?

250
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,745
Ji Sooheon,
isn't that the class you're in?

251
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,830
Who's Ok Chanmi?

252
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,958
I know you don't know me,

253
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,668
but I need to ask you something
about Park Wonseok.

254
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,878
Can you please call me back?

255
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,921
Please contact me.

256
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,423
Ok Chanmi?

257
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,509
Isn't that the girl on the shooting team
who transferred from Busan?

258
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,719
Yeah.

259
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,970
Who is she?

260
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,763
Why does she want to talk to you
about Park Wonseok?

261
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,057
You know, before the break...

262
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,184
There was a kid
that committed suicide here.

263
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,436
He jumped off.

264
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,021
I was in the same class as him.

265
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,773
What do you mean
you were reminded of this place?

266
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,320
So she knows about Park Wonseok.

267
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,696
What's wrong?

268
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,909
-It looks like you know something.
-Huh? What do you mean?

269
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,621
Hey, I gave you your phone back.
Gotta go. See ya.

270
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,458
Thanks, Sooheon!

271
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,756
Ah, what should I do about Ok Chanmi?

272
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,966
Should I just ignore?

273
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,528
READING ROOM RULES

274
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,587
Hey, Ok Chanmi.

275
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,924
Jaebum is not trying to become
a pro athlete.

276
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,759
He's just doing this
as a part of his therapy.

277
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,970
Whether it's for therapy
or becoming a pro,

278
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,472
isn't it all the same
if he's still shooting a gun?

279
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,224
He had an accident a year ago.

280
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,977
After that, he was in a coma
for six months.

281
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,646
It's a miracle that even he woke up.

282
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,274
It's also a part of his therapy for him
to return as a senior.

283
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,527
Ah... Is that so?

284
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,321
He had a head trauma
that caused memory loss.

285
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,782
His memory was fully wiped out.

286
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,702
He doesn't remember his teacher
or his friends.

287
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,245
Um...

288
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,917
So don't be too hard on him.

289
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,044
Don't say it like that.
I wasn't too hard on him.

290
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,255
-Hey, Jaebum!
-Hmm?

291
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,798
Did I train you too hard?

292
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,175
No? It was fine.

293
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,719
You should have told me.

294
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:55,139
I thought you were a typical rich guy
who doesn't have good grades,

295
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,892
who's trying to get into college
by being a part of the shooting team.

296
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,227
You know, the despicable type.

297
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,437
Ah...

298
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,397
Chanmi!

299
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,899
He's not actually your friend.
Jaebum is a year older than us...

300
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:06,984
We have another member
on the shooting team

301
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,068
who also couldn't graduate last year,
just like him.

302
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,611
We're all pretty casual with him too.

303
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,990
-But Jaebum is not just anyone...
-Anyways!

304
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,950
Thank you for your time today.

305
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,243
I mean...

306
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,413
can you...

307
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,002
...teach me again next time?

308
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,379
Please?

309
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,549
All right.

310
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,260
Brace yourself though.
I'm gonna push you to your limit.

311
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,763
All right.

312
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,235
Mother, I'm heading home now.

313
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,166
Sir, can you slow down a bit, please?

314
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,714
Ok Chanmi!

315
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,842
Ok Chanmi!

316
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,886
Ok Chanmi!

317
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,057
Oh? Hello.

318
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,726
Hey.

319
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,665
Damn, you really are the young master
of a rich household, aren't you?

320
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:48,085
-Do you ride that bike to school as well?
-Yeah.

321
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,628
Oh, I see.

322
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,257
-What's up? Do you have something to say?
-Huh?

323
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,008
You stopped your car and everything.

324
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,719
Uh...

325
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,389
I don't think I thanked you today.

326
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,643
You did though. You said thanks earlier.

327
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,980
I guess I'm really thankful.

328
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,316
Can I have your phone number?

329
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,860
Oh!

330
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,030
-My number is 010...
-010...

331
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,815
Jesus Christ!

332
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,194
Is your thing scaring people or something?

333
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,695
Sorry.

334
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,365
Oh, no, it's me.
I guess I'm just easily spooked.

335
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,492
Anyway, what's up?

336
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,119
I have something to ask.

337
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,205
How do you know Park Wonseok?

338
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,126
In the science room,
when I was talking about him,

339
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,587
you didn't tell me that you knew him.

340
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:20,302
Did you hear that from Hong Ajung
or are you still holding onto her phone?

341
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,596
I asked you first.
How do you know Park Wonseok?

342
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,891
I've known him for a while.

343
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,393
From the shooting club, you know.

344
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,772
I'm a pro and he's an amateur.
Do you get it?

345
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,775
What do you want to know?

346
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,526
Isn't his life tragic?

347
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,363
It's just so sad.

348
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,741
I just wanted to know why it happened.

349
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,993
A week ago, at school,

350
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,247
when you dialed Hong Ajung's number,

351
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,207
you saw I answered with her phone, right?

352
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,169
You called and didn't say anything
because I answered.

353
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,254
Yes.

354
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,546
That's correct.

355
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,799
Don't you think it's weird to pretend
like you didn't know about it?

356
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,427
When did I pretend to not know about it?

357
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,012
What's weirder is that you have
Hong Ajung's phone number,

358
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,264
even though she doesn't even go
to our school anymore.

359
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,348
There's a reason why

360
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,185
-I was holding onto her phone.
-And what reason is that?

361
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,479
I can't tell you all the details.

362
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,815
Look, it's not like I stole her phone.

363
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,441
Hong Ajung asked me to hold
onto it for her.

364
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,526
Just don't take it the wrong way.

365
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,735
Well, I guess I can clear things up
with Hong Ajung herself

366
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,987
when I ask her about it in person.

367
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,531
If you're done, I'm leaving.

368
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,593
Hey, Ji Sooheon.

369
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,774
Hey...

370
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,277
I forgot to ask you something.

371
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,237
Can you tell Hong Ajung that

372
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,281
I really want to meet her
in person to talk.

373
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,283
I'll be on my way then.

374
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,379
YONGTAN HIGH SCHOOL

375
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,714
Rock, scissors, paper!

376
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,385
All right, let's analyze
numbers one and three.

377
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,554
This classic poem is always
on the standardized test,

378
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,181
without fail.

379
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,307
"The Poem of the Fisherman's History"

380
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,100
was covered
on the practice test last year.

381
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,776
The fog is fading away.
The sun is rising behind in the mountain.

382
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,029
See, the fog here...

383
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,085
Interacts with this and that over there.

384
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,544
I mean, by going here and there...

385
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,636
MAN'S RESTROOM

386
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,900
"Uhsawa" means...

387
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,235
I'm sure you're all familiar

388
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,070
with how developed onomatopoeia
is in Korea.

389
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,405
This is one of those examples...

390
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,032
Excuse me, teacher?

391
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,371
WOMAN'S RESTROOM

392
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,760
Ji Sooheon?

393
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,470
Ji Sooheon?

394
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,571
Ji Sooheon.

395
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,489
Are you here?

396
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,876
Hey, Ji Sooheon!
Open the door, Ji Sooheon!

397
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,795
Ji Sooheon!

398
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,046
What are you doing in there?

399
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,632
Uh...

400
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,758
What...

401
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,677
What...

402
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,387
What's going on?

403
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,847
What the hell is this?

404
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,185
Lift me up. I'll take a look from above.

405
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,567
There's a girl bleeding inside!

406
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,287
Hey!

407
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,039
Wake up, hey!

408
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,790
Isn't this the girl
from the cafeteria yesterday?

409
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,167
The one from the photography club?

410
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,712
Hey, what's wrong with her stare?

411
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,597
-Hello?
-Hey!

412
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,474
I'm at Yongtan High School.

413
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,893
Please send an ambulance right away!

414
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,357
119 EMERGENCY SERVICE
AMBULANCE

415
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,693
Seonha, what the hell is going on?

416
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,283
Teacher, please let me go!

417
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,416
Everyone, go back.
Go back inside now.

418
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,211
Do you think she's dead?

419
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,380
-I heard people don't die that easily.
-Come on, let's go.

420
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,840
Fuck Min Seonha, that crazy ass bitch.

421
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,426
Cutting her wrists and shit.

422
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,891
I'm going inside.

423
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,226
Sa Junggyeong!

424
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,104
Get your shit together!

425
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,148
Don't be scared and hold your head high.

426
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,526
Just be yourself.

427
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,696
You'll become lame once you show people
that you're scared.

428
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,081
Are you okay?

429
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes...

430
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,918
-Yes...
-You must be in shock.

431
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:31,214
Isn't that the girl who made a fuss
at the station last time?

432
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,508
I didn't realize it
until you just mentioned it, but yeah.

433
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,135
She's the twin sister
from that suicide case.

434
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,512
So I guess that means
she transferred from Busan.

435
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,682
Detective, the boy next to her
is the one who found the suicide victim

436
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,559
and reported it to us.

437
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,728
Really?

438
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,855
So should we go ask some questions
regarding today's incident?

439
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,649
Let's do it later.

440
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,714
-Have you calmed down a bit?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

441
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,637
-Ji Sooheon, are you feeling okay as well?
-Yes, I'm fine.

442
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,808
The detectives are waiting for you guys.

443
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,690
Mr. Ji, do you remember me?

444
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,026
I met you
during Park Wonseok's investigation.

445
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,778
Yes.

446
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,323
Do you personally know Min Seonha,
the girl who cut herself today?

447
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,241
No, I don't.

448
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,412
Did you transfer from Busan?

449
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,790
Yes.

450
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,544
So that would mean
you don't know her very well, correct?

451
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,421
Yes.

452
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,590
I don't know Min Seonha at all.

453
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,092
Was Ji Sooheon the one to report
the incident

454
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,259
to 119 just like the last time?

455
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,096
No, I did.

456
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,641
I went to the restroom
because I suddenly felt nauseous.

457
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,477
I went there to check on Ji Sooheon
because he didn't return from the restroom

458
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,437
after being in there
for more than 10 minutes.

459
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,982
I didn't expect Ok Chanmi to barge
into the men's restroom like that.

460
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,776
Well, I was worried about him.

461
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,445
He didn't look too good.

462
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm not sure why she followed me there.

463
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,283
She was knocking on the stall,
calling my name.

464
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,786
There was blood on the tiles flowing
from behind the stall.

465
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,038
I thought it was Ji Sooheon's.

466
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,207
Ok Chanmi discovered her first
by peeking over the restroom stall door.

467
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,876
Ji Sooheon tore off his shirt
to stop the bleeding.

468
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,128
Wait.

469
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,546
Yes.

470
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,590
I see.

471
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,718
Roger that. Thank you.

472
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,432
We just heard word that Min Seonha
has regained consciousness.

473
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,767
Mr. Ji, you did a great job today.

474
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,061
That's good news.

475
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,902
It seems Min Seonha
has regained consciousness.

476
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,739
Ah, that's great to hear.

477
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,159
Did you and Ok Chanmi bond
because of Park Wonseok?

478
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,285
Excuse me?

479
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,829
You're the one who discovered
Park Wonseok's body then reported it.

480
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,290
Though you weren't able
to save him like you did today.

481
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,917
Um, I'm not sure...

482
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,297
what you're talking about.

483
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,715
I didn't tell him.

484
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,551
If he knew that I was
Park Wonseok's twin sister,

485
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,553
I assumed he wouldn't even tell me
the truth.

486
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,680
Even if I were just trying
to ask about my brother.

487
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,267
Also, the other students
could have kept a distance from me.

488
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,145
I'd be grateful
if you could keep this a secret.

489
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,441
That's not a problem,

490
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,610
but if that's the reason you transferred
to this school, it will be a problem.

491
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,653
Excuse me?

492
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,947
If you still think
your brother was murdered,

493
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,620
and if you're here to find his murderer,
that's going to be a problem.

494
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,748
Why?

495
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,001
Why will it be a problem?

496
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,545
Isn't the fact that the police
didn't even bother to properly investigate

497
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,963
and resolve the case the bigger problem?

498
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,299
There was no evidence or reasonable
substantiation for his murder.

499
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,803
I will get down to the bottom of this.

500
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,222
No matter what.

501
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,016
I'll find the culprit.

502
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,396
Don't become too obsessed
with your brother's death.

503
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,941
Once you fall into a swamp,
it's hard to get out of it.

504
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,152
You're an athlete, focus on your sport.

505
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,196
Do you have anything else to ask me?

506
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,540
What did the male detective ask you?

507
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,334
What did he ask?

508
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,419
He just wanted to know how I found her.

509
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,797
Didn't you get the same question?

510
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,924
Well, yeah.

511
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,719
Did he ask you anything else?

512
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,388
What do you mean by anything else?

513
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,515
Did the female detective
ask you something else?

514
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,559
Not really.

515
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,315
By the way,
why did you come into the men's restroom?

516
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,402
What did you tell them about that?

517
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,238
I told her that I didn't even realize
I had followed you in there

518
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,115
because I was so overwhelmed
by my feelings for you.

519
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,827
I hate this girl.

520
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,953
Totally insane.

521
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,080
Hey! You just cussed me out, didn't you?

522
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,374
Of course, I would!

523
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,084
Tsk!

524
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,711
You really are a shooter, aren't you?

525
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,590
I'm gonna mess you up.

526
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,966
Man.

527
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,253
-Please calm down, Mr. Min.
-Mr. Principal!

528
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,922
Mr. Principal, can I have a minute?

529
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,507
Leave me alone!

530
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:11,262
Mr. Principal, please answer me! Please!

531
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,097
Why did my girl have to

532
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,850
cut her own wrist?

533
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,352
What...

534
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:22,315
What could my daughter possibly have done
to think about killing herself!?

535
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,775
-What's going on?
-Mr. Min.

536
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,694
Was the bastard that raped
my daughter let off easily

537
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,489
because his rich family paid
a few hundred thousand won?

538
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:33,868
While my daughter
suffers forever because of it?

539
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,039
Tell me how you could have
allowed Seonha to try and kill herself!

540
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,960
It's all because you let
that bastard come back to school!

541
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,004
Please, Mr. Min, please calm down.

542
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,716
I just can't bear it.
I'm so mad that I might kill myself too.

543
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,427
Where's that bastard?

544
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,264
Bring him here! I want to kill
that bastard with my own hands!

545
00:32:56,265 --> 00:33:01,562
What did my girl do wrong?
Why should she die?

546
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,572
YONGTAN HIGH SCHOOL

547
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,158
GIVE IT EVERYTHING YOU GOT!
YONGTAN SHOOTING TEAM

548
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,372
HONG AJUNG.

549
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,749
IT'S ME, HONG AJUNG.

550
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:26,963
COME TO THE ROOFTOP PARKING LOT
AT KING KONG BOWLING. 8 O'CLOCK TONIGHT.

551
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,756
OKAY, SEE YOU AT 8 O'CLOCK. THANKS.

552
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,143
ENTRANCE

553
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,395
SHOPPING CENTER ENTRANCE
ROOFTOP PARKING LOT ANNOUNCEMENT

554
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,990
Huh. I've never seen her before.

555
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,952
Think harder.

556
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,287
I'm positive.
I've never laid eyes on here.

557
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,997
Ever since I sprouted the first strand
of hair on my head.

558
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,125
Don't you dare talk about hair.

559
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,233
HONG AJUNG.

560
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,743
Ok Chanmi?

561
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,161
Uh...

562
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,871
I'm Hong Ajung.

563
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,168
Wow, She looks like a celebrity.

564
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,295
She's so pretty.

565
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,797
What's her name?

566
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,048
Hong Ajung.

567
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,804
What is it that you want to ask me?

568
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,934
I don't have anything to ask you.
I want to talk to Hong Ajung.

569
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,904
Aren't you in class 4?

570
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,782
What are you doing?

571
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,367
So you must already know
what Hong Ajung looks like.

572
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,619
Who are you?

573
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,496
Heard you transferred
from Busan or something.

574
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,083
Why are you trying to meet Hong Ajung?
And how do you know what she looks like?

575
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,210
None of your business.

576
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,796
Where is she?

577
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,922
What you don't realize
is that if you want to meet her,

578
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,050
you have to tell me
whatever it is you want to say to her.

579
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,970
Why are you sniffing to find out
more about Park Wonseok?

580
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,346
And how do you know Hong Ajung?

581
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,305
Shut up.

582
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,683
Where's Hong Ajung?

583
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,268
Enough with this nonsense.
Bring her here right now.

584
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,188
You grow a pair or something?

585
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,482
Anyways.

586
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,651
You.

587
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,653
Are. Done.

588
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,906
If you ever send her a message
or even try to talk about her,

589
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,199
I'll kill you.

590
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,374
Let Hong Ajung know

591
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,004
that if she feels even the tiniest bit bad
about Park Wonseok's death,

592
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,256
she should send me a message.

593
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,514
If you're trying to reach her
to talk about it,

594
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,474
you got the wrong person.

595
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,894
The one you should look for is Im Somi.

596
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,108
Im Somi?

597
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,323
MOM'S NURSING HOME

598
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,325
Yes, hello?

599
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,328
Hi, yes, sir.

600
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,705
Yes, I can talk right now.

601
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,376
Sir, I'm really sorry.

602
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,129
I know I should've paid
my mom's medical expenses on time.

603
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,631
I'm so sorry.

604
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,051
No, sir, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

605
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,637
Of course. I'll send you the money.

606
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,013
I'm sorry.

607
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,640
Yes, take care.

608
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,357
That girl Ok Chanmi
is totally out of her mind!

609
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,441
Huh?

610
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,653
She knows what Hong Ajung looks like.

611
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,905
Gosh, I even wore this,
but she knew I wasn't her.

612
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,157
Then she started getting all riled up,
telling me to bring Hong Ajung to her.

613
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,077
It seems like she has
some business with Park Wonseok.

614
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,206
Are you even listening to me?

615
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,126
How can I make money?

616
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,008
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

617
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,802
I'm serious.

618
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,890
What can I do to make money?

619
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,034
-Stay here for a minute.
-Sure.

620
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,042
IM SOMI

621
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,720
You said you want to know
about Park Wonseok?

622
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,807
Yes, I'm Ok Chanmi.

623
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,976
Thank you
for making the time today, really.

624
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,103
Do you want anything to drink?
How much do you know?

625
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,187
What?

626
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,230
What I'm asking is...

627
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,107
What exactly did they tell you
about me and Park Wonseok?

628
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,445
Nothing, I called to ask you
about that directly.

629
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,199
When I heard that Park Wonseok was dead,

630
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,788
I was genuinely really happy.

631
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,710
And when I heard he had killed himself,

632
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:01,130
I thought it was karmic retribution.

633
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,428
Because of him,
I had to transfer to another school, and

634
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,556
I never stopped thinking about
how I would kill them.

635
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,144
Why?

636
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,950
You think you're ready for this?

637
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,661
Park Wonseok, why are you the one
who's freaking out?

638
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,373
Gi Osung's the one who got her pregnant.
Tell Gi Osung to come here.

639
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,666
Shut up.
You can cut my wrist if I'm wrong.

640
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,796
Use this to prove you are really pregnant.

641
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,173
Here. Take it.

642
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,759
If you're not pregnant,
you gotta give up something too, right?

643
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:55,017
Are you saying I should pee
on this test right in front of you all?

644
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,602
I can't do that.

645
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,895
Take a look at this.

646
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,272
Isn't it enough that she took
a photo to show it to you?

647
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,234
-Huh?
-The test you're holding

648
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,820
is fucking fake. That's why.

649
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,239
If you're telling the truth,
why don't you prove it?

650
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,117
Hah, you son of bitch,
you're out of your mind.

651
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,994
Hey, Im Somi, why don't you just
prove it with this test

652
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,705
and have Park Wonseok's wrist slit?

653
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,793
-Let's go.
-Wait.

654
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,711
I'm neutral
since I'm not on anyone's side.

655
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,756
I'll follow Im Somi.
You're okay with that, right?

656
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,010
I'm not on anyone's side either.

657
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,513
I just don't want anyone to come out
saying something else later on.

658
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,473
So, I'll be recording a video, okay?

659
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,439
Hey, Im Somi, let's go.

660
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,108
You better record this properly.

661
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,402
Park Wonseok, you said
you'll bet your wrist on this right?

662
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,279
Stop talking.

663
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,532
Go do it already!

664
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,579
Give me that.

665
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,712
Hey, Im Somi, look here
and admit with your own mouth

666
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,548
that your pregnancy was a fucking lie.

667
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,386
Why can't you just say it?

668
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,183
You freaked on Gi Osung
and told him that you're pregnant.

669
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,101
Seriously, did you really think
you'd cash in big time

670
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,061
by lying about the pregnancy? Huh?

671
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,689
Do you think we're all idiots?

672
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,691
How dare you try to deceive us!

673
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,318
Hey, admit it.

674
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,862
Tell me you lied!

675
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,490
Park Wonseok.

676
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,743
I'm going to kill you one day.

677
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,372
Ooh, how scary.

678
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,135
Hey.

679
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,559
I wasn't the only one
that was happy to hear he was dead.

680
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,728
When he killed himself,

681
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,813
there were probably
a lot of people who celebrated.

682
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,734
He threatened people
by leveraging their secrets against them.

683
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,487
Park Wonseok was trash.

684
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,696
Is that...

685
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,242
true?

686
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,328
Why would I need to lie to you
when he's dead?

687
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,666
Im Somi...

688
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,627
Sorry.

689
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,631
Please let me apologize on his behalf.

690
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,451
Do you really think I feel
better knowing that Park Wonseok is dead?

691
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,453
I should've beaten him up
while he was alive.

692
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,746
That's what I feel regret the most.

693
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,669
There were probably a lot of people
who celebrated.

694
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,297
Park Wonseok was trash.

695
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,357
MIN * HA F/16 03/15 KIM JINSUNG

696
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,658
Is this Min Seonha's room...

697
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,202
Yes, and who are you?

698
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,955
Hello. I...

699
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,958
I'm one of Seonha's classmates.

700
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:48,959
I see...

701
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,128
I'm Seonha's father.

702
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,798
Seonha is sleeping
after her stabilizing treatment.

703
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,717
This...

704
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,177
This is for Seonha...

705
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,263
It's not fair.

706
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,975
I'm so upset about this, sir.

707
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:14,985
Come in.

708
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,237
Isn't this too late for a visit?

709
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,366
Well, it's not something
I could talk about at school.

710
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,619
What is it?

711
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,374
-Hmm?
-Hey.

712
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,543
Why don't we make some money
by forcing Sa Junggyeong out of school?

713
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,337
He seems to be just fine
even after raping Min Seonha.

714
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,256
Is your head on straight?

715
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,675
You're out of your mind.

716
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,761
Ji Sooheon, didn't you tell me
you were looking for ways to make money?

717
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,432
I just went to the hospital
to visit Min Seonha.

718
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,108
Mr. Min...

719
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,280
I was also

720
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,867
a victim of school bullying.

721
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,375
I especially know how Seonha
feels right now, more so than anyone else.

722
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,002
I really want to kill the bullies.

723
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,965
But we can't do anything about it.

724
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,551
That's why she cut her wrist.

725
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,636
If the law can't serve justice,

726
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,889
I'd like to go out there myself
and kill that bastard.

727
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,145
Mr. Min.

728
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,023
I can force them out of school.

729
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,401
I'll do it for you.

730
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,157
Are you crazy?

731
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,825
That doesn't make any sense.

732
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,034
No.

733
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,328
I'm not crazy.

734
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,292
Ji Sooheon.

735
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,337
You already saved me once before.

736
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,256
What the hell are you talking about?

737
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,467
-I'm not doing that!
-Ah...

738
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,344
From that day onward,

739
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,431
I had self-confidence.

740
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,391
I felt alive.

741
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,018
No.

742
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,644
I said I'm not doing it.

743
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,563
Do you remember
when I transferred here last year?

744
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,408
You bastard.

745
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,495
Hi. Hi.

746
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,122
Hi!

747
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,044
Hey, hey.

748
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,007
Oh no.

749
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,761
Come on, don't be scared.

750
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,097
White head, it's been a long time.

751
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,767
You shitty white head,
did you really think

752
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,769
everything would be over
once you transferred?

753
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,271
Wow, you've gotten prettier.

754
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,732
Look at her crying.

755
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,069
Oh, no, what should we do?

756
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,198
Go, go.

757
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,841
See? Isn't she pretty? Isn't she?

758
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,097
-Stand-up, stand-up!
-Stand-up, stand-up, stand-up

759
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,433
Aw, you must be hungry.

760
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,562
Here's your food.

761
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,605
Open your mouth! Good girl.

762
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,107
Yummy.

763
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,153
Look at me.

764
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,072

You two,

782
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,560
go apologize to Tae Soyeon.

783
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,979
Who the fuck are you to tell us
what to do? Motherfucker!

784
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,420
Sorry.

785
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,381
I did something terrible to you.

786
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,258
I apologize.

787
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,511
Please forgive me.

788
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,365
Get lost.

789
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,868
If I see you guys ever again...

790
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,206
...I'll kill all of you, for real.

791
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,540
Hey, it's late. Go home.

792
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,958
This is nonsense.

793
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,503
Just like how you saved me.

794
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,172
Let's save Min Seonha, too.

795
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,676
I know you didn't accept
the money my father...

796
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,596
handed to you as gratitude.

797
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,015
But we honestly would've felt it was
worth it to give you everything we had.

798
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,684
That's what my father said.

799
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,687
-No, really...
-Enough!

800
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,813
That's enough.

801
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,651
Those kinds of bastards don't care
about the law until they get beat up.

802
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,947
I'll give you until tomorrow
to think it over.

803
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,699
I'm off.

804
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,709
Shit.

Hello, is everything okay?

808
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,776
Yes, I'm Shin Yukyung's son.

809
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,446
Excuse me?
Did you say she has symptoms of pneumonia?

810
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,617
Patient name is Shin Yukyung.

811
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,662
Please head that way.

It's going to be fine.

815
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,540
Come on, shit!
Do you really think I'm scared

816
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,958
because Min Seonha cut her wrist?

817
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,044
Well, the
entire school is against you now.

818
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,463
You imbecile, why do you even care?

819
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,798
I'm working on something

820
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,551
that'll prevent her
from getting in my way ever again.

821
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,368
Hey, now you got me all curious.

822
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,702
What are you working on?

823
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,162
Man, just you wait.

824
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:12,374
If she sees this with her own eyes,

825
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,670
she'll either leave
or transfer out of school.

826
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,714
Shit, that scared the crap out of me.

827
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:23,760
Who's there?

828
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,179
The darkroom is reserved for me today.
Come back tomorrow.

829
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,890
Who are you?

830
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,726
Yo, hang up for a minute.

831
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,189
Why the hell isn't he answering?

832
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,859
What the...

833
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,153
F...

834
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,300
What's this?

835
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,180
Is this for cutting off fingers?

836
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,492
If you scream,
I'll cut all off your fingers.

837
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,376
Why are you doing this to me?

838
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,962
I'll call home,
and give you all the money you want.

839
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,423
I'm doing this
because of what you've done to Min Seonha.

840
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,594
I... I'm so sorry.

841
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,678
Please forgive me.

842
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,848
You should've
apologized to Min Seonha, not me.

843
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,184
I'm sorry! I did something terrible!

844
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,810
I know you did.

845
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,604
But you haven't been punished yet.

846
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,898
All sins must be punished accordingly.

847
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:03,401
I'm terribly sorry.
I'll do anything, please!

848
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,987
Please spare me! I'm sorry!

849
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,280
Tomorrow.

850
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,698
Drop out of school
and don't ever come back.

851
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,200
Yes, sir...

852
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,451
Drop out of school tomorrow,

853
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,994
and walk slowly
from the teacher's room to the main gate,

854
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,998
so that everyone can see you leaving.

855
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:21,378
What? Okay, I'll do that. I'm sorry.

856
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,700
What is this picture?

857
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,663
Didn't I ask you what this picture is?

858
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,582
That, that's...

859
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,093
Didn't I ask you what this picture is?

860
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,096
I'm asking you!

861
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,390
To threaten Min Seonha to drop out.

862
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,685
Open your mouth! Open it, motherfucker!

863
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,536
Don't come, don't come near!
Please, forgive me!

864
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,121
Don't come near me, please!

865
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,337
There might be some changes
in your personality.

866
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,176
You might experience changes
in personality or behavior

867
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,761
that you've never had before.
