1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,485
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,767
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,366
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,521
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,771
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,766
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,168
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,163
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,724
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,961
Ronnie.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,885
Seventeen people died that night.
Many more were injured.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,242
I'm not the most popular person these days.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,206
We're just supposed to get used
to working above a makeshift prison...

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,966
...housing evil people with superpowers.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,721
- What is this?
- Somewhere you'll never hurt anyone again.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,329
Farooq!
It's not safe. Come down.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,286
Farooq, I'm serious. It's gonna rain.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,485
Y'all are tripping.
This is the best seat in the house. Whoo!

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,281
You know, when I said we should watch
the particle accelerator turn on...

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,882
...I just meant we should get naked
and howl at the moon.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,051
It's already on. Consider me unimpressed.

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,448
Whoo! Yeah, baby!

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,723
- Oh, my God. This is awesome.
- Are you seeing this?

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,801
- Oh, man. I think I am tripping.
- Ha, ha, ha.

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,810
Oh, man.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,447
Get in the car! Get in the car!

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,001
Farooq!

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,400
- Oh, my God, Farooq!
- Farooq!

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,726
Argh!

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,610
- Good day, Dr. Wells.
- One can always hope, Gideon.

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,888
- Bring up my log, would you?
- Certainly.

32
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,322
- Go ahead, doctor.
- New entry.

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,042
It has now been 311 days
since lightning struck.

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,609
Subject has begun relying
on his speed in everyday life.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,087
Using his extraordinary powers...

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,324
...to solve ordinary problems.

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,441
I'm late.

38
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,448
Accomplish ordinary tasks.

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,205
Unfortunately, his penchant
for the heroic persists.

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,405
I hate it when they let the new guy
train during the morning rush.

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,124
- The fact is..-
- Don't try nothing.

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,881
- ...he can be a bit of a show-off.
- Wallet. Now.

43
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,242
Oh, this is awesome.
You've gotta be kidding me.

44
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,283
Hold on, okay? I'm gonna set this down.

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,443
Heh, heh. This is crazy. There are hundreds
of thousands of people in Central City.

46
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,530
Out of everyone you could
have picked to rob, you pick me. Heh, heh.

47
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,326
What are you, sick? Money. Now.

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,602
You're really gonna
be kicking yourself, man.

49
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,242
I mean, if there was an Olympics
for bad luck, you didn't just medal, pal.

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,521
You Michael Phelps-ed.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,571
I'm gonna count to three,
then I'm gonna shoot you.

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,165
- One...
- Yeah.

53
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,801
...two...

54
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,088
And while his desire
to help others is commendable...

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,122
...it is impeding him from realizing
the full scope of his abilities.

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,130
But...

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,922
...there's still time.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,928
As the future remains intact.

59
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,404
- Where's Barry? He's late.
- Late is kind of his signature move.

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,241
Hey, you guys wanna see
my signature move?

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,691
Sorry, guys. I got a little held up.

62
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,611
You had to be there.

63
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,207
I'm gonna need a moment
or two alone with Barry.

64
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,449
Ooh, you're in trouble.

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,163
Now, may I remind you, Mr. Allen...

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,204
...we had an agreement that we would help
with your heroics...

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,007
...while you would help us research
and develop your abilities in here. Right?

68
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,206
Yeah. No, I know.

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,847
I guess I've just gotten a little caught up
with being able to help people.

70
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,491
Put bad guys away. Feels good.

71
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,850
Imagine how good it would feel to cure
diseases, stop aging, reverse paralysis.

72
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,570
All good causes.

73
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,209
So how can I help you do that?
You need more MRis? More blood?

74
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,441
I need more speed.

75
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,449
- Okay.
- Speed is the key to progress.

76
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,450
You need to kick it up a notch.

77
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,446
There was a homicide.
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,483
This is not just about you.

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,806
Remember that, Barry.

80
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,845
Yeah.

81
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,807
- I hope you both skipped your breakfast.
- Whoa.

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,010
What the hell could do that?

83
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,204
Two thousand four hundred degrees,
give or take.

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,691
This area is filled with combustibles.
How come nothing else burned up?

85
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,010
Where you going?

86
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,646
See the soot on the ground
where the cement is burnt?

87
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,162
- Yeah.
- That's evidence of arc blasts.

88
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,569
Happens when high amperage currents
travel or arc through the air.

89
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,968
There's no live wires.
There's no utility poles.

90
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,128
So how was this guy electrocuted?

91
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,722
The first thing we need to do is ID him.

92
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,406
Yeah.

93
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,446
His face is melted off.
How's that picture gonna help ID him?

94
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,204
- I've got mad skills
- Please don't ever say that again.

95
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,563
All right.

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,561
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Why?

97
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,524
I don't know. You seem a little off.

98
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,361
No, I'm fine.

99
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,250
All right.

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,842
Facial reconstructive software.

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,931
It was designed for archeologists, and
it should help us ID your crispy corpse.

102
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,168
How did he get fried in the first place?

103
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,210
Is there a metahuman
that can control electricity?

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,603
It'd take a serious electrostatic discharge
to cause that tissue damage.

105
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,530
Guys, according to the software...

106
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,684
...there's an 82 percent chance
your victim looked like this.

107
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,481
- Eighty-two?
- It was zero when you walked in here, pal.

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,001
Cross reference with the DMV database?
Get a name?

109
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,851
Absolutely.
This software can do just about anything.

110
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,929
Now that Felicity reprogrammed it.

111
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,731
Casey Donahue. No wife, no kids. Used to work
at the Petersburg electrical substation.

112
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,530
That can't be a coincidence.

113
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,042
That's weird. Someone just used his ID
to enter the substation.

114
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,609
The Petersburg grid is experiencing
a power drain right now.

115
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,450
Barry be...

116
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,921
...careful.

117
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,567
I'm pretty sure this is a restricted area.

118
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,924
Easy there, zappy.

119
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,645
I have to feed.

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,645
Whoa, what was that?

121
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,568
More of that.

122
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,491
I need more.

123
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,926
Barry, what's happening?

124
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,281
Too much.

125
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,085
Too much.

126
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,243
Get out of there.

127
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,282
Run, Barry.

128
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,004
I can't.

129
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,123
My speed...

130
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,443
...is gone.

131
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,087
- He runs slow even for a normal person.
- Unh.

132
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,607
You can't just lose your powers. Okay?

133
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,531
Your DNA was transformed
by the particle accelerator blast.

134
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,762
There's no way to untransform DNA.

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,766
Yeah? Tell that to the Uber driver
who charged me 65 bucks to take me here.

136
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,008
Had to say I was coming
from a cosplay party.

137
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,649
So we were wrong. This metahuman doesn't
electrocute people. He siphons electricity...

138
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,365
...thereby removing your power.

139
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,967
All right, do we think
this is temporary or...?

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,286
We have to run tests.

141
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,680
Yeah.

142
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,610
I've gotta warn Joe.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,527
Barry, we will find a way
to restore your speed.

144
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,481
I promise you that.

145
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,167
- You didn't catch it.
- I loved that mug.

146
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,170
What part of "a metahuman stole
my speed" didn't you understand?

147
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,410
Barry, there's no part of anything
you can do that I ever understand.

148
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,486
- What does Dr. Wells say?
- He's working on it.

149
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,047
Barry, you have to get your speed back.

150
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,527
The people in this city need protecting.

151
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,969
If you don't get your speed,
how the hell are we gonna keep them safe?

152
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,926
The meta who stole my speed, he burned
up the body we saw in the alley today.

153
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,761
Tell the police not to confront him.
He's dangerous.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,571
- Who's dangerous?
- No one.

155
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,765
- Just some thief.
- Well, criminals better watch out.

156
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,566
Cops in Central City are
the best there are.

157
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,287
And if you can't protect this city, Dad,
I know the Flash will.

158
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,929
What if he can't? What if he's gone?

159
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,486
Gone?

160
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,286
Or maybe he's just done.

161
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,007
Or maybe whatever he could do before,
he can't do anymore.

162
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,761
Don't you have some place to be?

163
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,084
Yeah. I'm going.

164
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,528
Aw. Barry loved that mug.

165
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,804
That's a quality timepiece, young man.

166
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,406
Oh. Um, thanks.

167
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,810
They took mine.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,126
All of them.

169
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,164
Guess you shouldn't have done
whatever it is you did.

170
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,481
- Gideon, show me the future.
- Certainly, doctor.

171
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,927
Run a complete search.
Show any references to the Flash.

172
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,691
- Zero references to the Flash.
- Look again.

173
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,171
Zero references.

174
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,563
- Show any references to Barry Allen.
- Zero references to Barry Allen.

175
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,448
- Look again.
- I've searched 3452 times, Dr. Wells.

176
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,846
There's nothing.

177
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,330
- You think I'll ever wear it again?
- I hope so.

178
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,605
I didn't have my speed for very long.

179
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,002
But now that it's gone,
it feels like part of me is gone too.

180
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,090
With or without your speed,
you're still you, Barry.

181
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,801
But I'm not.

182
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,562
I'm not the best version of me.

183
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,841
I love being the Flash.

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,889
I love everything about it.

185
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,329
The feeling of running
hundreds of miles per hour.

186
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,525
Wind and powerjust rushing past my face.

187
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,529
Being able to help people.

188
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,001
I'm not sure I can live
without it, Caitlin.

189
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,085
Farooq Gibran.

190
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,730
- Who?
- The powers vampire who jacked your speed.

191
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,164
I hacked into surveillance footage from the
substation. It was easy to find a match.

192
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,563
He climbed an electrical tower
the night of the accelerator explosion.

193
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,768
No surprise where his powers came from.

194
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
This is not happening.

195
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,925
Dr. Harrison Wells, I need to see you!

196
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,127
Come on. I know you're inside.
Open the door.

197
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,122
I just wanna talk, Dr. Wells.

198
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,844
Wells, let me in!

199
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,130
Joe.

200
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,965
Hello, Iris.

201
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,966
I am out. I need you to cover for me
until the shift change.

202
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,966
Only one headline. Prison transfer.
William Tockman.

203
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,010
Guns on the floor.

204
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,807
It should take you
less than three seconds...

205
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,691
...to discard any thought
of rebellion and comply.

206
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,047
I take it I don't need to count out loud.

207
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,888
Hm. Hm.

208
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,610
Striking resemblance.

209
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,563
He's inside.

210
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,281
Captain, Tockman has at least 10 hostages.

211
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,528
Two officers down.

212
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,242
- Copy that. When is the power back?
- We're on gennies for now.

213
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,931
- Not now.
- Wait.

214
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,205
Capt. Singh, I've been trying to get in
touch with Joe or anyone at the precinct.

215
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,327
There's a hostage situation, Barry.

216
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,888
Joe's inside, so is his daughter.

217
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,082
- I'll call you when I know more.
- Wait.

218
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,442
Joe and Iris are in trouble.
I need my powers back now.

219
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,484
I have a theory. It's untested.

220
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,843
- I'm willing to roll the dice.
- Okay. You've lost your speed. Yes.

221
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,283
But nothing has changed
inside you on a subatomic level.

222
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,087
- Your cells are still primed.
- They just need a jump-start.

223
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,691
Okay, how do we jump-start me?

224
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,882
Replicate the initial jolt to your system.

225
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,250
But that would mean a peak current
of at least 20,000 kiloamps.

226
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,762
That's more electricity than they
give to people in the electric chair.

227
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,282
Caitlin, with Farooq in the building,
we're looking at a death sentence.

228
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,085
The spare generator's offline.

229
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,288
If we reboot it,
we could get a charge that big.

230
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,562
We need something
that can transmit the load...

231
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,041
...from the generator to Barry
without shorting out.

232
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,561
The treadmill.
My baby could take the charge.

233
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,526
- What if Barry can't?
- Well, that's up to Mr. Allen.

234
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,766
Where are you going?

235
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,091
I'm gonna talk to him.

236
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,482
- Nope. Nope.
- Okay...

237
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,127
...you didn't see him at the substation.
He needed to feed.

238
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,085
Igotsuperspeed
out of the particle accelerator blast.

239
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,760
But his best friends died.
He woke up with a disease.

240
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,889
Earlier today, you worked a crime scene...

241
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,361
...where this metahuman
electrocuted an innocent man.

242
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,766
He's a murderer.

243
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,090
And you are powerless
to defend yourself against him.

244
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,205
He may just need help like I did.
I don't need my powers to offer him that.

245
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,640
I have to try.

246
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,364
Tockman.

247
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,081
Tockman.

248
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,081
Tockman.

249
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,086
I am presently in control
of eight of Central City's finest...

250
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,927
...three underpaid assistants,
and one very brave civilian girl.

251
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,924
You've got demands. I wanna hear them.

252
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,484
But first, let the civilians go.

253
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,082
Would you prefer
I sent them out alive or dead?

254
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,725
Please be more specific.

255
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,362
One helicopter.
One vegetarian takeout meal.

256
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,610
One laptop with eight gigabytes of RAM
will be delivered on this roof...

257
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,721
...at exactly 53 minutes
and 27 seconds from now...

258
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,400
...or I shoot a hostage.

259
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,281
There is a citywide blackout.
I'm gonna need more time.

260
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,411
Captain, you may delay, but time will not.

261
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,450
Benjamin Franklin.

262
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,809
Very good, detective.

263
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,081
Hey, whoa. Whoa, easy.

264
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,611
I'm not gonna hurt you.

265
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,481
You can't hurt me.

266
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,128
Where is Harrison Wells?

267
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,288
Look, I know what happened to you.

268
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,165
The night of the accelerator explosion,
it changed you.

269
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,851
It changed me too.

270
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,404
You were the one in the red suit.

271
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,323
I fed from you.

272
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,531
- I have to keep feeding.
- Right. I know this has to be terrifying.

273
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,883
That's why I wanna help you.

274
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,121
Okay?

275
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,284
The night of the explosion
when the light hit me, it stopped my heart.

276
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,885
- Jake and Darya.
- They were your friends.

277
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,566
I woke up and they were beside me, dead.

278
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,687
They tried to give me CPR.
They were touching me and...

279
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,923
...I electrocuted them.

280
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,243
This is not your fault.

281
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,644
I know.

282
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,725
Wells did this to me.

283
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,251
Farooq, you need to listen to me.

284
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,810
- Not sure how long that'll hold.
- Done being noble, Mr. Allen?

285
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,841
Caitlin, get him to the treadmill.

286
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,404
Cisco, bring the generator online.
Make sure Barry gets the charge.

287
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,602
What? You're not coming with me?

288
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,009
I am not leaving you.

289
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,009
Listen to me.

290
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,043
Of everything I've done in my life...

291
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,564
...of everything I have invented,
my most important creation is the Flash.

292
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,207
Barry Allen must have a future. Now, go.

293
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,610
Go.

294
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,491
End this now, and I'll talk to the DA.

295
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,091
It was your district attorney
that denied me furlough...

296
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,682
...so I could visit my dying sister
one last time.

297
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,086
Say goodbye to her in person.

298
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,646
Time I'll never get back!

299
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,810
So however long I have in this life...

300
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,446
...I promise not one second more...

301
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,331
...will be spent in a prison cell.

302
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,530
- Unh!
- Got him.

303
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,045
Eddie!

304
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,285
Eddie. Eddie.

305
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,967
An officer was just shot 9.2 seconds ago.

306
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,565
I'd pick up the pace
in meeting my demands, captain.

307
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,451
I'm not healing fast anymore.

308
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,086
- That's unfortunate.
- Don't worry.

309
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,567
When Dr. Wells has a theory,
he's usually right.

310
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,369
What if something happens
to Joe and Iris first?

311
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,728
Come to check on your pet?

312
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,328
Why don't you just kill me, huh?
Get it over with.

313
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,242
Quid pro quo.

314
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,770
That's Latin, Mr. Woodward.
You've heard of Latin?

315
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,202
Quid pro quo means
"something for something."

316
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,802
And in this case
that something is your freedom.

317
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm prepared to grant it to you.

318
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,845
How do you know I won't kill you?

319
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,247
A calculated risk. One I'm willing to take.

320
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,404
- Really?
- That's right.

321
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,568
- Why would you do that?
- Because...

322
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,846
...there is another metahuman
loose in this facility.

323
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,602
And I want you to kill him.

324
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,364
Did you know the human body
generates electricity?

325
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,207
The average person gives off 342 watts.

326
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,888
And I can smell it coming from you.

327
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,321
Turn on the treadmill.

328
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,211
- You're still hurt.
- We don't have time.

329
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,288
Been dying to punch somebody.

330
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,041
Ouch.

331
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,690
- Caitlin.
- I can't.

332
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,009
- We don't have a choice.
- If I turn this on, it could kill you.

333
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,690
If you don't, we could all die.

334
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,287
I already lost someone I cared about
in this building. I can't do it again.

335
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,520
Listen.

336
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,088
Someone once told me that I was
struck by that lightning for a reason.

337
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,368
That it chose me.

338
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,846
I'm not sure I believe it.

339
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,571
Right now, it doesn't
matter what I believe.

340
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,406
What do you believe?

341
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,365
Come on.

342
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,042
Unh!

343
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,207
My God. You okay?

344
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,646
Did you feel anything?

345
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,480
It didn't work.

346
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,523
Please. He's bleeding.
You have to let us get him some help.

347
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,000
You'll stay where you are.

348
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,647
While you're killing time,
he's bleeding out.

349
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,170
"As if you could kill time
without wounding eternity."

350
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,725
Henry David Thoreau.

351
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,365
Good.

352
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,330
- Little battlefield trick.
- Eddie.

353
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,210
If he lives long enough
to receive medical treatment...

354
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,882
...they'll know the exact time
the tourniquet was applied.

355
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,210
What? No "thank you"? Heh, heh.

356
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,043
They call you the Clock King, right?

357
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,402
A somewhat florid appellation,
but I've grown to see the humor in it.

358
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,202
- You're going back to prison.
- Really? Heh, heh.

359
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,409
- And how do you reckon?
- Because the Flash is coming.

360
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,211
Oh.

361
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,728
Where are you?

362
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,283
Tony. Tony, what are you doing?

363
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,210
Come on. You know me, Allen.

364
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,729
I never run from a fight.

365
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,527
All right. Well, stay with me. Okay?
You're good.

366
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,163
Run. Unh.

367
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,526
What?

368
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,365
H9)'-

369
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,165
Tony.

370
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,285
No.

371
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,490
Barf)'-

372
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,930
Early.

373
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,804
You ever see the city at night by
helicopter? It's quite spectacular.

374
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,728
You're winded. That's not good.

375
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,440
I need to take your blood
and figure out what happened.

376
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,163
I can't believe he's dead.

377
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,401
Dr. Wells?

378
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,727
No. No. Tony Woodward.

379
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,049
- He escaped the Pipeline.
- He must've got out when the blackout hit.

380
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,528
Not possible. The Pipeline was designed
to withstand power outage.

381
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,768
Someone had to have let him go.

382
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,086
I did.

383
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,841
I released him.

384
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,041
Why?

385
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,449
To divert our intruder's attention
while we worked to restore your speed.

386
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,530
You used him as a distraction?

387
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,929
An unnecessary one as it turns out,
it seems the plan has failed.

388
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,967
I have his blood on me.
How could you do that?

389
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,243
You're showing sentiment
for a man who tormented you as a child.

390
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,161
Tony might've been a bully then and now,
but he didn't deserve to die.

391
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,921
Does Caitlin, or Cisco, or me, or you?

392
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,046
I had a choice to make, him or us.
I chose us without a second thought.

393
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,767
Well, all your talk about miracle cures
and scientific breakthroughs...

394
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,531
...but you don't care about people at all.

395
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,405
Maybe you care too much.
Being a hero is important to you.

396
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,649
I respect your ideals.
I don't have the luxury of sharing them.

397
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,242
I forgot. Your game's chess.

398
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,888
We're all just pawns to you. Right?

399
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,444
So, what's your move, doctor?

400
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,922
Which one of us gets sacrificed next?

401
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,566
We have to get out.

402
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,205
We just left him on D-level.

403
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,840
We'll never make the main entrance
from here.

404
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,122
What about the garage?
The mobile lab van?

405
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,845
It's my move, Mr. Allen.

406
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,122
And I say we make a run for it.

407
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,651
Oh, my God. Barry, look.

408
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,286
Your cells are rapidly regenerating.

409
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,646
- I still don't have my speed.
- It must be mental.

410
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,648
Not physical.

411
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,680
- Ho-ho. You have the yips.
- The whats?

412
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,844
When a second baseman
all of a sudden can't throw to first...

413
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,362
...or a golfer tries to putt,
and they get all embarrassed and upset.

414
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,570
That makes the yips worse, and it's a hot
mess. They feel like even more of a failure.

415
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,442
That's not helping.

416
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,566
You asked if I believed you were struck by
lightning for a reason, if you were chosen.

417
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,651
I believe.

418
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,330
You should too.

419
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,441
Let's move.

420
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,688
Tockman, no. No. Don't do this.
Not her. Take me. Please.

421
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,606
Something tells me you will not
be a docile passenger. She will.

422
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,128
- Dad. Dad.
- Wait. Wait. Let her say goodbye.

423
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,482
This is her boyfriend lying here dying.

424
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,971
I think you and me both know
that he probably won't make it.

425
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,080
It's wrong you didn't get to
say goodbye to your sister.

426
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,844
Give them what you deserved.

427
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,324
You have 20 seconds.

428
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,490
Eddie. Eddie.

429
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,604
- Sorry, babe.
- No. Please.

430
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,327
You have to hang on for me. Okay?
I'm gonna be right back.

431
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,725
Ankle holster.

432
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,881
Let's go.

433
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,491
Second van. Keys are inside.

434
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,364
Come on.

435
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,888
Get in. Come on.

436
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,761
Come on.

437
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,201
He's here.

438
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,566
Unh!

439
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,563
- Barry.
- Quickly.

440
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,730
"Time and tide wait for no man."

441
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,562
- Wait. Let her say goodbye.
- You have 20 seconds.

442
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,091
Ankle holster.

443
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,130
Iris!

444
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,210
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

445
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,767
- Did he hit you?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

446
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,407
- Guys.
- Oh, my God.

447
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,966
- Oh, my God. No. Please.
- Hey.

448
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,322
You're here for me.

449
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,283
Finally, you show your face.

450
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,202
Well, I wasn't exactly eager to be killed.

451
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,323
Neither were my friends.

452
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,526
I know.

453
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,290
I hurt a lot of people that night.

454
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,126
People? You don't even know their names.

455
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,601
Jake Davenport.

456
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,081
Darya Kim.

457
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,721
Ralph Dibney. Al Rothstein. Grant Emerson.

458
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,163
Will Everett. Bea De Costa.

459
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,241
Ronnie Raymond.

460
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,242
I know the names of every person
who died that night. They mattered.

461
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,728
And the fact that the world
is now deprived of their potential...

462
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,481
...is something I have to live
with every day, but these people...

463
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,042
These people have done nothing wrong.
You wanna punish me? Fine.

464
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,242
Let's do that.

465
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,129
But let these people live.

466
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,881
You died that night too.

467
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,246
No!

468
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,484
You just didn't know it till today.

469
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,209
Iris.

470
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,765
- We could've called him Blackout.
- He had a name, Cisco.

471
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,444
I'm still not sure what happened.

472
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,321
Why didn't he just siphon
all my powers like before?

473
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,923
Because you finally stopped thinking about
your powers and just connected to them.

474
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,446
Look. This is a sample of your blood from
just after you were struck by lightning.

475
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,447
Now your cells are generating
more energy than ever before.

476
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,207
It was more energy
than the meta could safely handle.

477
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,329
It's almost like he choked on you.

478
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,167
- What does that mean?
- I think it means you kicked it up a notch.

479
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,164
Dr. Wells.

480
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,330
What I said about
how you don't care about people...

481
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,280
Mm. No. Look, Barry.

482
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:12,161
There is a reason
that my biography describes me as...

483
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,285
...arrogant, prickly, brusque.

484
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,005
"At times, contemptuous."

485
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,924
- I read it twice.
- You were right.

486
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,851
I don't care much for people.
I find them misinformed.

487
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,121
Shortsighted.

488
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,005
So why do you do what you do?
Why get up in the morning?

489
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,003
Because I believe in a better future.

490
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,687
One that I very much want to see.
One that you are a part of.

491
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,088
I might not much care for people, Barry,
but I care about you.

492
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,169
- Hey, Allen.
- Hey, Eddie.

493
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,810
Flowers?

494
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,725
That's so nice. Heh, heh, heh.

495
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,524
Where were you all night?

496
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,202
Home. Tried to eat all the ice cream
before it melted.

497
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,641
I love ice cream. Ha, ha, ha.

498
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,171
He is on pain meds.

499
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,569
Lots of them, but he's gonna be okay.

500
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,082
It's been some night.
I am gonna get some coffee. I'll be back.

501
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,681
Do it.

502
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,247
Awesome.
I guess you're feeling better.

503
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,169
Oh, yeah.

504
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,400
Did you guys see that?

505
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,090
You're just high, partner.

506
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,847
Right. I forgot. Ha, ha, ha.

507
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,368
Oh, now you show up.

508
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,888
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you tonight.

509
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,645
It couldn't be helped.

510
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,004
It's okay. A girl's gotta be her own hero
every now and again.

511
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,882
I promise I'll never be late again.

512
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,406
My best friend is always saying that,
and he is always late.

513
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,962
You're worth being on time for.

514
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,961
Honey, you all right?

515
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,960
Yeah. Why?

516
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,204
You forgot your coffee.

517
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,806
Oh. Heh.

518
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,405
Good day, Dr. Wells.

519
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,849
Yes it is, Gideon. Bring up my log, please.
New entry.

520
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,840
It has now been 312 days
since lightning struck.

521
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,250
In the past 24 hours,
subject has taken a great leap forward...

522
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,365
...causing me to revise my initial thesis.

523
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,164
I thought...

524
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,123
Well, I thought
his attachment to people...

525
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,282
...was a distraction
slowing down his progress.

526
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,249
Now I realize the opposite is true.

527
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,528
Barry's attachment to people...

528
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,161
...people he cares about...

529
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,243
...is actually the key
to getting him up to speed.

530
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,245
In the meantime, good news.

531
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,410
The future remains intact.

532
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,166
You're early.

533
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,603
Yeah. I know. It feels weird to me too.

534
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,889
I thought after yesterday,
you'd wanna sleep in.

535
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,085
Can't. There's too much work to do.

536
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,011
I'm ready to do it. I wanna push myself.

537
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,602
Find out how fast I can really go.

538
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,245
You were right.

539
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,727
This is not just about me.

540
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,050
Let's get to work.

541
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,163
Now, you...

542
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,763
...had the ability to steal
the Flash's powers, and I...

543
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,641
...would love to know...

544
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,965
...how you did that.
