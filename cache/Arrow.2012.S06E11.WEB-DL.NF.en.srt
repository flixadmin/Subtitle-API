our two separate teams,
could share information.

156
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,005
Yeah, uh, that's a good idea.

157
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,716
We'll share any
and all information that can help.

158
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,927
Okay, thanks, Curtis.
I'll send you what I've got so far.

159
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,721
[exhales]

160
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,140
I hope that's all right, guys.
I know we looked at each other,

161
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,725
but we actually didn't verbalize.

162
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,518
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh, we agreed, Curtis.

163
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,860
-Frank Pike is dead.
-[Curtis] What?

164
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,446
He was killed by one
of Cayden James' hacks.

165
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,823
[device whirring]

166
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,200
Is Felicity doing this?

167
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,871
Wait, that...

168
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,290
-[device chirping]
-That can't be.

169
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,917
You know what?
The last time I saw it doing this,

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,627
it was tracking Vigilante's visor.

171
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,797
I know, but he modified his electronics
to block our signal. But...

172
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,300
-[device whirring]
-This is real.

173
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,760
It's locking on to him.

174
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,971
Because your balls never malfunction?

175
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,016
Really? Not this time.

176
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,060
All right, but, I mean...

177
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,479
Could he have messed up?
Did he forget we could track him?

178
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,314
No way, he's too devious.

179
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,525
I think the son of a bitch
is trying to draw us out.

180
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,901
Trap us.

181
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,738
I say we trap him.

182
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,534
You all in?

183
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,914
One, two, three... Suit up.

184
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,213
Yeah, I don't think we should say
"Suit up" all together.

185
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,506
It'd be really cool if we did, though.

186
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,799
I don't think it would be really cool.

187
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,384
I mean, let's just be different than OTA.

188
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,052
Let's be like NTA and say it together.

189
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,930
But we are NTA and we're cooler
without having to say "Suit up."

190
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,265
Listen, this is kind of what Oliver...

191
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,100
-I'm just saying...
-I'm just saying we should try...

192
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,769
[indistinct police chatter]

193
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,855
I'm sorry I'm late. There was
an airplane crash on State Street.

194
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,317
It's awful. Is this the Cayden James
you've been talking about?

195
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,403
Most likely. Look, Quentin
can bring you up to speed.

196
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,738
I've asked him to run things here
with your help.

197
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,990
-Absolutely.
-[Quentin] Yeah.

198
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,075
Listen, we're taking SCPD systems offline.

199
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,412
We're setting up communication trees
so officers can talk in person.

200
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,122
Okay, cool. It's just like the old days.

201
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,206
I'm not that old.

202
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,541
Look, I think it's a great idea.

203
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,918
We should take everything
in the city's government on analog,

204
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,254
and that way, we're out of James' reach.

205
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,423
In the meantime, we need to do
everything that we can

206
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,841
to minimize panic.

207
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,635
Why don't we set up libraries, uh,

208
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,638
gyms and civic centers
with SCPD protection?

209
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,433
We can take them completely off-grid.
People can come, feel safe.

210
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,101
Safe zones are a good idea.

211
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,728
Now, I have to get back to City Hall.

212
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,062
With the death of Councilman Grovner...

213
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,606
-[sighs] No, go.
-Go, go, go.

214
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,690
We got it.

215
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,983
-Okay.
-[Quentin] Good luck.

216
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,158
I got nothing in the alleyway.

217
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,076
[Wild Dog] [over comms]
<i>Same for the parking garage.</i>

218
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,829
-Zilch here. Back to base?
-[static]

219
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,165
What was that? You're comm's breaking up.

220
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,083
Yeah, I'm getting some interference
on my side, too.

221
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,460
Can you guys hear me?

222
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,753
[Vince] No, they can't.

223
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,548
You're jamming us.

224
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,091
I'll be brief.

225
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,302
I'm on your side.

226
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,513
Cayden James is my target, too.

227
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,682
I'm undercover with his organization.

228
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,185
You think this "T" on my face
stands for "gullible"?

229
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,103
You know what I mean.

230
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,482
I tried telling Dinah last week,
but she didn't give me the chance.

231
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,777
Right now, James is killing
dozens of people.

232
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,196
By tonight, it'll be hundreds.

233
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,407
I need your help.

234
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,619
Why should I trust you?

235
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,539
Go to the subway tunnels where
the Red Line and the Gold Line cross.

236
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,833
An hour from now.

237
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,127
You might be able to save some lives.

238
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,546
Or I could lead my teammates into a trap.

239
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,175
I could have trapped you here.

240
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,427
But I didn't.

241
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,732
Harold Grovner
was a dedicated civil servant.

242
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,277
Who always wanted what was best
for this city

243
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,904
and we will not forget that.

244
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,449
But with everything that is happening,

245
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,161
we don't have the time
to mourn at the moment.

246
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,831
So, please, let's get back to work.

247
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,210
Becky, I need Councilmen Gattis,
McCaskell and Kullens,

248
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,294
in that order please.

249
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,838
Your 10:00 a.m. is here.

250
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,882
I don't have a 10:00 a.m.
on my schedule, and even if I did...

251
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,885
I think you'll find this one's
rather important.

252
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,515
Ben Gayle, pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Mayor.

253
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,225
Thanks for making the time.

254
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,768
Thank you, Becky.

255
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,066
I'll let you
make the usual threats in a minute.

256
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,194
But before we get to that, you should
know that my colleagues are expecting

257
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,946
to hear from me in six.

258
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,865
And if they don't, well,

259
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,994
you would be remiss in forgetting
the thermobaric explosive

260
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,537
that remains in my possession.

261
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,873
What do you want?

262
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,583
I've already told you.

263
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,503
Vengeance for my son.

264
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,055
I cared for him, protected him, loved him,

265
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,558
just as you do this city.

266
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,019
But now,

267
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,440
your city's entire infrastructure
is under my control.

268
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,027
Buildings, institutions, even people,

269
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,696
all under my dominion.

270
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,031
These are innocent people.

271
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,866
And you can save them...

272
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,041
By wiring $10 million
into that offshore account

273
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,003
no later than 11:30 tonight.

274
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,759
And every night.

275
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,969
Until further notice.

276
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,517
That will bankrupt us.

277
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,060
Well, I certainly hope so.

278
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,021
Please don't imagine that I've gone
to these lengths for money.

279
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,023
No, this is for you.

280
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,234
So that you'll suffer.

281
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,694
I didn't kill your son.

282
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,907
Yes, you did. One year ago,

283
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,408
this very day,

284
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,327
right here in Star City.

285
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,372
You missed your intended target,

286
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,708
but your arrow found its way into my boy.

287
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,549
Are you seeking vengeance?
If you want revenge,

288
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,762
why haven't you just outed me
as the Green Arrow?

289
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,764
If my understanding is correct,

290
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,724
that's already been done.

291
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,812
Star City will not negotiate
with a terrorist.

292
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,357
Oh, spare me the political claptrap,
Mr. Queen.

293
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,318
By tonight,
that will sound hollow even to you.

294
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,751
[computer beeps]

295
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,879
You okay?

296
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,339
I have tried every trick

297
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,300
to counter-hack what Cayden is doing,

298
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,218
and I am completely boxed out.

299
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,929
So I contacted Alena
to help me figure out why

300
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,140
and the answer is, is that it's my fault.

301
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,225
Felicity, what are you talking about?

302
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,853
When we stopped Cayden and Laurel
from blowing up the Internet vault?

303
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,229
Uh-huh.

304
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,898
That was all a ruse.

305
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,150
Cayden just wanted us to think
that people were in trouble

306
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,277
so that I would break through
his firewall,

307
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,406
but instead of blocking him, I was
actually helping him plant a virus.

308
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,700
Now he has complete control
of the entire city.

309
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,370
The hackcident is killing
one person every 18 minutes

310
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,122
and I have no idea how to stop it.

311
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,498
I do.

312
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,834
Thanks to Cayden James,
who was kind enough

313
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,419
to pay me a visit at City Hall.

314
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,838
-What did he want?
-He wants $10 million a day.

315
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,843
That's not the actual part. He told
me the details of his son's death.

316
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,803
He was killed one year ago today.

317
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,139
Cayden thinks that he was
collateral damage from a fight

318
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,766
that I had in Star City.

319
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,726
It's not possible.

320
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,353
You were in Hub City recruiting Dinah.

321
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,354
Yup.

322
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,982
If Cayden James is motivated by revenge,
maybe we can get him to stand down.

323
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,860
Oh, I like that idea, because I have
no way of stopping him my way,

324
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,279
and I have no location for you
to find him your way.

325
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,323
Felicity, we need incontrovertible proof.

326
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,367
Yeah, I know. I'm on it.

327
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,620
[Dinah Drake] I can't believe
we didn't catch Vincent.

328
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,747
He had a 20-minute lead on us.

329
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,249
Where have you been?

330
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,251
Long story. I need to check on something.

331
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,254
[line ringing]

332
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,756
[cell phone buzzes]

333
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,216
-Hey.
-Hey.

334
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,635
If we're still sharing intel, I need
you to check on something for me.

335
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,719
Yeah. Shoot.

336
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,472
The subway system specifically
where the Red and Gold Line meet.

337
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,266
<i>-I'm trying to stave off a disaster.</i>
-[typing]

338
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,228
Yeah, the automatic track signals
just went offline. How did you know?

339
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,397
-Lucky guess.
-You want backup?

340
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,608
Felicity, I appreciate the intel, but
we're not working together anymore.

341
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,985
My team can handle it.

342
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,737
Handle what?

343
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,406
[sighs]

344
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,200
Cayden James is going to attack
the subway in less than an hour.

345
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,494
I'd say suit up but we already are,
so let's go.

346
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,372
You guys, take a look at this.

347
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,333
This is the city's transportation system,

348
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,086
and these are all the accidents
that have happened so far.

349
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,089
A lot around the edges.
The train lines and the freeways.

350
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,716
He's laying siege to the city.

351
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,385
It's probably why he wanted the port.
It's exactly what he's doing.

352
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,720
He wants to block off all the exit routes.

353
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,847
And stop all the reinforcements
from the outside.

354
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,266
Any roads he hasn't hit yet?

355
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,644
Yeah, there's one exit left under
the city and it's the tunnel.

356
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,940
William.

357
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,664
[indistinct chatter]

358
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,961
I saw your new mom on TV.
She's pretty hot.

359
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,296
[laughing]

360
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,757
She read you bedtime stories?

361
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,843
Well, at least she can read,
unlike your mom.

362
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,890
This field trip, it's going to be fun.

363
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,144
-[Oliver] You sure you're good?
-Yup, never better.

364
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,979
I had Cisco put this together.

365
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,731
[sighs]

366
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,358
-You okay?
-Yeah.

367
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,903
[Oliver] We need to move.

368
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,742
Let's go save your son.

369
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,330
[Mr. Terrific] Careful
around these metal lines.

370
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,915
Sometimes they can be electrified.

371
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,917
[Black Canary] I know that, T.
I'm not six.

372
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,460
[Wild Dog] I didn't know that.

373
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,715
Hey, these tracks are set to cross.
The trains are going to collide.

374
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,469
That could be the switch,
that lever. Pull it.

375
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,556
[straining]

376
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,641
It's stuck.

377
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,309
These switch boxes are locked though.

378
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,811
All right, stand back.

379
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,566
Here we go.

380
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,652
Okay. Well, Plan B...

381
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,863
Actually, there's no Plan B because
Cayden James has completely

382
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,448
overwritten everything we can do here.

383
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,742
-Maybe Plan C would be...
-Guys.

384
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,911
[Mr. Terrific] We can literally
just start pulling things out

385
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,287
till we get the right circuit.

386
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,540
Guys!

Pull it all out. Pull it all out!

00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,046
It's not working. Hurry!

390
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,382
-Hey, what's Plan D?
-There's no Plan D.

391
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,217
-What?
-Yes, there is.

We have to get out of here.
Everyone stay calm and follow me.

We have to get out of the back.

-All right, it's okay, it's okay.
-Dad.

We got everyone out safely.

433
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,809
Unfortunately, that tunnel was
the last way out of the city.

434
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,395
So, this is your secret hideout?

435
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,522
Yeah.

436
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,567
You said you weren't
the Green Arrow anymore.

437
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,031
John did take over for me,
but he got injured.

00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,952
-Guess he's not injured anymore?
-No, he's not.

439
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:14,082
We've lost the other members
of our team, William, and...

440
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,835
I can't have him out there
on his own right now

441
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,670
with everything that's going on.

-Listen, buddy. I promise...
-You've promised before.

443
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,558
I need to go meet your Aunt Thea.

444
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,188
Could you please hang here?

-[Rene] Damn, that was so fire.
-[all chuckle]

446

Hey, man, New Team Arrow is kicking ass.

447
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,455
You know what? I really have to say

448
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,332
that I think we should change our name.

449
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,334
What do you guys think
about "The Outsiders"?

450
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,462
Ooh. Um... I think
it was a really awesome book.

451
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,425
You guys, talking to Felicity
actually was a good idea.

452
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,886
I mean, if she hadn't given us that
intel, those people would be dead.

453
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:12,599
About that. I got that information
from Vincent Sobel.

454
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,604
-I'm sorry, what?
-I didn't trust him at first either.

455
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,191
Okay, but I called Felicity
to confirm if his intel checked out,

456
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,734
and it did, clearly.

457
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,445
And that's why you were late
getting back here earlier,

458
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,696
you were talking to him?

459
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,282
So, you didn't bother telling us?

460
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,034
How very Oliver Queen of you.

461
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,662
[Curtis] I had to get all the information
first before I looped you guys in.

462
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,747
Then once I did have all the information,

463
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,374
we had to stop a subway collision.

464
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,335
But we did, and now here I am,
telling you guys.

465
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,795
Telling us what?

466
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,172
Why would Vince help us?

467
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,966
He says he's a double agent working

468
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,884
to take down Cayden James from the inside.

469
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,513
I mean, that does track,
and the guy used to be undercover.

470
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,850
Which makes him a professional liar.

471

He's had so many opportunities
to tell me he's a double agent.

472
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,356
Why hasn't he?
He just somehow forgot to mention it?

473
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,732
He says he tried to.

474
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,194
That is absolute crap.

475
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,446
Maybe. But if he turns out to be legit,

476
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,449
he could offer a tactical advantage
that we can't turn down.

Well, I can, because I will
never work with him again, ever.

so much happening right now

that people are too scared
to even come to the safe zones.

494
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,164
Worse still, I got cops standing
around here doing nothing

I'd like to redeploy them.

497
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,419
No. If we get people here,

498
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,379
then we don't need to worry
about protecting them out there.

-Okay.

-Yes.
-You got something?

505
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,274
Bull's-eye.

506
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,068
Alena remembered that last May,

507
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,444
Cayden received a package
from Corto Maltese

508
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,528
and she thinks that in that package

509
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,906
was the evidence that made Cayden
think that Oliver killed Owen.

510
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,532
And how exactly is that a bull's-eye?

511
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,201
Because we know Oliver didn't kill Owen.

512
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,203
So whatever was in that package,
that evidence...

513
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,622
That evidence had to have been
faked somehow.

514
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,541
-Bull's-eye. Boom.
-All right.

515
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,044
You okay?

516
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,756
Yeah. Yeah, it's just stupid.

517
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,716
Well, you don't do stupid, so?

518
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,387
I don't know. I was just hoping that

519
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,473
since the implant was working
so well, that maybe...

520
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,891
You'd be putting the hood back on?

-Yeah.
-I'm sure you will.

You know, once this whole Cayden
thing is dealt with.

Hope so.

Hope so for his sake.

Now sadly this has already led
to a number of casualties

including our police captain, Frank Pike,

540

Mr. James has made his demands,
but make no mistake,

542
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,414
he is a terrorist,

543
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:09,085
and Star City does not negotiate
with terrorists.

Period.

On Cayden James' son?

562
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,031
So Alena thinks that Cayden believes
that you killed his son

563
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,410
because of something that arrived in
a package from Corto Maltese in May.

564
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,995
Through a pretty close sequence
of hacks on the mail systems

565
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,164
of several different countries,
not that you need to know about it,

566
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,541
but it was really intense and really cool

567
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,625
and I did it, it was really hard.

568

You don't need to know about those.
In that package was a USB drive,

we actually have that USB drive's
serial number,

570

so Alena is just working on trying
to find the computer in Corto Maltese

571

that uploaded the information
onto that drive that Cayden received.

572

The information that made him think
that you killed his son.

573

You see how I came full circle on that?

Well, let's break it down.
You know, pro/con style.

All right.

585

Pro, he's really good and he gets
deep into his assignments.

586
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,406
Con, on our last assignment,
he got in too deep.

587
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,909
He can forget what side he's on.

588

Pro, he's in with Cayden James
and his crew,

589
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,915
and his last intel worked.

590

592
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,132

You know, there's, um,
a study I was reading

Because, you know,

626
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,366
genetics.

627
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:01,711
Aren't you ready yet? We're moving out.

628
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,505
I'll be right there.

629
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,561
[beeping]

630
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,980
[Dinah Drake] What's going on?

631
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,025
Vincent's using the link to my
T-Sphere to send a message.

632
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,652
Morse code.

633
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,236
Clever, what does it say?

634
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,822
"Attack."

635
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,911
"Oak Street,"

636
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,914
"now."

637
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,584
I'm assuming that's a warning,
not a directive.

638
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,253
Oak Street is one of the safe zones
Oliver and Quentin set up.

639
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,630
[sighs]

640
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,465
What do you want to do?

641
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,261
Suit up.

642
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,146
[Wild Dog] Officers marching, guns out.
City under siege.

643
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,148
It's like <i>Escape from Detroit.</i>

644
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,735
I don't know whether to correct you
or to just embrace your attempt

645
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,988
at referencing one of my favorite
John Carpenter films.

646
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,572
-Huh?
-I think the point,

647
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,242
is that people are scared. It's not good.

648
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,663
They should be scared.
It's why they need us.

649
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,249
When you say "us," do you mean just you,

650
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,460
and it's a passive dig at
our team, no pun intended?

651
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,337
Or do you mean all of us,

652
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,090
and you recognize our own team
as being independent...

653
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,426
Curtis, we got your message,
thanks for reaching out.

654
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,302
What are we dealing with here?

655
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,681
[Wild Dog] We have it on good authority
this place is Cayden James' next target.

656
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,393
-How do you know?
-We know. That's all that matters.

657
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,749
Not to spoil the really awkward
team reunion, but you have incoming.

658
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,959
Oh, you have lots of incoming.

659
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,794
[men shouting]

660
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,671
[people panicking]

661
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,132
We need to move out. Right now.

662
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,058
Is Dad gonna be okay?

663
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,976
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

664
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,936
I know you're not all that
happy with your dad right now,

665
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,104
but this,

666
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,940
this is what he does best,
and nobody does it better.

667
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,901
[William] <i>But everybody makes mistakes,</i>

668
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,904
things go wrong,
you can't plan for everything.

669
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,740
Yeah, you're right.

670
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,161
What your dad does, it's...

671
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,413
<i>It's very dangerous.</i>

672
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,416
And heroes don't always make it home.

673
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,003
I never forget that.

674
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,218
[grunting]

675
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,681
[Felicity]<i>But, you know,
I've loved your dad</i>

676
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,392
<i>from the first time he brought me
a bullet-riddled computer.</i>

677
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,728
Remind me to tell you about that one.

678
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,232
<i>That was a long time ago, which means
I've loved him for a long time,</i>

679
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,026
which means I've worried about him
for a long time.

680
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,571
And he hasn't always been truthful.

681
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,324
<i>He's lied, he's kept secrets,</i>

682
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,120
he's not perfect.
This life, it's not ideal.

683
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,124
But he makes his sacrifices,
so we have to make ours.

684
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,167
[men shouting on video]

685
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,252
[Felicity] I sometimes think to myself,

686
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,712
that that's what makes this love
deeper than other kinds of love.

687
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,006
I know it sounds cheesy, but...

688
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,843
It does, because we can't
take things for granted.

689
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,553
<i>We have to live with the fear
and the uncertainty</i>

690
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,847
<i>that everything
can be taken from us in an instant.</i>

691
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,306
[Boots] Traitor!

692
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,267
I'm taking you to hell with...

693
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,690
[Felicity] <i>'Cause that's the price we pay
for choosing the people that we love.</i>

694
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,026
Everything he does,
he does for a good reason.

695
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,112
Or what he thinks is a good reason.

696
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,243
So you can worry about your dad,
but you have to believe

697
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,037
that he's going to be okay.

698
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,207
Because that's the only way
that this works.

699
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,543
Okay?

700
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,963
Okay, now, watch.

701
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:20,178
Now, after he takes these two down,
he's gonna spin, disarm him, kick.

702
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,680
He's probably gonna use the arrow
right here. Oh!

703
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,848
[Felicity exclaims]

704
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,558
You probably shouldn't have been
allowed to watch that,

705
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,143
that's definitely in Parenting 101.

706
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,398
Good work.

707
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,235
Doesn't change anything, hoss.

708
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,246
Come on.

709
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,751
At least, he's pretty...

710
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,628
Amazing, yeah.

711
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,588
Well, I was gonna say "badass."

712
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,758
-Badass.
-Yeah.

713
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,804
[keyboard clacking]

714
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,389
Well, for two teams
that do not trust each other,

715
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,849
you guys worked together pretty well.

716
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,684
Well, except for the fact
that they never shared with us

717
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,061
where they got their information.

718
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,395
{\an8}What's happening?

719
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,815
Cayden's shutting down all communications.

720
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,777
E-mail, TV, cell phones,
Internet traffic, everything.

721
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,403
We didn't meet his 11:30 deadline.

722
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,031
Please talk to Alena and tell her
that we are running out of time.

723
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,200
I already did,
she is working as fast as she can.

724
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,411
What are we gonna do?

725
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,331
I need to go talk to my son.

726
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,008
You saved Rene's life tonight.

727
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,803
Thank you.

728
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,430
I'm on your side, D.

729
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,182
I wasn't so sure before.

730
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,603
So, what now?

731
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,234
When I was growing up,

732
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,404
if something happened, my dad would

733
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:06,409
call a family meeting so that
we could all talk about it.

734
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,619
[Felicity] I know we've both already
talked to you separately,

735
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,498
but we just thought we'd all get together
and just, sort of, talk it out.

736
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,041
Put it all in the open.

737
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,546
I'm terribly sorry that I lied to you.

738
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,674
There is no excuse for it.

739
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,053
I'm new at this whole dad thing,
but that's not an excuse either...

740
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,263
[sighs]

741
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,935
I've been tryin' to work my way
through it, and I've hit more

742
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,856
bumps in the road
than I thought that I would.

743
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,649
As you know.

744
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,777
But no more secrets, and no more lies.

745
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,656
And, William, if you need me
to stop being the Green Arrow,

746
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,118
I will.

747
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,247
Felicity showed me what you did tonight.

748
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,668
I gotta say it was really cool.

749
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,549
The city needs you and I get that now.

750
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,763
Are you sure?

751
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,641
Yeah, I mean, I was worried before
that I would become an orphan.

752
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,853
But it's different now. I have Felicity.

753
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,024
I understand why you have to go out there.

754
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,820
I'm gonna get to bed.

755
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,075
You sleep well, William, okay?

756
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,326
[William] Thanks.

757
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,037
[Felicity sighs]

758
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,666
What you said was touching.

759
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,337
It was kind of awful, too.

760
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,256
That's the actual definition
of "bittersweet."

761
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,466
Okay, well, don't let it get to you.

762
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,592
Yeah, it's not...

763
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,552
-Oliver.
-It's not, it's...

764
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,769
If I've learned one thing about
parenting so far that I'm sure of,

765
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,689
you can't win 'em all.

00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,828
It's Alena.

769
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,499
She went through all the computers
in Corto Maltese.

770
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,251
She didn't find anything, I'm sorry.

771
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,753
I've gotta get to City Hall.

772
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,839
What are you gonna do?
