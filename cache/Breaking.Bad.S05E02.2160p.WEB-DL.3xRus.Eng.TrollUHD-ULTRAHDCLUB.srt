1
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,795
Honey mustard.

2
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,508
<i>Honest to God,
it's starting to drive me crazy.</i>

3
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,075
<i>- Don't.
- It keeps me awake.</i>

4
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,012
<i>I lay there thinking, "Where is it?
Where did it go?"</i>

5
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,229
<i>- And I just... I can't even... I have no idea.
- Jesse, look.</i>

6
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,935
<i>Doesn't it make sense
that it wound up in the lab?</i>

7
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,063
<i>I thought about that a lot.
But I just don't see how.</i>

8
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,692
<i>Well, look. You had the pack
in your pocket of your jacket, right?</i>

9
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,319
<i>- Yeah.
- And your jacket was in your locker.</i>

10
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:04,821
<i>So maybe the cigarette
fell out of the pocket,</i>

11
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:08,284
<i>and wound up in the locker,
and now it's all burned up.</i>

12
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,452
<i>- It's gone.
- Yeah.</i>

13
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:13,414
{\an8}<i>But I don't know that, you know?</i>

14
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,708
{\an8}<i>I can't ever know for sure.</i>

15
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,254
<i>Well, look, did you check your house?</i>

16
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,840
<i>Did you...? Maybe it's
somewhere in your house.</i>

17
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,383
<i>No, man.
I've looked everywhere, okay?</i>

18
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,427
<i>- Your car? Did you check your car?
- No.</i>

19
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:30,111
<i>- Thoroughly?
- Yes, of course. It's not in my house.</i>

20
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,766
<i>It's not in my car.
The more I think about it</i>

21
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,083
{\an8}<i>there's no way it fell out in my locker.</i>

22
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,187
{\an8}<i>Somebody's gonna find it on the street.</i>

23
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:40,065
{\an8}<i>- You don't know that.
- Somewhere where I dropped it.</i>

24
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:42,443
<i>Some innocent person,
some kid maybe, even.</i>

25
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,737
<i>They're gonna pick it up,
and it's gonna...</i>

26
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,364
<i>- You're working yourself all up.
- Oh, my God!</i>

27
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:49,825
<i>You've gotta get ahold of yourself, here.</i>

28
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,662
{\an8}<i>All right? I'll tell you what I'm
gonna do. I'm gonna come over there.</i>

29
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:56,832
{\an8}<i>And together, we're gonna look
for this thing. All right?</i>

30
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,042
<i>Yeah.</i>

31
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,544
{\an8}What the hell is that?

32
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,755
My Roomba.

33
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,177
I already checked it.

34
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,555
When?

35
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,682
{\an8}Like a week ago.

36
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:39,703
Oh, God.

37
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,832
Oh, Jesus.

38
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,628
Okay. Easy, easy. Take it...

39
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,506
Careful. Let me see.

40
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,841
Is it still intact?

41
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,135
Yeah. Good.

42
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,054
Good. No worries.

43
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,306
Let me get rid of this.

44
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,351
What luck.

45
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,071
Well, I don't know about you,

46
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,782
but I, for one, could use a beer.

47
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,826
You have any?

48
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,330
Jesse?

49
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,336
{\an8}I almost shot you.

50
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,796
{\an8}Hey, hey, now...

51
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,049
I almost killed you all because...

52
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,094
Listen.

53
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,638
It was just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

54
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,890
No. No, no, no, no.

55
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,188
I don't know what's wrong
with me, Mr. White. I...

56
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:49,565
Hey.

57
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:54,862
- I don't know how I could be so stupid.
- Stop that now. Come on.

58
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,989
Come on. Come on.

59
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,409
I'm so sorry.

60
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,873
It's okay. It's okay.

61
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,459
Listen to me.

62
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,797
What happened, happened for the best,
you hear me?

63
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,176
And I wouldn't change a thing.

64
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:20,137
You and I working together

65
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,680
having each other's back.

66
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:25,392
It's what saved our lives.

67
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,814
{\an8}I...

68
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,319
{\an8}I want you to think about that
as we go forward.

69
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,117
Go forward where?

70
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,336
{\an8}<i>Stillwell, steady as you go.</i>

71
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,963
{\an8}<i>Willie, note the time.</i>

72
00:11:57,257 --> 00:12:00,219
<i>Captain, I'm sorry,
but you're a sick man.</i>

73
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,597
<i>I'm relieving you as captain of the ship
under article 184.</i>

74
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,391
- Oh, God.
- <i>I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

75
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,894
<i>Helmsman, left 180.</i>

76
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:12,439
{\an8}<i>Mr. Keith, what do I do?
You're the officer on the deck.</i>

77
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,317
{\an8}<i>I told you to come left.
Now come left, and fast.</i>

78
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,946
<i>I'm sorry, sir, but you're not issuing
orders on this bridge anymore.</i>

79
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:20,239
<i>I've relieved you.</i>

80
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:21,907
<i>I take full responsibil...</i>

81
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:26,744
{\an8}Thanks for seeing us.

82
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:32,167
{\an8}<i>We're here to talk partnership.</i>

83
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,169
{\an8}Partnership?

84
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,921
{\an8}Yes. Equal. Three ways.

85
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,382
{\an8}You, Jesse and me.

86
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,342
{\an8}Partnership in what?

87
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,929
{\an8}Well, we figure we're gonna start
cooking again.

88
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,014
You know, we figure, why not?

89
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:49,101
There's no denying the popularity
of our product.

90
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,186
{\an8}There's a market to be filled,

91
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,230
{\an8}and currently no one to fill it.

92
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,940
A lot of money to be made.

93
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,735
{\an8}And obviously, Jesse and I
have manufacture covered.

94
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,989
{\an8}But there's still distribution

95
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:05,117
{\an8}support, logistics, that sort of thing.

96
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,745
{\an8}For instance, we'll need a steady supply
of precursor.

97
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:11,331
{\an8}With your experience and connections

98
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:14,167
{\an8}you would be a great help.

99
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,087
{\an8}Granted, there's a lot of work ahead.

100
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,796
{\an8}There's a lot of rebuilding.

101
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,884
{\an8}And, no doubt,
our profits will be smaller.

102
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:27,889
{\an8}At least at first. But each of us
will receive a larger cut.

103
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:31,310
{\an8}Owners, not employees.

104
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:37,566
{\an8}Thanks, but no, thanks.

105
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:45,032
{\an8}Mike, I know you don't care for me.

106
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,869
{\an8}We've had our issues, you and I.

107
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,538
{\an8}But I would suggest

108
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,207
that you leave emotion
out of this decision.

109
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,917
I am.

110
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,211
You

111
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,465
are trouble.

112
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,969
I'm sorry the kid here doesn't see it,
but I sure as hell do.

113
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,722
You are a time bomb

114
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,725
tick, tick, ticking,

115
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:16,854
and I have no intention
of being around for the boom.

116
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,450
Well, sleep on it.

117
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,744
Maybe you'll reconsider.

118
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,498
In the meantime, we're pressing on.

119
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,306
Morning.

120
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,230
Hey, why aren't you upstairs?

121
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,525
- I came to see if you needed any help.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

122
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:03,985
Well, I can see that, man.
It's outstanding.

123
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:05,737
Yeah. I'm working on it, here.

124
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,948
Not exactly running marathons, you know.

125
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,618
Yeah, well, when did your couch-shaped
ass ever run any marathons?

126
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,662
- I'm proud of you, brother.
- Yeah.

127
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,288
So how many Krauts we got?

128
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,957
Enough to invade Poland.

129
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,168
Came in their own G5,
just like Oprah has.

130
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:22,254
G5, yeah?

131
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,798
Is that one where the wings
go up like that?

132
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,467
- I think they all do that.
- They all have that?

133
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:30,095
Anyway, we got two U.S. Attorneys
in the house.

134
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,305
Big doings.
Your name keeps coming up.

135
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,641
Yeah? Hey, give me a hand here,
would you?

136
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,726
Just a little bit there. Thanks.

137
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:40,689
<i>I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.</i>

138
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:44,901
Almost single-handedly,
he grew our little restaurant division

139
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:47,195
into an industry leader,

140
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:51,283
and a source of great personal pride.

141
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,578
I am shocked and saddened by his death,

142
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,580
and outraged by the damage

143
00:15:56,746 --> 00:16:01,460
his actions have wrought
upon my grandfather's company.

144
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,338
Alleged actions.

145
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:08,592
An innocent man does not kill himself.

146
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:11,219
My people and I are here to help.

147
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:16,808
To your investigation, I pledge Madrigal's
full cooperation and transparency.

148
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,979
I confess I have my selfish reasons.

149
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,191
I believe Peter Schuler
was a lone anomaly.

150
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:28,236
But if that is not the case,
I want to know it

151
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,489
just as you do.

152
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,409
So when you gonna announce it?

153
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,411
I don't know.

154
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,664
As I'm walking out the door
with my big cardboard box.

155
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:43,376
Can't do that. You know damn well
we're gonna throw you a big party.

156
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:46,171
Damn straight.
We're talking a blowout.

157
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,888
Outstanding police work, Hank.

158
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,681
If only I'd listened.

159
00:16:57,724 --> 00:17:00,393
But I guess the damage was done.

160
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,065
It's not right, them putting this on you.

161
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,654
Somebody's gotta go under the bus.

162
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,656
Ramey's a good man.

163
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:14,783
He'll do right by you.

164
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,662
Besides, this office
practically runs itself.

165
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:21,790
Bullshit, it does.

166
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:24,209
Sir.

167
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,966
What's with that A.P.D. thing?
The electromagnets?

168
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:33,176
They're thinking
it's about Fring's laptop.

169
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,680
A couple of days before it happened,
desk sergeant gets a call

170
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:39,096
from a "postal inspector" quote, unquote

171
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:41,309
wanting to know
where they keep the thing.

172
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,354
And he told them? Jesus.

173
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,314
Anything left of the laptop?

174
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:48,942
Do we look that lucky?

175
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,529
I sneaked a peek before A.P.D.
took it out of Fring's office.

176
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:57,158
The whole thing was encrypted. They
wouldn't have got anything anyway, but...

177
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:02,622
So Hector Salamanca killed Fring.

178
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,710
But who gave Salamanca the bomb?

179
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:10,463
Whole lot of questions
and not much in the way of answers.

180
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,923
Yet.

181
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,094
The A.P.D. did find
some of Fring's financials.

182
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,763
That just might lead to something.

183
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,186
I had him out to my house.

184
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:27,397
Fourth of July.

185
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,649
We cooked out in the backyard.

186
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:33,945
My son shucked the corn.
My daughter cut up potatoes.

187
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,905
Fring brought sea bass.

188
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:41,161
Every time I grill it now, I make a
little foil pouch, just like he showed me.

189
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,913
That whole night, we were laughing

190
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,333
telling stories, drinking wine.

191
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,671
And he's somebody else completely.

192
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:55,383
Right in front of me.

193
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,638
Right under my nose.

194
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:33,380
Hi. What can I get you?

195
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,842
- Just tea. Chamomile.
- Oh, sorry. We don't have chamomile tea.

196
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,511
Then some sort of bergamot,
not Earl Grey.

197
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,555
I like soy milk instead of dairy.

198
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:45,058
We don't have soy milk
or any sort of bergamot.

199
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,728
You're really running me
through my paces here.

200
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:51,189
Well, English breakfast, I guess.

201
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,816
We have Lipton's.

202
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,735
That's pretty much all we have.

203
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:01,408
I would like a cup of hot water, filtered,
if possible, and a slice of lemon.

204
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,493
I'm assuming you don't have stevia?

205
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,955
Never mind. I brought my own.

206
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,878
You coming to me, or am I coming to you?

207
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:15,839
Face forward. We'll talk like this.

208
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,384
I guess I'm coming to you.

209
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,814
Take a breath, will you?

210
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,859
This place is safe.
No one's gonna see you here.

211
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:41,740
My God. Duane, this is so... Thank you.

212
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,993
How did I not see you sitting back there?
So weird.

213
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,455
You want anything else, Mike?

214
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:52,542
No. I'm good, Fran. Thanks.

215
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,547
Now

216
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,675
how about we lose the sunglasses?

217
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,845
I feel like I'm talking
to Jackie Onassis here.

218
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,684
There you go.

219
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:13,730
Breathe in, breathe out.

220
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,816
Drink your whatever.

221
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,411
Who killed Gus?

222
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,206
Haven't I told you
not to worry about that?

223
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,335
Now, what do you want from me,
and why is it so important?

224
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,965
What's this?

225
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:41,591
A list of 11 names.

226
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,343
Okay.

227
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,554
You know them all.

228
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,974
I do.

229
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,490
Those 11 men...
And I think you know this, Mike.

230
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,979
Those 11 could sink us, you and me both.

231
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:57,983
- Where are we going with this?
- No specific... I'm just pointing out facts.

232
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:00,235
These men... Your men, yours and Gus'

233
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,737
they were on the payroll, very publicly.

234
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,615
They trace back to Pollos, the laundry,
to Madrigal.

235
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,534
They're gonna get picked up
by the police. When they do,

236
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,121
and threatened,
and there's only one way out...

237
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,957
And I'm not saying all of them, okay?

238
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,459
All it's gonna take is two or three,
or even one.

239
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,128
But there's always a weak link.
But they're gonna talk.

240
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:23,174
At least one's gonna talk about you,
me, and that's all it's gonna take.

241
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:26,219
These are the 11 I know of,
but I'd love your input.

242
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,638
I never met your chemist, for instance.

243
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,516
I'd love your input.

244
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:38,148
You want me to kill
every man on that list?

245
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,611
That's a leap, what you just...

246
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:45,322
No, I didn't say that.

247
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,285
But if you think that'd be wise...

248
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:55,290
You're scared, aren't you?

249
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:57,208
Yeah.

250
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:01,087
You're very upset, which I'm gonna factor
into my response here.

251
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,509
These are my guys, and they are solid.

252
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,076
- Understand?
- What about Chow at the warehouse?

253
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,430
Didn't you have to shoot him
through the hand?

254
00:23:11,514 --> 00:23:15,393
- Think that didn't stick in his memory?
- What about Dennis at the laundry?

255
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,895
- They're sure to pick him up.
- They already have.

256
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,939
They picked him up last night.

257
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:22,859
My guys are solid.

258
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,111
I vetted them with great care,

259
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,114
and Fring made sure
they were well compensated

260
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:32,619
in the event of a situation such as this.
They're paid to stand up to the heat

261
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,456
keep their mouths shut, no matter what.

262
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,291
And they will.

263
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:42,337
I don't know what movies
you've been watching,

264
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,256
but in the real world,
we don't kill 11 people

265
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,051
as some kind of prophylactic measure.

266
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,887
Look at me,

267
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,306
and say you understand.

268
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:55,975
I understand.

269
00:23:56,976 --> 00:24:00,355
- I get it.
- So we're off that very silly idea?

270
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,818
Good.

271
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,704
Drink your hot water.

272
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,633
I gotta go.

273
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,343
Did you have enough?

274
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,095
Yeah. I'm good.

275
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,513
Okay.

276
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,889
Bye-bye.

277
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,099
- Bye.
- Bye.

278
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,225
Bye, big brother.

279
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:39,978
Say bye to Mom for me.

280
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,648
I will. Have a good day.

281
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,817
You too.

282
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,833
Skyler.

283
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,250
Hey.

284
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,253
The car wash opens in 15 minutes.

285
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,466
Mariano can open for me today.

286
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:16,890
Hey, how about you get up, huh?

287
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:21,895
Come on.

288
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,231
A shower will feel good.

289
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,666
Hey, Chow.

290
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,294
How you holding up?

291
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,172
Okay.

292
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,008
You know, they...

293
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,260
They talked to me.

294
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:56,888
You can't smoke in here, Chow.

295
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,452
<i>Thanks for coming down.</i>

296
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,163
Have a seat, Mr. Ehrmantraut.

297
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:24,791
Am I saying that right?

298
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,168
Close enough.

299
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,880
Once more, you're waiving your right
to have an attorney present?

300
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,339
Correct.

301
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,509
Could you state that to the camera?

302
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,554
I'm waiving my right
to have an attorney present.

303
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,765
Okay, then.
We just have a few questions.

304
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,143
You're currently employed
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

305
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,812
- Is that correct?
- Yes, I am.

306
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,273
- What do you do there?
- Corporate security.

307
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,525
- Corporate security.
- Yeah.

308
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,279
What's that?
Like guarding the special sauce?

309
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:56,614
I conduct employee background checks.

310
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,366
I oversee loss prevention.

311
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,204
At a fast-food restaurant,
that's a full-time job?

312
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,499
We have 14 locations.
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

313
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,545
Yeah, well, if I were you,
I'd start sending out those résumés.

314
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,756
It says here
you're a private investigator?

315
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,885
- Where you licensed?
- New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.

316
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:18,928
Every state where we operate.

317
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,140
Colorado?
You have some restaurants there, right?

318
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,935
- Colorado doesn't require licensure.
- Licensed to carry a firearm?

319
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,771
- Concealed carry? Yes, I am.
- Which states?

320
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,816
It'd be quicker to mention
the states in which I'm not.

321
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,153
And if we pulled your CCPs,
everything would be in order?

322
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,197
I'm guessing you've already done that,
so you tell me.

323
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:43,578
You strike me as a former cop.

324
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,038
Am I right?

325
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,374
Where at?

326
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,213
- Philadelphia.
- Philly.

327
00:27:55,131 --> 00:28:00,178
The City of Brotherly Love.
Turns out we know some folks there,

328
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,473
and they told us that your tenure
as a police officer

329
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,477
ended somewhat dramatically?

330
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:10,939
- You wanna talk about that?
- Not particularly.

331
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,358
Yeah, me neither.

332
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,613
See, I'm more interested in why Gus Fring
decided to put a guy like you

333
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,448
in charge of his corporate security.

334
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:25,411
I mean, given your history

335
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,290
doing background checks
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

336
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:31,167
Seems like overkill.

337
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,586
What else you do for Fring?

338
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,674
He must've needed help
running that drug empire of his, no?

339
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:42,887
Drug empire?
First I'm hearing about that.

340
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,931
I don't know anything about that.

341
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,267
We have a guy that could
put you in that underground lab,

342
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:53,022
and he'll testify to it. So from
here on out, this can go hard or easy.

343
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,024
So what's it gonna be?

344
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,829
Forget your handcuffs?

345
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,624
I'm confused.
Am I under arrest here, or am I not?

346
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,717
You wanna state that for the camera?

347
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:29,058
You are not under arrest, currently.

348
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,602
Agents, do you have
any more questions for me?

349
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:36,733
Because you've got me very stirred up
with all these false accusations.

350
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,569
If I'm not under arrest,
I'd prefer to leave.

351
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,321
Oh, well...

352
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,537
I suppose we could talk about
the $2 million

353
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,957
in your granddaughter's name.

354
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,922
Yeah. It seems Fring had all these
secret offshore accounts

355
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,843
that he would deposit money into.
Like, well, an even dozen of them.

356
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,555
And they're all in the names
of certain people on his payroll.

357
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,807
The manager of the laundry

358
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:14,103
a couple guys from
the Pollos distribution center.

359
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,940
There was the owner of a chemical
warehouse, a bunch of others.

360
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:21,569
You know, guys that must've been
getting paid off the books.

361
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:27,492
Anyway, one of the names
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

362
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,081
Ten years old and just cute as a button.

363
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:37,418
Yeah. Two million and change
we found on deposit for her.

364
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,170
Way more than anybody else.

365
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,757
Now, my partner here,
he took one look at that and said:

366
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:47,220
"Shit, man. This fifth-grade girl is the
muscle behind Fring's entire operation."

367
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:50,139
I said, "Whoa, whoa, hey, partner,
slow down there.

368
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:55,144
Maybe it was actually
her dear old granddaddy."

369
00:30:56,437 --> 00:31:00,900
Impressive, no?
That... level of insight?

370
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,070
He's not impressed, Gomey.

371
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,740
Perhaps he's picturing
all that money going bye-bye.

372
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:14,122
Yeah, well, I mean, the government's
gonna take every last dollar, unless...

373
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,126
Here's the thing, Mike... Or Michael?

374
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,442
- Mr. Ehrmantraut.
- Here's the thing, Mike.

375
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,295
Lucky, you didn't touch that money.

376
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,383
I cannot say the same
for the other 11 on the list.

377
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,593
One of your guys is gonna roll,

378
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,220
and then we'll definitely remember
the handcuffs.

379
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:35,101
Now, before that day comes,
you can do yourself a solid.

380
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,020
You can tell us what you know

381
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,439
you can tell us who's still out there,

382
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,901
and if we like your story

383
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,320
good things can happen.

384
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,031
Kaylee might be able
to keep some of that money.

385
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,908
Maybe.

386
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,494
So what do you say?

387
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,501
I don't know anything about any money.

388
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,505
I don't know what you're talking about.

389
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,939
First order of business is to find a new
place to cook. Before anyone says it

390
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,565
- no more RV's.
- I don't know.

391
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:27,445
- The crystal ship did pretty good for us.
- The "crystal ship"?

392
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,822
Yeah. That's what I called it.

393
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:33,534
Well, I'll admit, it held its own
as a starter lab,

394
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,079
but it was too dark, too small

395
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,207
not to mention it could've broken down
at any moment.

396
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:42,668
Saul, find us someplace safe
from prying eyes.

397
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,046
Security against detection is paramount.

398
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:49,342
But I don't wanna drive too far. No more
50-mile treks to some Indian reservation.

399
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,971
In town is trickier. I mean, you got
a lot more of your prying eyes.

400
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,892
If Gus can manage it, then so can we.

401
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,940
Precursor. Where are we with that?

402
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:10,863
We're good on everything
except methylamine.

403
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,907
No surprise.

404
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,700
It's dry as hell out there.

405
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,245
What if we switched back
to a pseudo cook?

406
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:19,205
Absolutely out of the question.

407
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,291
Jesse, there is methylamine out there.
I know it.

408
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,043
Yeah, but what if there's not?

409
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,254
Because there isn't.

410
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,713
I mean, really.

411
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,215
There is.

412
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,592
Have faith.

413
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,428
Can I offer a thought?

414
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,933
Say a guy wins the lottery.

415
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,810
Ten million bucks.

416
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,813
The very next day,
what's the one thing he does not do?

417
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,524
He does not go buy another
lottery ticket, right?

418
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,486
He counts his lucky stars,
and he sails off into the sunset

419
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,031
which, seems to me, and all due respect

420
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,076
some advice you two might take.

421
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,537
What lottery did I win, exactly?

422
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,873
Hey, you're alive.

423
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,000
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
that's the Irish sweepstakes.

424
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,461
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

425
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:11,632
Counting the money that I owe Jesse,
I'm about 40 grand in the hole.

426
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,927
Does that seem like an acceptable
stopping point to you?

427
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,807
There is gold in the streets

428
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,019
just waiting for someone
to come and scoop it up.

429
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,397
But me, I should quit now.
Jesse, too, I suppose, huh?

430
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,153
I got you this time, kid.

431
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,406
Hey, how come you get two,
and I only get one?

432
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,827
Oh, what are you gonna...?

433
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,329
That one's mine!

434
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,581
Green is beating orange.

435
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,250
- No.
- Green is beating orange.

436
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,878
Pink is beating your yellow one.

437
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,512
I give up, baby.

438
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,974
You're too good.

439
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,518
Yeah?

440
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,230
<i>It's me. You got a minute?</i>

441
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,316
Yeah. A minute. What's up, Chow?

442
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,527
The DEA, they call me to come back.

443
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,112
Say they want to talk more.

444
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,697
<i>I'm sure they do.</i>

445
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,282
Did you call your lawyer?

446
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,661
<i>Yeah, but, Mike,
the DEA take all my money.</i>

447
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:22,995
<i>I need it.</i>

448
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,039
I need my money.

449
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,958
You understand.

450
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:29,335
<i>What do you want me to do about it?</i>

451
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,962
I don't know.

452
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,215
I don't know. We gotta talk.

453
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,883
<i>Not on the phone.</i>

454
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,344
<i>Can you come to my house?</i>

455
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,516
All right.

456
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,851
<i>You give me two hours.</i>

457
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,564
Chris.

458
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,445
I'd like you to drop your gun
where you stand,

459
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,782
and then turn around very slowly.

460
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,466
Come on over and sit next to Chow.

461
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:05,282
How much was she gonna pay you?

462
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,121
Ten thousand a name.

463
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,542
How far did you get down the list?

464
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,710
Just Chow.

465
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,587
I figured I'd start with you.

466
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,924
For you, she was gonna pay 30.

467
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:27,555
I'm really sorry about this, Mike,
but I needed the money.

468
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:30,891
Those feds, they took it all, man.

469
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,896
I know.

470
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,233
Are you ready?

471
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,235
Listen, Mike...

472
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,303
Kiira, come and have some cookies.

473
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,015
- It's a cookie!
- It's a cookie, yes!

474
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,017
Let's go.

475
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,895
Let's count.

476
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,974
Well, look at this.
What are you doing?

477
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,810
- Hey, Mommy!
- What are you doing still up?

478
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,520
Hey, yourself. Give me a kiss.

479
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,773
- She said she wanted to wait for you.
- She does, huh?

480
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,901
Well, who's the adult here, Delores?

481
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:06,613
- Tell me she ate her dinner, at least.
- Oh, yes, she ate everything.

482
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,365
She ate her peas, her carrots.

483
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:11,618
Do whatever it takes to keep them
out of here, or they die.

484
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,328
- A whole lot.
- Understand?

485
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,415
- Yep.
- That's right, my girl.

486
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:21,044
Delores, I'm gonna take a bath.
Put Kiira to bed and then go on home.

487
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,879
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Really?

488
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:27,050
- You don't want me to wait for you?
- No, you go home. Thank you.

489
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,594
<i>Sí, </i>Miss Lydia.

490
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,516
Mommy, you gonna come
say good night to me?

491
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,227
Yeah, honey.
After Mommy takes a bath.

492
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,146
Okay.

493
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,523
Love you.

494
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,527
Mommy's very tired, so let's go to bed.

495
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,167
Don't hurt my daughter.

496
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:05,464
I won't have to unless you scream.

497
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,674
You know why I'm here?

498
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,387
What are you waiting for?

499
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,015
The nanny to leave.

500
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,644
If you have anything to say to me,
now's the time.

501
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,030
Two good men died because of you.

502
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,743
Don't shoot me in the face.

503
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,579
Please. I don't want my daughter
seeing me like that.

504
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,915
- Your daughter won't see you.
- She will. She'll find me.

505
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,669
- She never once sleeps through the night.
- Nobody's gonna find you.

506
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,464
Wait. What?

507
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:50,717
No. No. No.

508
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,303
No. She has to find me.

509
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,056
- Lower your voice.
- She has to find me.

510
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,307
She has to find me.

511
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:01,645
You want your 5-year-old daughter
stumbling across your dead body?

512
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:04,856
I can't disappear.
She has to know I didn't leave her.

513
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,275
- She has to know that.
- Keep your voice down.

514
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,610
I don't care what you do.

515
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,862
I'll scream, and I'll keep screaming.

516
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,072
My daughter's not thinking
I abandoned her!

517
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,201
Shut up and calm down.

518
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:20,288
I don't care. You have to promise.
You have to promise me.

519
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:32,259
Promise I don't disappear.

520
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:59,911
Can you still get your hands
on methylamine?

521
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:08,128
Methylamine, Lydia.
Can you still get it?

522
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:11,173
Maybe.

523
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,259
Why?

524
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:42,412
- Yes?
<i>- You still plan to move forward?</i>

525
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,165
Yes, we do.

526
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,043
I've reconsidered.

527
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,836
I'm in.

528
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,465
Good.

529
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:15,695
Well, you missed a good meal.

530
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,325
The lasagna came out very well,
if I do say so myself.

531
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:26,248
I wrapped some up for you
if you'd like some later.

532
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,141
You know, it gets easier.

533
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,270
I promise you that it does.

534
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,483
What you're feeling right now

535
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:58,363
about Ted...

536
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,491
Everything.

537
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,329
It'll pass.

538
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:01,092
When we do

539
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:05,055
what we do for good reasons...

540
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,979
then we've got nothing to worry about.

541
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,737
And there's no better reason

542
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:24,282
than family.
