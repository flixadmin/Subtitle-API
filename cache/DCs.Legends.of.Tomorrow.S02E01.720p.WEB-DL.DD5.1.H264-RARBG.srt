<i>The Time Masters
were an organization</i>

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,919
<i>charged with protecting history</i>

3
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:06,554
<i>from rogue time travelers,</i>

4
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:08,005
<i>but they were destroyed.</i>

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,426
<i>Under the leadership
of Rip Hunter</i>

6
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,311
<i>we have taken up their mantle.</i>

7
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:17,231
<i>Sara Lance, former member
of the League of Assassins,</i>

8
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,817
<i>Dr. Raymond Palmer... The Atom,</i>

<i>The Arsonist... Mick Rory,</i>

11

myself, Martin Stein.</i>

12
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,027
<i>We are the only ones
left to protect history.</i>

13
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,036
<i>We are The Legends of Tomorrow.</i>

14
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,127
Oh!

15
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,633
Sorry! My bad!

16
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,610
What the hell is going on out here?

17
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:05,318
Sorry, sir, he broke through
the security cordon downstairs.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,981
Only because they wouldn't let me up

19
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,818
without an appointment, but
how does a regular guy

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
get an appointment with
the Mayor anyway?

21
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,655
Heywood, Dr. Nate Heywood.

22
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:20,160
I'm... here to talk about
Sara Lance, Ray Palmer,

23
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:23,213
and the rest of the Legends.

24
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:24,915
I think they're all in trouble.

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,971
Thank you for not having
me arrested back there.

26
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:32,756
Those security
guards really overreacted.

27
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:34,308
You know, one of 'em tried to Mace me.

28
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,682
Dr. Heywood, I only agreed
to give you five minutes,

29
00:01:36,707 --> 00:01:38,323
which was three minutes ago,

30
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,230
because Ray and
Sara are friends of mine,

31
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:43,817
but I don't know the first
thing about any Legends.

32
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:46,320
Of course you do, because
you're the Green Arrow.

33
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:48,689
- Excuse me?
- Huh?

34
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,692
- We're done here.
- Look, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,694
I didn't mean to drop
a bomb on you like that,

36
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,197
it's just, I've exhausted
all my normal avenues,

37
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:01,035
and you're the only person
left who won't think I'm crazy.

38
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,586
Are you sure about that?

39
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:04,171
I'm a historian.

40
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,624
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

41
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,460
In layman's terms, I'm a time detective,

42
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,596
which I really don't have to
be to look at a calendar to see

43
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,382
one week after you came to this city,

44
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,885
Robin Hood showed up.

45
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,733
You said that Sara and Ray are...

46
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,826
Traveling throughout
time with the other Legends.

47
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,937
"Legends" is what they call themselves.

48
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,989
Now, for the past six
months, I've been noticing

49
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:28,942
subtle changes to history...
Almost imperceptible.

50
00:02:28,944 --> 00:02:30,566
Actually, if it
wasn't for a friend of mine

51
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,696
who's a quantum physicist,
I wouldn't have been able

52
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:34,197
to detect the subliminal alterations.

53
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,784
The point being, I think your
friends are responsible.

54
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:42,005
You're looking at me
like you want evidence.

55
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,291
Evidence, okay, an
illuminated manuscript

56
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,926
from 1216 depicting a knight...

57
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:47,794
Looks a lot like your
friend Dr. Palmer...

58
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:49,546
Same nose and and chin.

59
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:53,266
Erratic text describing a
woman in white with a bo staff.

60
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:55,468
Uh, hieroglyphic from Mesopotamia

61
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,020
depicting an albeit crude ship

62
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:58,889
that flies through
the air and disappears.

63
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:01,024
Let's skip to the part
where they're in trouble.

64
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:03,526
UFO sighting, New York City, 1942,

65
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:06,780
multiple witnesses
report a flying machine

66
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:08,949
diving into the Atlantic, which matches

67
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:10,650
not only the Mesopotamian
hieroglyphics but...

68
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:11,985
The part where
they're in trouble!

69
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:13,286
Contemporaneous with the sighting

70
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:14,738
were multiple reports

71
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,324
of an underwater
detonation of an atomic bomb!

72
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,293
Now, the government has denied this.

73
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:22,996
You said 1942.

74
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:25,248
- That's three years before...
- Before the atomic bomb

75
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,601
was supposedly invented, yes.

76
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:30,587
I told you history was changing.

77
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:32,639
Dr. Heywood, if the Legends' ship

78
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:37,060
met an A-bomb, they're
not in trouble...

79
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,315
They're dead.

80

_

82
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,859
<i>We're closing in on your
coordinates, Dr. Heywood.</i>

83
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:55,745
<i>Are you seeing the sonar
readings of the sea floor?</i>

84
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:58,365
<i>Either that's a really
weird-looking rock formation...</i>

85
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,667
<i>or the wreckage of a time ship.</i>

86
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:12,712
If the Legends went
down with the ship...

87
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:14,881
Where are the bodies?

88
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:32,032
The ship's keeping him in stasis.

89
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:34,567
How do you know that?

90
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,655
Oh.

91
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,055
My name is Oliver
Queen and my preference is

92
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:58,174
to not break your arm, so
I want you to calm down

93
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:02,228
and tell us what happened to your team.

94
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,932
You wouldn't believe
me even if I told you.

95
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,518
All I remember is being knocked out

96
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,104
by that skinny, little Englishman.

97
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:13,356
Very embarrassing.

98
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:15,208
I know that Sara told her father

99
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,744
she was leaving to protect history.

100
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:19,946
Why?

101
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:22,332
Why does history need protecting?

102
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:24,306
Because the idiots who
were protecting it...

103
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,454
The Time Masters, were blown up.

104
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:29,889
So you and the Legends took over?

105
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,741
Mm.

106
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,576
Chasing down time criminals

107
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:36,963
and fixing the parts of
history they screwed up.

108
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,682
Aberrations the captain called them.

109
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:42,435
We were chasing
them for about six months

110
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:44,220
without a problem.

111
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:48,091
Well, the occasional problem.

112
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,029
<i>I knew we were all in trouble
when Rip made us put on blouses</i>

113
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:55,982
<i>just to save the King of France.</i>

114
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:58,485
I look like an idiot.

115
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:02,072
I rather like the style of
les Mousquetaires de la garde.

116
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:04,240
- You would.
- Can we concentrate, please?

117
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:06,493
King Louis XIII is
scheduled to meet an untimely end

118
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:07,994
at the hand of Cardinal Richelieu's men

119
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:10,330
at any moment.

120
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,049
Roger that. I have eyes on the King.

121
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,919
<i>Whatever you do, do not
let him out of your sight.</i>

122
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:18,338
But if today's when he's supposed to...

123
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,639
You know, with the queen, I...

124
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:21,091
Raymond, without that consummation

125
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:23,059
there will be no Louis
Quatorze, no Sun King,

126
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:24,928
and no golden age of France.

127
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,513
Which means by
extension no Madame Curie,

128
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:27,730
no Louis Pasteur.

129
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:28,982
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it,

130
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:30,817
history will be totally screwed,

131
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:32,936
but I don't have to be
there for the actual...

132
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:35,271
you know, consummation, do I?

133
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:43,947
It's beautiful, Your Grace.

134
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,034
As is yours. Who gave it to you?

135
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:49,569
My sister.

136
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:52,038
You speak of her as if she is gone.

137
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:58,178
I hate to see a
lady so beautiful so sad.

138
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:04,384
Your husband...

139
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:06,769
Enjoys the company
of his male courtiers.

140
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:11,474
Why should I be
denied similar... pleasures?

141
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:13,526
Sara...

142
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:16,946
I need to know that the Queen is secure.

143
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:20,066
Meantime, I believe I've
identified our assassins

144
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:23,153
and I'd wager those
aren't just swords on their hips.

145
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:24,737
<b>Ah, yes, that would explain

146
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:26,206
the aberration.

147
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:33,847
My love, there is no need for you to...

148
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:35,248
knock.

149
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:38,968
Sorry to spoil the mood.

150
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:00,023
Where the hell's Sara?

151
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:06,779
Ha!

152
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,285
Everyone back to the ship!

153
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,123
That's easier said than done.

154
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,784
Ray, meet me on the
north side of the house!

155
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:48,154
It's actually a chateau.
What's your plan?

156
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,757
You'll see!

157
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,492
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

158
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:02,635
Oh, bloody hell.

159
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:09,259
That was the last assassin.

160
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:10,593
What did we say about using powers

161
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:12,428
and future tech, Dr. Palmer?

162
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,397
Well, yeah, but they started it.

163
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,065
Don't look at me.

164
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,401
I left my gun on the ship like
a good little Boy Scout.

165
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:20,003
What's going on?

166
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,273
Who are you people?

167
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,191
I believe the Queen is waiting for you

168
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:27,026
in her bedroom.

169
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:29,362
And I'll bet she's
all warmed up for you.

170
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:31,197
Shut your mouth, Jax,
or I'll cut your eyes out

171
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:32,332
and feed 'em to you.

172
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,284
I believe our work here is done.

173
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:46,546
Wait, how'd you go from
the court of Louis XIII

174
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,214
to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean?

175
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:50,350
You said you wanted
to hear the full story.

176
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:52,385
We do, just some of us have lives

177
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:53,853
that we'd like to get back to.

178
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:56,556
We got ourselves in
trouble by visiting a time

179
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:59,058
we were told not to.

180
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,527
- 1942?
- Mm.

181
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,113
Who told you not to go to 1942?

182
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:07,450
Some guy in a hood named...

183
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:09,652
Rex Tyler.

184
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:13,206
Said if we set foot in
1942 we'd be all screwed,

185
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,991
and then he just vanished.

186
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:18,745
Okay, if he told you not to go to 1942,

187
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:20,380
then why'd you go?

188
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,050
Put another successful
mission down in the books.

189
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,184
Where are we off to next?

190
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,553
Gideon and I have
calculated a 96% likelihood

191
00:10:27,555 --> 00:10:30,173
of another aberration in Bhopal, 1912.

192
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:32,425
Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?

193
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:33,926
For real. We've been going non-stop

194
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,011
for the past six months.

195
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,763
Nobody wants to address the fact

196
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:39,315
that Cardinal Richelieu's
men were armed with laser guns?

197
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:42,652
Clearly provided to them by a
time pirate or some-such.

198
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:45,071
Ah, Grey's right. We
need to find out who so...

199
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:47,273
You can get another chance
of destroying the very history

200
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:49,258
that you're supposed to be protecting?

201
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,277
Ah, I knew I forgot something...

202
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,446
The part where Rip tells us
everything that we did wrong.

203
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:55,114
As in seducing the Queen of France

204
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:56,666
just before she's supposed to conceive

205
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:58,368
the country's greatest
hope for the future?

206
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,919
- She seduced me.
- All wrong,

207
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:01,421
as in violating our policy

208
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:04,123
of not using super
powers in front of people?

209
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,575
They had laser guns.

210
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:07,510
At least I didn't screw up this time.

211
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:11,347
Ahem.

212
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:12,832
Stealing's not screwing up.

213
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:19,272
<i>Another successful mission, Captain?</i>

214
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:20,473
Yes, well, it seems I don't share

215
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:22,050
our team's definition of success,

216
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:25,078
but let's see if our labors
came to a certain fruition, shall we?

217
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,313
Well, that was fun.

218
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:29,148
I'm in no mood for a lecture, Sara.

219
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,317
Too tired from dishing 'em out?

220
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:33,986
Replacing the Time Masters
is an enormous responsibility,

221
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:36,155
Sara, and one which I
fear our team is ill equipped...

222
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,492
Gideon, are we under attack?

223
00:11:39,494 --> 00:11:41,327
<i>Negative, that was a shock wave</i>

224
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:42,995
<i>generated by a time quake.</i>

225
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:43,954
A what?

226
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,798
A disturbance in the temporal zone

227
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,500
caused by an unusually large aberration.

228
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:49,635
You never mentioned a time quake before.

229
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:51,804
I've never experienced
one before. Gideon?

230
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:53,089
<i>The shock wave's point of origin</i>

231
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:56,008
<i>was New York City, 1942.</i>

232
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,644
That's not... possible.

233
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:02,815
Wait, what wasn't possible?

234
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:04,734
What?

235
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:07,653
You said you and the
Legends discovered an aberration

236
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:09,856
in 1942, what was it?

237
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:12,608
My guess is it involved Nazis.

238
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,161
You could say that.

239
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:18,815
The krauts nuked New York City in 1942.

240
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:27,432
Wow, someone just blew up New York.

241
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:28,850
During World War II.

242
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:31,386
Think we can all
guess who that someone is.

243
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:34,439
Nazis. I hate Nazis.

244
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:37,392
Aided by some sort of time
traveling ally, obviously.

245
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:40,161
Wait, does that mean the
Allied forces lost the war?

246
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:42,447
In which case, why aren't
we speaking German right now?

247
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:43,898
Because we're in the temporal zone.

248
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,249
And because it takes
time for the consequences

249
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:48,119
of an aberration... even
one as cataclysmic as this one,

250
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:49,404
to ripple throughout time.

251
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:51,206
So how much time do we have to stop it?

252
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,308
Isn't traveling to that particular time

253
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,077
precisely what Rex
Tyler told us not to do?

254
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,448
Well, what's the alternative?
We let New York blow up?

255
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,333
It's not like there are Time
Masters left to stop it.

256
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,420
Miss Lance is right, we are
history's last line of defense.

257
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:06,671
I like the sound of that.

258
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,973
I'd rather die than speak German.

259
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:16,264
Best case scenario, let's
assume that Mr. Tyler is wrong

260
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:19,868
and we all end up not dying in 1942.

261
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,156
What if, in endeavoring to save
New York, we make things worse?

262
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:27,325
What could be worse than
a genocidal fascist

263
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,027
nuclear-armed super power?

264
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:31,396
Relax, Captain.

265
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:33,164
We got this.

266
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:38,002
Gideon, I need you to
pull up everything you can

267
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,754
on the target in 1942.

268
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:42,507
<i>I assume that by "target"
you mean Damien Darhk.</i>

269
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:43,625
You are finally getting the hang

270
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:45,794
of this whole revenge thing.

271
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:48,296
All right, so we know
that he was alive during 1942,

272
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:50,932
so we just need to know where he is.

273
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:55,303
<i>According to a 1942 FBI file,
the target was spotted here.</i>

274
00:13:57,441 --> 00:13:59,774
<b>Hope I'm not interrupting.

275
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:03,695
No, just reading up on 1942.

276
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:07,365
You've been spending a lot of
time down here lately, alone.

277
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,901
Am I not allowed in the library?

278
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:12,620
Ah, you just never struck
me as a book worm.

279
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:15,907
I'm just making sure that you're not

280
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:17,826
holding onto anything.

281
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,244
I-I know a thing or two about grief,

282
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:20,578
so if you ever want
to talk about Laurel...

283
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,549
Then I know where
to find you. Thank you.

284
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,338
Miss Lance. Any luck pinpointing

285
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,841
the epicenter of the
temporal aberration?

286
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:33,662
No.

287
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,960
<i>Perhaps these news
reports will prove useful.</i>

288
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,140
Oh, that's good news,

289
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,664
even though we get
nuked, we still win the war.

290
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,100
Look at the date, Dr. Palmer.

291
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:44,152
In this version of
history World War II lasts

292
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:45,270
two more years.

293
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:48,156
And claims 12 million more lives.

294
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:49,457
Including Albert Einstein.

295
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:50,942
<i>Actually, Einstein went missing</i>

296
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:53,444
<i>just prior to the attack on New York.</i>

297
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:56,748
Wait. W-wait.

298
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,503
Perhaps these two events aren't
merely coincidental.

299
00:15:01,505 --> 00:15:04,539
Think about it, a Nobel Prize
winning physicist goes missing.

300
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,541
And miraculously, the
Germans get the bomb

301
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:07,475
three years ahead of us.

302
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,043
They must've kidnapped Einstein,

303
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:11,179
forced him to build them an A-bomb,

304
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:16,467
which means the only way for
us to fix the aberration...

305
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:17,852
Is for us to kidnap him first.

306
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:20,355
Yes! Ha!

307
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:23,274
Gideon, please chart a
course for New York City, 1942.

308
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:26,277
Oh, my God.

309
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,696
I can't believe I'm going to meet...

310
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:31,533
Albert Einstein.

311
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:33,484
I can't believe you're making
me stay on the ship.

312
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:37,693
Mm. I'm asking you to
stay on the ship, Mr. Jackson.

313
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:39,851
While the rest of
you get to have all the fun

314
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:40,865
battling Nazis.

315
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,139
You're the only one that I trust

316
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:44,329
to give the time drive
a long overdue tune up.

317
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:47,165
And build the time
library and modify the bridge

318
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,384
and half the other 100
things you've been getting me to do.

319
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,135
All right, give me your tools then.

320
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,670
- What?
- Pack up your tools

321
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:54,839
- and give 'em to me.
- Why would I do that?

322
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:56,046
Well, I'm gonna give 'em to Mr. Rory

323
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,426
to see if he wants to
be the ship's mechanic.

324
00:15:58,428 --> 00:15:59,627
You see, that's not funny.

325
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,062
Quite right, because in the event

326
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:03,565
that we can't stop this
nuclear explosion,

327
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:07,518
a fully functioning time
drive is going to come in handy.

328
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,304
_

329
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:20,448
So how do we find Einstein
in a city of 7 million people?

330
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,116
Well, we just look for the physicist

331
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,869
with the crazy white
hair. I mean the other one.

332
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:26,454
According to Gideon,
there's a cocktail party

333
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:27,505
at Columbia this evening.

334
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:28,506
Cocktail party?

335
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:30,291
Means booze. Where is it?

336
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,542
At Columbia, I just...

337
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:34,045
Why does no one ever listen to me?

338
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:37,882
Hey, where you going?

339
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:39,968
I have a grandfather that's in the FBI.

340
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,053
I figured I'd check in
in case we need backup.

341
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:45,106
Oh. Good plan.

342
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,059
Hey!

343
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:49,477
Where do you think you're going?

344
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,230
Follow Sara, in case she needs backup.

345
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:55,233
Oh, God.

346
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,406
Take me to Conway and 5th.

347
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,174
Oh, jeez.

348
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:24,228
Never been to a nerd party before.

349
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,230
You mean a physics symposium.

350
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:28,650
- Nerd party.
- Keep your eyes open.

351
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,768
We're sure to be in the
company of German spies.

352
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:39,077
Th-th-that's him.

353
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,695
Good evening, ladies.

354
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:43,448
The greatest mind the
world has ever known.

355
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:49,037
I am merely demonstrating
Newton's third law.

356
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,208
"For every action, there is an
equal and opposite reaction."

357
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,794
<b>Ha ha! I like him.

358
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:58,346
He's a pig.

359
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:02,216
I just found our spies.

360
00:18:02,218 --> 00:18:04,602
- Them?
- Notice their uniforms.

361
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:07,605
The stitching on the
lapels, it's exquisite.

362
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:09,891
- You mean to say fake.
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:50,898
Surprise. 
Surprise.

364
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,650
How long have you been following me?

365
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:54,485
How long have you been following Darhk?

366
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:59,907
Shut your mouth, Ray. We got company.

367
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,577
<i>Guten Abend, mein Herren.</i>

368
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:04,695
- Are they speaking...
- German.

369
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,790
The extraction team is on the move.

370
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:18,676
Let me talk, I speak "physicist."

371
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:21,129
Oh, Herr Professor, I'm
so sorry to interrupt.

372
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:22,764
- Who are you?
- My colleague and I

373
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:24,799
were just having a
rather spirited debate

374
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:26,601
about your theory of relativity.

375
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:29,520
Perhaps you can help us settle it.

376
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:31,639
I was this close to getting them both

377
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:33,357
to come back to my room.

378
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,476
Well, what about your wife?

379
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:40,731
The one who died or the one
who divorced me 30 years ago?

380
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:43,317
<b>Come on, it's time to go.

381
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:45,611
_

382
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:47,654
_

383
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,779
_

384
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:55,305

386

_

387
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,422
You don't have to speak German
to know what "uranium" means.

388
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:04,733
So what?

389
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,735
Even Einstein can't
build a bomb without fuel.

390
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,843
Darhk must be the
one supplying the Nazis.

391
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:11,979
Damien Darhk murdered my sister in 2016.

392
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:15,066
If I take him out here in 1942...

393
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:16,096
You save her.

394
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:19,020
I've been waiting six
months to get this son of a bitch.

395
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:20,655
You're gonna have to
wait a little while longer.

396
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:21,994
We gotta let him go.

397
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,192
Until we get our hands on
the uranium he's selling,

398
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:26,944
New York City's hanging in the balance.

399
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:29,997
I really hate you
sometimes, Ray.

400
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:34,869
What do you two think you're doing?

401
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,898
We have to get you out of here,

402
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:36,970
your life is in danger.

403
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:40,591
This is why I never travel
without my security detail.

404
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:42,710
Help! I'm being kidnapped!

405
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:55,389
We might not look like
it, but we're the good guys.

406
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,276
Why should I believe
that you are really a physicist?

407
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:01,946
Because for every action...

408
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:04,198
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

409
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,289
So how'd it go with Einstein?

410
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,212
Depends on who you ask.

411
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:17,415
But apparently the professor
has one hell of a right hook.

412
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,718
Seriously?
Grey punched him out?

413
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,803
Yeah, he's sleeping it off in the brig.

414
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:24,115
So can we get the hell out of 1942 now?

415
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,840
It looks like. Gideon?

416
00:21:25,842 --> 00:21:28,093
<i>I'm afraid not, Miss Lance.</i>

417
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:30,762
But without Einstein's help, the Nazis...

418
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:32,897
<i>Still manage to destroy New York City</i>

419
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:34,482
<i>with an atomic blast.</i>

420
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:36,568
<i>The historical aberration
remains unchanged.</i>

421
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,354
How is that possible?

422
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:40,772
The Nazis must've gotten the bomb

423
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:43,908
from someone other than Einstein.

424
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:53,201
<i>Guten Morgen.</i>

425
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,126
What is this? Some sort of prison?

426
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:03,044
What am I doing in here?

427
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:04,713
Good question.

428
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:06,214
I'm sorry, I never had the opportunity

429
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:09,184
to introduce myself. I'm
Professor Martin Stein,

430
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:12,721
just like "Einstein" minus the "Ein."

431
00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:15,557
There's just so much I'd
like to discuss with you,

432
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:18,727
such as your paper on
unified field theory.

433
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:20,428
I have not yet published

434
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,220
my paper on unified field theory!

435
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:25,567
Who are you? Why have you abducted me?

436
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:27,202
The guys at the party wanted you to make

437
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:29,454
an atomic bomb for "ze Fuhrer."

438
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:30,739
No.

439
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:33,625
Not even a man as mad as Adolph Hitler

440
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:35,744
would want to create such
a terrible weapon.

441
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:39,047
You yourself once said that
two things are infinite...

442
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:41,583
The universe and human stupidity.

443
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:44,335
And you are living proof of the latter.

444
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:46,054
He just called you stupid.

445
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:48,506
Now, open this door and let me out!

446
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:51,059
We will, soon. I promise.

447
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:53,645
We saved you from the Nazis.

448
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:56,598
The least you could do is
help us save New York.

449
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,483
From what?

450
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:01,820
From some theoretical attack?</b>

451
00:23:01,822 --> 00:23:05,824
Some eventuality that not
even I could have predicted?

452
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:08,109
The only way you...

453
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:12,126
<i>Mein Gott.</i>

454
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:15,510
_

455
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:17,619
Yes, obviously you know.

456
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:19,921
I deduced it, Herr Doktor.

457
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:23,091
Perhaps you could deduce
how the Germans managed

458
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:25,510
- to create a nuclear bomb...
- Atomic.

459
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:27,162
When you are the only man on Earth

460
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:29,430
capable of performing such a feat.

461
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:34,886
Ja. That is correct.

462
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:37,806
I am the only man.

463
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:41,559
Wait a minute. You
saying there's some lady

464
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:43,478
out there that can make an atomic bomb?

465
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,648
Wunderbar. Why am I talking to him

466
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,367
when you are clearly the
brains of the operation?

467
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:53,238
You ex-wife is also a physicist.

468
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,491
Without Mileva's help,
I would still be working

469
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:59,878
as a patent clerk in Vienna.

470
00:24:01,414 --> 00:24:02,664
So, while we were busy

471
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,499
safeguarding Professor Einstein...

472
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:06,584
The Nazis were busy kidnapping his ex.

473
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:08,086
Her name is Mileva Maric,

474
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:09,838
she's a fellow nuclear physicist.

475
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,006
Who, let me guess, had
no one guarding her.

476
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:14,843
Yes, Einstein's collaborations
with Ms. Maric

477
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:17,011
were a closely guarded
secret between the two of them.

478
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:19,013
A secret that the
Germans apparently knew,

479
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:22,433
so unless we can
determine where they're keeping her

480
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:23,985
while she manufactures their bomb...

481
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:25,291
If I had to guess,

482
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:26,938
I'd say she's with
Damien Darhk's uranium.

483
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,773
Damien Darhk? As in...

484
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:30,491
The man who murdered your sister.

485
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:32,493
<b>How is Damien Darhk

486
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:34,579
even alive in 1942?

487
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:37,532
Thanks to the Lazarus
Pit, he hardly ages.

488
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:39,500
Sara's kind of an
expert on Damien Darhk.

489
00:24:39,502 --> 00:24:41,786
- Drop it, Ray.
- I'm sorry,

490
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:43,254
but while you were all saving Einstein,

491
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:45,006
Sara was off on her
own secret side mission

492
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:46,457
to kill Laurel's killer in the past.

493
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:47,709
And I suppose you never thought

494
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:49,127
about saving your fiancée?

495
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:50,845
Yeah, of course I
did, but I never did it,

496
00:24:50,847 --> 00:24:51,930
because it's against the rules.

497
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:53,153
What rules?

498
00:24:53,178 --> 00:24:54,933
We're not Time
Masters, there are no rules.

499
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:56,134
Well, if there were,
there'd certainly be one

500
00:24:56,136 --> 00:24:57,635
about lying to your team.

501
00:24:57,637 --> 00:24:59,020
Listen to yourself.

502
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,905
Look, we get it, you're perfect.

503
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:03,274
Always the Boy
Scout, aren't you, Raymond?

504
00:25:03,276 --> 00:25:04,559
Yeah, well, I could say the same thing

505
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:06,778
about you being an assassin.

506
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,780
Well, if we're being honest,

507
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:10,531
then let me get
something off of my chest.

508
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,983
Let's all just take a
deep breath, shall we?

509
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:14,986
You think that you're
such a big hero, Ray?

510
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:16,537
Without that fancy suit

511
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,741
you're nothing but a
self-righteous rich guy.

512
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:23,294
Maybe you're right... but without my suit

513
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:25,246
there's no way of
finding Einstein's ex-wife,

514
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,798
or Damien Darhk for that matter.

515
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,666
Sorry, what are you saying?

516
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:31,586
That anyone who spends a
lot of time around uranium...

517
00:25:31,588 --> 00:25:33,805
In this case Damien
Darhk... Picks up trace amounts

518
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:36,507
of radiation, which my suit can track.

519
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:42,263
And lead us straight to
the Nazis' nuclear bomb.

520
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:51,105
Beautiful work, Mileva.

521
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:54,025
Dr. Einstein should
never have let you get away.

522
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:57,278
I did what you want. Now let me go.

523
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,114
Actually, we still have need of you.

524
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:04,619
This thing didn't exactly come
with an owner's manual.

525
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:08,623
Get her and the bomb onboard.

526
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:22,053
We can't allow them to
get that bomb onboard.

527
00:26:22,055 --> 00:26:24,022
- What about Mileva?
- Don't worry, Doctor,

528
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:25,356
we'll be sure to keep her safe,

529
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:27,141
but we must secure the nuclear bomb...

530
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:28,943
- Atomic.
- About to be placed

531
00:26:28,945 --> 00:26:31,779
aboard a Nazi submarine. This
is no time for subtlety.

532
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:33,231
Agreed.

533
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,616
Let's make sure we all follow the plan.

534
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:37,235
Let's just get this done.

535
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:47,078
Step away from the lady and the bomb!

536
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,212
Final warning!

537
00:26:48,214 --> 00:26:50,498
Schnell! Toten sie!

538
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:54,335
I love roasting Nazis!

539
00:26:54,337 --> 00:26:55,420
Mein Gott!

540
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:15,356
We need to get Miss Maric to safety!

541
00:27:16,693 --> 00:27:18,159
Sara!

542
00:27:21,664 --> 00:27:23,081
Get down.

543
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,475
Interesting technique. League
of Assassins, am I right?

544
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,881
I've been waiting a long time for this.

545
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:41,432
Long time? For what?

546
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:44,986
- To kill you.
- Try to you mean.

547
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:54,445
Dr. Palmer, let's take precautions.

548
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:57,115
And disable the bomb? Already on it.

549
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:04,155
<b>Uh, guys, a little problem here.

550
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:06,157
Suit's not as
radiation-proof as I thought.

551
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,826
Sara! Fall back!

552
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:23,758
Uh, guys, actually a big problem.

553
00:28:24,761 --> 00:28:26,227
Haircut! Watch out!

554
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:34,168
Mick, look out!

555
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:41,943
Fall back!

556
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:44,612
Sara!

557
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:46,697
<i>Mr. Rory's injured, Dr.
Palmer is incapacitated,</i>

558
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:48,616
<i>we need to fall back now!</i>

559
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:54,188
Firestorm, cover Dr. Palmer and Sara.

560
00:29:13,148 --> 00:29:16,232
Okay, Mick's on the
mend and Einstein and his ex

561
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:18,902
are safe and sound with
the security detail.

562
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:21,404
Thank you, Jax.

563
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:22,856
But the Nazis still have the nuke.

564
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:24,240
What are we doing leaving New York?

565
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:25,692
Because the Nazis still have a nuke,

566
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:27,694
which we saw being
loaded onto a U-boat.

567
00:29:27,696 --> 00:29:29,279
They're gonna hit New
York from underwater.

568
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:31,081
Yeah, I'm tracking
the uranium signature

569
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,199
recorded by Dr. Palmer's suit,
but before we engage the Nazis

570
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:35,452
I need you to make these modifications.

571
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:38,037
Really? Is now the time for
me to be playing mechanic?

572
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,422
Look, I know that you consider

573
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:40,490
the chores that I've been assigning you

574
00:29:40,514 --> 00:29:42,125
to be a waste of time, Jefferson,
but believe me,

575
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:43,710
they're more than just an exercise.

576
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:48,932
What's the subliminal
variance of the quantum manifold?

577
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:51,301
- Two microns.
- And if one wanted

578
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:53,520
to divert power from the axial array?

579
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:56,606
Can't be done, you'd have to
go through the clavian adjunct.

580
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,641
Mm-hmm.

581
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:01,945
All of the stuff you've
been having me do,

582
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:03,863
you've been teaching
me about the Waverider.

583
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:05,398
I'm a time traveler, Jefferson.

584
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,900
I spend most of my time thinking
about the future,

585
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:11,037
specifically my own, and...

586
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,540
it occurs to me that that
future might not involve

587
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:15,909
me being aboard this
ship, and I need someone

588
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:17,627
to know its secrets in my absence.

589
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:21,080
Hmm, nice try, dude, but
you're not quitting on us.

590
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:24,667
What's a "Timescatter"?

591
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:28,838
Hmm? Uh, a last ditch option,

592
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,975
and one that I pray we
will never have to use.

593
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:53,663
Ah. We going swimming or something?

594
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:56,166
I'm tracking the Nazis U-boat.

595
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:57,617
Where is it now?

596
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:00,920
It's close.

597
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:09,866
_

598
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,624
_

599
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:12,991
_

600
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:19,939
<i>They've knocked out
our telemetry, Captain.</i>

601
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:22,642
- What's going on?
- As you can see, the Waverider

602
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:25,195
is ill suited for underwater combat.

603
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:27,230
I'm trying to bypass the
tertiary subsystem array.

604
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,982
Make it fast, haircut.

605
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:41,578
Yes!

606
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:45,131
Is the weapon ready?

607
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:46,883
Yes, Herr Darhk.

608
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:48,334
Fire!

609
00:31:55,977 --> 00:31:57,093
What was that?

610
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:58,678
They're not firing on us.

611
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:01,931
It's the nuclear bomb.

612
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,182
Atomic.

613
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:05,068
Whatever it is, we gotta stop it.

614
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,854
I fear that there is
only one way to do that.

615
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,093
Okay, I don't know
what you wanted me to do,

616
00:32:14,095 --> 00:32:16,613
- but I did it.
- Excellent work, Jax.

617
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:18,615
- What's going on?
- I am piloting us

618
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:20,366
on a collision course with the torpedo,

619
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:23,620
Now, with any luck it will
hit us before New York City.

620
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,958
How is that lucky?

621
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,877
Can the Waverider handle the blast?

622
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:34,430
Honestly, I have absolutely no idea.

623
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:39,552
Which is why... I'm doing this.

624
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:45,858
Where is everybody?

625
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,727
The appropriate question is when.

626
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:50,446
Other the last few months I've
implemented a safeguard

627
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:52,949
in case of a catastrophe. A
high burst of temporal energy

628
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:55,668
has scattered our
team throughout history.

629
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,904
I knew you never liked me.

630
00:32:57,906 --> 00:32:59,455
I'm afraid, injured as you are,

631
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:01,324
you wouldn't survive the
rigors of time travel,

632
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,876
which is why... I'm doing this.

633
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:07,297
Gideon, how much time do we have?

634
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:08,715
<i>30 seconds, Captain.</i>

635
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:29,485
Gideon?

636
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:30,903
<i>I'm here, Captain.</i>

637
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:35,608
You always are.

638
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:52,596
Okay, there's just one question

639
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:53,647
that you haven't answered.

640
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:55,966
Where's Captain Hunter?

641
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,319
I don't know. Must have
time-scattered himself

642
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:01,605
like the rest of them.

643
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:04,708
Guess I gotta play hero and find them.

644
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,461
Do you even think this ship still flies?

645
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:10,748
I don't see why not. Fridge works.

646
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,166
I don't have time to time travel,

647
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:14,368
but if your team is stuck in history,

648
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,537
who better to help
find them than a historian?

649
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:20,841
This guy?

650
00:34:20,843 --> 00:34:24,094
Without Dr. Heywood you'd
still be in stasis.

651
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:27,431
Ah. Good point.

652
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,349
Library, this way.

653
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,102
Hey, wait. Time out.

654
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:34,388
This was supposed to
be a salvage mission.

655
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,140
Who are you kidding? You've been waiting

656
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:38,408
your whole life for a chance like this.

657
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,037
Well, I-I did some digging, but I think

658
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,538
I finally got a lead on Ray Palmer.

659
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,956
Uh-huh.

660
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:58,245
Are you, uh, sure you
know how to fly this thing?

661
00:34:58,247 --> 00:34:59,963
Let's find out.

662
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:07,588
Maybe you should slow down?

663
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,673
Maybe you should shut up and strap in.

664
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:13,560
I can't believe this.

665
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:15,345
We're about to travel through time!

666
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,564
Did I tell you about the side effects?

667
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:20,100
What side effects?

668
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:51,949
Oh!

669
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:54,384
Mick! Buddy!

670
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,969
- How'd you find me?
- I didn't.

671
00:35:55,971 --> 00:35:58,222
<b>Pretty did.

672
00:35:58,224 --> 00:35:59,306
Is he okay?

673
00:35:59,308 --> 00:36:02,025
Side effects of time travel.

674
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:04,978
Speaking of, you're never gonna believe

675
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,431
where the rest of your team ended up.

676
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:15,956
This festival is boring.

677
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:19,243
Bring me my wizards!

678
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:23,413
My liege, how may we entertain you?

679
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:27,000
Do you wish to gaze into
my magic mirror, Your Majesty?

680
00:36:27,002 --> 00:36:30,554
I grow bored of your tricks.

681
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,422
<b>Off with their heads.

682
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,224
- What?
- You little brat.

683
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:39,179
This is incredible. An
actual medieval execution?

684
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:41,682
I never imagined I'd see
this with my own eyes.

685
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:42,683
Who... Who's that?

686
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:44,067
The new guy.

687
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,686
- New guy!
- Hiyah!

688
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:50,190
I'm Dr. Heywood, I
heard so much about you.

689
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:51,358
Hey, how about we get
to know each other

690
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,576
- back on the ship?
- Okay.

691
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,194
But first we have to find Sara.

692
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,697
Vile witch!

693
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:58,865
You have corrupted the
women of our village!

694
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:02,336
In my defense, they
were happily corrupted.

695
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,373
Hang the witch!
Hang the witch!

696
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:09,126
Hang the witch! Hang the witch!

697
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:13,530
You must be Sara Lance.

698
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,434
Oh! whoa, whoa, it's
okay. He's with us.

699
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:19,970
Hey.

700
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:22,556
Is she always this violent?

701
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:25,943
I'm sorry, but so far I
haven't been able to detect

702
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:29,062
any historical
alteration that would indicate

703
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:32,783
Mr. Hunter was stranded in time.

704
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:35,235
Uh, why don't we ask Gideon where he is?

705
00:37:35,237 --> 00:37:36,737
Who's Gideon?

706
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,322
<i>Greetings, Dr. Heywood.</i>

707
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:40,407
<i>I am the ship's artificial
consciousness.</i>

708
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:43,543
Gideon, we need you to
tell us where Rip is.

709
00:37:43,545 --> 00:37:45,579
<i>I'm afraid I have no idea,</i>

710
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:48,582
<i>but I would be happy to play
his final message for you all.</i>

711
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,218
Final message?

712
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
<i>Sorry for stranding you
all throughout history,</i>

713
00:37:53,222 --> 00:37:55,422
<i>but it was the only way to save you.</i>

714
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,592
<i>Well, you know what they say,</i>

715
00:37:58,594 --> 00:38:02,562
<i>Captain must never abandon his ship.</i>

716
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:04,381
<i>Well, neither shall I abandon hope</i>

717
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:08,435
<i>of seeing you all again someday,
somewhere in time.</i>

718
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:10,904
<i>As flawed and unruly
as you are individually,</i>

719
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:12,439
<i>together you are the best crew,</i>

720
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:16,443
<i>the best team a
captain could ever hope for.</i>

721
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:20,364
<i>So...</i>

722
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:22,749
<i>stick together.</i>

723
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:25,752
<i>And remember,</i>

724
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:29,423
<i>history is yours now, my dear Legends.</i>

725
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:36,697
<i>Good luck.</i>

726
00:38:42,682 --> 00:38:45,034
So, what do we do now?

727
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:46,487
We drink.

728
00:38:46,512 --> 00:38:49,371
It's not like we were exactly
Time Masters, even with Rip.

729
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:51,590
But I think he knew that one day

730
00:38:51,592 --> 00:38:53,842
we might have to do this without him.

731
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:56,128
And we all heard his message.
He wanted us to keep going.

732
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,180
We have to keep going. There's
a rogue time traveler

733
00:38:58,182 --> 00:38:59,381
out there somewhere.

734
00:38:59,383 --> 00:39:01,800
Yeah, a time nemesis whose idea of fun

735
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:03,685
is helping Damien Darhk and the Nazis

736
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:05,387
blow up New York City.

737
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:07,439
What's to stop them
from going back in time

738
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:09,308
and kidnapping
Einstein and his ex-wife again?

739
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,726
We can't be everywhere at once.

740
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:13,028
But you can safeguard the Einsteins.

741
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,981
Safeguard the Einsteins?

742
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:18,650
How?

743
00:39:18,652 --> 00:39:22,538
By making one slight
alteration to history.

744
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:26,448
_

745
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:28,710
We'd like to talk to Mr. Einstein. CIA.

746
00:39:28,712 --> 00:39:32,915
He means OSS. This is
related to the Manhattan Project.

747
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,516
You're headed to
Columbia University, right,

748
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:36,001
- for the symphony?
- Symposium.

749
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:37,553
- Same thing.
- Once you're there,

750
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:39,004
we're gonna need
you to publicly announce

751
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:41,006
that Miss Mileva Maric has
been your silent partner

752
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:42,318
for over 30 years.

753
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:44,309
You see, acknowledgment
of Mileva's contributions

754
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:45,594
is the only way to keep her safe.

755
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:47,763
Besides, it's the right thing to do.

756
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:49,765
Don't be a jerk.

757
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:54,653
Today I want to tell you
about a very special woman,

758
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:59,491
my longtime collaborator, Mileva Maric.

759
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,063
What does that mean?

760
00:40:05,065 --> 00:40:06,615
Krauts won't be able to get to her?

761
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:08,784
Yes, and then people won't say,

762
00:40:08,786 --> 00:40:10,953
"Hey, you're a regular Einstein."

763
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:14,373
They'll say, "You're like
one of the Einsteins."

764
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,258
That's so crazy.

765
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,178
I can't believe we just changed history.

766
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,016
No, Dr. Heywood, we saved it.

767
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:31,306
You promised no trouble, Herr Darhk.

768
00:40:31,308 --> 00:40:34,643
And you promised me competency.

769
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:37,279
Perhaps we'll have better
luck with the next bomb.

770
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:39,815
That's cute, but there
won't be a next bomb.

771
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:43,118
You see, my partner wants
to move on to other things.

772
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,838
But your partner isn't here, is he?

773
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:57,633
According to who?

774
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:03,088
Hello, Eobard.

775
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,840
Mr. Darhk.

776
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:09,645
Ah, how'd it go with Einstein?

777
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:12,014
Good, until someone gives
the Confederate Army

778
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:14,516
machine guns or
breaks Mozart's fingers, or...

779
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:16,735
One aberration at a time.

780
00:41:16,737 --> 00:41:19,271
Hey, remember that
thing that I said before

781
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:20,822
about you being a...

782
00:41:20,824 --> 00:41:24,359
Billionaire Boy Scout?
You weren't all wrong.

783
00:41:24,361 --> 00:41:27,863
Yeah, but... you're more than that.

784
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,998
Thanks.

785
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,620
And we'll get justice for
Laurel, Sara, promise.

786
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:38,090
What do you guys say we get outta 1942?

787
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,210
Not until you answer a few questions.

788
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:44,213
We're the Justice Society of America.

789
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:46,114
And you're coming with us.

790
