<i>There's a war coming, a terrible war.</i>

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:05,482
<i>There will be chaos.</i>

3
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:06,516
Rivers of blood in the streets!

4
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:07,517
I know it!

5
00:00:07,552 --> 00:00:08,952
I-I-I can see it coming!

6
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:10,520
<i>MOONEY: It's time.</i>

7
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:12,756
Somebody has to take over;
it might as well be me.

8
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:15,592
(screams)

00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:17,127
OSWALD: Hello, James.

10
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:18,161
Old friend.

11
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:19,963
Mooney, the MCU cops...

12
00:00:19,997 --> 00:00:21,498
none of them know Penguin's alive?

13
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:23,173
If they did, I'd be dead already.

14
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,890
James Gordon is not a good guy.

15
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:27,259
He framed Mario Pepper for
the murder of the Waynes.

16
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,262
<i>James Gordon is the most
honest man I've ever met.</i>

17
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,797
This is not a city or a job

18
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,632
- for nice guys.
- You're a cynic.

19
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,801
A slovenly, lackadaisical cynic.

20
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,835
You're probably right.

21
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,205
(water dripping slowly)

22
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,781
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,351

24
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,787

25
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,021

26
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,626
I am the Spirit...

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,728
of the Goat.

28
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,773
I am the Spirit of the Goat!

We were right, Dix.

Of course we're right.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

48
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,998
Come on, man, we gotta get in there.

49
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,533
Wait a second, listen to me.

50
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,534
Wait a minute!

51
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,870
Listen to me.

52
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,073
Randall thinks he's the
reincarnation of some

53
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,143
ancient, murdering goat spirit.

54
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,078
We are waiting for backup.

55
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,280
He's got Shelly Lawson
in there. If he kills her,

56
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,715
that's three people we lost to this maniac.

57
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,850
Gotham's Golden Rule, Harvey.

58
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,386
No heroes.

59
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,394
That son of a bitch.

60
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,300
Idiot! She's already dead.

61
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,468
BULLOCK: You don't know that.

62
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,670
Yeah, I know it.

63
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,387
I told you.

64
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,842
BULLOCK: Shelly.

65
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,343
I told you she'd be cold.

66
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,343
She's been here half of the night.

67
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,915
BULLOCK: Wait a minute.

68
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,416
New candles, barely melted.

69
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,985
Just lit.

70
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,721
Ah, that's great. That's great news.

71
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,356
(creaking sound)

72
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,938
Randall Milkie?

73
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,273
You're under arrest

74
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,708
for the murders of Shelly Lawson,

75
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,444
Daniel Tremont and Edward Talbot.

76
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,746
Randall! Be smart, come out of there

77
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,577
or we're gonna have to blow you away!

78
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:11,383
Randall Milkie is undone.

79
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,019
Gone.

80
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,655
This body is moved by
the Spirit of the Goat.

81
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,691
Uh, we're gonna go with Milkie.

82
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,126
I already did the paperwork.

83
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,201
(Dix screams)

84
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,402
Dix!

85
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,204
(grunting)

86
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,139
(groans)

87
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,509
You can never stop the Goat!

88
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,678
This body may fail, but I will not!

89
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,048
I will always come back.
I will always come back!

90
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,416
Come back from this!

91
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:58,797
Milkie.

92
00:04:58,832 --> 00:04:59,999
(sirens approaching)

93
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,333
Dix!

94
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,569
Dix!

95
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,671
Talk to me. Talk to me.

96
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,039
Dix, come on, man.

97
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,240
Come on. Dix.

98
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,075
- Help!
- He's through there!

99
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,243
BULLOCK: We got an officer down!

100
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,279
We need help now!

101
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,662
(breathing heavily)

102
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,269
NYGMA: Detective Bullock.

103
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,737
Detective Bullock, do you give up?

104
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,739
- What?
- My riddle.

105
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,208
A man has to cross a river

106
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,009
with a wolf, a cabbage and a goat...

107
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,477
Ed, please.

108
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,546
What's the time of death?

109
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,884
Examiner pegs it

110
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,576
at just before 3:00 a.m. this morning.

111
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,378
He's a bit eager with
his coagulation markers,

112
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:54,380
so I'd put it at closer to 1:00.

113
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:57,850
Killer left her identification for us.

114
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:00,853
Amanda Hastings, 21 years old.

115
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:02,055
She comes from money.

116
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:03,322
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm guessing

117
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:05,058
she was the oldest in her family.

118
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:06,325
Why is that?

119
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,961
The Goat always kills the firstborn.

120
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:11,331
It's all the same. The same M.O.,

121
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:13,232
the same victim choice, presentation...

122
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:14,500
it's all the same.

123
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:16,502
We got a copycat.

124
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:19,839
- You all right, Detective?
- No, I'm not all right!

125
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:22,175
I already solved this case.

126
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:23,776
Where's Gordon?

127
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,511
Apparently, he's not answering his phone.

128
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:26,512
(giggles)

129
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:28,014
He's not answering his...

130
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:30,516
You mean I'm on the clock
before the Boy Scout?

131
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:31,517
Mm-hmm.

132
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:33,152
This is freaking ridiculous.

133
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:34,687
Fine, I'll tell you the answer.

134
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:37,323
So the man crosses the river
with the wolf and the cabbage.

135
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:40,059
- He leaves the wolf, he goes back with...
- Ed.

136
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,966
(phone buzzing)

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,701
I'm not apologizing for my past.

138
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:50,370
I'm not asking you to.
You're not listening.

139
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:51,738
No, you're not listening.

140
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:53,639
I'm not asking you to walk away from this.

141
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,375
Really? Because it sounds like you are.

142
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,210
And we keep going around and around

143
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:59,645
and I keep telling you
that I don't have a choice.

144
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,681
Barbara...

145
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:06,419
This city...

146
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,021
the law, the crime here, they're all...

147
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:10,723
twisted up at each other like a maze.

148
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:12,759
I came here to be a cop.

149
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,729
This city needs something else.

150
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:18,297
So, okay...

151
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:20,333
I understand.

152
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:25,304
I'm just asking for one thing:

153
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,473
half of what you have to carry.

154
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:29,575
God knows I've...

155
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,111
I've dumped my half on
you and you carry it.

156
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:34,054
Barbara, what I'm dealing
with, it's so dangerous...

157
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,518
Half... of what you carry.

158
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:41,087
If you think I care about the risk,

159
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:42,955
then you're forgetting who I am.

160
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,692
I swear I'm not.

161
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:50,229
Are we okay?

162
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:52,031
Are we still fighting?

163
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:56,602
We're negotiating terms.

164
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:59,672
Oh.

165
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:00,907
That's not good for me.

166
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:03,710
You tell me what you're up against.

167
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:05,878
Okay?

168
00:08:05,913 --> 00:08:07,914
You let me in.

169
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:10,316
Then we're okay.

170
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:14,921
(phone buzzing)

171
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:17,156
(sighs) That's work again.

172
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:18,791
Yep.

173
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:21,361
I'll tell you everything.

174
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:23,997
Everything I can.

175
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:25,098
Okay?

176
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:26,432
I'll make it right.

177
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,568
Okay.

178
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:34,273
(door opens)

179
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:36,909
(door closes)

180
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,646
MONTOYA: There's the one, right there.

181
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:48,688
We've been canvassing this
waterfront for days, Monty.

182
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,190
None of these river rats are gonna help us.

183
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,259
We don't get a lead in the next 24 hours,

184
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:55,294
MCU is dropping this.

185
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,964
Hey.

186
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:59,766
I'm on the disability six months.

187
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,300
Where do you expect me to go?

188
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:03,302
We're not flushing you, old-timer. Okay?

189
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:04,704
Just want to ask you some questions.

190
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:05,838
Yeah, about a shooting

191
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:07,840
that took place recently
on that pier back there.

192
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:08,908
A shooting?

193
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:09,942
Yah.

194
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,146
I saw it good.

195
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,615
Okay... uh, great. You-you ever this man?

196
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:17,683
That was the man did the shooting.

197
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,320
A cold customer, that man.

198
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,522
Ice floating in the veins.

199
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,592
We got the son of a bitch.

200
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:28,628
We got Gordon.

201
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,961
(seagulls squawking)

202
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:38,063
(indistinct conversations)

203
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:42,300
- "Gotham Goat"?
- A wannabe.

204
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:45,136
For a copycat, the copy is... ugh.

205
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:46,805
Downright creepy, is what it is.

206
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,641
- You moonlighting or something?
- Huh? Me?

207
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:51,076
Yeah. 'Cause you're late

208
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,144
and you look like crap warmed over.

209
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:54,579
Write me up if you want.

210
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:57,182
- Screw you, Boy Scout.
- You're in a good mood.

211
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:59,818
I'm in a déjà vu acid flashback.

212
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:00,952
Someone's hunting the kids

213
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:02,087
of Gotham's top one percent,

214
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:03,521
the press will have a field day,

215
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:04,990
city turns upside down,

216
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:06,591
the whole thing's gonna
come down on the GCPD

217
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:07,626
like a ton of bricks.

218
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,194
Well, then, let's catch him quick.

219
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:11,229
(sighs)

220
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:15,667
I'm guessing the killer knew the victim,

221
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:16,935
Amanda Hastings, somehow.

222
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:18,169
We'll go see the family,

223
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:21,239
see if we can try to get
something we can work with.

224
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:22,774
And, Nygma...

225
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:25,410
let me know when they're set
up for the autopsy, all right?

226
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:27,545
Anything in particular you
want me to look out for?

227
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,581
Just call me.

228
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:40,825
<i>MAN: You see, the strange thing,</i>

229
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,560
the horrible thing,

230
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:45,730
is that I've been having
the same dream for weeks.

231
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:47,499
Of a dark,

232
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,134
overbearing presence.

233
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:51,002
Mr. Hastings, about your daughter...

234
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:53,772
and we know that this
is difficult... but...

235
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:56,474
did she have anyone in
her life that worried you?

236
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:58,009
Anyone who might have wished her harm?

237
00:10:58,044 --> 00:11:01,046
Everybody loved my Amanda.

238
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:07,886
Uh, Mr. Hastings, are... are you all right?

239
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:10,789
Robert, if you need to take a moment,

240
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:12,457
I'm sure it'll be all right.

241
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:13,491
Absolutely.

242
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:17,996
Come on.

243
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:25,537
I know you gentlemen are
working against the clock,

244
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,405
but I'm afraid Mr. and Mrs. Hastings

245
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,607
might not be ready for this.

246
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,042
I can see that.

247
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:32,877
And you are the Hastings'
family therapist, Dr. Marks?

248
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:35,180
Yes, I treat mostly Mr. Hastings,

249
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:37,315
but we've had many family sessions.

250
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,151
Mr. Hastings has a very...

251
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:42,120
delicate nature.

252
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:44,055
I'm afraid he's not at all capable

253
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,657
of dealing with this kind of tragedy.

254
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:48,093
No one's capable of dealing
with this kind of tragedy.

255
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:49,694
It's a freight train.

256
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:51,563
It runs you over.

257
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,698
And you try to pick up what's left.

258
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,567
You don't believe in treatment.

259
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,335
I believe in the tranquilizers

260
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,803
you clobbered Mrs. Hastings with.

261
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,038
And if you're giving out samples...

262
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:01,139
Okay, uh...

263
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,273
Detective, maybe we should, uh...

264
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:04,576
BULLOCK: Yeah, you're right, we should.

265
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,177
Excuse me.

266
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:07,545
Thank you, Doctor.

267
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,015
Mm-hmm.

268
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:11,149
WOMAN: Uh-huh.

269
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:13,685
All right, got it... and got it.

270
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,720
Yes, sir, I'll bring
those files right away.

271
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,826
Mr. Nygma.

272
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:24,562
Hello, Miss Kringle.

273
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:32,771
So, I'm just looking for
all the information you have

274
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:35,306
on the Goat murders from ten years ago.

275
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,475
Don't you find it curious?

276
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,411
Why someone would resurrect the myth

277
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:41,112
of a centuries-old bogeyman.

278
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:42,447
And what is it about the Goat

279
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,782
that has made two separate people decide

280
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:44,883
to kill in his name?

281
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,952
No, I-I don't find it curious.

282
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,321
I think I would like your parents.

283
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:51,122
Excuse me?

284
00:12:51,157 --> 00:12:54,326
Kringle, such a rare surname.

285
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,227
Most people changed it generations ago,

286
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:57,629
out of embarrassment.

287
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:59,764
Not only did your parents keep it;

288
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,000
they called you "Kristin."

289
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,736
"Kristin Kringle." (laughs)

290
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,771
They must be very humorous people.

291
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:08,340
Humor is so important, don't you think?

292
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:11,142
Remember you have to sign
out any evidence you pull.

293
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:14,145
How do you find anything at all in here?

294
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,980
I mean, organizationally speaking,

295
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,082
this place is a shambles.

296
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:19,267
I am warning you, Nygma.

297
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:21,720
I have this exactly as I want it.

298
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,388
I know where everything is.

299
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:26,524
- Understand?
- Preternaturally.

300
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,460
But...

301
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:31,763
I can help you, Kristin Kringle.

302
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,167
I doubt that very much.

303
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:47,679
There's a much better way to do this.

304
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:50,281
Amanda Hastings was last
seen entering this building...

305
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:51,983
Tuesday, midnight.

306
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,685
That's about 36 hours ago.

307
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,553
You think she was abducted from here?

308
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:58,657
I don't know. That was
Milkie's M.O. ten years ago.

309
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:00,959
He took each one of the
victims from their homes.

310
00:14:00,993 --> 00:14:04,229
But CSI found no signs of a break-in.

311
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:05,764
They didn't with Randall, either.

312
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:07,232
He worked for an air-conditioning

313
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:09,300
maintenance crew that
covered all three buildings.

314
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:11,403
He had keys?

315
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:13,338
He had keys.

316
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:16,875
This is Detective Gordon.

317
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,243
I need the employee list

318
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,145
of every maintenance and janitorial company

319
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:21,813
with access to the Hastings' building.

320
00:14:22,882 --> 00:14:25,216
Yeah, I'll tell him.

321
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:27,085
They're ready for the autopsy.

322
00:14:37,997 --> 00:14:39,964
Mother!

323
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,633
GERTRUD: I wait for so long,

324
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,336
and now he scratches at the door,

325
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,737
the filthy tomcat.

326
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:47,439
Hi, Mom.

327
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:48,974
I'm alive.

328
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:53,545
I don't know why you always think

329
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,146
I'm running off with some painted lady.

330
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:57,749
- I don't even date.
- Ha!

331
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:00,685
Why you don't call your
mother in all this time?

332
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,921
I tell you why.

333
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:06,524
You got tangled in some
hussy's demon-purse!

334
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,827
Mother, there was no hussy.

335
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:12,063
Only betrayal and savagery and...

336
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,868
All I wanted was a little respect.

337
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:19,270
And they hurt me.

338
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:20,438
So cruelly.

339
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:23,908
Oh, there was no other woman.

340
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:25,276
(laughs)

341
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:28,113
I have been to hell and
back. They tried to kill me.

342
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:30,415
The bullies again?

343
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:33,118
My poor, poor darling.

344
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:38,757
They only do these things
because they resent you.

345
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,426
Envy and spite.

346
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:44,863
That's all it is.

347
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:51,536
You watch, Mom.

348
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,405
I'm gonna be somebody in this town.

349
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,908
I always knew this.

350
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:02,747
Victim was asphyxiated, likely
with ether or chloroform.

351
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:04,649
Look under the scalp.

352
00:16:05,851 --> 00:16:07,085
Humor me.

353
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:10,188
At the base of the skull

354
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:12,957
will be an incision, about an inch long.

355
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:15,460
Sewn closed.

356
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:19,597
Wait a minute. Yes. How did I miss that?

357
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:22,467
An incision stitched closed,

358
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:24,035
near the occipital.

359
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:28,340
Over a foreign object.

360
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:31,209
- What is it?
- It's a penny.

361
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:33,979
He's right.

362
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,515
A penny?

363
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,351
Randall Milkie's M.O.

364
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:42,220
No one could know that detail.

365
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,390
It isn't a copycat.

366
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:48,927
It can't be.

367
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:56,196
BULLOCK: Ten years ago, Randall Milkie took

368
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,131
an 1813 Liberty penny just like this one

369
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,333
and sewed it into the heads
of each one of his victims.

370
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:01,935
Why?

371
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:03,537
How the hell do I know?

372
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:05,972
He bum-rushed me wearing animal horns.

373
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:07,808
I shot him. We didn't talk coin collecting.

374
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:09,843
And you're sure no one else
could have found this out?

375
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:11,912
Milkie was the definition of a loner.

376
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:13,146
He didn't tell anybody.

377
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:15,282
We left it out of the file intentionally.

378
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,148
- You suppressed evidence.
- We "Easter-egged" it.

379
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:19,433
We figured a killer like the
Goat would have a good chance

380
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,856
- of drawing admirers.
- Yeah, it's copycat porn.

381
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,769
We left out this one detail.

382
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,386
The coins, it never hit the papers.

383
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,789
How the hell did this
copy-Goat know about this?

384
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:30,724
Okay, so you hid it.

385
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,726
But the medical examiner, he had to know.

386
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,294
Ed Hayes. Yeah, sure.

387
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:35,896
But he died of cirrhosis.

388
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,598
That just leaves me. And Dix.

389
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:39,966
Captain, please, there's no reason...

390
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,134
Go talk to him.

391
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,302
Make sure he didn't

392
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:43,837
tell anyone about the coins.

393
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:45,772
Hell, see if he's got any ideas.

394
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,544
<i>I'm Lacey White,</i>

395
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:54,915
<i>and this is the Gotham 7 Goat Watch.</i>

396
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:59,286
<i>Tonight, Gotham's wealthiest
one percent rests fitfully</i>

397
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,356
<i>under a copycat killer's deadly shadow.</i>

398
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,458
<i>And if you happen to be one</i>

399
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:07,260
<i>of the city's high-society silver spoons,</i>

400
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,797
<i>then you're probably headed
to the Swiss Alps right now...</i>

401
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:13,500
They've got them all running like rabbits.

402
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:14,835
Yeah.

403
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,703
I don't know why he chose an ungulate

404
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:18,038
for his totem, but...

405
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:19,506
he does know how to scare them, though.

406
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,176
You do realize you happen
to be one of "them,"

407
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:24,811
don't you, Master Bruce?

408
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:26,980
Yeah, firstborn son of Gotham's rich

409
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:28,115
and powerful.

410
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,383
I don't know, maybe you should

411
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,051
leave town for a little bit.

412
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:33,787
Pop down to the lake house.
You like it there, don't you?

413
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,956
I'm not going anywhere.

414
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,325
I have work to do.

415
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,964
Besides...

416
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,099
why would the Goat take me?

417
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,901
There's no one to take me from.

418
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:56,910
Oh, my God.

419
00:18:56,944 --> 00:18:58,812
I'm improving your system.

420
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,248
Implementing a rhizomatic cross-index,

421
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:03,016
with your case files classified by subject,

422
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:06,620
but arranged more like the
way a peat moss organism grows.

423
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:08,488
You know, laterally.

424
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,757
I had this entire room organized.

425
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:12,392
Yes, but now it will be rhizomatic.

426
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,560
Lateral.

427
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:16,530
What did I ever do to you, Nygma?

428
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,432
What did I do that compels you to come here

429
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,267
with your endless notes and suggestions

430
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:21,501
and riddles?

431
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,337
My God, the riddles!

432
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,339
Are you trying to get me to quit?

433
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,175
- You can't want my job.
- No, no, no! I want you.

434
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,579
To... keep your job

435
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:34,448
and to have it. Here.

436
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:36,850
For working.

437
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:44,324
Okay, I'm getting the sense

438
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,061
that this was somehow inappropriate.

439
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,698
You are so odd.

440
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:57,704
I'll just take my
non-hierarchical data paradigms

441
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,373
out of your hair...

442
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:04,793
and leave you to your work.

443
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:22,229
GORDON: How long has it been
since you've seen this guy?

444
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,664
Look, Bullock, I know what happened.

445
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,198
Anybody in your situation...

446
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,267
Listen, you think you can
shrink my head, Boy Scout?

447
00:20:27,302 --> 00:20:28,468
Because you can't.

448
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:29,703
This is the black box, man.

449
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:31,371
And we don't open the black box. Ever.

450
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:32,506
Okay, fine.

451
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,174
So, why don't you sit your ass down?

452
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,642
I'll be back in a few minutes.

453
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,112
We're both on this case.

454
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,156
Dix.

455
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,058
Hey...!

456
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:53,627
What do we have here?

457
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:57,798
Harvey Bullock, boy detective.

458
00:20:57,832 --> 00:20:59,066
Look at you up there, huh?

459
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,133
Living the high life.

460
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:02,002
And me down here,

461
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:04,838
all broken up with a busted liver.

462
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:06,673
Don't put that on me, old man.

463
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,409
Your bum liver's between
you and the bottle.

464
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:13,204
I just busted up your gams
and put you in that chair.

465
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,716
Gotham's Golden Rule.

466
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,018
No heroes, Bullock.

467
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:20,053
No heroes.

468
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:22,122
Listen, Dix.

469
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:26,326
We have to talk about the case.

470
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:27,728
About the Goat.

471
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:28,929
I was wondering when you were going

472
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:30,163
to come and ask for my help.

473
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:31,598
I'm not asking for your help.

474
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:33,300
That don't mean you don't need it.

475
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,536
Who's this? Your partner?

476
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:38,472
James Gordon. Nice to meet you.

477
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,706
Come on, Dix.

478
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:41,408
You ever tell anyone about Randall Milkie?

479
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:42,643
The Liberty head pennies?

480
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,645
We said we weren't
going to. We sealed them.

481
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,680
I know we sealed them, you jackass!

482
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:49,249
I told you to seal them.

483
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:51,985
Okay, but this new killer's
doing the same thing.

484
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,888
He's stitching up coins in
the heads of his victims.

485
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,057
Any idea how he came up with that?

486
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:59,760
I didn't tell anybody.

487
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:01,762
Ed Hayes didn't tell nobody.

488
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:03,564
And you didn't tell nobody.

489
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:05,232
So, what the hell does that mean?

490
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:08,101
It means we were wrong about Milkie.

491
00:22:08,136 --> 00:22:10,037
He was not working alone.

492
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,271
No.

493
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:12,472
Mm-hmm.

494
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:15,342
You do not have a copycat killer here.

495
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,745
You do not have a lone killer.

496
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,882
What you have...

497
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,417
is a conspiracy.

498
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:25,552
BULLOCK: A conspiracy to hang

499
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:28,355
rich kids off local historical landmarks?

500
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,489
Yeah, right.

501
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,927
He always thinks he's the
smartest one in the room.

502
00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:35,429
I know, right?

503
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:39,433
That's because I'm always
in a room full of idiots.

504
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:42,603
Watch out for him.

505
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:45,772
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

506
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:47,774
He's a loose cannon.

507
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:50,811
He thinks he's a white
knight jumping into the breach

508
00:22:50,845 --> 00:22:53,647
like some idiot in the movies.

509
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:55,616
You're talking about Bullock here?

510
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,185
We're talking about Bullock here.

511
00:22:58,219 --> 00:22:59,686
Harvey Bullock?

512
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:02,022
(quietly): Harvey Bullock, yeah.

513
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:03,824
Detective Bullock, do you
want to settle the bill

514
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,993
for this month now or
should we send it to you?

515
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:07,828
You can just put it in the mail, thanks.

516
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:10,063
Is he getting those magazines I ordered?

517
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,332
Those are awful magazines, Detective.

518
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:14,067
BULLOCK: But he's getting them?

519
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,169
WOMAN: Yes. He is.

520
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:18,138
Good.

521
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:22,309
Thank you.

522
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:31,852
No, Mom. I'm just grabbing a few things.

523
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:34,154
Yes. Yes, I know.

524
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:35,689
I'll be at the marina at 9:00.

525
00:23:35,723 --> 00:23:37,224
Okay.

526
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,361
Here you are. Thank you, Anita.

527
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:43,964
Oh, will you put some snack
stuff together, please?

528
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,034
(creaking)

529
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:23,437
Miss Ember?

530
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:40,287
Anita, have you seen the
tops to my yellow silk...?

531
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:43,023
Anita?

532
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:45,392
(muffled shriek)

533
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,567
<i>Ember Copley was supposed
to meet her parents tonight</i>

534
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:56,402
at 9:00 at the marina.

535
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:58,070
When she didn't show, they came back,

536
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:00,239
found the maid out cold, Ember gone.

537
00:25:00,274 --> 00:25:02,575
- You think it's our guy?
- It's our guy.

538
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:04,277
He slips in, chloroforms the maid,

539
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:06,813
grabs Ember, no sign of B and E, nothing.

540
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:07,847
Like a ghost.

541
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,916
Like he had keys.

542
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,651
Randall Milkie had a ritual.

543
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:13,686
He'd dress the victims,
kill them and do his little

544
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,521
coin trick... whole thing
took about eight hours.

545
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,990
If our copy-Goat's doing the same thing,

546
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:19,992
we're running out of time.

547
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:22,195
I pulled the employee
list from the agencies

548
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,996
that do maintenance on
Ember Copley's building.

549
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:25,464
Looking for an employee that had

550
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:27,433
access to both victims' apartments.

551
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:29,168
That's a hell of a lot of people.

552
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:30,870
Yeah, but our guy's been real busy.

553
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,319
He had to have called in
sick the last couple days.

554
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:36,419
Get Nygma in there. He's
freaking good with puzzles.

555
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:37,781
You got it.

556
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:42,430
Renee, we have to talk.

557
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:43,665
- What are you doing here?
- Look, I know

558
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:45,099
you think that he's done terrible things,

559
00:25:45,134 --> 00:25:47,268
but I also know you care about the truth.

560
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:49,537
You shouldn't be here. Barbara,
you shouldn't be seen here.

561
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:50,972
Damn it, Renee! Will you listen to me?!

562
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:53,908
Look. I'll work with you, okay?

563
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:54,942
I will tell you whatever

564
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:56,778
I know, whatever I can find out.

565
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:59,514
I need you to keep an open mind, okay?

566
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:01,149
It's too late for that.

567
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:03,651
Whatever's happening, okay,
you've got it wrong, Renee.

568
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:06,154
You can't tell me, I know that,
but it isn't what you think.

569
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,889
He's trying to protect me.

570
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:09,891
Okay? He won't tell me who's out there.

571
00:26:09,925 --> 00:26:11,826
- Who he's afraid of.
- He's right not to.

572
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,127
Wait. Why?

573
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:14,996
Because it'll get you killed, okay?

574
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,231
You understand what he knows,

575
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:19,734
who he knows will kill you.

576
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:24,839
We got a judge issuing a warrant tonight.

577
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:28,076
Barbara, you know how
much I care about you.

578
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,511
When Gordon gets arrested,
you have to get out of here.

579
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:33,881
If Jim gets arrested, then this
is exactly where I have to be.

580
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:35,049
By his side.

581
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:37,151
Please, just leave.

582
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:39,821
Get out of Gotham Just till this is over.

583
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,489
And don't come to me again.

584
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,764
<i>GORDON: Okay, so four guys</i>

585
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:51,299
have called in sick since last week.

586
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,334
The two suspects from the
outer boroughs are cleared.

587
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:55,837
Another is out of state, but
apparently it's unconfirmed.

588
00:26:55,871 --> 00:26:57,038
So...

589
00:26:57,072 --> 00:26:59,006
So... that leaves one last guy.

590
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,541
Raymond Earl.

591
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:02,543
His shift supervisor

592
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:04,112
says he's been squatting in a place

593
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:06,047
near Cannery Park, somewhere
around the 1100 block.

594
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:07,749
- That's him.
- You sure?

595
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:09,951
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm 100% sure.

596
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:31,072
Déjà voodoo all day long.

597
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:37,044
This is where we got
Randall Milkie ten years ago.

598
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:39,280
This is where Dix fell.

599
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:41,215
Bullock.

600
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:44,285
Got to go in.

601
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,353
Come on.

602
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:47,388
Yeah. Yeah.

603
00:27:50,592 --> 00:27:54,162
We're going to put you
to sleep for good now.

604
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:57,965
You're lucky to be the sacrifice.

605
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,567
(quiet moaning)

606
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:02,103
(door opens)

607
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:34,302
(birds' wings fluttering nearby)

608
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:38,172
Go get her.

609
00:28:49,985 --> 00:28:51,652
You're safe.

610
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:56,757
You all right? (mumbling)

611
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,159
You okay?

612
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:08,402
(Goat yells)

613
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:11,472
(both grunting)

614
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:24,752
You'll never stop the Goat.

615
00:29:26,755 --> 00:29:28,689
I will always come back.

616
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:30,224
Quit saying that!

617
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:32,093
(both grunting)

618
00:29:57,886 --> 00:30:00,588
Raymond Earl, you're under arrest.

619
00:30:02,224 --> 00:30:04,225
Not bad.

620
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:07,929
All right.

621
00:30:09,698 --> 00:30:11,699
All right.

622
00:30:22,604 --> 00:30:24,605
(door opens)

623
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:36,818
(moaning nearby)

624
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:50,031
(footsteps nearby)

625
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:27,034
(footsteps approaching)

626
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:53,995
(door opens)

627
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:57,065
(door closes)

628
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:59,233
Your suit is ready.

629
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,502
I steamed it nice.

630
00:32:01,537 --> 00:32:03,404
Thanks, Mom.

631
00:32:08,444 --> 00:32:11,112
I'm worried for you.

632
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:14,148
So anxious you look.

633
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:17,952
These moves you make,

634
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:20,221
they're safe, yes?

635
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:23,291
You're not doing anything illegal?

636
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:26,527
No, Mom. Don't worry. It's just business.

637
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:29,030
Well, business is all very fine,

638
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:31,199
but always remember...

639
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:33,868
you can trust no one.

640
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:35,903
No one but your mother.

641
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:38,172
I know. (laughs gently)

642
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,574
I know.

643
00:32:41,944 --> 00:32:44,412
But you know what?

644
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,981
I think I finally found
somebody I can trust.

645
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:49,984
A policeman.

646
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:52,120
Police?

647
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:53,621
The police are liars.

648
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:56,224
Hmm-mm, not this one, Mom.

649
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:57,558
He's a real friend.

650
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:59,364
Hmm.

651
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:02,230
He'll help me come out right in the end.

652
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:12,240
GORDON: Raymond Earl, 33 years old,

653
00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:13,408
janitor in the city.

654
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:15,977
Works with an agency

655
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:17,578
that services the
buildings of both victims.

656
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:19,213
And he's not talking.

I got a lot of phone calls to make.

664
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:34,028
Bullock, look happier.

665
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:41,602
(sighs)

666
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,038
(door closes)

667
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:45,306
What?

668
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:47,842
Randall Milkie worked
for a maintenance company

669
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:49,644
that serviced the buildings of his victims,

670
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:51,813
same as Raymond here.

671
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:53,514
Milkie was mentally ill,

672
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:55,683
no violent crimes in his history,

673
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:56,818
same as him.

674
00:33:56,852 --> 00:33:59,354
Ten years apart, they never meet,

675
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:01,122
then one day, suddenly, out of the blue,

676
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:03,157
they both decide to become the Goat?

677
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:07,328
It's like...

678
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:09,397
it's like something found them.

679
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:10,732
Changed them.

680
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:13,440
You talking about Dix
and his conspiracy theory?

681
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:16,467
No. It just doesn't add up.

682
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:19,036
And how'd he know about the coin?

683
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:20,471
I know that we're missing something,

684
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:22,273
and if we keep missing it,

685
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:24,075
I'm afraid we're never gonna stop this.

686
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:25,076
Okay.

687
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,577
We go back to Milkie's files.

688
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:29,113
We, uh... look for possible accomplices,

689
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:31,048
uh, connections... Tomorrow, tomorrow.

690
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,284
I, uh, just... I need... I need to think.

691
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,188
Why don't you, uh, get some rest?

692
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:40,625
Yeah.

693
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:44,762
- Night.
- Good night, Jim.

694
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:45,796
(door opens)

695
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:49,200
(door closes)

696
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:03,047
No. No.

697
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:05,583
No. No.

698
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:06,884
Oh, no.

699
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:09,353
No. No.

700
00:35:09,388 --> 00:35:10,354
(gasps)

701
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:12,089
No. No.

702
00:35:12,124 --> 00:35:13,124
(grunts)

703
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,160
Holy Ghost on a bicycle.

704
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:31,075
Barbara?

705
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:32,777
Jim, look.

706
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,278
I don't know everything, but I know enough.

707
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:35,880
You have to listen to me now.

708
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:38,983
- Baby, I can barely stand.
- Montoya has a witness.

709
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:40,718
What?

710
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:43,020
They really believe you
killed this Cobblepot person.

711
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:45,089
- I didn't.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

712
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:47,310
They've got a warrant for your arrest.

713
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:49,927
What aren't you telling me?

714
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:55,351
For weeks now, it's like
you've been a different person.

715
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,453
Something happened not long after

716
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,088
you started the job.

717
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,757
Something... something you

718
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,158
don't feel right about.

719
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:03,693
Somehow, they've cornered me.

720
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:05,779
- Tied my hands.
- Come with me now. Okay?

721
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:07,884
I don't care what I
leave behind, as long as

722
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,152
we leave it together.

723
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:10,620
If they take you away, Jim,

724
00:36:10,654 --> 00:36:12,388
- I'm scared I'll lose you.
- (knocking at door)

725
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:14,023
- Barbara...
- Please!

726
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:16,526
(knocking continues)

727
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,695
I can't run.

728
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:24,967
Can't run.

729
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:38,448
James Gordon... you're under arrest

730
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:40,416
for the murder of Oswald
Chesterfield Cobblepot.

731
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:41,484
(handcuffs clicking)

732
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:43,553
You have the right to remain silent.

733
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:45,254
Anything you say can be used against you

734
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,223
in a court of law.

735
00:36:52,663 --> 00:36:54,664
(door creaks, slams shut)

736
00:37:03,714 --> 00:37:05,715
<i>DR. MARKS: You're drifting down</i>

737
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,784
and away... deeper...

738
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:09,586
I got it.

739
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,254
I'm sorry to interrupt.

740
00:37:11,288 --> 00:37:13,192
- It's Detective Bullock, isn't it?
- Yeah.

741
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:15,461
Did you want to interview Mr. Hastings?

742
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:16,452
Actually, your secretary told me

743
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,254
I might be able to find you here.

744
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,523
I was hoping to pick
your brain about the case.

745
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:22,425
Oh. Uh, I'll just be a minute.

746
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:23,459
It's okay.

747
00:37:27,638 --> 00:37:29,806
I didn't realize this before.

748
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,274
You're a hypnotist, right?

749
00:37:31,308 --> 00:37:32,976
A hypnotherapist.

750
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,612
Oh, therapist. It's a
funny word, therapist.

751
00:37:35,646 --> 00:37:39,115
Can either mean "therapist"
or "the rapist," if...

752
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,651
So you do

753
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:43,687
pro Bono work at an outpatient clinic?

754
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:46,289
- Or a couple of them?
- I do. I try to give back.

755
00:37:46,323 --> 00:37:49,459
Yeah, you've been giving
back for a while, uh...

756
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:51,161
- 12 years now.
- Mm-hmm.

757
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:52,929
That's good.

758
00:37:52,963 --> 00:37:54,564
To be honest, I...

759
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:57,934
wanted to talk to you about
one of your pro Bono patients.

760
00:37:57,968 --> 00:37:58,935
Uh, Raymond Earl?

761
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:01,104
He's a person of interest

762
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:03,106
in our investigation.

763
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,543
Our records indicate you've seen him, uh...

764
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:07,811
at least a few times, right?

765
00:38:07,845 --> 00:38:09,979
Hmm... sounds familiar.

766
00:38:10,014 --> 00:38:11,147
Last year, maybe?

767
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:13,483
And Mr. Hastings, Amanda's father...

768
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:15,485
we know he's your patient.

769
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,820
When we were here yesterday,

770
00:38:16,854 --> 00:38:18,154
he was doing something really curious.

771
00:38:18,189 --> 00:38:19,489
It, uh...

772
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:21,691
he, uh... he kept clenching his fist.

773
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:23,226
Over and over.

774
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,228
- Yes, he does that.
- Yeah.

775
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:26,830
See, I was reading about that,

776
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:29,399
and it said that if a
patient has a compulsion,

777
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:31,668
like a bad idea or an impulse,

778
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:33,002
that the hypnotist could

779
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:34,671
put the poor sap under

780
00:38:34,705 --> 00:38:37,173
and introduce a... a physical movement.

781
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:40,009
Like, uh, clenching your fist.

782
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:41,211
So instead of doing what

783
00:38:41,245 --> 00:38:43,380
the compulsion wants the person to do,

784
00:38:43,414 --> 00:38:45,682
they just...

785
00:38:45,716 --> 00:38:47,016
clench their fist.

786
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:49,252
That's how it works, pretty much.

787
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,921
So Mr. Hastings, when he's in a, uh,

788
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,890
room full of people and he wants to start

789
00:38:53,924 --> 00:38:55,792
screaming his head off, I don't know,

790
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:58,528
instead of doing that, he just...

791
00:38:58,562 --> 00:39:00,096
Mm-hmm.

792
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,798
Yeah.

793
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:03,099
Okay.

794
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:04,734
What about Raymond Earl?

795
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:06,403
Why does he clench his fist?

796
00:39:08,372 --> 00:39:10,240
And what about Randall Milkie?

797
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:14,511
See, I know you treated him
a little over ten years ago,

798
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:15,945
and I want you to follow me

799
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,480
because this part gets a little weird.

800
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:19,682
See, I think a hypnotist
completely turned both those men

801
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:21,551
upside down.

802
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:23,920
Until their own identity was the bad idea,

803
00:39:23,954 --> 00:39:26,523
and then it wasn't even them
clenching their fists anymore.

804
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:28,892
It was the Spirit of the Goat.

805
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:30,360
Hmm.

806
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:32,862
I underestimated you.

807
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:36,199
(laughs) I really did.

808
00:39:36,233 --> 00:39:38,802
So I'm right.

809
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:39,803
Aha!

810
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,237
Yes, I'm right.

811
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:43,506
And so you trolled all
the outpatient clinics

812
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,275
so you could find a
suitable borderline case

813
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:47,010
like Randall Milkie.

814
00:39:47,044 --> 00:39:48,712
And then you hypnotize the poor bastard

815
00:39:48,746 --> 00:39:50,814
until he literally doesn't
even know who he is.

816
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:52,482
And then I tell him who he is.

817
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,317
That's pretty good intellection, Detective.

818
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:55,652
Why?

819
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:58,354
Why hypnotize a janitor

820
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:00,056
and turn him into the Goat?

821
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:02,926
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

822
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,662
It isn't an act of murder or madness.

823
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:06,830
It's an act of therapy.

824
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:09,632
- Therapy? For who?
- For Gotham.

825
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,835
Excuse me?

826
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:14,437
This city used to have hope,

827
00:40:14,472 --> 00:40:16,106
and they gunned it down in the streets.

828
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,108
The rich, the powerful.

829
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:19,976
Their greed is pathological,

830
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,679
an id run rampant, eating Gotham alive.

831
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,614
So your one-percent solution

832
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:26,249
is to kill the city's rich kids?

833
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:28,384
Negative reinforcement.

834
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:31,221
To believe that the Goat is real,

835
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:33,423
that it wouldn't tolerate this...

836
00:40:33,457 --> 00:40:34,924
Gotham wanted that.

837
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:36,960
No matter how painful it was.

838
00:40:38,129 --> 00:40:40,296
It's true what they say.

839
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:41,664
You can't really hypnotize somebody

840
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:42,999
to do something that, deep down,

841
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:45,668
they don't already want to do.

842
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:47,437
And deep down,

843
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:49,973
we all want to eat the rich.

844
00:40:51,008 --> 00:40:53,243
Don't we?

845
00:40:53,277 --> 00:40:56,513
You are 100% nuthouse crazy, lady.

846
00:40:57,575 --> 00:41:00,183
Dr. Marks... is everything okay?

847
00:41:00,217 --> 00:41:01,651
No, it's not.

848
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:03,787
Dr. Marks, you're under arrest

849
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:06,222
for conspiracy to commit murder, coercion

850
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:07,624
and, frankly, a few things

851
00:41:07,658 --> 00:41:09,359
we're probably gonna
have to name after you.

852
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:10,994
Well, I do have another one for you.

853
00:41:11,028 --> 00:41:15,665
Robert, the golden temple is open.

854
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:17,133
Now kill this man.

855
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:19,469
(growling)

856
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:20,703
Robert...

857
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,775
Heel, Mr. Hastings! Heel!

858
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,510
(grunting)

859
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:34,984
(yelling)

860
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:37,086
(grunts)

861
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:40,156
Freeze, lady!

862
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:43,827
(screaming)

863
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,398
<i>ESSEN: One more time.</i>

864
00:41:48,432 --> 00:41:49,966
Take me through the part

865
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,835
where you drove to the nice part of town

866
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:54,003
and shot the doctor lady.

867
00:41:54,038 --> 00:41:55,638
We caught the other half of the killer.

868
00:41:55,673 --> 00:41:57,273
Dr. Marks was the Spirit of the Goat.

869
00:41:57,308 --> 00:41:59,342
Okay, see, that's the
part that I don't... get.

870
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:01,744
On the same side, do you understand?

871
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:02,879
We're fighting the same war,

872
00:42:02,913 --> 00:42:04,547
and damn it, I'm getting somewhere.

873
00:42:04,582 --> 00:42:06,716
Getting into a six-by-eight
in the Blackgate Pen,

874
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,051
that's what you're getting.

875
00:42:08,085 --> 00:42:09,853
- What is this?
- MCU's taking

876
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:11,621
Detective James Gordon into custody.

877
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,690
- What?
- Your boy here murdered

878
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:15,625
Oswald Cobblepot and
dumped him in the river.

879
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:16,793
That's a damn lie!

880
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:18,194
He's right. It was a lie.

881
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:21,231
I didn't shoot Oswald Cobblepot.

882
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:23,433
I lied. I didn't shoot him, Bullock.

883
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:26,302
- Of course you didn't, partner.
- No, I mean it!

884
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:27,704
Harvey Bullock, you're under arrest.

885
00:42:27,738 --> 00:42:28,771
For what?

886
00:42:28,806 --> 00:42:30,073
Accomplice in the murder
of Oswald Cobblepot.

887
00:42:30,107 --> 00:42:32,876
Our witness places you at the scene.

888
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,277
ESSEN: You think you can

889
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:35,778
walk in here and take my people

890
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:37,714
- like that?
- We're not here to take down the GCPD.

891
00:42:37,748 --> 00:42:39,048
We just want these two.

892
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:42,151
Well, they're GCPD, so
the MCU's got a problem.

893
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:44,254
Yeah, you got a problem. You
got a real problem, you...

894
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,891
Holy crap.

895
00:42:47,925 --> 00:42:49,592
Hello.

896
00:42:49,627 --> 00:42:51,694
(chuckles)

897
00:42:51,727 --> 00:42:54,463
I am Oswald Cobblepot.

898
00:42:58,873 --> 00:43:01,145
- Son of a bitch.
- Harvey...

899
00:43:01,183 --> 00:43:02,601
Son of a bitch!

900
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:06,907
