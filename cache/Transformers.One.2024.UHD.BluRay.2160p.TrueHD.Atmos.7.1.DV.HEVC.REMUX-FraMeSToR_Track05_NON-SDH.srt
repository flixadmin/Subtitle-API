1
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,455
Okay, let's see what we got here.

2
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,374
Seen it. Seen it.

3
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,668
Huh. What's this about?

4
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,545
<i>At the dawn... dawn... dawn</i>

5
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,921
<i>dawn... dawn... dawn</i>

6
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,936
Ah. Here we go.

7
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,563
<i>At the dawn of time,</i>

8
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,150
<i>there was our gracious
and powerful creator,</i>

9
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,861
<i>Primus.</i>

10
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:36,032
<i>To protect our universe,
he sacrificed his life force,</i>

11
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:39,869
<i>transforming himself into our planet,</i>

12
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,621
<i>Cybertron.</i>

13
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,374
<i>From within Cybertron's core,</i>

14
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,961
<i>Primus birthed the first Transformers</i>

15
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:52,256
<i>known as the Primes,</i>

16
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,342
<i>the most powerful Transformers,</i>

17
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:58,220
<i>appointed to lead and protect
future generations.</i>

18
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:02,933
<i>To assist them, Primus created
an entity of great power,</i>

19
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,144
<i>the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

20
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,147
The Matrix, there it is. Okay.
Good. Come on. Keep going.

21
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,816
<i>With the Matrix
in the Primes' possession,</i>

22
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,323
<i>Cybertron's natural power source,
Energon, flowed in abundance,</i>

23
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,701
<i>sustaining life across the planet.</i>

24
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:27,333
<i>Attention! Unauthorized
movement detected in archival vault.</i>

25
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,626
<i>Sector J-3.</i>

26
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,711
KDQ-12 to KDK-1.

27
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,463
Breaching archives in ten seconds.

28
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:37,385
<i>For generations,
there was peace and prosperity,</i>

29
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,805
<i>until the Matrix of Leadership was lost,</i>

30
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,517
<i>causing Energon to no longer flow.</i>

31
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,687
Why does every legend
about the Matrix end right there?

32
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,940
One of these
has to say what happened.

33
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,293
<i>Halt, criminal!</i> Prepare to be detained!

34
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,361
- Oh, <i>hey</i> there.
<i>- Halt, criminal!</i> Prepare <i>to...</i>

35
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:57,947
Uh-oh.

36
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,784
- Freeze!
- Get down!

37
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,620
Well, hello, guys.
I'm so glad you're here.

38
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,788
Which way is the exit?

39
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,581
I must've taken a wrong turn.

40
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,418
It's that defective mining bot, Oreon Pix!

41
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,877
- Orion Pax.
- Who cares?

42
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,921
We told you to never come back here!

43
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,882
- Why are we all yelling?
- I'm gonna smash you!

44
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,552
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, hold on.
No need for violence.

45
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:23,180
I run away, you chase me.
We play that game. Huh?

46
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,224
Come on. You're bigger, faster.
It'll be fun.

47
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,060
He doesn't have a cog.
Let's give him a head start.

48
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,938
Why not? It's not like he can transform.

49
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:31,897
Oh, yeah?

50
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,899
Well, watch this.

51
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,071
Get him!

52
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,325
I... I... Uh...

53
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,286
Something that flies.
Something that flies.

54
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,972
Prepare to be detained!

55
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,664
<i>Halt, criminal! Prepare to be detained!</i>

56
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,124
<i>Halt, criminal!</i>

57
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,638
Come on! Start! Come on!

58
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:07,308
Whoa!

59
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,690
Whoa. No, no, no, no!

60
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,444
There he is!

61
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,159
Ha-ha! So long, suck...

62
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,329
Ooh, Energon.

63
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,122
Evening, everyone. Pardon me.

64
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:38,923
Hey!

65
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,513
Whoa!

66
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,349
...Ah, it's Orion.
—Seriously, again?

67
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,030
Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

68
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,382
You want to give me another one?

69
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,867
- You're dead!
- I'll take that as a no.

70
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,702
Hey! Watch where you're going!

71
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,538
- Oh...
- What did you say, no-cog?

72
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,914
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean you.

73
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,958
I was referring to the bot
who was behind you.

74
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,459
What? Where'd he go?

75
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:16,919
The filthy red and blue bot?

76
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,921
Has a big mouth, squeaky joints,

77
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,589
gives off a corroded metallic stench?

78
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,299
- Where is he?
- He went that way.

79
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,468
When I get my hands on that bot...

80
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,229
All right, all clear.

81
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,856
Okay, D-16, I may be a little rusty,

82
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,525
but "corroded"? That is too far.

83
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,652
Let me guess. Chased out of the archives?

84
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,797
Yeah.
I had to jump out of a window this time.

85
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,531
Almost died. It was wild.

86
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,783
And digging through ancient data
is worth dying for?

87
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,118
Yes, it is.

88
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,619
I need a new best friend.

89
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,496
If there are clues in our recorded history

90
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,623
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

91
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,000
they're in the archives.

92
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,378
Sentinel Prime, the Sentinel Prime,

93
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,463
is up on the surface right now,

94
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,717
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

95
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,803
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

96
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,388
Yeah, okay.

97
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,140
The sooner Energon flows again,

98
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,309
the sooner we won't have to mine for it.

99
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,704
Don't you want to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

100
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,314
We're miners. We mine, that's all.

101
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:22,818
No, there has got to be
something more I can do. I can feel it.

102
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,862
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

103
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,655
you could transform without a cog?

104
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,508
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

105
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,868
Took me three days to pry you open.

106
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,053
Your feelings get you in trouble.

107
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,287
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,789
- Just trust in Sentinel Prime.
- I do trust in him.

109
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,460
Hey, if we did have cogs

110
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,712
I'd transform into a shovel and beat you.

111
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,464
I don't like how fast you answered that.

112
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,550
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome.

113
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,844
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

114
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,805
- I'll give it to someone else.
- What Megatronus Prime thing?

115
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,682
Ah, it's nothing. Just a, you know,

116
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,977
mint-condition Megatronus Prime
decal, first edition.

117
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,312
What?

118
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,314
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

119
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,083
Throw it away? Don't...
That's not funny. Let me see.

120
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,443
Wait. Don't grab. You're gonna crease it.

121
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,073
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the...

122
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,991
The strongest Prime to ever live.

123
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,493
I know, buddy.

124
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:16,664
- Looks good on you.
- Ah, it's really cool.

125
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,584
- Thanks.
- Always got your back.

126
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,878
No matter what.

127
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,152
<i>Approaching</i>
sub/eve! <i>Station. Stand</i> clear <i>of doors.</i>

128
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,053
<i>Mining teams, prepare to unload.</i>

129
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,534
Metal to the pedal, drill bits.
This is it.

130
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,994
How much Energon have you mined
under my leadership?

131
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,329
So much, Elita-1!

132
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,331
And how perfect is my mining record?

133
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:00,833
So perfect, Elita-1!

134
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,210
We are a mere 30 units of Energon away

135
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,254
from my promotion to supervisor.

136
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,797
Are you happy for me?

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,215
So happy, Elite—1!

138
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,759
Elita... I mean Captain,

139
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,679
you are looking especially shiny
this morning. New polish?

140
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,681
Orion Pax, I'm sorry that I somehow

141
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,474
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

142
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,684
Apology accepted.

143
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,686
Light up that wall! Let's go! Ten seconds!

144
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,312
Happy to take the lead today, Captain.

145
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,858
Feeling like I have enough power in me
to drill down and touch Primus myself.

146
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,526
You don't have the touch or the power.

147
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,737
Ready positions, rust buckets! Let's go!

148
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,655
- She's in a good mood today.
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,407
- You ready?
- Always ready.

150
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,950
Let's punch in.

151
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,803
Here we go.
This one won't be open long.

152
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,078
Brace it up!

153
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,998
Here we go! Bridge!

154
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,249
Brace up!

155
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,586
Lower channel is open.

156
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,402
...Drill power on max!

157
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,469
Low bridge!

158
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,225
Drill it out!

159
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:03,604
I tapped a vein!

160
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,444
It's unstable!
We got to go, we got to move!

161
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,495
Evacuate!

162
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,081
Everyone out! Evacuate immediately!

163
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,750
The tunnel is closing.

164
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,753
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

165
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,923
- You with me, D?
- On your six! Keep going!

166
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:32,758
Look out!

167
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,180
Jazz is stuck!

168
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,491
Elita, we've got a trapped miner.

169
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,099
I'm falling back to assist.

170
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,119
<i>Negative.
Do not break protocol. Evacuate!</i>

171
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,187
We're gonna need more lift.

172
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,564
It's closing! Just grab your pack and go.

173
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,816
Yeah. Good idea.

174
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,151
What? No, I didn't mean it!

175
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,570
{

176
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,781
Pull him clear!

177
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,411
<i>Pax, What's happening?</i>

178
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,289
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff.

179
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,874
It's all good.

180
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,211
Oh, that's not good.

181
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,797
Orion Pax, could you please exit
the tunnel of death?

182
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,882
<i>Elita, it's about
to get messy out there!</i>

183
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,056
Go, go, go!

184
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,853
Run! Run!

185
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,688
- Hurry!
- We're not gonna make it!

186
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,773
Come on! Go, go, go!

187
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,657
What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

188
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,243
- I did, eventually.
- If I get fired because of you...

189
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,203
Oh, please. They're not gonna fire you.

190
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,539
Elita-1, you're fired.

191
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,709
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

192
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,672
That is true.
I was the one who broke the rules.

193
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,004
No one asked you!

194
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,590
Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard for this.

195
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,676
You are no-cog bots with limited options.

196
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,345
Report to waste management immediately.

197
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,014
Waste management?

198
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,075
- Elita...
- Next time, why don't you stop and think

199
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,559
before you ruin someone's life?

200
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,727
I'm sorry!

201
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,105
- Hey, Darkwing!
- Don't do it.

202
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,317
I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

203
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,278
Guess which one?
I'll give you a "limited option."

204
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,907
Excuse me, sir.

205
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,783
Allow me.

206
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,244
I apologize on his behalf for the...

207
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,788
Why?

208
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,638
That really hurt.

209
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,181
What'd you expect? He's metal.

210
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,849
You know you were out of line,

211
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,101
talking back to a superior like that.

212
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,270
Darkwing was out of line. He deserves it.

213
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,566
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

214
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,029
He had every right to hit me.
I interfered.

215
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,742
Hey, and I appreciate you having my back.

216
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,455
I'm glad you were there with me to get
punched in the face. That was fun.

217
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,666
Anytime, buddy.

218
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,429
<i>Attention, all sectors.</i>

219
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,712
<i>Stand by for a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime.</i>

220
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,632
- He's back? He's back already?
- Maybe he found the Matrix.

221
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,969
{

222
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,180
<i>Is it on? Okay, thank you.</i>

223
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,015
<i>Hello, my friends.</i>

224
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:28,433
<i>Hello, Ia con City!</i>

225
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,228
<i>Hello to our saviors,
the industrious miners</i>

226
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,231
<i>who toil selflessly to maintain
our Energon reserves.</i>

227
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,192
<i>I celebrate you.</i>

228
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,529
Humility and presence! That's leadership!

229
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,531
Ah! Nobody does it better!

230
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,283
<i>Once again, I have narrowly
returned with my fleet</i>

231
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,952
<i>after another treacherous expedition</i>

232
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,330
<i>across the desolate, dangerous
surface of our planet.</i>

233
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,874
<i>I departed with hopes of finding
the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

234
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,043
<i>the key to bringing balance to Cybertron.</i>

235
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:58,505
<i>I regret to inform you
that we've returned empty-handed.</i>

236
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:03,135
<i>This is a setback, but not a failure.</i>

237
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:06,179
<i>Rest assured, I will find
the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

238
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,640
<i>so that Energon can flow again.</i>

239
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,434
<i>But that's in the future.</i>

240
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,729
<i>Right now,
I think we all deserve a little fun!</i>

241
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,272
<i>Tomorrow, there will be no work.</i>

242
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:19,985
<i>All shifts off because tomorrow
is the lacon 5000!</i>

243
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,321
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

244
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,614
<i>My favorite event.</i>

245
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,868
<i>A high-octane race all across lacon City.</i>

246
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:32,122
<i>Let's all see which competitor can prove
they are truly more than meets the eye.</i>

247
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,798
D.

248
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,551
Psst! Hey, D.

249
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,395
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

250
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,356
Whatever this is,
it better be good.

251
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,067
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Listen.

252
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,152
All right, what if... what if

253
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,654
what if tomorrow

254
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,492
we ran in the lacon 5000, huh?

255
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,453
What if kill you for waking me up?

256
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,205
No, no, no, hear me out.

257
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,581
We don't even have to win!

258
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,975
Oh, that's good, because we wouldn't.

259
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,252
But—— But if we beat just one Transformer,

260
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,254
it proves we're just as good as they are.

261
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,381
Not only would we go down in history,

262
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:26,718
the mining bots that did the impossible,

263
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,595
but we would show everyone that we're...

264
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,639
We're capable of so much more!

265
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,642
Or we get publicly humiliated
and then busted back to tier one.

266
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,645
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

267
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,313
- Pax”.
- Come on, D.

268
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,606
Pax.

269
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,651
We're mining bots who can't transform.

270
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,862
We can't fly, we can't roll,

271
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,197
we can't race.

272
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,281
Come on, let's go.

273
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,284
All right, fine.

274
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,036
Yeah, maybe you're right.

275
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,084
Maybe.

276
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,672
The lacon 5000 is finally here!

277
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,274
I have a surprise for you.
Come on.

278
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,425
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

279
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,094
Yeah, yeah, I know. Follow me.

280
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,179
Great. We're gonna be late now.

281
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,348
I wanted good seats.

282
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,184
We came all this way to miss
the opening ceremony. This is wonderful!

283
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,978
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

284
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:19,938
Hold up!

285
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,736
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you halfway across the city.

286
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,363
Okay, where are you taking me?

287
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,742
Don't be a glitch, this will be
totally worth it. Trust me.

288
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,952
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

289
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,205
Look, I know this is, like, fun for you,
like, we're joking around,

290
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,958
but if you make me miss
any part of the lacon 5000,

291
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,545
I swear I will smelt
your face right off your...

292
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:50,302
<i>Welcome to the lacon 5000.
There they are.</i>

293
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:55,599
<i>Put your hands together as today's
competitors are taking the field.</i>

294
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,560
Look!
There's Thunderglide and Behemoth!

295
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:02,272
This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

296
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,027
You did this for me?

297
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,111
No.

298
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,113
I did this for us.

299
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,662
And now the moment
you've all been <i>waiting</i> for.

300
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,414
<i>The icon of lacon!</i>

301
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,542
<i>The savior of Cybertron!</i>

302
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,129
<i>Quintessons fear him, but we love him!</i>

303
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:29,299
<i>Our leader, the one and only...</i>

304
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,092
<i>Sentinel Prime!</i>

305
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,896
I love you, Sentinel!

306
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:39,100
Yes! It feels so good
to be here with you all today.

307
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,649
My friends. My Cybertronian family.

308
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,027
It has been precisely 50 cycles

309
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,571
since the Quintessons attacked our home.

310
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:55,116
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

311
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,744
and our Energon supply dried up.

312
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,790
Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

313
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,792
my brothers and sisters in arms.

314
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:08,004
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

315
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,716
and we show them that the strength
of Cybertron will never be diminished.

316
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,556
Racers, on your marks!

317
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,184
{

318

I can't believe we get to watch
from the starting line.

The best seats in the house!

320
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:29,818
Why'd you bring jetpacks?

321
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,278
Get <i>set!</i>

322
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,364
It's time to show them
we are more than meets the eye.

323
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,782
Oh, no.

324
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,827
And <i>they're off!</i>

325
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,877
- Are you crazy?
- Sure feels like it.

326
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,882
The <i>lacon 5000</i> has begun!

I'm sorry, are those miners in the race?

328

- There are miners in the race!
- Miners?

00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,835
- No way!
- They can't even transform!

334
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,610
It's Orion Pax and D-16!

337
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,999
If we survive this, I'm gonna kill you!

338
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,459
I accept those terms.

- I owe you one.
- More like a thousand.

Get off!

I'm not talking to you.

You know what?
I can't believe you made me do that.

- We are so screwed!
- Thought you weren't talking to me.

But come on, didn't you feel it?

398
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,637
Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?

399
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,323
Didn't you feel like
you were something else?

400
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,141
Like you could be more
than what they say you are?

401
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,852
Yeah, I felt it. I did.

402
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,480
But it doesn't matter.

403
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,899
We're going to get punished and demoted.

404
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,986
Sentinel Prime
saw the whole thing.

405
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,280
This is so embarrassing.

406
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,127
It's clear.

407
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,383
Orion Pax.

408
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,844
D-16.

409
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,220
What you two did today

410
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:52,098
was one of the craziest things
I've ever seen.

411
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,601
Sir, this is all my idea,
and we're so sorry.

412
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:56,019
I loved it!

413
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,102
You did?

414
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,980
How could anyone not love it?

415
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,733
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

416
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,152
So we're not getting demoted?

417
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,320
Demoted?

418
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,451
Demoted.

419
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,454
What is happening?

420
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,310
The fact of the matter
is we're halfway into the first shift

421
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:24,631
since the race ended and that mining crew
has already reached 150% quota.

422
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,758
You inspired them to work harder!

423
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,843
Sentinel Prime, sir,

424
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:33,139
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

425
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,058
That we bots can do more than just mine...

426
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,394
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

427
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,146
Perhaps you two could tour the mines,

428
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,499
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

429
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,567
Wow! Okay, great.

430
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,361
That sounds incredible.

431
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,279
- I would love to...
- Sir, it's time.

432
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,906
Ah, yes.

433
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,282
I'm sorry, friends.

434
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,660
We're preparing our next travel
to the surface.

435
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,454
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

436
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,582
Hang tight. Airachnid,
have someone escort these heroes

437
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,459
to my personal service facilities.

438
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,462
Best care in lacon.

439
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,297
Until next time, legends.

440
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:14,055
Sentinel Prime.
The Sentinel Prime!

441
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,908
- You still mad at me?
- I am less mad at you.

442
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,810
I'm telling you, D... I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

443
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,037
and we're gonna go...

444
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,814
Miners!

445
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,900
Hi, Darkwing.

446
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,445
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No!

447
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,782
Wait, wait! You don't understand!

448
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,535
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

449
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:38,830
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

450
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,331
I'll make sure of that.

451
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,625
You're making a mistake! Ask Sentinel!

452
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,836
I hate that guy!

453
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,309
You! How did you get down here?

454
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,061
There's no access to this level.

455
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,105
There is nobody down here but me.

456
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,607
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

457
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,861
You're others! You're not... me!

458
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,613
You're here, and you're not me!

459
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,826
- Uh, yeah.
- Awesome!

460
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,328
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

461
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,539
I just haven't had a lot of company

462
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,624
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

463
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:26,919
Fifty? But there are only 40 sublevels.

464
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,421
That's what I thought!

465
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,549
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

466
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,360
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

467
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:36,345
- How long have you been down here?
- How long have I been here?

468
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,599
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

469
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:43,311
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

470
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,188
'cause I'm so good at what I do.

471
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,232
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

472
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,650
But you can call me B.

473
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,414
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

474
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:54,071
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

475
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:57,825
Which is actually pronounced...
"Badassatron."

476
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,136
But if you have any critiques...

477
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,205
Yeah, great. How do we get out of here?

478
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,165
Great question. You don't.

479
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,541
- We don't?
- Nope.

480
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,044
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

481
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,131
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

482
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:15,176
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

483
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,719
- Which is?
- Oh!

484
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,680
The scrap comes in from the chute there

485
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,224
onto the conveyor belt.

486
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:24,393
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

487
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,104
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

488
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,148
So you watch garbage burn.

489
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,650
Yes!

490
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,276
It is so great that you're here now.

491
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,195
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

492
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,030
And then tell you everything about me!

493
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,908
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

494
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,302
with one or two new best friends.

495
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,453
Uh, yeah, I would love to...

496
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:43,913
Where are my manners?

497
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,974
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

498
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,917
Hey, guys, we've got company!

499
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,712
This is EP-508,

500
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:55,508
this is A—A—Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

501
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,885
- "Steve"?
- Yeah, he's foreign.

502
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,887
Do they talk back to you?

503
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,181
Um, they're not real.

504
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,809
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

505
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,161
It's just you've been down here a...

506
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,913
No, I was talking to Steve.

507
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,481
Classic Steve.

508
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,275
- What is that?
- Look at this guy.

509
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,361
It's coming from inside.

510
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,822
Oh! Steve! No!

511
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,033
...I am so sorry.
Steve, no!

512
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,119
- We can fix it, don't worry.
- My Steve!

513
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,832
Quintesson <i>ambush!</i>

514
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,168
<i>Calling the High Guard
for immediate support. Immediate support!</i>

515
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,421
That's Alpha Trion.

516
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,964
One of the Primes?

517
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,300
<i>Repeat, Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

518
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,136
- It's <i>an 808</i> message.
<i>- Protect the Matrix!</i>

519
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,431
<i>Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates.</i>

520
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,312
Holy Primus!

521
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,607
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

522
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,236
This could be where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

523
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,656
Which means this is where we could find

524
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,742
the Matrix of Leadership.

525
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:06,537
What are you talking about? It's an old
beacon inside a statue made of garbage.

526
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,122
Or it's a clue of how we could find

527
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,958
- the Matrix of Leadership.
- No. No way. Absolutely not!

528
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,753
Come on. This could be our chance
to show everyone we're not...

529
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:16,773
You already tried to "show everyone"
in the race you tricked me into running,

530
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:20,509
which got us stuck down here
in this waste hole with this, uh

531
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,471
really cool guy.

532
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,681
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm just saying...

533
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:28,893
There's a reason no one goes
to the surface. It's dangerous!

534
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,604
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime finds us.

535
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,105
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

536
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:36,525
Well, we'll just stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

537
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,944
Forever? This is great!

538
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,154
I have new coworkers and roommates.

539
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,007
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

540
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,301
I usually sleep on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

541
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,844
I'll sleep in the corner next to A-A-Tron.

542
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,387
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

543
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,413
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

544
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,249
Hey, D, what do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be

545
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:57,004
if you personally handed him
the Matrix of Leadership that you found?

546
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,882
Okay, stop.
I know what you're trying to do.

547
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:02,176
And it's definitely working. I'm in.

548
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,679
- Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
- How do we get to the surface?

549
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,847
Pfft! You kidding me? The surface?

550
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,016
Easy. I know a way.

551
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,769
But it won't be easy.

552
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,730
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

553
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,108
Warn me next time, please.
My mouth was open.

554
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,610
Only 49 sublevels to go!

555
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,780
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

556
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,573
that go all the way to the surface.

557
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,469
Yeah, but they don't allow
passengers. The trains are autonomous.

558
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,829
Yeah, that's the "won't be easy" part.

559
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,289
It's perfect.
We'll be safe inside the train.

560
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,441
That's the last one. Send 'er up!

561
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:49,140
Hold up! One more.

562
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,520
I'll look it down.

563
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,823
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

564
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,951
Turning you in will definitely
get me promoted back up a rank or two.

565
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:10,995
Got her!

566
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,204
No, wait, I...

567
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,539
Elita! Stop!

568
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,332
- Orion?
- Hold on, let me...

569
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,584
Security! Sound the ala...

570
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:24,957
- She's headed to the engine!
- Don't worry, I got this.

571
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,221
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

572
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,390
So am I. To ruin your life.

573
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,987
Elita, wait. We found a message.
We know where...

574
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,865
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

575
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,409
Dead end, Elita. There's no way...

576
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,619
Well, she's gone.

577
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,718
Whoa!

578
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:10,805
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

579
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:11,972
Climb faster!

580
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,280
Gotcha!

581
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,649
Ah, the surface.

582
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,193
It's beautiful.

583
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:12,116
I am speechless.

584
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,619
Elita, listen to me.

585
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:17,872
We know where the Matrix of Leadership is.

586
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,915
Oh, sure. And I'm really a Prime.

587
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:23,335
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

588
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,838
Whoa. Where did you get this?

589
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,590
From my friend Steve. Orion killed him.

590
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,050
- I did not kill Steve.
- He was never alive.

591
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:31,343
- What?
- Look.

592
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,679
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

593
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,556
and then we found this message.

594
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,808
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

595
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,811
or scout the locations ourselves.

596
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,104
Whichever comes first.

597
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,691
This was too important to wait.

598
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,402
It will change all of our lives.

599
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,197
No, no, no, no.

600
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,491
I'm not going to get demoted
again because of you.

601
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,428
I'm turning this rig around
and I'm notifying the.

602
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,287
Hey, guys? Guys?

603
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,371
What is that?

604
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,002
Is it getting bigger?

605
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:07,838
Or closer?

606
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,932
No, no, no, no, no, no!

607
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,531
Are you closing?
Don't close. Stop closing.

608
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:23,520
It's closed!

609
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:24,730
Oh, come on!

610
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,781
Oh, now I know why
no one comes to the surface!

611
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:58,514
<i>Elita?</i>

612
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,850
Elita?

613
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,310
You okay?

614
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,606
Please stop punching me in the face.

615
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,875
Can you help?

616
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,651
Lacon... The train...

617
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,862
- Where's the train?
- Relax, okay? Here it comes.

618
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:15,906
And there it goes.

619
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,034
Okay, I was wrong about that.
It was going the other way.

620
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,213
Okay, so I think this is us,

621
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,757
- and if we follow the path to...
- Now you listen to me,

622
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,343
Mr. "Zero Seconds Since My Last Accident"!

623
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:39,430
I'll go on your little quest
because I don't have a choice.

624
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:43,309
But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this leads to nothing,

625
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,894
then I'm dragging you
and those two idiot go-bots

626
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,313
back to lacon City

627
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:49,982
and to the first supervisor depot we see,

628
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,943
at which point you will explain
everything that's happened,

629
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:57,031
using words that reflect me
in a very positive light! Got it?

630
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,283
Yeah, okay. Deal. Great. All right.

631
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,618
- Let's go!
- She's joining us?

632
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,245
Fantastic!

633
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:06,665
Hi there. Uh, Elita, right?
Am I saying that right?

634
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,917
Wanted to formally introduce myself.

635
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:12,588
I'm B-127. You kneed me
in the face earlier, back there.

636
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,257
You can call me B, or Badassatron.

637
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,818
It's a nickname some of the guys gave me.

638
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,428
I don't know. I didn't give it
to myself or anything.

639
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,556
Actually, it's pronounced...
"Badassatron,"

640
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,642
in case you were wondering.

641
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,937
Badassatron.

642
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,939
You like that, right?

643
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,209
- Badass...
- I'm gonna need you to talk less.

644
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,902
Sure! No... Yeah, no problem.

645
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,665
What am I talking less about, my nickname?

646
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,906
That's fine with me.
Got some mountains over here...

647
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,824
Hey. You're thinking about what you'll say

648
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,828
when you hand the Matrix
to Sentinel, aren't you?

649
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,078
I can't help it.

650
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,372
D, we're really doing this.

651
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:49,833
So glad I'm out here with you.
This was a great idea.

652
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,460
I'm just having a good time.

653
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,104
How much further is the Matrix on the map?

654
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,463
Make an educated guesstimate.

655
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,507
This is the coolest thing
that has ever happened

656
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,467
to anyone anywhere, I'm telling you!

657
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,886

660
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,059
Hey, look, there's more of it over here.

661
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,645
- What is it?
- It's not metal.

662
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,107
It's like some kind
of weird nature. It's weird.

663
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,274
So are they.

Urn

668
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,586
I think this is not right. We should go.

669
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,422
- Yeah, good idea.
- Run!

670
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,507
What are we running from?

671
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,534
- What is that?
- Oh, no.

672
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,703
- It's a Quintesson ship.
- What?

673
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,414
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Shh! Quiet.

674
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,302
It's scanning for life-forms. Move, move!

675
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,267
Wait!

676
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,105
Go, go, go, go!

677
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,239
Come on!

678
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,991
They're not gonna make it.

679
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,251
Whoa.

680
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,145
What... What were they searching for?

681
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,980
Someone to hug, B. How should I know?

682
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:19,066
I'm not waiting around to find out.

683
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,360
This way. We're close.

684
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,238
Quintessons haven't
been here for 50 cycles.

685
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,907
It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here.

686
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:52,474
A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that.

687
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,150
Knives coming
out of the ceiling. Amazing.

688
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,546
Everyone, do we have to go insi...?

689
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,738
{
Okay, yep, we're going in.

690
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:09,032
Why shouldn't we? Just walking
into the scariest place

691
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,534
I've ever seen in my entire life.

692
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,620
This is ridiculous.

693
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:38,979
I don't believe it.

694
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,106
The Primes.

695
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:43,859
We're here.

696
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,855
Megatronus Prime.

697
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,621
Zeta Prime.

698
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:41,958
The Matrix!

699
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,546
It's gone.

700
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:50,467
Let's keep looking.

701
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:18,704
Hey, guys!

702
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,598
It's Alpha Trion!

703
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:40,726
He's powered down.

704
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,354
But his spark is still lit.

705
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,750
Quintesson ambush!

706
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,334
Attack!

707
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,547
Message before...

708
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,799
Whoa, whoa, it's okay! It's okay.

709
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:14,634
You're safe now.

710
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,344
The war is over.

711
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,368
I failed you, old friend.

712
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:45,332
You deserved so much better than this end.

713
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:47,959
No, you didn't fail.

714
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,796
We heard your message.
We've come to find the Matrix.

715
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:54,049
Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?

716
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:55,884
Who are you?

717
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,261
We're cogless miners, from lacon.

718
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:01,348
Miners? Why?

719
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,867
Well, we've had to drill for Energon

720
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,935
ever since it stopped flowing.

721
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,102
Impossible.

722
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,480
That's why we came. To fix things.

723
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,524
If we find the Matrix of Leadership

724
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:12,327
and get it to Sentinel Prime, he can fix...

725
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,654
Sentinel is no Prime.

726
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:19,407
- What?
- He's broken. Fantastic.

727
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,302
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

728
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:25,288
Sentinel Prime is our protector.
He's been saving us from the Quintessons...

729
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:29,251
You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie.

730
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:32,254
I saw the truth with my own eyes.

731
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,382
Come. I will show you.

732
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,891
For thousands of cycles,
the war with the Quintessons

733
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:47,978
had been a brutal conflict.

734
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:56,194
<i>Until Sentinel,
the principal aide to the Primes,</i>

735
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:59,197
<i>intercepted an enemy transmission.</i>

736
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:04,077
<i>There was going to be a secret gathering
of Quintesson commanders.</i>

737
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,872
<i>Their elimination could end the war.</i>

738
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:13,044
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

739
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:17,299
We agreed to meet Sentinel
for his sensitive intel in secret,

740
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,926
here in this cave.

741
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,720
But we were not alone.

742
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,616
- Quintessons!
- They're here!

743
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,118
- It's a trap!
- Battle positions!

744
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:29,519
- ...Hold the line!
- Primus be with us!

745
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,649
For Cybertron!

746
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,325
<i>We were outnumbered, but stood as one.</i>

747
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,579
<i>Our victory was near.</i>

748
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,043
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i>

749
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:20,528
Sentinel, why?

750
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:23,073
For all the power of Cybertron.

751
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,495
<i>But Sentinel never understood</i>

752
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:32,666
<i>the true power of what he desired.</i>

753
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:36,711
<i>The Matrix of Leadership
can only be wielded</i>

754
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:41,716
<i>by one that Primus himself deems worthy.</i>

755
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:47,389
<i>And Sentinel most certainly was not.</i>

756
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,474
No!

757
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:58,775
Wait. Hold on. You're saying that
the Matrix of Leadership just vanished?

758
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,068
No.

759
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,862
No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

760
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,698
Why would Sentinel do that?

761
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:06,324
To make a bargain.

762
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:08,243
A bargain? With who?

763
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,499
With the new rulers of Cybertron.

764
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,464
The Quintessons.

765
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:22,716
There are so many.

766
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,031
He's here.

767
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,284
Sentinel Prime is here.

768
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,403
- Keep your eyes open.
- They always are.

769
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:07,987
I load those crates.

770
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:10,406
Those are filled with contaminated metal.

771
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,117
I don't understand.

772
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,744
What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?

773
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,084
Our Energon.

774
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,300
- Traitor!
- D, no.

775
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,482
I know what I promised you

776
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:47,610
but our mines, they're running out!

777
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:49,821
There's barely enough Energon for us.

778
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,617
I swear I will get you the rest.

779
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:02,167
Triple-time every mining shift.

780
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,878
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

781
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:06,546
All of it! Let's go.

782
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:26,399
Now you have seen the truth.

783
00:50:29,903 --> 00:50:31,321
Every day...

784
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:37,911
Every single day of my life

785
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:40,496
has been a lie.

786
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,999
My God, I knew it!

787
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,877
Deep down,
I always felt something was off.

788
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,379
He deceived everyone.

789
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:53,551
Sentinel bought himself power and then
put us to work paying off his debt.

790
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:55,303
I can't believe it.

791
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,681
Well, obviously, I can believe it,
I just saw it, but I still

792
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:00,725
I can't believe it.

793
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,728
Sentinel lied

794
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,021
to my face.

795
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:08,691
It was all a sham.
How could we have been so gullible?

796
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:12,320
Oh, this... this is going
to change everything.

797
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:19,369
You just had to do it, didn't you?

798
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,663
Me? What did I do?

799
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,498
You just had to go to the surface,

800
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,541
had to enter the lacon 5000.

801
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,127
You just had to break protocol!

802
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:30,380
- Who cares about protocol?
- I do!

803
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:32,215
I care!

804
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,176
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

805
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,055
Sentinel Prime has been forcing us to
work in the mines until our gears strip,

806
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,767
and all the while he's been giving
the Energon away to our greatest enemies!

807
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,829
And what do you think he's going to do
to us when he finds out that we know?

808
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,855
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

809
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,583
I'm thinking about what we're going to do.

810
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,984
That's the whole thing!

811
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,695
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

812
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:58,032
Fantastic! Another Orion Pax master plan.
I can't wait to hear this.

813
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,409
Don't you want to stop him?

814
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:01,327
No, I want to kill him!

815
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,247
I want to put Sentinel in chains

816
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,748
and march him through the mines

817
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:09,460
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

818
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:13,423
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

819
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:17,719
But we all know that it doesn't matter
what I want, right, Pax?

820
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:21,347
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

821
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:28,187
We had limited
options, and now... now we have none.

822
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:34,444
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

823
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:37,363
Oh, yeah. I've been with myself
since I came online,

824
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:40,366
and this slot's always been empty.

825
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,368
What are you saying? Are you saying...

826
00:52:42,452 --> 00:52:45,997
No. No way. Nobody could be
that evil, not even Sentinel.

827
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,418
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

828
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:55,631
We were born with transformation cogs,
but he...

829
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,592
He took them from us.

830
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,845
What defines a Transformer

831
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,306
is not the cog in his chest

832
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:08,353
but the spark that resides in their core.

833
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:13,691
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

834
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:18,196
My fellow Primes had that spark.

835
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:22,241
And I see their strength in you.

836
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:30,291
Take their cogs
and access your full potential.

837
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,460
Prima.

838
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:34,962
Onyx.

839
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,131
Alchemist.

840
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:39,300
Micronus.

841
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:45,139
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

842
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:49,143
Their uniqueness enhanced by these.

843
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:20,425
They were one. You are one.

844
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:23,302
All are one!

845
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:39,944
Wait. We have... You... You gave us...

846
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,448
The ability to change your world.

847
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:48,619
How you choose to use that power
is up to you.

848
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:54,876
They've found us.

849
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:57,587
Oh, yes! Time to fight back!

850
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,466
No. You must return to
lacon City and alert everyone.

851
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:07,972
Embedded in this
are the records I have shown you.

852
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,433
Use it to reveal the truth.

853
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:12,643
We will.

854
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,937
This tunnel leads to the mountains.

855
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:17,815
Cybertron's future is in your hands.

856
00:55:17,899 --> 00:55:19,376
We're out of time.

857
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,943
We got to move!

858
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,696
Wait, we can't just leave you here.

859
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,282
Your fight will come, my friend.

860
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,660
Primus has a purpose for us all.

861
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,579
But this fight...

862
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,498
This fight is mine.

863
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:36,000
Now go!

864
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:48,387
Stand down, old timer.

865
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:51,390
Ah. Old, you say?

866
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,214
Not too old for you.

867
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:30,096
We need to hurry!

868
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,931
I still think we have better odds

869
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,683
fighting than outrunning them.

870
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:36,727
Wait! We have cogs. We can transform now.

871
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:39,689
- That's right. Everyone ready?
- I was born ready.

872
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,357
On three. One...

873
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:50,991
Ah!

874
00:56:56,706 --> 00:56:58,165
How do we use these things?

875
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:00,126
I don't know. Just try.

876
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,672
It's working. Ha! It's working!

877
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:06,507
My head! My head!

878
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:07,592
Whoa!

879
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:09,427
Help! Help!

880
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,642
This is not faster!

881
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:21,522
Oh, come on!

882
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:24,650
And transform!

883
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:28,696
Wheels! I need wheels!

884
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:39,539
Whoa.

885
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,647
{
Ha!

886
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,734
Oh, wow.

887
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,611
- We're alive!
- I've never moved that fast.

888
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,447
- That was incredible!
- Did you see me slide all over?

889
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:19,872
Yes!

890
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,460
Hey, whoa, buddy. You okay?

891
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:28,172
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

892
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,341
We transform!

893
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:31,676
Oh, hey! I know.

894
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,053
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to lacon.

895
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,221
Looks like the fastest way

896
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,014
- back to lacon is...
- Here, I got it.

897
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:38,265
Hey, what are you doing?

898
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,160
- Don't worry, I got it.
- Yeah, but be careful.

899
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:43,062
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

900
00:58:44,397 --> 00:58:49,735
It.

901
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:52,988
Okay.

902
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:58,285
Follow me.

903
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,378
Alpha Trion!

904
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:10,214
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

905
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:13,008
You look horrible.

906
00:59:13,843 --> 00:59:18,139
Traitor. You are a disgrace.

907
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:21,434
- Primus will surely...
- Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

908
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:25,229
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

909
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:29,066
Anything to get out of working for you
and that boring council of elders.

910
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,277
Seriously, I would watch you Primes

911
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,404
spend half the day losing a war

912
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:38,242
and the other half sitting around
waxing poetic about loyalty and honor.

913
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,535
And now look at you.

914
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:43,372
You will fall.

915
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,458
And a new Prime will rise...

916
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:46,917
There you go again.

917
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:49,920
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

918
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,715
There were others in the cave with you.

919
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:53,799
Who are they?

920
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:56,927
They are to be your undoing.

921
00:59:57,011 --> 01:00:01,348
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do

922
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:10,483
Oh, didn't I just say no speeches?

923
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:12,109
You heard me, right?

924
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:14,528
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

925
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:17,448
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

926
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,285
Okay. Hunt down the others.

927
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,620
With pleasure.

928
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,471
Hey, buddy.

929
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,515
Oh. Hey.

930
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:47,311
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

931
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:51,649
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

932
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:55,486
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

933
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:59,698
We are. With Alpha's proof inside that
device, we will show everyone the truth.

934
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,785
You honestly believe it'll be that easy?

935
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,787
Lacon doesn't want to hear the truth.

936
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,039
They worship Sentinel.

937
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,083
There's got to be a better way
to bring him down.

938
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,794
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

939
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,963
I trusted Sentinel!

940
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:15,589
With everything.

941
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:22,096
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

942
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,403
There's only one bot I know I can trust...

943
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:39,238
All right, wake them up.

944
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,472
Now, are you spies

945
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,768
or just incompetent lackeys?

946
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:12,605
- We're not spies.
- But he is incompetent.

947
01:02:12,688 --> 01:02:16,942
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

948
01:02:17,026 --> 01:02:21,488
That just means he believes himself,
like any spy would.

949
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:26,035
Uh, why is he gagged?

950
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:27,578
He wouldn't stop talking.

951
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,347
Even when he was unconscious?

952
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,498
Especially when he was unconscious!

953
01:02:31,582 --> 01:02:32,750
Enough!

954
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:35,127
Two options for you!

955
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:40,049
One, we slowly dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time,

956
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:42,718
and really make sure you feel it.

957
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:43,802
Or two:

958
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:45,638
In exchange for a quick death,

959
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:48,098
you give us intel on the Energon trains,

960
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:50,100
access to the mines

961
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:53,812
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

962
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:55,314
Who exactly are you guys?

963
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,108
Ah!

964
01:02:58,192 --> 01:03:01,153
The Cybertronian High Guard!

965
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,072
I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

966
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:06,200
- Prestigious defenders of lacon.
- Prestigious?

967
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,953
He's right.
I read all about you in the archives.

968
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:12,373
You were the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

969
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:13,457
Look, look, look!

970
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,086
That's Starscream,
and you're Shockwave, and Soundwave.

971
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:19,773
Raise your hand if "wave" is in your name.
There's a lot of "waves."

972
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:21,298
Silence!

973
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:23,425
The yellow annoying one is correct.

974
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:24,343
Whoo!

975
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:26,261
We were once the High Guard.

976
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:30,015
We witnessed Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

977
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:32,893
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

978
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:35,646
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

979
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,356
That's great! We're... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

980
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:41,068
Okay, okay. We're good. Everyone relax.

981
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,570
I'm just saying we're allies.

982
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,656
We were on our way back to lacon,

983
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:49,702
and now with your help, we can unify
Cybertron against Sentinel Prime.

984
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:53,872
The idea of a unified Cybertron is a myth.

985
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:58,711
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

986
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:03,590
Okay. So, these guys are a little intense.

987
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,551
Yeah. Just a little.

988
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:06,885
Hey!

989
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,470
What are you doing?

990
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:13,726
I tell you what I'm not doing.

991
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:17,646
I'm not cowering in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

992
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,857
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

993
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,568
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

994
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:24,862
I found out that Sentinel is rotten today,

995
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:26,864
and I'm gonna make him pay for it.

996
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,073
Today!

997
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:31,952
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

998
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:35,998
No one leaves here unless I say so.

999
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,666
Is that right?

1000
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:40,836
Well, how can you say so

1001
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,796
with my head in your teeth?

1002
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,306
Whoa!

1003
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,058
{

1004
01:04:57,603 --> 01:04:58,687
Hit me!

1005
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:02,149
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!

1006
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,694
D-16! D-16! D-16!

1007
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:12,868
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

1008
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,991
Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

1009
01:05:15,037 --> 01:05:17,748
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

1010
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,476
Please! I beg you!

1011
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,312
Stop! D, he's not the enemy!

1012
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,775
Bear witness!

1013
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,569
This is the last time I show mercy!

1014
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:50,239
Decide right now:

1015
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:54,868
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before your pathetic leader,

1016
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:58,205
or follow me as we march on lacon

1017
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:01,792
and I take down Sentinel once and for all!

1018
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:08,841
D-16! D-16! D-16!

1019
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:36,994
B, come on!

1020
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:04,771
Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

1021
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:37,553
Elita, get down!

1022
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:02,663
I feel like someone dropped a cliff on me.

1023
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:05,207
Where are the others?

1024
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:09,002
Sentinel's troops took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

1025
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:10,796
They got D-16 and B.

1026
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,673
Oh, no.

1027
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:15,259
And half of those High-Guard nutjobs.

1028
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,971
Our proof.

1029
01:08:19,054 --> 01:08:20,430
It's gone.

1030
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,558
So, what do we do now?

1031
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,143
D was right.

1032
01:08:25,227 --> 01:08:27,771
- About what?
- Everything.

1033
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:31,400
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

1034
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,068
It's all my fault.

1035
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,070
I should have stayed on protocol.

1036
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:44,746
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

1037
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:45,831
Are you listening?

1038
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,876
I'm better than you.

1039
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,462
Yeah, okay, I'm hearing you.

1040
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,090
I'm better than you in every way,

1041
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,592
except you have hope.

1042
01:08:57,676 --> 01:09:01,305
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1043
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:05,267
You snuck up to the surface to find
the Matrix of Leadership.

1044
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,102
Yeah, and how'd that work out?

1045
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,770
My point is,

1046
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:13,150
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

1047
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:16,236
This blind optimism that you have

1048
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:20,615
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

1049
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,493
that are also extremely stupid.

1050
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:26,038
First time giving a pep talk?

1051
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:27,831
You're inspiring.

1052
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:31,209
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

1053
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:35,297
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

1054
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,343
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

1055
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:41,595
Listen to me.

1056
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,680
We can do this.

1057
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:49,353
Those Energon trains
will be heading back to lacon.

1058
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:52,064
If we intercepted one...

1059
01:09:52,147 --> 01:09:55,275
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

1060
01:09:55,359 --> 01:10:00,030
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1061
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,368
I was afraid you'd say that.

1062
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:07,954
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave. You in the back.

1063
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:11,249
In order to save our captured friends,
we have to act now.

1064
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,543
How about I blast you back to lacon?

1065
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:16,963
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

1066
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:20,217
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

1067
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,054
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

1068
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,722
at the top of Sentinel's tower.

1069
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:28,767
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

1070
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:33,730
Impossible. We do not have enough soldiers
or a way inside.

1071
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:36,900
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

1072
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,527
Why should we follow you?

1073
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,363
We will follow you.

1074
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:44,616
Attention, High Guard. Prepare for battle.

1075
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,618
What is our first move?

1076
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:47,828
We roll out.

1077
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:50,414
What?

1078
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:51,832
<i>Louder.</i>

1079
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,292
Transform and roll out!

1080
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:07,806
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

1081
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:11,435
Look at this rowdy bunch! The High Guard!

1082
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:13,311
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

1083
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:16,898
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

1084
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:19,443
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

1085
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:20,569
Oh-ho-ho!

1086
01:11:20,652 --> 01:11:23,697
- You captured Starscream!
- It was too easy.

1087
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,907
I'm going to rip you apart piece by piece

1088
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:27,468
so that your death is painful!

1089
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:28,761
You'll regret the day you were...

1090
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:30,662
You sound ridiculous. It's weird.

1091
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,707
Oh, D-16, what a tragic story you'll be.

1092
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,627
Atop the leader board in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

1093
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,713
I'm not a traitor. You're the traitor.

1094
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:42,466
Nuh-uh. You, all of you, are traitors.

1095
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:46,178
You've been working with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

1096
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:48,656
You're the reason why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1097
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,806
None of that is true!

1098
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:54,436
Oh, trust me, it'll be very true when I'm
executing you in front of all of lacon.

1099
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:58,273
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

1100
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,409
Well, well. What's this about?

1101
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:12,996
I'm not kneeling in front of you.

1102
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,956
Feeling confident, are we?

1103
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,210
You don't scare me. You want to know why?

1104
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:19,294
Please.

1105
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:23,548
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

1106
01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:25,717
You took it all.

1107
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,428
I sure did.

1108
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:33,934
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1109
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:38,396
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was the coolest Prime!

1110
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,274
The biggest! The baddest! The toughest!

1111
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:44,778
That's why, after I killed him,

1112
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,031
I took his cog for myself.

1113
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:50,534
He was greater than you'll ever be!

1114
01:12:50,617 --> 01:12:52,827
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1115
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:55,705
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

1116
01:12:55,789 --> 01:12:56,790
Here.

1117
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:01,253
Let's make sure it doesn't come off.

1118
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,524
Okay.

1119
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:25,110
I can do this.

1120
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:42,252
You can't be serious.
We just worked 22 shifts without a break!

1121
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,021
These miners need rest
and time to repair and...

1122
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,298
Sentinel Prime wants more Energon.

1123
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:49,718
So get back in the mines
before I make you get back in the...

1124
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,392
- Who was that?
- Did you see who that was?

1125
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:58,602
That can't be him.

1126
01:13:58,685 --> 01:13:59,686
Is that...

1127
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:02,397
It can't be.

1128
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,941
- Orion?
- Jazz.

1129
01:14:05,025 --> 01:14:06,318
Is it really you?

1130
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:08,778
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

1131
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:10,363
"Little"?

1132
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,198
There's nothing "little" about you.

1133
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:14,075
Uh, how is this possible?

1134
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,911
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

1135
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:19,873
Sentinel is a liar.

1136
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,916
- What?
- Huh?

1137
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,085
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

1138
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:27,589
I was never the most focused miner.

1139
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:30,050
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1140
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:42,145
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1141
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:45,273
My friends,

1142
01:14:45,357 --> 01:14:49,402
we were all born with transformation cogs.

1143
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:53,573
And then Sentinel, he stole them from us.

1144
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:56,993
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

1145
01:14:57,077 --> 01:14:59,162
He stole our freedom.

1146
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:08,797
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1147
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,926
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1148
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:17,472
or fight back against Sentinel with me.

1149
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:20,058
Right now.

1150
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,520
- How are we supposed to do that?
- We can't fight. We don't have cogs.

1151
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:29,776
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1152
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,737
but the spark that resides in their core.

1153
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:36,908
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1154
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:40,787
And that spark,
Sentinel can never take from us.

1155
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,206
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

1156
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:46,960
And we have one. Elita is bringing troops.

1157
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,045
We are not alone in this.

1158
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:51,840
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

1159
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:53,508
we will have to fight for it.

1160
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:56,886
Now is the time for us to stand up.

1161
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,888
...for ourselves.

1162
01:16:01,266 --> 01:16:03,143
Stand up for this injustice.

1163
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:09,065
I promise you this fight will be worth it.

1164
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,735
Follow me.

1165
01:16:11,818 --> 01:16:14,612
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

1166
01:16:14,696 --> 01:16:18,158
...—Together as one.

1167
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:22,662
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

1168
01:16:22,746 --> 01:16:25,165
<i>Elita, it's time.</i>

1169
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:26,499
You got it.

1170
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,793
Buckle up, Blinky. We're going in.

1171
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:43,433
Not a good idea.

1172
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,771
D, stay down.

1173
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:01,409
Well, that's a shame.
{

1174
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:03,369
You really were a great miner.

1175
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:10,335
We've got a breach! Protect Sentinel!

1176
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:22,138
They spotted us. It's about to get bumpy.

1177
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:24,766
High Guard, eject.

1178
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,726
Come on! Move out!

1179
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:43,818
...—There's too many. We have to abort!

1180
01:17:49,457 --> 01:17:50,458
We're not gonna make it.

1181
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:54,212
Whoo-hoo!

1182
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:55,880
Metal to the pedal, miners!

1183
01:17:55,964 --> 01:17:57,674
Let's break some protocol!

1184
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,437
That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

1185
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,354
Whoa! That's intense.

1186
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:16,067
You can't win, miner. I see everything!

1187
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,945
That's right, you do.

1188
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,698
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

1189
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:36,337
What's going on?

1190
01:18:40,592 --> 01:18:41,718
Hey!

1191
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:48,600
What has he done to you?

1192
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:51,853
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

1193
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:55,064
Soundwave, free the prisoners.

1194
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:02,071
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

1195
01:19:02,155 --> 01:19:03,823
- I'm doing this my way.
- D!

1196
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:10,413
Yes!

1197
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:11,496
Whoa!

1198
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:12,999
Whoa-ho-ho!

1199
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,375
I got a battle mask!

1200
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,046
Elita! Battle mask!

1201
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:21,007
It appeared when this guy tried to...

1202
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,051
Sword hands? I have sword hands!

1203
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,138
What the...?

1204
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,935
Badassatron.

1205
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,150
Where's Sentinel?

1206
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:43,738
You pathetic little twits.

1207
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:48,284
Did you really think that you could
knock down everything I've built?

1208
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:50,828
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.

1209
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:52,121
What truth?

1210
01:19:52,205 --> 01:19:54,832
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

1211
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:58,211
Forced you to mine so that I could pay off
the Quintessons and live like a king?

1212
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,381
None of that matters! Because the truth

1213
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:05,385
{
...is what I make it.

1214
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:08,637
Incoming!

1215
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:11,683
Whoa!

1216
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,063
- He's too strong.
- I have a plan.

1217
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,273
- We need Airachnid.
- Airachnid?

1218
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:21,526
- We need her memory.
- Where is she?

1219
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:23,152
Found her!

1220
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:25,737
Elita!

1221
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:27,824
<i>Do not break her.</i>

1222
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,301
<i>Bring her to the broadcast station.</i>

1223
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,493
<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

1224
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:32,453
Easier said than done.

1225
01:20:51,556 --> 01:20:52,825
<i>I said, don't break her!</i>

1226
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:55,810
Relax! I'm being very gentle.

1227
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:02,984
Orion! Orion, look! I have sword hands!

1228
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,569
I can see that.

1229
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:06,779
I'm gonna out these guys.
Watch. Come here!

1230
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:08,656
You can jab them later. We got to go.

1231
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:13,036
Yeah!

1232
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:34,557
Uh, excuse me. You can't be in here.

1233
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:43,274
B!

1234
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:46,319
- These are not the bad guys.
- Why did you cut the door?

1235
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,946
What? No, I didn't... That was an... I...

1236
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:50,615
It was already like that. Right?

1237
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:52,009
- Yes, that's right.
- That's right, yes.

1238
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:54,035
- Yeah, it was already like...
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

1239
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:00,541
<i>Attention, lacon City.</i>

1240
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:03,961
<i>Stand by for a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime.</i>

1241
01:22:09,801 --> 01:22:11,344
What's wrong, D-16?

1242
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:13,429
Rise up!

1243
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:19,119
<i>That's why after I killed him...</i>

1244
01:22:19,143 --> 01:22:23,189
<i>That's why after I killed him,
I took his cog for myself.</i>

1245
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,525
<i>...cog for myself.</i>

1246
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:29,362
<i>What truth? That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?</i>

1247
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:32,949
<i>Forced you to mine so that I could pay off
the Quintessons and live like a king?</i>

1248
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:34,367
<i>What truth?</i>

1249
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,577
<i>That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?</i>

1250
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:40,456
<i>Forced you to mine so that I could pay off
the Quintessons and live like a king?</i>

1251
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,291
<i>I'm working my miners as hard as I can.</i>

1252
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:45,253
<i>I swear I will get you the rest!</i>

1253
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:47,421
<i>I'm working my miners as hard as I can.</i>

1254
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:50,216
<i>I swear! Will get you the rest!</i>

1255
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,593
<i>I'm working my miners
as hard as I can, I swear...</i>

1256
01:22:52,677 --> 01:22:54,220
Liar!

1257
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,891
We trusted you!

1258
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,601
Traitor!

1259
01:23:00,685 --> 01:23:02,687
Pax, we did it.

1260
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:15,449
D!

1261
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:44,395
D-16.

1262
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:47,690
We can lead Cybertron together!

1263
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,066
Don't do this!

1264
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:56,490
What are you doing?

1265
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:58,117
It's over, D.

1266
01:23:58,201 --> 01:24:00,286
Everyone in lacon knows the truth.

1267
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:01,954
So do I!

1268
01:24:02,038 --> 01:24:05,124
He took everything from us!
I have to do this!

1269
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:06,792
No, you don't.

1270
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:10,504
Rebuilding lacon
cannot begin with an execution.

1271
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:13,049
He deserves to die! Can't you see that?

1272
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:16,052
We're better than this.
Don't be like Sentinel.

1273
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:19,555
Pax,

1274
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:23,768
you need to move out of my way
before I move you myself.

1275
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,978
D, listen...

1276
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:35,363
Stop!

1277
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,334
No!

1278
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,419
No, no, no, no. Why?

1279
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:53,839
Why did you do that? Why?

1280
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:05,977
D, no.

1281
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:13,526
I'm done saving you.

1282
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:56,420
The Age of Primes has ended!

1283
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:58,798
No more false prophets!

1284
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:03,094
Follow me and you will
never again be deceived.

1285
01:27:03,928 --> 01:27:06,430
Rise up!

1286
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:08,474
Rise up! Rise up!

1287
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:11,685
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!

1288
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:14,063
<i>Orion Pax,</i>

1289
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:17,191
<i>your noble sacrifice for the greater good</i>

1290
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:21,237
<i>has proven you worthy
in the eyes of Primus.</i>

1291
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:24,490
<i>He entrusts in you</i>

1292
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:27,410
the future of Cybertron

1293
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:33,040
and the Matrix of Leadership!

1294
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:37,670
I will lead us all into the future!

1295
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:55,729
I

1296
01:27:56,564 --> 01:27:57,565
Am...

1297
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:00,276
Megatron!

1298
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:02,945
<i>Arise...</i>

1299
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:06,031
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

1300
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:10,911
Burn it down!

1301
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,913
All of it!

1302
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:21,505
All hail Megatron!

1303
01:28:23,424 --> 01:28:25,885
- He's gonna kill everyone.
- We have to stop him. Come on.

1304
01:28:27,428 --> 01:28:28,721
Stop! It's over.

1305
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:32,892
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

1306
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:07,801
Impossible.

1307
01:29:10,513 --> 01:29:14,350
Primus gave you the Matrix.

1308
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:16,560
We could've built the future together.

1309
01:29:16,644 --> 01:29:18,562
I'll build it myself.

1310
01:29:18,646 --> 01:29:22,191
After I tear down everyone in my way!

1311
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:04,817
Ah!

1312
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:10,132
We were given the power
to change our world

1313
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:12,635
and you chose to destroy it.

1314
01:31:12,718 --> 01:31:13,886
Just like Sentinel.

1315
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:17,973
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

1316
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:22,436
And you betrayed me.

1317
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:34,573
Go.

1318
01:31:35,491 --> 01:31:38,118
Take the High Guard and leave.

1319
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:42,956
You are banished from lacon.

1320
01:31:47,878 --> 01:31:50,172
It didn't have to end this way.

1321
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:55,969
This isn't over, Prime.

1322
01:32:03,352 --> 01:32:05,896
High Guard, follow me!

1323
01:32:19,535 --> 01:32:22,037
<i>The line
between friend and enemy</i>

1324
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:25,207
<i>is not as clear as I once believed.</i>

1325
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:29,128
<i>Once it's crossed, there's no going back.</i>

1326
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:33,173
<i>Because some transformations
are permanent.</i>

1327
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:35,050
Hey, Megatronus Prime. Nice.

1328
01:32:35,134 --> 01:32:37,219
Oh, yeah. Well, he's my hero.

1329
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,054
The greatest Prime to ever live.

1330
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:43,559
- I'm D-16.
- Orion Pax.

1331
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:45,936
You ever mine Energon before?

1332
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:47,354
No. You?

1333
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:49,565
No. I hear it's dangerous.

1334
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:51,483
Well, I'll tell you what.

1335
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:54,194
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

1336
01:32:54,278 --> 01:32:55,404
All right.

1337
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:58,240
Thanks, Pax.

1338
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,589
A new beginning for Cybertron.

1339
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:15,674
And a new leader.

1340
01:33:15,758 --> 01:33:17,426
Yes, about that.

1341
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:22,681
I could use some help from a bot who is
better than me in every way.

1342
01:33:22,765 --> 01:33:24,641
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1343
01:33:24,725 --> 01:33:27,060
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1344
01:33:27,144 --> 01:33:30,063
Well, Captain, I do owe you a promotion.

1345
01:33:30,147 --> 01:33:32,816
How's Major Elita sound?

1346
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:35,402
How about Commander?

1347
01:33:35,486 --> 01:33:37,154
Even better.

1348
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:41,325
And I'm sorry, B, but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

1349
01:33:41,408 --> 01:33:43,160
I may be a Prime now,

1350
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:44,912
but I'm gonna need you by my side.

1351
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:48,415
Are you serious?
This is the greatest day of my life.

1352
01:33:48,499 --> 01:33:50,626
I get to work for the government.

1353
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:54,254
Okay. So that's new.

1354
01:33:54,338 --> 01:33:55,923
I'm sorry, what is happening?

1355
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:30,082
<i>And now we stand here together as one</i>

1356
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:35,629
<i>proving we all have
the power to transform,</i>

1357
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:38,882
<i>to become who we were destined to be,</i>

1358
01:34:38,966 --> 01:34:43,554
<i>to right wrongs, to make our world better.</i>

1359
01:34:43,637 --> 01:34:46,723
<i>Because here, freedom and autonomy</i>

1360
01:34:46,807 --> 01:34:49,518
<i>are the rights of all sentient beings.</i>

1361
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:55,065
<i>Here, all are truly Autobots.</i>

1362
01:34:56,567 --> 01:35:00,112
<i>This message is a warning
to all Quintessons.</i>

1363
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:05,534
<i>If you dare return to Cybertron,
the Autobots will be waiting.</i>

1364
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:08,453
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

1365
01:35:08,537 --> 01:35:12,291
<i>I am Optimus Prime.</i>

1366
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:42,654
Hey, guys! Great news, the Energon's back!

1367
01:35:42,738 --> 01:35:44,948
And I have a cog and I can transform!

1368
01:35:45,032 --> 01:35:46,867
It's a long story. I'll fill you in later.

1369
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:50,454
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up swords.

1370
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:52,289
Watch this. Sword hands!

1371
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:55,208
No!

1372
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:23,948
<i>Sentinel the betrayer is dead.</i>

1373
01:43:24,032 --> 01:43:27,702
<i>But his death has given life
to a new enemy.</i>

1374
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:29,913
<i>A stronger enemy.</i>

1375
01:43:29,996 --> 01:43:32,040
<i>A personal enemy.</i>

1376
01:43:33,208 --> 01:43:37,337
<i>We will not be blinded by his deception.</i>

1377
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:40,006
<i>We are the ones who are...</i>

1378
01:43:40,882 --> 01:43:42,842
Decepticons!

1379
01:43:42,926 --> 01:43:44,677
Rise up!

1380
01:43:44,761 --> 01:43:48,181
Rise up! Rise up!

1381
01:43:59,818 --> 01:44:00,819
