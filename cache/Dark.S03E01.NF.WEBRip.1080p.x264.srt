<i>If we knew</i>

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,333
<i>how things would end...</i>

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,958
<i>where our journey would take us...</i>

5
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:37,458
<i>would we still make the same decisions?</i>

6
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,916
<i>Or would we choose a different path?</i>

7
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,625
<i>Could we even escape our fate?</i>

8
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:58,000
<i>Or would what is deep within us</i>

9
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,541
<i>lead us to the same end,</i>

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,083
<i>like an invisible hand?</i>

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,458
<i>Does it matter which path we choose</i>

12
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,541
<i>if we end up</i>

13
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,708
<i>facing ourselves again and again?</i>

14
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,875
Wait. Martha, that's not possible, I...

15
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,166
-I don't understand.
-We don't have time.

16
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,083
What time are you from?

17
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,875
The question isn't from what time,

18
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,500
but from what world.

19
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,791
How did we get here?

20
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,791
I asked how we got here!

21
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,916
You're not Martha.

22
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,583
Who are you?

23
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,666
Today's the day it all began.

24
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,250
The day we first met.

25
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,500
What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,333
That you and I...

27
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,666
your world and my world...

28
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,583
form a knot
that is inextricably intertwined.

29
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,958
Your world?

30
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,291
What do you mean, your world?

31
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,208
I'll make it right.

32
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,416
-I promise.
-Wait! Where are you going?

33
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,250
Why am I here?

00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:30,000
NOVEMBER 4, 2019

35
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,458
Mikkel, put that away.

36
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,958
-Morning.
-No wonder you can't sleep at night.

37
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,250
What's up with him?

38
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,250
The same nightmare he always has.

39
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,250
Mikkel, that's enough.

40
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,250
Maybe it wasn't a dream.

41
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,166
But the here and now is one.
And none of us are real.

42
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,166
Ever thought about that?

43
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:34,541
Ha-ha! Very funny.

44
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,750
Oh, the damn electricity!

45
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:43,291
Pass the butter.

46
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,208
Come on, Mikkel. Go get ready now.

47
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,333
The bowl!

48
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,000
Is Magnus up yet?

49
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,500
-Martha, is Magnus up yet?
-No idea.

50
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,333
-Are you nuts?
-I just wanted to see if you were real.

51
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,833
Magnus!

52
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,791
Magnus!

53
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,291
You're going to be late!

54
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,625
Hello!

55
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,583
Magnus, either you get down here
or I'm coming up!

56
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,083
I'll be down in a sec.

57
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,416
-Asshole!
-Race you to school. Morning, Mom.

58
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,833
-Idiot.
-Morning.

59
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,041
Shall I give you a ride?

60
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,458
It's supposed to rain later.

61
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,416
No, I'll be home late today.
Play rehearsal.

62
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,291
Don't forget, starting tomorrow
you guys are at your father's place.

63
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,500
Man, Mom, that sucks.

64
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,041
Good morning, sleepy head.

65
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,875
I was awake half the night again.

66
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,958
Why did it take so long?

67
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,333
First day back at school.
Long line at the baker's.

68
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,458
The apocalypse is coming.

69
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,458
Stay awhile.

70
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,208
I'm running late.

71
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,625
I'll see you this evening, okay?

72
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,958
Ulrich?

73
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,875
I love you.

74
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,125

I win.

78
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,875
Welcome back to hell.

79
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,875
Just because you're too pea-brained to see
education is the only way out of this dump

80
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,541
doesn't mean we all share
your retarded opinion.

81
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,500
-Don't forget to breathe.
-Don't forget to think.

82
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,291
-Hey.
-Hey.

83
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,958
-Have you seen Kilian?
-Nope.

84
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,666
Why all the effort?

85
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,291
We all die in the end.

86
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,375
Are you sure you're not adopted?

87
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:02,500
Are you sure you don't have a stick
up your ass that needs surgical removal?

88
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,208
-Dumbass!
-Dumbass yourself!

89
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,333
-Hey, Martha.
-Kilian.

90
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,916
Is there any news about Erik?

91
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,750
No.

92
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,458
It's all pretty creepy.

93
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,916
<i>Good morning.</i>

94
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,458
<i>We request all grades to gather in the gym</i>
<i>for first-period assembly.</i>

95
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,041
It'll be about your brother.

96
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,375
It's been two weeks already.
He's never been away this long.

97
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,083
He'd always send me a message

98
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,208
whenever he couldn't stand it
at home anymore.

99
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,916
But this time, nothing.

100
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,416

He hasn't said anything else all morning.

-It will happen again.
-How'd it go at the doctor's?

112
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,125
It will happen again.

113
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,916
Fine. Just a check-up.

114
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,583

<i>Erik Obendorf</i>
<i>has been missing since October 22.</i>

125
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,291
That's almost two weeks now.
No traces, no witnesses.

126
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:49,083
Questioning the neighbors didn't bring
any new evidence to light either.

127
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,708
So, do you have any ideas?

128
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,916
We still haven't got the shift schedules
from the nuclear power plant.

129
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,500
All right, then follow up on that.
Go see Tiedemann.

130
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,416
-WÃ¶ller, look into the tire treads.
-Yes.

131
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,666
-Jankowski, talk to the Obendorfs again.
-Okay.

132
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,500
Maybe he just took off.

133
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,291
It wouldn't be the first time.

134
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,958
<i>Well, a black hole...</i>

135
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,750
<i>forms when a central region collapses in</i>
<i>upon itself.</i>

136
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,833
And it contains neutrons.

137
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,750
WORMHOLE

138
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,125
Well, more like neutron matter.

139
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,083
But not enough of it.

140
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,958
So when the light of a star
three times the mass of the sun goes out,

141
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,416
then it explodes.

142
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,416
No, it implodes.

143
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,625
And that is a black hole.

144
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,333
And...

145
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,291
Can I help you?

146
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,416
Hello?

147
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,875
Are you new?

148
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,416
I'm Jonas.

149
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,125
Are you sure this is your class?

150
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,666
I wasn't notified of any new students.

151
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,625
A signature was missing.

152
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,250
Okay.

153
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
Bartosz, please continue.

154
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,291
Mm-hmm.

155
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,166
So then we have a black hole.

156
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,791
And it has a huge gravitational pull.

157
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:40,875
Everything flying around the hole
is drawn to it and somehow dragged inside.

158
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,291
Other stars, planets, and even light.

159
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:50,375
The gravitational force is so strong,
that even light is pulled into it.

160
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,416
Nothing can escape once it's inside.

161
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,208
Basically, no one knows what's behind it.

162
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,708
Maybe nothing. Or maybe a new world.

163
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,833
A world in which nothing is
as it is in ours.

164
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:11,708
All I'm asking is to review
your employees' shift schedules.

165
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,375
Erik was last seen on the forest road.

166
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,416
The schedules

167
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,291
will allow us to check employee vehicles
with the tire treads we found.

168
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,916
Do you have a court order?

169
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,375
This is a request.

170
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,083
Not an order.

171
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,791
I'll have someone search them out.

172
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,625
How are you?

173
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:54,750
Holding up.

174
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,541
Okay, then.

175
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,250
I was wondering...

176
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,166
Do you think Erik could have made his way
onto the grounds?

177
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,208
The caves are partly located
under the nuclear power plant.

178
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:17,916
That's impossible.

179
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,750
The access points
were sealed up years ago.

180
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,208
No one can get in that way.

181
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,708
Okay, then.

182
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,375
<i>A quick reminder</i>
<i>that all afternoon activities</i>

183
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,708
<i>after four o'clock are canceled</i>
<i>due to the parents' meeting.</i>

184
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,041
<i>Except theater,</i>
<i>which will go on as planned</i>

185
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,458
<i>but vacate the auditorium an hour earlier.</i>

186
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,541
<i>The school newspaper</i>
<i>will meet in the youth cafÃ© today</i>

187
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,500
<i>under the supervision of Mr. Hopf.</i>

188
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:10,750
Katharina.

189
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,958
What are you doing here?

190
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,125
-I wanted to see you.
-Uh-huh.

191
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,541
I don't know...

192
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,291
I know you andÂ Ulrich...

193
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,750
Ulrich and the kids...
I know they're part of him.

194
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,208
And I want you to know
I won't stand in the way of that.

195
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,500
That's very generous of you.

196
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,500
Did Ulrich stop
at your place this morning?

197
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,916
He wanted to bring something by.

198
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,625
Bring what by?

199
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,125
I don't know.

200
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,583
Something for school. For the kids.

201
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:12,416
No.

202
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,666
Then maybe he forgot.

203
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,958
Please don't forget to turn in
your presentations next week.

204
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,666
No exceptions!

205
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,916
Something up?

206
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,416
You didn't tell me why I'm here.

207
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,416
Do we know each other?

208
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,041
You have no idea who I am.

209
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:14,791
You coming?

210
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,333
ARIADNE
A PLAY

211
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,166
Jonas, right?

212
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,625
Everything okay?

213
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,625
What day is it today?

214
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,083
November 4.

215
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,083
What year?

216
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,416
2019.

217
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,750
I don't understand...

218
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,708
Mom?

219
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:18,750
Pardon?

220
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,458
Are you okay?

221
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,500
Can I help you?

222
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,750
POLICE

223
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,791
Charlotte?

224
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,458
We have to stop this.

225
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,541
That's not what
you were saying this morning.

226
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,333
Ulrich, not here.

227
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,375
Oh... I'm sorry.

228
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,291
What is it?

229
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,583
Um... the...

230
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,083
The tire treads.

231
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,125
Forty-seven cars and two trucks.

232
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,458
In Winden alone
there are 21,000 registered vehicles.

233
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,916
Yes. What do you want me to do with that?

234
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,166
I...

235
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:01,416
No idea.

236
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,375
I got the power plant shift schedules.
We can run a check.

237
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,041
WÃ¶ller.

238
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,791
<i>From then on, I knew that nothing changes.</i>

239
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,500
<i>That all things remain.</i>

240
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,750
The spinning wheel turns.

241
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,208
Round and round, in a circle.

242
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:32,541
One fate tied to the next.

243
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,541
A thread,

244
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,666
red like blood,

245
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,083
that connects all our deeds.

246
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,000
One cannot unravel the knots.

247
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,208
But they can be severed.

248
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,375
He severed ours

249
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,291
with the sharpest blade.

250
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,125
And yet, something remains behind
that cannot be severed.

251
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,375
An invisible bond.

252
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,750
On many a night, he tugs at it.

253
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:05,208
And then I wake with a start,
knowing that nothing ceases to be.

254
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:06,833
That all remains.

255
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,166
And because
their eyes and hearts were blind,

256
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:20,375
they were punished for their sins.
Here and now.

257
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,416
And what flew plummeted to Earth.

258
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,875
And what was on Earth changed its shape.

259
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:27,041
Revealed its grotesque face,

260
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,041
which was nothing
but blasphemy made flesh.

261
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,416
Great. We'll stop here.

262
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,083
Unfortunately,
we have to finish early today.

263
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:45,541
Please put everything away
for the parents' meeting tonight. Thanks.

264
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:51,083
Nine o'clock tonight by the bridge.
Don't forget.

265
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,583
Martha.

266
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:09,916
I have no idea what you want from me,
but I want nothing from you, okay?

267
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,791
So get lost.

268
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,916
Please listen to me.
Maybe you don't know who I am.

269
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,750
-But today is November 4, and Mikkel--
-What? Mikkel?

270
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,208
Michael Kahnwald, Hannah's husband.
He's not who you think--

271
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,958
Hannah's husband? Are you joking?

272
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,958
I don't know any Michael Kahnwald.

273
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,125
Hannah's husband is my dad
and his name is Ulrich.

274
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,666
I don't know what your deal is,
but just fuck off already, okay?

275
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,958
Wait. Not so fast.

276
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:51,541
I...

277
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,458
love you.

278
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,833
I love you.

279
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,916
It will happen again.

280
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,958
It will...

281
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,375
happen again.

282
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,375
It will happen again.

283
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,166
Mom?

284
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,750
Dad?

285
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,666
It will happen again.

286
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,541
It will...

287
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,333
happen again.

288
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,666
Tick, tock.

289
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,291
Tick, tock.

290
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,666
-Grandpa, is everything okay?
-Tick, tock.

291
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,291
Tick, tock.

292
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,500
The beginning is the end.

293
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,750
And the end is the beginning.

294
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,541
Tick, tock.

295
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,583
Tick, tock.

296
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:32,333
REGINA TIEDEMANN
AUGUST 1, 1971 - SEPTEMBER 2, 2019

297
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,166
Can I help you?

298
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,958
Are you looking for
something in particular?

299
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,416
I wanted to know
if someone was buried here.

300
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,041
Who?

301
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,625
Kahnwald,

302
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,083
Michael Kahnwald.

303
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,125
No, we have a Daniel Kahnwald,
died in '64,

304
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,458
but no Michael Kahnwald.

305
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,166
Maybe that's why I'm here.

306
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,000
So that it doesn't happen.

307
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,750
What happens?

308
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,625
Do I know you?

309
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,625
I feel like
I've seen you somewhere before.

310
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:46,625
Hey, wait!

311
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,291
What's your name?

312
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:20,291
SEPTEMBER 21, 1987

313
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,416
Hello?

314
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:49,166
Can I help you? You must be lost.

315
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,208
The master key.

316
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,916
For the nuclear power plant.

317
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,500
Is this a joke?

318
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,666
You kept it.

319
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,833
Do you think this is funny?

320
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,416
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

321
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:00,000
<i>Police--</i>

322
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,750
What do you want from me?

323
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,041
Nothing is in vain.

324
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,333
No breath.

325
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,750
No step.

326
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,083
No word.

327
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,250
No pain.

328
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,791
An everlasting miracle...

329
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,791
of the One.

330
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,166
Who the hell are you?

331
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,041
The police were here today.

332
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,708
You know what you've got to do.

333
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:02,958
Kilian?

334
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,958
Stop screwing around, okay?

335
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,250
What is this?

336
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,000
What do you want here?

337
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,333
I don't want to scare you.

338
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,541
-Why did you say we know each other?
-We do know each other.

339
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,000
Not now, but in another time.

340
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:40,625
What does that mean?

341
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,625
You've seen all this before.

342
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:00,666
The light.

343
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,000
The forest. Me.

344
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:09,750
It's dÃ©jÃ  vu.

345
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:13,041
Or a glitch in the matrix.

346
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,291
What?

347
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,458
I think I know why I'm here now.

348
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,500
Why you came to get me.

349
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,291
So that I change it.

350
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,166
Change what?

351
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,166
Who is he?

352
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,833
-Where's Mikkel?
-Mikkel?

353
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,958
Mikkel isn't with you?

354
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,500
Are you blind or what?

355
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,125
What's he doing here?

356
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,791
Did you bring him along?

357
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:56,291
What is this?

358
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,791
-How do you know my brother?
-This can't be.

359
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:04,125
You took him with you.
Heide, the babysitter, is sick.

360
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,083
And he didn't want to stay home alone,
so he came along.

361
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,541
No idea what the fuck this is,

362
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,291
but Mikkel is old enough
to look after himself.

363
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,666
Now, you'd better fuck off.

364
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,000
Get lost, freak.

365
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,291
Come on.

366
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,666
Martha.

367
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,916
POLICE

368
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:55,750
Charlotte?
I'm going to the parents' meeting.

369
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,000
I can give you a ride if you like.

370
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:01,541
All right.

371
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,833
-Will you carry on with this?
-Mm-hmm.

372
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,875
Why did he act like he knew you?

373
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,625
-Do you know him?
-No.

374
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,125
Who knows.

375
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,041
Did you know Nostradamus predicted
the world would end this year?

376
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,083
What a load of crap.

377
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,916
No. Really.

378
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,583
The apocalypse
is practically around the corner.

379
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,791
Glad I got myself a girlfriend
with her own bunker.

380
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,125
What?

381
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:24,708
Nothing.

382
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:25,916
Ow!

383
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,041
What?

384
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:08,416
And you think you'll find something here?

385
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,041
Erik sometimes spent nights here
in summer.

386
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,416
Maybe the police overlooked something.

387
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,541
Have you heard the story
of the cave monster?

388
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:24,708
-Spare us the bullshit, man.
-It's not bullshit.

389
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,208
Some 100 years ago,

390
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:30,500
just after World War I,
they did experiments in there.

391
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,083
What kind of experiments?

392
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,333
-What was that?
-What?

393
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,458
Shit.

394
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,291
What's in the cave?

395
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,583
-What is it?
-Oh, shit!

396
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,416
-Fuck!
-What is that?

397
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,500
-Fuck! What's going on?
-Go! Run!

398
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,208
-What's with the flashlights?
-Go!

399
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,625
-Out of here! Out of here!
-Martha!

400
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,166
-Martha, come on.
-Out of here!

401
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,375
Run! Run!

402
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,000
Kilian?

403
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:22,541
Kilian?

404
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,416
Martha.

405
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:30,583
-Is it over?
-I think so.

406
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,916
What...

407
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,166
What... What is that?

408
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,791
Oh, God!

409
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,458
Fuck!

410
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,125
Shit!

411
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:50,250
Oh, shit. Shit!

412
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,583
Fuck.

413
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:58,541
-Is he dead?
-Fuck.

414
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,625
Yes, I think so.

415
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:03,375
Who... Who is that?

416
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,166
STUDENT CARD
MADS NIELSEN, DECEMBER 4, 1973

417
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:15,375
Mads Nielsen.

418
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:56,291
I've waited for this moment for so long.

419
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,583
For you to come back.

420
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,208
Who are you?

421
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:17,625
Mikkel.

422
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,708
He didn't travel back.

423
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,666
He won't become your father.

424
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,583
And you...

425
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,666
will never be born in this world.

426
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:31,416
A world without you.

427
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:34,916
Isn't that what you wanted?

428
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:39,583
Yet, despite that,

429
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:44,416
this world is doomed
to the same fate as yours.

430
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,125
Everything will fall apart.

431
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,583
In this world, just as it will in yours.

432
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:54,250
Again.

433
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,666
And again.

434
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:58,791
Because of you.

435
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,208
And because of me.

436
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,875
Martha.

437
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:50,000
SEPTEMBER 21, 1888

438
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:27,958
Jonas?

439
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:17,875
You're alive.

440
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:23,625
You're alive!

441
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,916
I'm not Martha.

442
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:45,750
Not your Martha.

443
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,250
What does that mean?

444
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:03,458
I'm here to help you find the origin.

445
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,125
The one thing...

446
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,666
that's the beginning of everything.

447
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:13,458
In your world...

448
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,375
and in mine.

449
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:17,208
