1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,040
<i>Thousands will be infected
with the virus.</i>

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,360
The G.C.P.D. are scrambling
to recover the antidote.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,880
They are missing
one very important element.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,800
I told you I would help you
find your darkness.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Take the virus.
It'll show you who you really are.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,320
You're still Ed Nygma,
the Ed Nygma I made.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,080
<i>I'm the Riddler.</i>

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,680
<i>I became him when I killed you.</i>

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,000
No one wants Nygma dead
more than me.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,240
But I can't betray Barbara.

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,440
She's always got
your best interest at heart.

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,320
I don't know what you want from me.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,280
The one I serve believes
you have a great destiny.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,480
I am Ra's al Ghul.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,280
But I need to know if you're ready.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,040
Join me.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
Join me.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
Alfred.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,360
Alfred! Alfred!

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,520
Alfred!

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,720
You've broken through

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,080
- your conditioning.
- No!

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,600
Impressive.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,560
You don't control me anymore!

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,920
- I will never be your heir.
- On the contrary.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,920
Your strength only confirms
what the prophesy has foretold.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,440
An heir to serve
as my knight in the darkness.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,760
I will never follow you!

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,640
You made me kill, Alfred.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,880
Use the waters, Bruce.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,760
- Our time will come.
- No!

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,080
- Bruce.
- Alfred. Alfred.

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,800
<i>A citywide lockdown
continues to remain in effect</i>

35
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,600
<i>with Gotham officials urging people
to stay inside their homes</i>

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
{\an5}<i>as thousands of infected citizens</i>

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
{\an5}<i>continue their rampage through
the city.</i>

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,280
{\an5}<i>Local law enforcement...</i>

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
{\an5}Lee?

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,200
{\an5}Where are you?

41
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,520
{\an5}Why? You miss me?

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
{\an5}The city's not safe.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,040
{\an5}That's why I'm packing a bag.

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
{\an5}<i>What are you talking about?</i>

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,440
{\an5}I'm leaving Gotham
and I want you to come with me.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,480
{\an5}I'll take your silence as a "yes"?

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,720
{\an5}Lee, you can't leave. There are
checkpoints all over the city.

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,160
{\an5}Who are you trying to convince, Jim?

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,160
{\an5}I can hear it in your voice.
You want this as much as I do.

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,520
{\an5}<i>We can finally be together
without judgment</i>

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,560
{\an5}or secrets or jealousy.

52
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,640
{\an5}<i>After everything
we've been through...</i>

53
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
{\an5}Don't we deserve that?

54
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,600
{\an5}I am leaving on
the afternoon train,

55
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,360
{\an5}and I want you with me.

56
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,960
But I want the real you.

57
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,000
{\an5}<i>So tell me you'll stop fighting it.</i>

58
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,760
{\an5}<i>Tell me I won't lose you again.</i>

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,000
Tell me you'll be there.

60
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,640
{\an5}I'll be there.

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
Hey, Jim.

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,360
Where are we with Tetch?

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,920
Barbara and Nygma gave
the mayor's office

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,320
a list of demands.
A friend snuck me a copy.

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,680
They also threatened
to kill Tetch

66
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,120
if we tried to take
him back by force.

67
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,120
Half of these would bankrupt
the city.

68
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,520
The alternative being there's
no city left to bankrupt.

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,200
We don't have
any cards to play, partner.

70
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
We got no moves.

71
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Yes, we do.

72
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,520
Him.

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
- Penguin?
- This entire list

74
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,760
is Barbara's except for him.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
Penguin is the only
thing Nygma cares about.

76
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,480
- The question is, how much?
- No way.

77
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,040
There is no way
we're turning him over.

78
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
- Why not?
- Because we don't have the authority

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
to broker some kind of secret
deal behind the city's back

80
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,360
much less one that leads to the
imminent death of its former mayor.

81
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,680
Nygma would betray Barbara

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,040
and hand over Tetch if given half
the chance.

83
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,680
I need to save Lee.

84
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,480
I don't have much time, Harvey.

85
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,800
It's now, or never.

86
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,240
You know, one of these days,
I'm gonna say never.

87
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,520
- Hello?
<i>- Nygma, it's Gordon.</i>

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,880
<i>I'm calling with a proposition.
Can you talk?</i>

89
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,440
I can listen.

90
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,240
We need to kill her.

91
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,840
How much longer
are we gonna wait?

92
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,880
Come on.

93
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,440
Nygma chopped off your hand.

94
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,800
He almost killed me,
and now, Barbara's partners with him?

95
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,520
That's the mother of all insults.

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,760
This city is gonna pay us
a lot of money to get Tetch back.

97
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,200
We need to let that play out
before we do anything rash.

98
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,840
I know you two were close...

99
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,400
But whatever you had,
she treats you like dirt now.

100
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,480
She treats us both like dirt
and you know it.

101
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
She doesn't deserve your loyalty.

102
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,880
What are you two whispering about?

103
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
Nothing.

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,840
- Any word from city hall?
- Trust me,

105
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,520
we're about to own this town.

106
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,440
Parts of it, quite literally.

107
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Where's Ed?

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
He was just here a minute ago.

109
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Tetch?

110
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,880
Nygma!

111
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,440
How could you let this happen?

112
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,640
Us? You're the one that trusted him.

113
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
I asked you to do one thing!

114
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,360
Watch a man tied to a chair!

115
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,760
You idiots can't even do that!

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,720
- Where are we going?
- Shut up.

117
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,200
Look, I'm not trying
to aggravate you.

118
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,840
It's just, this doesn't exactly have
an above the board feeling about it.

119
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,960
- What's going on?
- Barbara and Nygma have Tetch.

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,400
-They're ransoming the city.
- So, what does that

121
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,640
have to do with me?

122
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
You're handing me over to him.

123
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,640
You can't. You can't.
You cannot do this.

124
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
It's a small price to pay for saving

125
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,520
- the city.
- Yeah, for you.

126
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,320
For me, it's a very large price.

127
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,360
Look, he cannot be trusted.

128
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,880
You're risking everything
based on the word of a sociopath.

129
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,520
Yeah, yeah, get in the car.

130
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,240
What? It's gonna be fine.

131
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,480
Yeah, Penguin, Nygma, Tetch
all in the same place

132
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,400
For a high stakes hostage swap,
what could possibly go wrong?

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,440
Do you mind?

134
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,800
Look, if I'm gonna be
this city's sacrificial lamb

135
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,120
the least you could do
is lead me to

136
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,800
the slaughter with a little dignity.

137
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
No.

138
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,880
You don't think that I can cause you
trouble once we're inside?

139
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,920
- You do, and I'll kill you.
- No, you won't.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,800
Not before you have Tetch. Not before

141
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
the exchange goes smoothly.

142
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,280
And after that,
what do you care what happens?

143
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
Let's just get this over with.

144
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,040
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

145
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,400
My three favorite men.

146
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,840
Don't feel bad, Oswald.

147
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,080
Your death at my hands

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,280
Was inevitable.

149
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Is that what
you told yourself last time?

150
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,120
I'm assuming the grenade's
not a fashion statement.

151
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
Precaution.

152
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,440
You three try anything,

153
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,880
I pull the pin.

154
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,400
No more Tetch.

155
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,920
No hope for an antidote.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
- Little crude, don't you think?
- Enough! Let's get this done.

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,440
You're infected.

158
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,920
Oh, how wonderful.

159
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Nygma!

160
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,880
Did you really think
you could get away with this?

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,440
I knew you'd figure out
that this is about Oswald.

162
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,840
How'd you figure out where we are?

163
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,280
Please. You know how many cops
I got on the payroll?

164
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,240
Oh, baby, you might wanna use
your inside growl

165
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,840
whilst making secret calls
inside the G.C.P.D.

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,080
Now, hand him over.

167
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,280
Go!

168
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,520
Let him go!
Let him go!

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,360
We need to get Tetch!

170
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Now!

171
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,760
That little bastard!

172
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,200
Coming through. Move out of
the way. Rita, move.

173
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,920
All right, let's have a look.

174
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,440
What did you do to cauterize this?

175
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't know.

176
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,560
- Is he going to be okay?
- We'll do everything we can.

177
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,240
What's your relationship
to the patient?

178
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,160
Doc, BP's falling.

179
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
We're family.

180
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,520
All right, let's get him typed,
cross set and prepped for OR.

181
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,360
It looks pretty good.
I'll call the station.

182
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,040
Grab Tetch!

183
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Split up.

184
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,880
Jim.

185
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,360
Jim.

186
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,120
You and the ex are infected?

187
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,400
I've heard Lee wants to remove
my pretty little head from my body.

188
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,720
Is it weird that kind
of makes me like her?

189
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,400
You thinking about ripping
anyone's head off, Jim?

190
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,200
I bet you are.

191
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
You're so close.

192
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
The next time you give in,
the virus will have you.

193
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,120
- Stop talking.
- Jim!

194
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,520
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

195
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Hey.

196
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
There's no back door into
a loading dock.

197
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,800
No way this ends well.
The virus will give you all

198
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,080
the strength you need.

199
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,240
It's the only option.
Give in to the darkness.

200
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,320
I said stop talking.

201
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,600
You want to kill me,
that I can see.

202
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,640
But without my blood,
no antidote will there be.

203
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,160
- Fight it, Jim.
- I don't know if I can.

204
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,600
He's right. We need him.

205
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,880
Yeah, but not all of him.

206
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,240
Where are they?

207
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,920
What happened?

208
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,960
What'd he do?

209
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,120
Oh, Jim.

210
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,880
You sick bastard.

211
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,920
Where's the lab tech?

212
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,760
Where's the lab tech?

213
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,520
Come on. Come on. Here. Here.

214
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,960
What? You've never seen a Mason jar
filled with blood before? Go!

215
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
Back to work!

216
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,840
You okay?

217
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,200
He's awake.

218
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,280
- I was getting lonely.
- Where are we?

219
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,560
Well, we ran into a police blockade.

220
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,560
Had to hunker down a minute.

221
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
Where are you taking me?

222
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know.
I'm sort of improvising here.

223
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Why? You have some place
you have to be?

224
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,400
Does it matter?

225
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,040
I imagine you're planning on
dragging this out.

226
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,000
There are so few moments
of pure joy in one's life

227
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,040
I feel compelled to savor this one.

228
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,960
You mean gloat?

229
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,080
Yes, I do.

230
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,520
It was always one of your least
attractive qualities, Oswald.

231
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,400
- It's killing you, isn't it?
- What?

232
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,280
To know that you are not as
smart as you think you are.

233
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,680
All of that planning to drive me
crazy strip me of everything I had

234
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,080
revealing yourself with a "Ta-da!"
and then shooting me by the river.

235
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,520
That plan was perfect

236
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,920
and you know it.

237
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,440
You failed.

238
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,880
I am still alive
and you are handcuffed

239
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,000
in the back seat.

240
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,560
And now, you will never be able
to correct your mistake.

241
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,400
I guess not.

242
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,880
Now, that they have Tetch's blood,

243
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,800
they can make the antidote.
And after what we tried to pull

244
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,320
the whole city's gonna be
gunning for us.

245
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,600
Hell, I'm surprised the cops haven't
busted down our door already.

246
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,440
Relax. They've got better
things to do.

247
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,880
What are we supposed to do now?

248
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,080
We split up, go to the safe house,
and regroup.

249
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,280
Regroup? For what?

250
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,280
For whatever
the hell I tell you to do.

251
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,080
I'm not waiting anymore.

252
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,800
She's broken every promise
she's ever made to you.

253
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,160
- To us.
- I know.

254
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,040
Safe house is
the perfect place to do it.

255
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Okay.

256
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
- I'll take care of everything.
- No.

257
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,280
We do it together.

258
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Yeah.

259
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,080
Kowalski and Burrows
are gonna be pissed.

260
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,440
Tetch's blood is good.

261
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,240
The lab guys are starting work
on an antidote as we speak.

262
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,960
I need to get to Lee.
How long?

263
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,440
- How long before it's ready?
- They said we could head there now.

264
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Where is it?

265
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,440
Detective Gordon, just in time.

266
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,320
If you'll take a seat
and roll up your sleeve.

267
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
We have a dose
ready for you right now.

268
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,760
The others will be ready shortly.

269
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,600
I need two.

270
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Sorry. We could only make
one of these single shots so quickly.

271
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,880
No! Two.

272
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,080
All of Tetch's blood
is in the centrifuge machines.

273
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,280
The process can't be interrupted.

274
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,480
Just one or two hours max.

275
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,960
You can still catch Lee
before she leaves.

276
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,120
There's not enough time.

277
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,120
Jim. Jim. Jim.

278
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,560
Don't make me...
Jim! No!

279
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,760
Jim! Jim!

280
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,480
Someone call the bullpen.

281
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Bruce?

282
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,120
I heard about Alfred.

283
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,880
Is he gonna be okay?

284
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,400
Go home, Selina.

285
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
What happened?

286
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
No.

287
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,600
No, you don't get to do this.

288
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,960
- Do what?
- Walk back into my life.

289
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,480
You think I need your pity?
I don't.

290
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,320
- That's not why I'm here.
- You wanna know what happened?

291
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,800
- You wouldn't understand.
- Why?

292
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,960
Because I'm not desperate

293
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,280
- to believe in something?
- Because you don't believe in anyone

294
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,760
or anything but yourself.

295
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,800
It's called surviving.

296
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,480
And unlike you...

297
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,800
I know who I am.

298
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,720
I don't need anyone to tell me.

299
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,840
What are you even doing here, Selina?

300
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,960
You don't give a damn about Alfred

301
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,480
and you sure as hell
don't care about me.

302
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,080
I know you better than that.

303
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

304
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,720
I thought you did.

305
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,400
Have a nice life.

306
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Lee?

307
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,920
I don't like to be kept waiting.

308
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,000
You're still fighting it.

309
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
I can help you with that.

310
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,320
We both know that's not what I want.

311
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,240
I want you.

312
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,120
I want you and all your darkness.

313
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,680
Give in.

314
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,880
Give in to your darkness. Be free.

315
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,920
Don't you get tired of making
the same mistake over and over?

316
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,280
You think I'm making a mistake?

317
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,440
Instead of killing me
when you had the chance...

318
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,720
You've decided to feed your ego.

319
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,280
You wanna talk ego, Riddler?

320
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,680
You will always fail, Oswald.

321
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,920
Because you will always
let your base emotions drive you.

322
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Hate.

323
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,920
Anger.

324
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Fear.

325
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,520
- Love.
- Shut up.

326
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,920
You wanna know why I could never
love someone like you, Oswald?

327
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,160
- I'm warning you.
- Because you are a spoiled child

328
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,360
who throws a tantrum any time
he doesn't get what he wants.

329
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,080
Especially when what he wants
doesn't want him back.

330
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,600
You're right.
I shouldn't have waited.

331
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,040
But unlike you.

332
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,280
I'm in the position
to rectify my mistake.

333
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,640
Prepare for one massive tantrum.

334
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
No!

335
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,120
That is not possible!

336
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
It is my turn.
It is my turn to kill you!

337
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,120
Like I said...

338
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,640
You will always fail
because you'll never change.

339
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,240
Maybe.

340
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,880
But at least I know who I am.

341
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,840
That day by the edge of the river
that was the moment

342
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,600
you were reborn and that was a lie!

343
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,960
Your entire persona
is based on a lie.

344
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,000
And there is nothing
you can do to change that!

345
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Actually...

346
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,440
Maybe there is.

347
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,640
<i>All travelers must pass through
security checkpoints</i>

348
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,280
<i>before boarding the trains.</i>

349
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
- Sir.
- This way, sir.

350
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,640
<i>Anyone who might be
displaying signs of infection</i>

351
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,840
<i>to the nearest checkpoint
or security officer.</i>

352
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,000
Hey, this isn't a public entrance.

353
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,040
Oh, crap.

354
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,320
Police! Excuse me! Police!

355
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
Move aside! Police! Move! Move!

356
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,680
Get out of my way!

357
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,360
He's trying to stop us.

358
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,080
You can't let him.

359
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,520
I'll see you on the train.

360
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,800
Police! Police! Move!
Out of the way, move!

361
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,080
Jim! Jim!

362
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,400
Now, we're gonna be delayed,
aren't we?

363
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,360
You gonna shoot me, Harvey?

364
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,880
This isn't you.

365
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,720
It is.

366
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,440
Please don't make me do this.

367
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,920
Lee and I belong together.

368
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,000
I know, I know how bad
you want that.

369
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,640
To forget about
everything that happened.

370
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,760
But you can't. It's not real.

371
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,040
This is who I am!

372
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,520
- This is who I've always been.
- No, it's not!

373
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,640
Who you are is a choice.

374
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,400
It always has been. It still is.

375
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
This is who you are.

376
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,040
You're the best cop
I ever worked with.

377
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,400
The best friend I've ever had.

378
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,240
If you love Lee...

379
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,200
Go save her.

380
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,440
Tickets.

381
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Tickets.

382
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,480
To our great adventure.

383
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Tickets.

384
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,160
I love you, Lee.

385
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,640
No! No.

386
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,800
What have you done?

387
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,800
Really? A hacksaw?

388
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,000
Even your disposal tactics
are idiotic.

389
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,040
Guess I'm just old fashioned.

390
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,440
Did you really think
I wouldn't figure it out?

391
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,200
The two of you have been whispering
like teenagers for weeks.

392
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
Oh, Butchie...

393
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,120
You shouldn't have waited.

394
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,080
Oh, believe me,
if it weren't for Tabbie...

395
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,440
You'd have been dead a long time ago.

396
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,680
You're trying to tell me
she had nothing to do with this?

397
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,000
- That's right.
- Oh, so you've just

398
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,760
gone behind her back,
have you?

399
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,640
I was gonna hit you
before we got to the safe house.

400
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,120
Play dumb when you didn't show.

401
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,760
Leaning into your strengths?

402
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,800
Wanna know why you're always
taking shots at me?

403
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,080
The giant size of the target.

404
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,080
It's because
for all your tough talk...

405
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
You miss her.

406
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,000
You miss her loyalty, her strength.

407
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,040
She made you better,
and you know it.

408
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,600
And she sacrificed that for what?

409
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,880
Play queen for a day?

410
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Pathetic.

411
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
If it helps...

412
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,520
You never deserved her
in the first...

413
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,280
I guess we'll see.

414
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,720
I don't know if you can hear me...

415
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,560
But if you can...

416
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,200
Alfred, you need to fight.

417
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,920
I don't know what
I would do without you.

418
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Alfred?

419
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Please.

420
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,360
Please don't leave me.

421
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Here we are...

422
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Again.

423
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,520
I have to tell you...

424
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,160
This feels really great.

425
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,560
Glad I could help.

426
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,840
Any last words?

427
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,560
I'm fine for now.

428
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,720
I beg your pardon?

429
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
I'll wait.

430
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,360
I'm going to kill you, Oswald.

431
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,280
There is no later.
If you have something to say...

432
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,080
Now, is the time.

433
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,400
Duly noted.

434
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,960
Oh, whatever.

435
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,720
I'm not letting you ruin this for me.

436
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,560
You don't have anything to say...

437
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
But I do.

438
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,440
Goodbye, Oswald.

439
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,680
I removed the bullets
when you were knocked out.

440
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
Right before I called them.

441
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,960
In the back seat...

442
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,480
The pin I used
to unlock my cuffs?

443
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,720
My tie pin.

444
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,880
I thought it should be personal.

445
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,880
You were just trying to make me think
I had the upper hand.

446
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,440
It all fell into place.

447
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,840
How did you know that Barbara
would show up at the warehouse?

448
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
I didn't.

449
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,840
If it wasn't for her...

450
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,040
Gordon would have turned me over,
and I'd most likely be dead.

451
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,560
But fortune favors the bold.

452
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,440
You said you called them
after you knocked me out.

453
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,240
You knew that I'd bring you here.

454
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,320
I know you, Ed.

455
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,720
I may be driven by my emotions...

456
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,680
but you're driven by something
much more predictable.

457
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,480
A desperate, compulsive need
to complete

458
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,280
what you've started in
exacting fashion.

459
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,400
Why didn't you just kill me, Oswald?

460
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,920
You were the one time
I'd let love weaken me.

461
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,920
And I want you around
as a constant reminder

462
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,280
to never make that mistake again.

463
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,560
No!

464
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,360
Barbara?

465
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Butch?

466
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Butch?

467
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,200
Was killing Nygma really

468
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,160
that important to you?

469
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,120
Did you kill Butch?

470
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,080
He said you didn't have anything
to do with him trying to kill me.

471
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Is that true?

472
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,240
What does it matter?

473
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,840
All right, for argument's sake...

474
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,160
let's say I haven't been
the best friend.

475
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,400
Do you think we could put this
behind us and move forward?

476
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,760
Did you kill Butch?

477
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,800
That doesn't sound like a "yes."

478
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,280
I need to know.

479
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,040
It's the only way
we'll able to move forward.

480
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Yes.

481
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,520
I killed him.

482
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,040
But it's not like you gave
me a choice.

483
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,600
There's always a choice.

484
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,560
How many times have I told you
not to bring a whip to a gunfight?

485
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,280
Now, we can move forward.

486
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,880
<i>The Tetch antidote
has been released over the city</i>

487
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,280
<i>with a 90 percent cure rate</i>

488
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,640
<i>with individual antidotes
now, being manufactured.</i>

489
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
You're awake!

490
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
God.

491
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,360
I'm sorry, Alfred.

492
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,200
Wasn't your fault, was it?

493
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,040
I completely lost my way.

494
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,080
I've been trying to find
who I am for so long

495
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,040
searching for some greater meaning.

496
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,200
I don't know who I am, Alfred.

497
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,560
Who am I supposed to be?

498
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,760
I can't help you with
that one, mate.

499
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,960
You're a man now.

500
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,360
You gotta find your own path.

501
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,440
I'm not like you.

502
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,000
You've always been
so sure of who you are.

503
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
Oh, I don't know about that.

504
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,400
I've been through some
very dark places...

505
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,160
As have you.

506
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,480
You need to find your true North

507
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,120
and let that guide you.

508
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,680
What's yours?

509
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,880
You.

510
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,000
It's always been you.

511
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,280
You gotta find something
that you really care about

512
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,240
and you protect it at all costs.

513
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,440
And when you find it...

514
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,560
You'll never be lost again.

515
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,560
<i>And while the arrival of the antidote
is certainly welcome news...</i>

516
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,360
<i>The death and the destruction
the virus left in its wake</i>

517
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,960
<i>will no doubt reverberate
through the city for years to come.</i>

518
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,960
Yeah?

519
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Is Barbara around?

520
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
No.

521
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,920
And she's not coming back.

522
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
What do you want?

523
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,960
I'm not sure.

524
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,800
I just know I'm tired
of just surviving.

525
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
I want more.

526
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,240
I wanna move up.

527
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,320
I figured this was
a good place to start.

528
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,840
I'm at a bit of a crossroads myself.

529
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
You hungry?

530
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You buying?

531
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,280
Give it a whirl.

532
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,840
That is the logo for my new club.

533
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,960
What are we gonna call it?

534
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,680
The Iceberg Lounge.

535
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,440
Clever. Because you're nicknamed
Penguin, right?

536
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,120
There's that.

537
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,600
And then there is
the club's centerpiece attraction.

538
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Lee?

539
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
Lee.

540
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
<i>Jim,</i>

541
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,320
<i>I knew if I saw you I might not have
the courage to leave</i>.

542
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
<i>And I need to.</i>

543
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,600
<i>I finally understand Gotham
in a way I suspect you always have.</i>

544
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,520
<i>It's a place where the strongest
and most cunning rule.</i>

545
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,560
<i>Where the cost of survival
is paid for by others.</i>

546
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,400
<i>And everyone feels alone.</i>

547
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,400
<i>Having the virus showed me
the city as it truly was.</i>

548
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,280
<i>As I truly was.</i>

549
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,960
<i>In so many ways</i>.

550
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,800
<i>The virus made me feel reborn.</i>

551
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,920
He's a gangster.
Probably got what he deserved.

552
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,160
- He is?
- Sure. That's Butch Gilzean.

553
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,400
Really?

554
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,400
His chart lists his birth
name as Cyrus Gold.

555
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,720
Cyrus Gold?

556
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,400
He must've changed it at some point.

557
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,280
<i>But if having the virus allowed
Gotham to embrace its worst self</i>

558
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,920
<i>the cure should remind us
there is always hope.</i>

559
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,600
<i>A chance to remember
who we can be</i>

560
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,000
<i>rather than who we are.</i>

561
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,560
<i>I don't know if Gotham
deserves saving</i>

562
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,080
<i>but I do know one thing.</i>

563
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,640
<i>If anyone can save it</i>...

564
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
<i>It's you.</i>

565
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,400
<i>And in return, I believe
it can save you as well.</i>

566
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,920
<i>And then maybe one day...</i>

567
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,000
<i>It will send you back to me.</i>

568
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,080
<i>Until then</i>...

569
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,960
<i>Love always...</i>

570
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
<i>Lee.</i>

571
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,120
Can I come in, captain?

572
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,800
No.

573
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,080
You threw me against a train car.

574
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,320
- I know.
- Two,

575
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,040
actually.
I felt like a freaking cartoon.

576
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,880
I am really sorry about that.

577
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
You see Lee?

578
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,120
She's gone.

579
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,600
She left Gotham.

580
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
You okay?

581
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
I will be.

582
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,040
You wanna get a drink?

583
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,960
- It's noon.
- I didn't ask you what time it was,

584
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,880
I asked if you wanted to get a drink.

585
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Sure.

586
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
I'm good.

587
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,840
Any word on Tetch?

588
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,680
Yeah, he stumbled
into some hospital.

589
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
They patched him up.

590
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,600
Shipped him back to Arkham.

591
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,840
You know, I'd actually like to get
back to being a detective.

592
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,040
Do some good old fashioned
police work.

593
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,320
The kind that doesn't involve
secret cults or blood viruses.

594
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,360
- Do we have anything like that?
- Not really.

595
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,360
Half the force is coming off
24 hour shifts, but we could...

596
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,640
Hit the streets like
a couple beat cops,

597
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,360
see if we could stir up some trouble.

598
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,320
I don't know, seems kind
of beneath me.

599
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,800
You know, seeing as I'm the best cop
you've ever worked with and all.

600
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,200
I was just telling you
whatever crap came to mind

601
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,360
so you wouldn't punch a hole
through my head.

602
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,120
Like a hostage negotiation, you just
tell someone what they wanna hear.

603
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,440
Sure. Sure.

604
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,680
You know, if you didn't have

605
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,520
- the virus, I...
- Is that right?

606
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,360
That was so good.

607
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,600
- That was such a good dinner.
- I've never had sushi like that.

608
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,080
It was great, whatever it was.

609
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,680
- Money! Now!
- Dad?

610
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,480
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- Now!

611
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,240
- No!
- Dad!

612
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,360
- No!
- No!
