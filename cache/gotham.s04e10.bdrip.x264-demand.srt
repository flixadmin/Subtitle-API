00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,077
Hmm. A wise decision.

325
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,480
Now, untie me.

326
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
(WHIMPERING)

327
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,993
Things are finally looking up.

328
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,639
- BARBARA: Wakey, wakey.
- (GASPS)

329
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,714
Oh, hello.

330
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,596
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Barbara Kean.

331
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,432
This ferocious lady is Tabitha Galavan

332
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,279
and that kitty cat, that's Selina Kyle.

333
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,599
I know who you are.

334
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,869
Penguin wants you dead for
betraying him down in The Narrows.

335
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,114
What do you want with me?

336
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,079
Well, we heard you and Ozzy are BFFs.

337
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,469
So, you're going to try and leverage
me to get Penguin not to kill you.

338
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,536
TABITHA: We have some other demands.

339
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,153
But essentially, yeah.

340
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,595
That's a good plan.

341
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,399
Except for the fact
that Penguin just tried to kill me.

342
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,600
Why would he do that?

343
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,316
Because I am so close to taking
his underworld from him.

344
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
(SELINA scorrs)

345
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
You're lying.

346
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
SOFIA: Am I?

347
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,114
I've been working Penguin for months,

348
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,989
manipulating him into behaving
exactly how I want him to.

349
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,357
Every move he made today,
I orchestrated.

350
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,234
Now you three are screwing things up.

351
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,758
S0, you want him out of your life,
let me go.

352
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,433
(WHISPERS)
Maybe she's telling the truth.

353
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,674
She's a Falcone.

354
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,676
She learned to lie
before she could read.

355
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,069
But whether you are friend or foe
makes no difference to me,

356
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,550
because Penguin
will still make the deal.

357
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,799
Get him on the phone.

358
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
You'll grow into it.

359
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,749
(PENGUIN LAUGHS)

360
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,275
Because of you,
I was able to vanquish my enemy.

361
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,840
And now that you've proven yourself.

362
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,718
I see a beautiful future ahead
for you.

363
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,279
I have so much wisdom to impart.

364
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,639
And if you pay attention.

365
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,956
One day all of this could be yours.

366
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
What's wrong?

367
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,040
What are you talking about?

368
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,394
You mean, you did not see
Sofia kissing Gordon?

369
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,109
Why would she do that?

370
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,749
Unless...

371
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,233
She knew exactly how I would respond.

372
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,310
She wanted me to confront her.

373
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,799
Even torture her.

374
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,749
Boss, we have a problem.

375
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,114
The dentist is gone.

376
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,594
What happened to Sofia?

377
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,432
To be honest,
that's still a little unclear.

378
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,273
Barbara Kean has her.

379
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,835
What?
How do you know this?

380
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,912
She's on the phone.

381
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,154
Says she wants to make a deal.

382
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,953
Give me that.

383
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,395
Barbara.

384
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,993
Hello, Oswald.

385
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,869
I see you have crawled out from
whatever rock you were hiding under.

386
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,514
What are you doing with Sofia?

387
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,914
We scooped her up this morning.

388
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,273
And of course, when we did,
we thought she was your best friend.

389
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,749
Turns out, she's your worst enemy.

390
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,995
I want her back. Name your price.

391
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,800
We keep the gun shop,
we don't share profits

392
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,760
and from this point forward
<i>we</i> operate with complete autonomy.

393
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,035
Fine.

394
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,837
I will send Zsasz over
to collect her.

395
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,630
She had better be there
when he arrives.

396
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
She will be.

397
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,191
And as for you, young man.

398
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,999
Our conversation is not over.

399
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
GORDON: S0, this is what the Pyg
used to look like?

400
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
That's him.

401
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,869
AII right, send it out to
police stations across the country.

402
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,110
- Start in the South.
- The South? Why?

403
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,476
When I pressed him,
he spoke in a Southern accent.

404
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,816
He could have done that deliberately
to throw you off.

405
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,592
No. he slipped up.

406
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,109
I saw it in his eyes.

407
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,599
This is the best lead we've got.

408
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,399
Let's see where it goes.

409
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,120
NYGMA: I don't understand you.

410
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,879
If Sampson's cough will kill him,
why not let him die?

411
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,118
There's no such thing
as Narrow's Lung.

412
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,719
He probablyjust has bronchitis.

413
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,310
I give him some medicine,
he feels better, problem solved.

414
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,158
Okay. what about the 30%?

415
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,992
Once he has that.
He's just gonna want more.

416
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Maybe.

417
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,990
Sampson, you son of a bitch.

418
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,513
Now do you see
who you're dealing with?

419
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,113
I know you wanted
to try this your way.

420
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,478
No more diplomacy, Lee.

421
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,509
Take Grundy and end this.

422
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
No.

423
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,909
I have a better idea.

424
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,233
- That was easy.
- Yeah, a little too easy.

425
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,560
SOFIA: Because he couldn't wait
to get you off the phone.

426
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,552
We need to get out of here.

427
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,840
And then what happens?

428
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,994
You take over from Penguin?

429
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,159
We are not working for anyone
but ourselves.

430
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,713
I'm not asking you to.

431
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,473
I will give you everything you want
from Penguin.

432
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,550
You're not in a position
to offer us anything.

433
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,235
We're in charge here.

434
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,357
Uh. guys, I think
we should listen to her.

435
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
Why?

436
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,433
Because Zsasz is standing out front
holding a rocket launcher.

437
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Ladies.

438
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,150
(LAUGHING)

439
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,231
(ALL COUGHING)

440
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,393
I'm gonna break
his little beak in half.

441
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
SOFIA: Jim.

442
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,034
Sorry, Captain. I tried to stop her.
I told her she had to wait.

443
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,193
It's okay, Detective. I've got it.

444
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,551
Sofia, what happened to you?

445
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,639
I underestimated Oswald.

446
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
He found out
we were plotting against him

447
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,239
and he just tried to kill me, Jim.

448
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,709
He can't hurt you here.

449
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,350
If he finds out I'm alive.
He will come after me

450
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,590
and he won't stop until I'm dead.

451
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,197
You are the Captain of the GCPD,
your men would follow you anywhere.

452
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,955
Please, please, use the position
I gave you and end this.

453
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,995
What are you proposing I do?

454
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,194
You have an army,
just take the fight to Penguin.

455
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,469
So, this was your plan.

456
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,875
To start a war.

457
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,553
You knew you didn't have the numbers
to fight Penguin on your own,

458
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,790
so you made me Captain,
knowing it would come to this.

459
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,075
And I'd take him out for you.

460
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,720
Your job is to stop criminals, Jim,
here you go.

461
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,518
It is not that simple,
and you know it.

462
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,516
We could bring law and order
back to Gotham.

463
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,976
This is exactly what you asked for
when you came down south

464
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,991
and it is yours for the taking.

465
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,319
You know what has to be done, Jim.

466
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,514
Crush Penguin.

467
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,439
I trusted you, Martin.

468
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,714
And you betrayed me.

469
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,596
I think it's time for you
to go back to the orphanage.

470
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,629
- Boss.
- Hold on.

471
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,034
Let the little spy
step out of the room.

472
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
So?

473
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,513
The place went up
like a great ball of fire.

474
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,315
Good. Alert the capos.

475
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,033
We are going to unleash a crime wave
on this city like it has never seen.

476
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,040
That will teach Jim Gordon

477
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,151
to align himself with Sofia Falcone.

478
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,120
GORDON: I wouldn't make that call
if I were you.

479
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,515
Ijust spoke with Sofia.

480
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,035
She's alive.

481
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,157
And she told me
you tried to kill her.

482
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,155
Hearsay, Jim.

483
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,437
Been here all day. I have witnesses.

Okay. Jim. You have my attention.

Since the moment
she set foot in Gotham,

Sofia has put us on a path to war.

492
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,231
She's willing to let this city
burn to the ground

493
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,594

I'm putting her
on a train home tonight.

But I need assurances from you,
you won't get involved.

498

Not good enough.

499
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,155
She needs to suffer
for what she has done.

your girlfriend's gonna react

502
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,993
when she realizes you betrayed her?

503
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,831
You think she's just gonna
run away quietly?

one question for you, Jim.

No more licenses.

518
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,716
If you or any other criminal
in this city break the law,

519

my men will enforce it.

about Sofia again.

Look, I asked you to trust me
with something today, and you did.

648
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,358
So, I'm gonna trust you
with something.

649
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,836
I haven't been looking
for a cure for your brain, Ed.

650
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,073
Because there's nothing wrong
with you.

651
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,510
- But you...
- Sure,

652
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,591
at first there was an effect
from the ice.

653
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,392
But I ran all the tests, checks out.

654
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,073
There's nothing wrong
with you physically.

655
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,834
Your condition is psychological.

656
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,835
Think about it.

657
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,670
You knew every move
that Sampson was gonna make

658
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,989
before he made it.

659
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,749
You lied to me.

660
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,715
Why?

661
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,096
Because I was afraid
that if I told you the truth,

662
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,191
you would go back to being
who you were before.

663
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
The Riddler.

664
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,798
And I like who you've become.

665
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,915
Who's that?

666
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,635
Ed Nygma.

667
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,639
The Ed that you were before.

668
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,669
My friend.

669
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,069
Well, that backfired.

670
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,496
Penguin's gonna be coming for us.
What are we gonna do?

671
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,999
We hit him before he hits us.

672
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,480
Lady, you lost.

673
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,633
Penguin just blew up that kid.

674
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,554
I admit I didn't see that coming.

675
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,200
But Oswald still has to align
his capos before he moves on us.

676
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,271
We use that window of time
to make our play.

677
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,995
You didn't get told "no" a lot
as a kid, did you?

678
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,238
You took your shot and you missed.

679
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,800
We're going it alone from here.

680
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
You leave now,

681
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,120
and you will never have
a piece of this city.

682
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,512
Now, that sounded like a threat.

683
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,920
Your club is destroyed.
You have nowhere else to turn.

684
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,395
You need me.

685
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,035
Penguin may have won the battle,

686
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,312
but tomorrow, we win the war.

687
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
ZSASZ: Boss.

688
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
My boy.

689
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,550
You did a splendid job of dying.

690
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,190
Victor will take you
to a safe location.

691
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,318
You can never return to Gotham.

692
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,358
This is goodbye, my friend.

693
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,435
There, there.

694
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,993
This is what I have to do
to protect you.

695
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,436
One day. when you're older.
You will understand.

696
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,751
Sofia's on our heels, boss.

697
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Let's finish her off.

698
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,999
Have someone else take the kid.

699
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,434
No! I want my top man on this.

700
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,638
Besides, I have something much better
planned for Sofia Falcone.

701
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,475
You were right about the Pyg.

702
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,270
A precinct down south
recognized the picture

703
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,509
you had me send out.

704
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,637
His real name is Lazlo Valentine.

705
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,920
What do we know about him?

706
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,879
He was being held for a string
of murders down there 10 years ago.

707
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
But here's the thing.

708
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,554
His previous victims
weren't police officers

709
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,631
and there was no Pyg persona.

710
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,511
Serial killers
don't usually change their M0.

711
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,715
This guy did.

712
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,598
You said he was being held.

713
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,353
Did they say
why their case fell apart?

714
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,113
It didn't. He escaped.

715
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,996
Call Arkham. Have them
put a guard on his cell.

716
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,150
I'm on my way.

(METALLIC SCRAPING)

718
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160

(SCRAPING CONTINUES)

720
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,879

00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,395
No!
