You're best man, Arthur.
Go and find them.

167
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,480
Yeah.

168
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,280
ADA: That's completely nonsense.

169

You know, we're part of a serious
political movement and organisation.

170

They're not "secret little meetings,"
they're just meetings.

171

We talk about the world,
about the people in it,

172
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,960
about our current political landscape
and what's going on.

173
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,080
You know, we really need to re-evaluate
the way our government...

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,840
He's coming. He bloody is.

178
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,920
Fuck. It's the wrong one.

179

What do you mean "the wrong one"?
How many are there?

180

I prefer the other one.
He looks harmless.

182
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,600
It must be that bloody lipstick
Tommy brought you back from New York.

183
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,680
I couldn't help noticing
you are unaccompanied.

184

I also am alone. May I join you?

Oh. (SNIFFLES)

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,120
I need you downstairs.

188

-Are you drunk?
-Huh? No.

192

No.

193

Here.

194
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,760
All right, it's just one drink, then.

196
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,880
Good whisky.

197

hold out sometimes, eh?

(SIGHS)

199
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,200
So, uh, do I mention this
in my speech, then, eh?

200
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,800
Not unless you want to get cut, Arthur.

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,480
Tell the maids
to break out the champagne.

204
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,920
We'll be down in a minute.

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Champagne, yeah. OK.

206
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,200
-I got it right here. I'm ready.
-Good. Good.

207
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,080
Where are you from?

208
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,720
I'm a refugee.

209
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
From where?

210
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,240
Russia.

211
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,560
In the past few months,

212
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,440
Thomas has developed
some business interests with Russia.

213
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,520
I see he has confided in you.

214
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,960
Hmm.

215
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,560
You need his permission
to even speak to me.

216
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,840
My senior position
within the Shelby company

217
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,560
means I don't often have
to ask permission from anyone

218
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,040
to do anything.

219
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,480
So perhaps you'll just tell me

220
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,000
why the fuck you're talking Russian
business on Thomas's wedding day.

221
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,120
LIZZIE: Hold on, wait a second. So
you're saying I'm not allowed a man...

222
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,520
It's about your choice of man.

223
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,760
LIZZIE: I'm not allowed a man on my arm?

224
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,280
MICHAEL: Thomas says
that they're the rules.

225
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,280
LIZZIE: Fucking parish bastard!

226
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,760
Michael, speeches. Come on.

227
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,680
Arthur. You know
why he didn't come, don't you?

228
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,120
Why who didn't come?

229
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,600
My bloody man.

230
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,200
Oh, you mean the wop?

231
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,480
LIZZIE: I just heard there was a fire
at his restaurant midnight last night.

232
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,000
And a smashed back window
and a smell of petrol.

233
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,200
Lizzie, we tried to talk some sense
into you.

234
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,000
We did checks on him.

235
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
He's had five different names
in the last six years,

236
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,720
and he's got connections
with the Naples boys.

237
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
ARTHUR: Come on, Michael.

238
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,280
What do you know about love?

239
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,160
About when lightning strikes.

240
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,000
So, it was lightning, hmm? Not petrol.

241
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,360
I thought you were
off the whisky, Arthur.

242
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,880
Yeah, I am. Having a couple
now and again

243
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,320
to remind myself why I don't drink it.

244

(CHUCKLES)

245
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,440
You set fire to his restaurant
to stop him coming.

246
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,720
You have no right to choose
who I step out with in my own time!

position in this company.

249
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,600
You got the order, same as us.

250
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,400
You can do it.

251
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,240
Until further notice...

252
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,680
No fraternizing with the foreigners.

253
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,920
Yeah, well, you can tell Tommy from me

all the girls in the office think
he's losing his fucking mind!

that I want to say.

Just read what we wrote down, eh?

Plenty of other rooms to stay in.

I knew it.

Arthur, you mustn't worry about
what happened with the speech.

What was in your heart was beautiful.

Close your eyes, Arthur,
and spend a minute thinking about that.
