656
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,034
There are other ways
for me to hurt you.

657
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,193
Thank you so much for coming.

658
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,637
I thought we were overdue
for a chat.

659
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,031
How could I say no
to my sister-in-Iaw?

662
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,434
<i>JOKER: So I strangled him
with his lower intestines.</i>

663
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,153
Relax, buddy.

664
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,119
You gave me what I needed.

665
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,510
The laugh of the century.

666
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,955
Tell me something.

667
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,870
You appearto have everyone here
under your thumb,

668
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,640
- the guards, the inmatesu
- What can I say?

669
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,358
I'm a charismatic guy.

670
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,154
You could escape anytime.

671
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,919
- Why stay?
- Hmm.

672
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,434
Why indeed?

673
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,830
- You're planning something.
- JOKER: Righty, old boy.

674
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,275
Something spectacular.

675
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,158
See, I'm in this funny farm

676
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,198
'cause I need to find
the crême <i>de la</i> crazy.

677
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,198
Which is whyl need you.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

679
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,713
Ah, you get it.

680
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,235
But when we're done,

681
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,318
the world out there,
that'II be the asylum.

682
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,629
What do you say?

683
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,271
Thank you for your kind offer.

684
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,074
I don't expect
to be here very long.

685
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,711
You'll come around.

686
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,157
They always do.

688
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,115
Nope.

689
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,157
Where did these plants
come from?

690
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,595
Get out!

691
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,353
Before we call the police.

692
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,593
(COUGHING)

693
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,840
Oh, friends.

694
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,190
You're all so beautiful.
