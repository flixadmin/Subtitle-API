No. I followed the protocols

three of the eight components

Okay, so she didn't have the full recipe?

Unless she reverse engineered
her own V-Nine.

Knock, knock.

312
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:37,413
Am I hallucinating or is that disgraced
ex-Mercury's employee, Caitlin Snow?

313

Eliza Harmon, burning the midnight oil.
Don't you ever take a break?

314
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:43,627
Well, you know what they say, these
thiocyanate ions won't bond themselves.

315
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,629
-Hi.
-Hi.

316
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,674
Who is your handsome friend?

317
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,676
Detective Joe West, ma'am.

318
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,928
Detective, what brings you around
these parts?

319
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,680
Well, it's a funny story.

320
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,558
You know how there's a speedster
that's been wreaking havoc on the city?

321
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,518
Yeah. I heard the Flash went nuts.

322
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,020
Fame will do it to you.

323
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,938
I guess some people
just can't handle the limelight, right?

324
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,691
Well, we happen to know
it was someone else.

325
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:07,693
That's why we're here looking into this.

326
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,863
Wow! How very <i>Law &amp; Order</i> of you, Caitlin.

327
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,454
Do you remember that formula that you were
helping me with a few months ago?

328
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,166
-Uh, yeah, vaguely.
-We think that it was somehow involved.

329
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,000
How? What did you have me working on?

330
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,921
It's classified, but let's just say
it was some kind of enhancement.

331
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,632
And we're afraid
that my research was stolen.

332
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,426
Not from this lab?

333
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:38,599
Okay, uh, between you and me,
the place is pretty vulnerable.

334
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,767
Ever since that break-in a few months ago,

335
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,729
some of us think McGee
hasn't sufficiently stepped up security.

336
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,481
But I kept my research on lock

337
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,399
and destroyed the originals
when it was given back to you.

338
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,236
But, hey, you're free
to look around my lab if you want.

339
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,989
Uh, I don't think that'll be necessary.

340
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,907
I'm sorry. I wish I could be more help.

341
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,202
It's okay. It's actually kind of a relief.

342
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,079
Will you call me
if you hear anything, though?

343
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,913
Of course. That's what friends are for.

344
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,916
Thank you.

-For now? We take her at her word.

347
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,937
Um, great.

348
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:30,109
I have a source who knows for a fact
that this speedster is not the Flash,

349
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,777
but an imposter.

350
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,320
Ah. Who's your source?

351
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,157
I am not at liberty to say.

352
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,160
Well, if you can't tell me your source,
I'm running the original story.

353
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,537
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

354
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,000
You're right. What's one unnamed source
compared to dozens of eye-witnesses.

355
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,463
Honestly, I'm having a hard time
wrapping my head

356
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,465
around your vision for this story.

357
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,884
Something isn't adding up.

358
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,471
How about we, um, talk about it some more?

359
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:02,933
Uh, grab some coffee, what do you say?

360
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,394
Coffee? Right now?

361
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,148
Yeah, yeah. I mean, a little caffeine
never hurt anybody, right?

362
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,151
Sure.

No, not hard enough.

366
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:38,844
I'm sick of always being passed over
for the grant, for the promotion.

367
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,307
I'm underpaid and understaffed
and six months behind on my research.

368

That's why I started all of this.

Okay, I don't have time for chaos.

620
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,450
I mean, that would explain why
Zoom is so much faster than me.

621
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,661
If that's true,
then that means he's sick, right?

622
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,203
He's dying.

623
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,751
That's why he wants your speed.
He's dying and he needs a cure.

624
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,963
Same as Jay.

625
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,840
No.

626
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,885
Jay? No.

627
00:37:43,218 --> 00:37:46,764
He died right in front of us.
Zoom killed him right in front of us.

628
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,224
Yeah, Cisco, we've seen a speedster

629
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:52,061
be in two places at once before.

630
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,317
I guess there's one way to find out.

631
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,698
I guess now would be a good time to
tell you all, I've been vibing Zoom.

632
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,491
What?

633
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,035
For how long?

634
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:11,539
It started when we closed the last breach.

635
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,085
And every time it's happened,
I've been near that thing.

636
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,631
(SIGHS)

637
00:38:38,273 --> 00:38:39,567
We need to know.

638
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,591
No.

639
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,301
No, no.

640
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:13,518
Cisco? What did you see?

641
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,356
I saw Jay.

642
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,609
He's Zoom.

643
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,210
Barry!

644
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,680
