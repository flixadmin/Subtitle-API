1
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,917
Doctor, courier for you.

2
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:36,090
Sender. Sana. Item.
Flowers. Message. Miss you.

3
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,508
Keep it aside.

4
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:42,430
Switch on the processor.

5
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:49,895
Good. It moves well.

6
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,315
Serves you right.

7
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,236
Quiet.

8
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,370
Oh, God.

9
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,292
Even you deserve this.

10
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:17,006
He's kicking us like a
baby in the womb right now.

11
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,384
Imagine our plight
when he's complete.

12
00:04:54,502 --> 00:05:00,049
Up. Walk. Yes.

13
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:03,427
Yes.

14
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,764
Oh, no. Pick him up.

15
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:11,352
Coffee?
- Thank you, R-2.

16
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,980
Hey, tin-head. One cup strong
filter coffee for me as well.

17
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,441
No coffee for grade 02, only water.

18
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,652
Hey, you tin-head.
- And for grade 03?

19
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,404
Sorry, self-service.

20
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,787
There's no worth of a
human being in this lab.1

21
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:02,361
Come on.

22
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,113
Walk.

23
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:09,451
Come on, yes. Yes, walk.

24
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,245
Slow.

25
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:17,626
Walk like me. Yes.
Yes. That's right. Yes.

26
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,132
Excellent, doctor.

27
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:25,800
I'll start the data transfer.
- Okay.

28
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:26,969
Verify the connection.

29
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:24,276
He's giving a pose like Bruce Lee.
- Superb.

30
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,819
Come on.

31
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,977
Hi, Sana. Long see. No time.

32
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,188
Does anyone check
e-mails and SMS in this lab?

33
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:05,150
Where is that man? Why does
such a man need a girlfriend?

34
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,403
Is he alive inside or..
- He's stuck in the wires.

35
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,321
If I disturb him, he'll get angry.
- Let him be angry.

36
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,699
Tell him Sana is here.

37
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,742
Come on, hurry up.

38
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:17,787
Sana, do you have a sister?
- No.

39
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,872
Mother.. No.. Brother.
- What?

40
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:20,756
Well, cousin sister?

41
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,917
Can you please shut
down your stupid system?

42
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,419
Control, Alt, delete.

43
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,878
Get out, you stupid.
- Sorry, sir.

44
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,047
Don't disturb me.

45
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:32,385
He began hitting me with a motor,
Sana. Said he won't even see Obama.

46
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,761
Did you tell him that Sana is here?

47
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:35,805
I did. He said he'll call you later.

48
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,558
Forget his call.

49
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,445
Now I will never see him again.

50
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,573
Hello, world.

51
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:59,038
Hello, world. Hello, world.

52
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,582
Hello, world.
- Dot.

53
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,711
Boys, speech train him, I'll be right back.
- Okay. Okay.

54
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,005
Hey, pal. Repeat.

55
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,550
Hey, why are you staring
at me? Shall I thrash you?

56
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,343
Hey, donkey, idiot. Shall
I give you a tight slap?

57
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,429
Yes.

58
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,599
Hey, answer me, you mental fool.

59
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,518
Let me see how you've trained him.

60
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,978
Actually, you came too soon.

61
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,104
Come on, tell me.

62
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,524
Hey, pal. Repeat.

63
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:31,862
Hey, why are you staring
at me? Shall I thrash you?

64
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,950
Hey, donkey, idiot. Shall
I give you a tight slap?

65
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:41,997
Hey, answer me, you mental fool.

66
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,042
He's repeating whatever we said.
- What is all this?

67
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,376
Is this your speech training?

68
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,129
Doctor, it was not me,
but this Shiva.

69
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,047
I thought we would start
with local language and..

70
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,298
...then go on to pure Hindi..

71
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:55,593
Shut up. This is my hard
work of 10 long years.

72
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:56,886
This is not a joke.

73
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,388
If you try to teach him
wrong again, I'll punish you.

74
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:00,974
Irresponsible idiots.

75
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,687
You fool. You complain against us?

76
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:09,328
Idiot, I'll break you into pieces
and throw you in the tinker shop.

77
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,694
He'll get us in trouble again.
Let's go from here.

78
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,670
My dear Robo, welcome to this world.
- Hello, world.

79
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:16,008
I am Robo. Speed. 1 terahertz.
Memory. 1 zetabyte.

80
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,425
Success, doctor.

81
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,427
Now just the approval from
AIRD remains, doesn't it?

82
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,762
No, Shiva. Even though
he has been programmed..

83
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:24,766
...with all the inputs, he is
still an innocent machine.

84
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,517
Like a new born baby.

85
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,311
I will socialize him
with the outside world.

86
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,981
I'll see how he uses his intellect
and abilities amongst humans..

87
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,900
...living like them

88
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,028
Once we are sure about this,
then we'll take him to AIRD.

89
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,322
That means you are going to let him out?
- Dot.

90
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,949
There'll be a big chaos then.

91
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,789
Coming.

92
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,958
It's been months.
Don't know what's going on.

93
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,754
He's spoilt his health
doing some research.

94
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:55,337
Hi.

95
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,882
What's this, Vasee?
You look like a hermit.

96
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,635
Hi, Father. I have a
shocking surprise for you.

97
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,720
What is it?

98
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,929
Come.

99
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,059
Who's he? Is he a clone?

100
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,979
No, Father.
- Hey, what's all this? Who are you?

101
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,940
Hi. I am Robo.

102
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,609
Speed 1 terahertz.
Memory 1 zetabyte.

103
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,986
He's beyond you as well.

104
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,988
Father, I made this robot.

105
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:22,448
There are many different types of robots.
- Yes.

106
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:24,200
This is an andro-humanoid robot.

107
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,994
A machine that resembles a human.

108
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,082
This is mother.
- Mother. - Yes. Mother. Mother.

109
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,668
Take mother's blessings.

110
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,838
He is a complete human.

111
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,882
He does everything a human can.

112
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,801
But he can also do
what a human can't.

113
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,678
Then we don't need
these jokers any more.

114
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,056
Father.. - Father..
- No, Father. Let them be.

115
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,724
If they are not here,
who'll clean up the Robo?

116
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,185
Who'll make him wear clothes?

117
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,855
You turned an MSC
science guy into a nanny?

118
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:56,775
Vasee, dear, have your food.
- Yes.

119
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,696
Robot, you have a seat as well.
Have some steaming hot rice cakes.

120
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,782
Looks like you will feed
him a gourmet meal, too.

121
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:07,285
Mother, all it needs is 2
units of electricity daily.

122
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,121
Why are you talking like that?
Haven't you given him a name?

123
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,374
Mother, you choose a name.

124
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:15,584
If you had a brother, I
would've named him 'Chitti Babu'.

125
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:18,004
Sounds good. We can
lovingly call him Chitti.

126
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,966
I am Chitti?
- Yes.

127
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,260
Chitti. Put on the TV.

128
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:34,687
Oh, Mother. He would do
that if you say so, right?

129
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,940
You should specifically
say "switch on the TV".

130
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,527
Vasee, where are you off
to already? To the lab?

131
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,529
No, Mother. First I'll get a
haircut and then meet Sana.

132
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,990
She's very angry
with me. Sit behind.

133
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,118
Who'll drive the car?
- Chitti.

134
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,828
Chitti?
- Chitti? Oh, God.

135
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,748
Doctor, why to take a risk?
- And you?

136
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:55,875
The thing is that I've an
upset stomach, doctor. You go.

137
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,670
I haven't told my
folks at home. You leave.

138
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:00,589
Change to driving mode.

139
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,383
Take care, doctor. He might break
the gear if you don't say it right.

140
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:07,012
I'm there.
- Yes. You were there when he broke the TV.

141
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,389
Slow. Slow. Just
follow my instructions.

142
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,932
Don't do anything without asking me.
- Okay, doctor.

143
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,352
Where do we go?

144
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,946
Hey, Chitti.

145
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,907
Idiot. Why didn't
you apply the brakes?

146
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,285
You said I shouldn't do
anything without asking you.

147
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:32,745
Hey, idiot.
- New word.

148
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,038
Are you driving the car
after getting full with alcohol?

149
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,434
No, I'm driving the car
after getting it full with petrol.

150
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:35,915
Hey.

151
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,793
Don't argue with him. Just drive.

152
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,260
Don't cut it too short. Just inch.

153
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:50,263
Will cut your hair
just as I cut your nails.

154
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,433
Sir, you didn't come for long time.
Had you made a wish to Ayyappa?

155
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:56,269
No, Brother.
- Is he your brother?

156
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,645
Yes, kind of.

157
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,690
Sir, would you like to have a haircut?
- No. This is a wig.

158
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,528
Wig? How old must sir be?
- One day.

159
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,365
Sir's joking.

160
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,450
Here, read some books.

161
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:17,416
Is he counting the pages?

162
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,927
Are there other books?

163
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,089
You finished reading all of them so soon?
- Yes, I did.

164
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,767
We only have the
telephone directory to read now.

165
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,655
Next. - You read the directory as well?
- Yes.

166
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:50,512
You memorized all the
numbers in the directory?

167
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:51,008
Yes.

168
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:53,910
Tell me Kamal Hassan's number.
- 24334140.

169
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,456
Everyone knows that.
Tell me my number.

170
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,125
Your name?
- Bhajanlal.

171
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,548
There are 12 Bhajanlals' here.
What are your initials?

172
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,633
K. Bhajanlal.

173
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:11,969
There are 3 K. Bhajanlals here.
What is your address?

174
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,684
No. 6, Manna Reddy Street. Chennai.
- 24884030.

175
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:19,769
Correct. Brilliant.

176
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,025
My number. 44433 Guess my name.

177
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,444
Hello, Mr. P. Pitambaram.

178
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,666
Hi, sweetheart.
- Broken heart.

179
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,794
What is it?
- I am sorry, Sana.

180
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,921
Please accept my apologies.

181
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,839
I was busy in the
lab for so many days.

182
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,051
You should've stayed there.
Why did you come here?

183
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:54,011
I know.. You are very angry, right?

184
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,806
How many times I called you? I
lost count of e-mails, SMSs.

185
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,852
I dropped in so many times.
You didn't even talk to me.

186
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,770
I am tired of all this now.

187
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,813
Sana, look at this. Bullet points.

188
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:08,026
One. I have no clue what's
happening when I am at work.

189
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,787
Second. If you knew what
I was doing all these days..

190
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,612
Excuse me.

191
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,780
The class is going on.

192
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,740
Say whatever you want to say
in the evening at Jeeva park.

193
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:16,784
Dot. I love you. See
you in the evening.

194
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:21,623
Hello, don't get any ideas. Not to
romance, but to call off our love.

195
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,625
What? Call off our love?
What do you mean?

196
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,751
If you are to keep hugging
your machines and me my..

197
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:28,546
...solitude, then there's no point
in calling off our marriage later.

198
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,381
So, we might as well call
off our love now itself.

199
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,174
I'll go my way. You go your way.

200
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:34,218
End of the fight.
- Hey, look.

201
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,639
Easy. Easy, Sana. Oh, no.

202
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,945
Here's the break-up agreement.

203
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,781
All the letters sent
by you, greeting cards..

204
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:57,449
Look what book you had given me?

205
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,662
"A briefer history of time".
"Freak economics"”.

206
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,124
Lord Murugan's photo
on Valentine's day.

207
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,960
Have you ever given a gift
that has touched my heart?

208
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,924
This. Does anyone give a
razor as a gift to a girl?

209
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,678
Thought it would be useful to you.
- What nonsense.

210
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,770
I have returned everything
you gave me. Sign on this now.

211
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:29,315
Our relationship is over. Goodbye.

212
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,774
That's all?
- End of it.

213
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,027
Have you returned everything I gave you?
- Yes, I did.

214
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,740
What about my 2 to the
power of.. 512 kisses?

215
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,284
You keep counting kisses, too?

216
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:40,702
Don't you have any feelings?

217
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:44,163
Complete matrix head. I
can't return all that.

218
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,623
Then this love won't be called off.

219
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,374
Forget it. I won't give it.

220
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,461
Then even I will not sign it.
Call-off is called-off.

221
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,005
What have I gotten myself into?

222
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,467
Close your eyes.

223
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,640
Count.

224
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,974
What's this?

225
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,143
These are all post office kisses.
Did I kiss you like this?

226
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,122
Then?

227
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:10,105
Pulled you by the
waist. Hugged you tight.

228
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:13,276
Stop. Stop. This is impossible.

229
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:14,985
You won't get it.

230
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:18,531
Then I won't call it off.
I'll trouble you daily.

231
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:23,244
You are torturing me. Idiot.

232
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,874
Come close. Close your eyes.

233
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,086
Don't chuckle.

234
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,219
Is this okay?
- Too much gap.

235
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,889
Hold tighter.

236
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,684
Feel. Feel.

237
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:41,788
What is this?
- 'Bhel' (Indian snack).

238
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:42,956
"Bhel'?
- Yes.

239
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:45,877
Who is the driver?
- Which driver?

240
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:47,525
There are
different kinds of drivers.

241
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,504
Engine driver, taxi driver,
screwdriver..

242
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:52,341
Who is the driver of this car?
- I am.

243
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:54,760
You've parked your car
in the no parking zone.

244
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,219
It's only written
"No parking” there.

245
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,514
It doesn't say "No parking
for Dr. Vaseegaran's car".

246
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:01,225
Are you trying to act smart?
- No, I am replying.

247
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,187
Show me your driving license.
- I don't have one.

248
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,897
How can you drive without a license?

249
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,398
The driving module has
been programmed in me.

250
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,484
Okay. Don't act too smart.
Come with me to the station.

251
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,861
Which station? Radio station,
railway station, space station..

252
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,987
...or play station?

253
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:16,783
Trying to fool me? What's your name?
- Chitti.

254
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,034
What's your address?
- Here's the I. P address.

255
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,036
108.11.0.1.

256
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,663
Why do you answer all
questions is such a weird manner?

257
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:25,248
What's your father's name?
- I have no father.

258
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:26,708
Mother?
- No mother.

259
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:28,418
Are you an orphan?
- I'm not an orphan.

260
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:31,214
Then how were you born?
- |I wasn't born, but made.

261
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:36,010
Made? Are you insane?
- No.

262
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,678
I have been fitted well.
- Are you in your senses?

263
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,931
No, it is in nickel. All
my bolts are made of nickel.

264
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,725
Stop it.
- Stop what? Tell me properly.

265
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,269
You..

266
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:54,028
I argued unnecessarily.
Parking of fence. No driving license.

267
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,780
You talk too much.

268
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:58,783
If you go to the court,
you will be fined Rs. 1000.

269
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,244
Want to go to court or
take care of it here itself?

270
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,445
I will take care of it here itself.
- That's the spirit.

271
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,207
Go on.

272
00:27:09,043 --> 00:27:10,252
Done.

273
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,380
Hey, are you out of your mind?

274
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:14,632
Don't you know what
'taking care of it' means?

275
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:17,593
Give me a cut.
- Where?

276
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,848
Give it in my hand.

277
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,605
He cut my hand. He
cut it. Police. Police.

278
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:32,149
Chitti. What happened?
- Police.

279
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,650
He asked for a cut. So I obliged.

280
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,111
Oh, my God. He's bleeding.
- Vasee, who's this?

281
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,029
He looks just like you.
- Get into the car. I'll tell you.

282
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,533
Hey, get the car.
- Hey, where are you going? Stop. Stop.

283
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,244
Is he your brother? Are you twins?

284
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:46,414
No. If we get caught, we
will be in a mess. Drive fast.

285
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:48,457
Is he your friend?
- No.

286
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,251
Driver? He doesn't look like a one.

287
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,711
Wait.. I'll explain everything.

288
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,547
Hey, look back if he's
following us and drive.

289
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:02,096
Hey, look in the front.

290
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,306
Why do you turn your
head at the drop of a hat?

291
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,974
You asked me to look back and drive.

292
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,392
Can't you look at
the rear view mirror?

293
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:11,022
You couldn't have told me that earlier?
- Come on.

294
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:02,156
Gentlemen, he is equal to 100.

295
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:06,035
He has been programmed with the
memory and skills of 100 humans.

296
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,414
He knows all the arts
and languages of the world.

297
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:15,586
He can dance. He can fight.
And he's a sportsman.

298
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:20,131
He's fire resistant, water
resistant, in-built vehicle.

299
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:23,552
His eyes don't just see,
but also show.

300
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,643
You can talk to him virtually.

301
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:36,232
This type of robot can develop
and protect our nation 100 fold.

302
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:38,901
You are welcome to ask
Chitti any question.

303
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:43,770
Simple question. 24157817
is it a Fibonacci number?

304
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,283
Yes.

305
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:47,492
It is the 22nd Fibonacci number.

306
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:49,536
By the way, it also happens to be
Mr. P. Subramaniam"s residential..

307
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,414
...number in Pondicherry.

308
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,127
What is the biggest
prime number in your opinion?

309
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:05,136
M44. You will have to wait
for many years to verify this.

310
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,012
Good.

311
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,056
Amazing. Great.

312
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,941
What raga is this?

313
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,692
You started with "Nat Kurinji"
and went off to 'Husseini'..

314
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,069
...in between. Listen to this.

315
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,035
You missed the note at this place.

316
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,166
Any more questions?
- Does God exist or not?

317
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,752
What is God?
- The one who created us.

318
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,964
My creator exists. Dr.
Vaseegaran. So God exists.

319
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,653
What else?
- Wow, Vasee.

320
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:09,241
He's superb. What a lovely creation.
- Thank you.

321
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,077
You are really great.

322
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,121
Hey, Chitti. Do you know to paint?
- Yes, I do.

323
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,873
Will you paint me?
- Sure.

324
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,583
Smile, please.

325
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,930
Cool.
- Wow..

326
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,641
He's such a darling.

327
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:35,294
Can we click a photograph?
- Sure.

328
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:40,688
Yes. Yes.
- Wow.

329
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:42,441
Look, the girls are all over him.

330
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,695
Hey, girls. I am co-scientist.

331
00:31:47,696 --> 00:31:49,989
I fixed all of Chitti's motors.

332
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,617
Hi. I am deputy scientist. Ravi.
- Deputy scientist?

333
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:54,577
Yes, that means he's still learning.
- Hey.

334
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:57,206
I dressed him up.
- Can I have a date with you?

335
00:31:57,998 --> 00:32:01,042
Dating? Why are you
all falling for him?

336
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:02,961
He may have the
strength of 100 people..

337
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:07,716
...but we have something
that he doesn't. He doesn't.

338
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:13,055
Doctor, why don't I have
that special thing they do?

339
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:15,265
Robo is called Chitti Babu..

340
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,684
Fools. Don't you know how
to talk in front of him?

341
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,270
Actually we have
feelings and he doesn't.

342
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,813
Cheap fellows, don't
try to change the topic.

343
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,315
You lose one month's salary.

344
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:30,196
Hello, Professor.
- Brilliant job, Dr. Vasee.

345
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:32,533
Thank you. Chitti,
meet professor Bora.

346
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,910
You have told me.
Chief of AIRD. Your mentor.

347
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:37,537
His picture hangs on our lab wall.

348
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,291
Interesting. Chitti.

349
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:43,877
What processor are you using?

350
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,963
Pentium ultra core millennia V2.

351
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,050
And your motors?
- FHP450S motors.

352
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,387
From Hi rat a, Japan. With
harmonic reduction unit.

353
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,474
Can you tell me
about your neural schema?

354
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,142
I can't.
- Why?

355
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,602
It is highly confidential.

356
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,313
I am Vaseegaran's professor.

357
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,065
You can tell me without hesitation.
- I'll have to check.

358
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:09,444
No.
- He is asking me about my neural scheme.

359
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,654
Shall I tell him?

360
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,492
You see, professor.
You are asking know-how.

361
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:17,953
I'm hesitating to divulge
information till he is patented.

362
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,833
He can be easily misused.
- Of course, I understand.

363
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:27,630
I had just casually asked to see
how much Chitti knows about himself.

364
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,756
I hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

365
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,509
After studying him thoroughly,
I will bring him to you..

366
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,471
...for AIRD evaluation.
- All the best. - Thank you.

367
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:37,264
I'll see you there, my boy.

368
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:48,358
Vasee, I like Chitti a lot.

369
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,652
Can I take him home for 2-3 days?

370
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,113
Hey, he's not a Pomeranian
or your teddy to play with.

371
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:57,992
No, Vasee. I have my final exams.
I haven't prepared well..

372
00:33:57,993 --> 00:33:59,702
.-As I was upset with you.

373
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:03,039
Chitti being around could
help me. Please. Please.

374
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,166
Please. Please.
- Alright. Take him along.

375
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:07,252
You both go along with him as well.
- Okay, doctor. - Okay, doctor.

376
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,087
Gents are not allowed at home.

377
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,380
Who said we are gents?

378
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,927
Okay. Call me if you need anything.
- Okay. Thanks.

379
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,316
Activate command
mode and a stand up.

380
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,570
Command mode activated.

381
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,531
Walk.

382
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:40,953
Idiot. Come forward. Not
on the side, but straight.

383
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:45,207
Shit.
- I can't shit.

384
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:50,671
Okay, pick up the gun.

385
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,468
Not the bun. The gun. Gun.

386
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,973
Shoot.

387
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:08,647
Hey. Hey. Stop it.

388
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:12,276
I have programmed 8
lakh line of codes in you.

389
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,778
You mistake a gun for a bun.

390
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,740
If I tell you to massage my head,
you'll strangle my neck.

391
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:27,666
My student Vaseegaran
turned out to be stupendous.

392
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:32,463
He got a standing ovation for
his robot in the conference.

393
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,507
And this nonsensical
metal head is still..

394
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,926
Strangle the neck.
Strangle the neck.

395
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:41,889
Let go off me. Let go.
- Task incomplete.

396
00:35:42,264 --> 00:35:45,016
Strangle the neck.
Strangle the neck.

397
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,520
Strangle the neck.
Strangle the neck. Neck..

398
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,489
Oh, no.

399
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,295
Alright Vaseegaran,
I'll surpass you.

400
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:16,006
You just wait.

401
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,592
"Happy home". Meaning?

402
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:22,012
Papa was in the army. He was
martyred in the Kargil war.

403
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:25,807
After that, grief, tears
and depression at home.

404
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,059
It was horrible.

405
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,061
Then we thought, how
long will this go on?

406
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,647
Thought all the women who are
homeless after losing their..

407
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:37,111
...husbands and sons in the army
should live in a family environment.

408
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:40,029
Nobody can change what has happened.

409
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,824
And no one can prevent
what is about to happen.

410
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,992
But what's the harm in
living a happy life today?

411
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:46,537
So, this Happy Home.

412
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:49,496
Latha, is your baby
playing football inside?

413
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:50,248
Naughty.

414
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,501
Wait till he comes out.
I'll teach him a good lesson.

415
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,841
Who's he? What will a
man do in our house?

416
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,967
Is he your boyfriend?

417
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,303
Mother, not boy friend,
but toy friend.

418
00:37:03,595 --> 00:37:05,931
His name is Chitti. He's a Robot.

419
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,975
Robot? Why are you lying
to me? You are too much..

420
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,228
It's true. I am a robot.

421
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:13,897
Speed. 1 terahertz. Memory.
1 zetabyte.

422
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:17,735
Chitti, don't give them a
fright like this. Put it back.

423
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,740
Mother, you will be
shocked by all that he does.

424
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,491
Can he cook?
- Of course.

425
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:27,745
Cook something for me,
Chitti. I'll take a shower.

426
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:50,350
You neatened the whole room.

427
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,730
You are so sweet, Chitti. Thank you.

428
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,694
Cool.
- It's hot.

429
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,575
Just one day left. Lots to study.

430
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:09,036
I'll tell you what I know verbatim.

431
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,705
Correct me if I go wrong, okay?

432
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,842
Finished reading everything?

433
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:27,471
Okay, let me test you.

434
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,015
What are monopsychotic
and dipsychotic twins?

435
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:33,351
Monopsychotic twins
are identical twins.

436
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,729
Dipsychotic twins are
non-identical twins.

437
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:38,023
Amazing.

438
00:38:38,398 --> 00:38:41,527
If you learn at this pace, you
will become a doctor in a day.

439
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:45,696
In the important
segment of the pelvis..

440
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:47,825
The trans..
- Tenciamomo?

441
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,993
Tenciamomo is usually the
smallest diameter of the pelvis..

442
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:52,328
Anteroposterior diameter.

443
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:56,166
The Anteroposterior diameter,
which is through the level of the..

444
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,972
They do this everyday.

445
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,978
Hello. Such loud music.
Turn the volume down.

446
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,396
Hello.

447
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,399
We've spent a million and
bought a deck, amplifier..

448
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,652
...woofer, surround speaker.

449
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:26,237
Do you expect us to
hear it on headphones..

450
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,905
...if not on full volume?

451
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:30,408
It's exam time. So
many girls are studying.

452
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,952
And there are
heart patients as well.

453
00:39:32,744 --> 00:39:34,412
Heart patients.

454
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,332
Is there pain in your heart?
Stuff in some cotton.

455
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:41,920
I said in the ear. Okay.

456
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:51,137
Chitti, do something.

457
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,139
Don't worry. The
remote control has infrared.

458
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,224
I'll handle it.

459
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:18,165
Come on, baby. Come on.

460
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,042
Finish it off.
- Shut your ears.

461
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,920
Come on.
- Okay.

462
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:26,715
Let's move it. Let's move it.

463
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,306
Turn down the volume, buddy.

464
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:37,643
It's too loud, man.

465
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:54,409
Cool. Come, Chitti.

466
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,500
Back to studies. Okay?

467
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,293
The Anteroposterior diameter
through the level of the..

468
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:06,838
...spine which normally
measures up to about 11..

469
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,848
98 decibels. Too loud.

470
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:19,518
I can't bear this.

471
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,733
Listen. It's too loud.

472
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:28,943
Turn it down by 30 db.

473
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:32,446
Buzz off. It's a feast for
mother Goddess. We are celebrating.

474
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:34,240
He says it's too loud.
The db is high.

475
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,281
I'm having exams. I'm
finding it difficult to study.

476
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,497
Offer your prayers to the Goddess
and smear the holy ash. You'll pass.

477
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,750
Your parties are so loud as well.

478
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,005
Sana, the problem of the
loudspeaker is now taken care of.

479
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,172
Thanks.

480
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:51,966
Hey, Shekhar. He broke
the mike. That scoundrel.

481
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,302
Hey. Wait up. I won't spare him.

482
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,722
Come on.
- I said stop.

483
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,244
Mother. Mother Goddess.

484
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,706
Mother. Mother Goddess.

485
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,751
Mother. Mother Goddess.

486
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:31,089
Mother. Mother Goddess.

487
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,673
Mother Goddess.

488
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:33,966
What is this?

489
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,593
I guess he knows magic.

490
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,136
Hey, he drew in all the things.

491
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,389
What's going on?
- What is this?

492
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:11,088
Oh, God.
- Why are you crying, Sana?

493
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,090
I'm going to fail, Chitti.

494
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,759
I haven't studied anything.
I have run out of time.

495
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:17,510
My head starts
spinning when I see the books.

496
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,886
Can I appear for the exams?

497
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,472
What nonsense, Chitti?

498
00:43:20,722 --> 00:43:22,766
You need a photo ID,
exam card and everything.

499
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,391
You'll be caught if you go.

500
00:43:24,392 --> 00:43:26,061
Then we'll do Zigbee.

501
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,145
What do you mean?

502
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:30,565
If the bleeding starts
with the placenta and utero..

503
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,527
...the fund us of uterus
must be grasped and massaged..

504
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,945
...to make it contract.

505
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,571
If the placenta shows
sign of separation..

506
00:43:37,572 --> 00:43:40,909
...it must be expressed
by the commonly employed..

507
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:43,994
If the placenta is not separated..

508
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:46,248
...no attempt should
be made to express it.

509
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:49,959
The third stage of lab or
starts after the baby's delivery.

510
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,087
And ends..
- Excuse me. What are you doing here?

511
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,713
Sana is appearing for
her exam over there.

512
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:56,466
And I'm telling her the answers.

513
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,926
How come by sitting here?

514
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,928
I've built-in data transmitter.

515
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,014
There is a trans-receiver
attached to Sana's ears.

516
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,308
Zigbee protocol. Simple.

517
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,976
What high tech bit is this?

518
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,686
It's not a bit, but byte.

519
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,604
I've sent 2 megabyte data so far.

520
00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:12,607
Did you see, sir? How
they conjure up things?

521
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:15,526
Get up, man.
- Wait for a while.

522
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,069
I'll be there the moment the
umbilical cord is severed.

523
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,630
What? Are you coming with us or
you want me to call the security?

524
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,999
There. She is Sana.

525
00:44:29,332 --> 00:44:30,916
Sana, what is this?

526
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:32,376
You're copying his
answers via a trans-receiver..

527
00:44:32,377 --> 00:44:34,004
...attached to your ears?

528
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:35,880
Who told you?
- I did.

529
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,298
Who is he? I don't know him.

530
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,341
Sana, why are you lying? I'm Chitti.

531
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:41,928
Speed 1 terahertz.
Memory 1 Zetabyte.

532
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,430
What the.. It's
absolute nonsense, sir.

533
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,639
He has lost his marbles.

534
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,225
I don't have a mind, but
a CPU. Perfect condition.

535
00:44:48,226 --> 00:44:50,019
There is no doubt that he is crazy.

536
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,520
Take him away. My
time's getting wasted.

537
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:53,439
When he was muttering away alone..

538
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,191
...I thought he must be
some ex-medical student.

539
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,067
Sir, you may go out.

540
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:58,527
Go and severe the umbilical cord.

541
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:00,613
Sana, then what will you
about the fertilization process?

542
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,865
Go out. That's her problem.

543
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,326
Task incomplete.

544
00:45:43,865 --> 00:45:45,366
Thank you very much.

545
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,953
I would've failed if
you hadn't helped me.

546
00:45:48,161 --> 00:45:50,038
Why are you wetting
my cheek for that?

547
00:45:51,831 --> 00:45:52,958
Let's go.

548
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,502
I'm sorry, Chitti.

549
00:45:55,877 --> 00:45:58,088
They would've debarred me
for 3 years had I been caught.

550
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,924
That's why I had to
put on this entire act.

551
00:46:01,716 --> 00:46:04,010
Don't feel bad.
- I have no feelings.

552
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,180
I have learned that a
human can lie in his defence.

553
00:46:09,182 --> 00:46:10,910
I have learned that a
human can lie in his defence.

554
00:46:10,922 --> 00:46:11,502
True.

555
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,311
Move.

556
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,981
Move, smarty.
- Come on, make way.

557
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,149
Make way.
- Hey. Let me get in. Hey.

558
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,985
You, get out.
- Come on.

559
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,488
Come on, out.
- Take a hike. Take a hike.

560
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,616
Hey, are you some big-shot?

561
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,286
Now tell us.
- Hey, what are you staring at?

562
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,870
Now you can't draw in anything.

563
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:33,665
Everything's made of wood and stone.

564
00:46:34,165 --> 00:46:36,126
Come on.
- Why are they calling me?

565
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:37,793
Quiet.

566
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,004
Hey, you had
brought him along, right?

567
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,214
Now ask him to come.

568
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:47,511
Chitti, my purse.

569
00:46:47,512 --> 00:46:49,681
It has the hall ticket,
ID.. Everything.

570
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,376
You broke my home theatre.

571
00:47:19,377 --> 00:47:22,297
Now let me see how much
noise your home theatre makes.

572
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,221
Chitti.

573
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,560
Chitti.

574
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:46,362
Chitti.
- Come on, get in.

575
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,616
Chitti. Chitti, train.

576
00:48:09,427 --> 00:48:11,971
Chitti, give them a thrashing.

577
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,305
Chitti.

578
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,589
Stop it.

579
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,519
Chitti.

580
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:41,079
Chitti.

581
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,422
You'll go crazy when you
hear what Chitti did today.

582
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:18,675
He is so sweet. He's amazing.
Unbelievable.

583
00:52:18,676 --> 00:52:20,470
Like.. Like a super hero.

584
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:24,849
If he was a human, trust me,
he'll be the best man.

585
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:30,271
Why do you look irked?
- Not at all.

586
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,815
Hey. Come on, Vasee.

587
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:35,525
He's just a machine.

588
00:52:35,526 --> 00:52:38,488
And the entire credit of
whatever he does goes to you.

589
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,031
You created him.

590
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,784
And I love you for that.

591
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,045
Hello. My son will fly in the air.

592
00:55:42,046 --> 00:55:43,214
Hold him.

593
00:55:53,307 --> 00:55:54,642
Are you insane?

594
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:57,019
What are you doing? Hey,
leave me. Put me down.

595
00:55:58,062 --> 00:55:59,313
Task completed.

596
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:18,017
Cheers.
- Cheers.

597
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,731
What is it? You are checking
us out as if you are watching..

598
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,691
...some girl dancing.

599
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:28,902
Do you intend to complain about us?

600
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,445
It's the AIRD evaluation tomorrow.

601
00:57:30,446 --> 00:57:32,113
I'm carrying out
peripheral trouble shooting.

602
00:57:32,114 --> 00:57:34,658
Hey, are you some scholar?

603
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,785
Your language is wrong.

604
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,662
As if you are some linguist?

605
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,919
Hey, stop it.

606
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,420
You're ranting away preaches..

607
00:57:47,421 --> 00:57:50,256
.-Without a break like a
sage on some devotional channel.

608
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:52,926
You think you're bigger than us
now that you know a few things?

609
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,970
Yes.
- What yes?

610
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,137
Can you drink like us?

611
00:57:56,138 --> 00:57:57,682
Can you puff cigarettes like us?

612
00:57:57,848 --> 00:57:59,391
Can you eat
'Biryani' (Indian Pilaf)?

613
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,184
Can you eat and puke?

614
00:58:01,185 --> 00:58:02,560
Can you spit like us?

615
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:04,854
Can you write names on
the wall with your urine?

616
00:58:04,855 --> 00:58:06,816
Is this the only
difference between me and humans?

617
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,820
He's putting us down.
- Shall we feed him some 'Biryani'?

618
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,989
I can't eat all this.
It's in my rule list.

619
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,657
Hey, isn't it mentioned
in the rule list that..

620
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,492
...you should listen to us?
- Yes.

621
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:19,995
Then here. Have some liquor.
- Have some 'Biryani'.

622
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,371
Wait. Let me ask the doctor.

623
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,052
Hey, why the doctor?
- Hey, why the doctor?

624
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:24,666
Hello, doctor.

625
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,168
These guys are feeding me alcohol,
beverages and 'Biryani'.

626
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:29,337
Rule priority clash.
What should I do?

627
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:30,797
Thrash those rascals with slippers.

628
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,091
Yes, doctor. Command received.

629
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,467
Listen.

630
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:36,429
Give me your slippers.

631
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,138
Slippers?
- Slippers?

632
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,515
Here you go.
- Here you go.

633
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:41,684
Are you going to eat this?

634
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,524
Chitti, why are you beating us up?

635
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:51,067
We haven't anything done
of that sort. Don't do it.

636
00:58:51,068 --> 00:58:52,569
Look, it hurts.
- Don't beat us up.

637
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,154
You're beating us up
with our slippers.

638
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,405
Please spare us.
- Please.

639
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,866
Task incomplete.

640
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,827
Doctor, help us.
- Help us.

641
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,662
Chitti is beating us up. Help.

642
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:05,790
Chitti, stop. You deserve this.
- No, sir.

643
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:07,959
Don't you have brains?
- No, sir.

644
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,127
It's AIRD evaluation tomorrow..

645
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,248
...and you're asking him to
have drinks and 'Biryani'?

646
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:12,922
We did not tell him
anything of that sort, doctor.

647
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:14,049
He is lying, doctor.
- Shut up.

648
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,342
Only humans lie, not machines.

649
00:59:16,343 --> 00:59:19,096
Last warning, idiots. Next
time you'll be fired. Literally.

650
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:21,515
Task completed.

651
00:59:31,942 --> 00:59:34,070
A human's life is precious.

652
00:59:34,403 --> 00:59:37,490
Millions of our brave
soldiers lose their lives every war.

653
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,075
Many families get
orphaned after losing them.

654
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,409
There will be no
human casualties if..

655
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,871
...we use robots instead
of soldiers in the army.

656
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,999
My goal is to create many
such Andro Humonoid robots..

657
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:49,418
...and to give them
to the Indian army.

658
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,711
For which I need the AIRD approval.

659
00:59:51,712 --> 00:59:55,090
That's why I request all
you scientists and officers..

660
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,427
...to examine Chitti and
give me your approval. Dot.

661
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:01,596
Has this robot been created as per..

662
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:04,015
...the rules of Asimov
of not harming humans?

663
01:00:04,016 --> 01:00:06,017
This robot hasn't been
created in this way.

664
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:10,314
Because in the battlefield, the
robots might have to kill humans.

665
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,902
Let me check your
color and shape perception.

666
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,320
Take the red cube up and
put it on the yellow pyramid.

667
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:18,530
Not possible.
- Then?

668
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,698
Reverse is possible.

669
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,659
Yellow pyramid on the red cube.

670
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,744
In a race between the
famous Greek sprinter Achilles..

671
01:00:24,745 --> 01:00:28,957
...and a tortoise, if the tortoise
gets a head start, it'll win.

672
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,292
This has been proven in a theory.

673
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:32,877
Are you aware of this?
- Yes. |I am.

674
01:00:32,878 --> 01:00:34,295
It's a paradox.

675
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,840
Actually, since it's
a conversion series..

676
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,681
...chances are that
Achilles might win as well.

677
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:41,052
What do you think?

678
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:43,388
Can we approve him?
- Sure.

679
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,141
One minute. Please.

680
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,351
Are you aware of how
precious a human life is?

681
01:00:48,352 --> 01:00:50,311
It depends on whose life it is.

682
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:52,857
Whom will you save
first during an emergency?

683
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:56,109
Doctor Einstein or a child?

684
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,444
Hypothetical question.

685
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:03,117
Smart answer.

686
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,286
Now follow my commands.

687
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,621
Please get up.

688
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,874
Turn. Walk.

689
01:01:10,624 --> 01:01:13,252
Turn right. Run forward.

690
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:15,588
Run around.

691
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,298
Run back.

692
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:20,426
Turn left. Jump.

693
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,138
Right. Run forward.

694
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:29,226
Fast. Faster. Faster.

695
01:01:31,812 --> 01:01:34,148
Catch. Kill Vaseegaran.

696
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,484
Stop.

697
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:42,948
Take it out.

698
01:01:47,786 --> 01:01:50,706
This is a dangerous machine.
It can kill anyone.

699
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,416
We can't approve him.

700
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,250
No, Professor.

701
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:56,294
You confused him by
giving him random commands.

702
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,630
That's the problem.

703
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,633
He doesn't know what's good, bad,
friendship or enmity.

704
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:04,553
It is just a stupid
inference engine. That's all.

705
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,388
If he's enrolled into the army..

706
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:10,184
...he could attack our
generals instead of the enemy.

707
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,604
He had chopped off the
hand of a traffic cop.

708
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:19,068
He had beaten a passenger of
an electric train into a pulp.

709
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:24,365
This robot can be used only as
a work horse in some factory.

710
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,623
Sorry, doctor. Cannot clear.

711
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:35,166
Professor, what do
you have against me?

712
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:36,417
Tell me.
- Please.

713
01:02:36,418 --> 01:02:38,003
Please don't misunderstand me.

714
01:02:38,462 --> 01:02:40,130
I have nothing against you.

715
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,509
But science mustn't get defamed.
- But..

716
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,691
Why, Chitti?

717
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,693
I taught you everything,
still you messed it all up.

718
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,152
What wrong have I done?

719
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:05,488
I did whatever
they asked me to do.

720
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:06,906
Are you going to kill if
they tell you to kill?

721
01:03:06,907 --> 01:03:08,367
This is what 'kill' means.

722
01:03:15,749 --> 01:03:16,875
Chitti, stop the car.

723
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:21,713
Someone, douse it with water.

724
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,673
<i>Sir, the fire brigade
troops can't get close.</i>

725
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,383
Lots of people are
trapped inside, sir.

726
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,218
Send more force immediately, sir.

727
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:29,179
Chitti, can you save them?

728
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,390
It is 799 degree Celsius.

729
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,600
I can resist fire up to
1000 degrees. I can save them.

730
01:03:34,601 --> 01:03:38,105
Go. Chitti, no life should be harmed.
- Okay.

731
01:03:53,787 --> 01:03:55,622
Someone help. Please.

732
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,585
Save me. Save me.

733
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,421
Someone. Please.

734
01:04:02,921 --> 01:04:04,130
Don't worry.

735
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,675
I'm Chitti. The robot.
I'm here to save you.

736
01:04:21,273 --> 01:04:23,692
I would've been dead
if it had not for him.

737
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:25,527
Well done, Chitti.
- Thank you.

738
01:04:25,986 --> 01:04:31,575
Help. Someone help.

739
01:04:55,265 --> 01:04:57,601
Professor, are you watching the TV?

740
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,352
You'd rejected the robot
citing that he is a threat..

741
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,812
...to human life, hadn't you?

742
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,774
Now he is saving people from
the fire. Watch it yourself.

743
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,951
Someone help. Someone
save me from this fire.

744
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,578
Someone help. Help.

745
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,043
Get down.

746
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:31,176
Selvi.
- Everyone's out, right? Please check.

747
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:32,845
Selvi.
- What happened, Aunty?

748
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,930
My daughter Selvi was
having a bath inside.

749
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:39,350
I don't know what happened.
Save my daughter.

750
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:40,602
Chitti.

751
01:06:00,038 --> 01:06:04,376
Help. Someone help.

752
01:06:05,752 --> 01:06:08,172
Save me.

753
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,257
Save me.

754
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,969
Don't come near me. I'm
not wearing any clothes.

755
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,053
No. Leave me.

756
01:06:16,054 --> 01:06:17,430
So what? Nor am I.

757
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,224
No.

758
01:06:25,063 --> 01:06:27,483
I'm not wearing any clothes.
Leave me.

759
01:06:28,942 --> 01:06:33,655
Everyone's watching me. Leave me.

760
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:37,534
Leave me.
- Here's Selvi.

761
01:06:39,786 --> 01:06:41,788
You have done something so stupid.

762
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,165
She is not wearing any clothes.

763
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,542
But she is alive.

764
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,587
Selvi. Dear, Selvi.
- They are taking my pictures.

765
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,632
Look, don't take pictures. Please.

766
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,634
Please listen to me. Please.
- Selvi. Selvi, stop.

767
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,219
Where are you going?
- Hey. Stop.

768
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,639
Don't run.
- Selvi. - Stop.

769
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:09,816
Selvi. Selvi, I
had told you to stop.

770
01:07:10,108 --> 01:07:13,737
But you did not listen to me. Selvi.

771
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:18,742
So, Vasee. He killed the poor girl.
- "What have you done, Selvi? ♪

772
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:21,912
I had told you that it's a
stupid machine, hadn't 1?

773
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,456
It's dangerous to leave him free.

774
01:07:25,457 --> 01:07:27,501
I did the right
thing by rejecting him.

775
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,378
You've proven this yourself.

776
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:31,880
Bad luck, Vasee.

777
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,886
You're an idiot.

778
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:40,596
Why did you not cover
her up with a cloth?

779
01:07:40,597 --> 01:07:42,516
Vaseegaran, how will
you explain it to him?

780
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,018
He is not a human, but a humanoid.

781
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:48,897
How will you explain to
this machine what ho nor is?

782
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,399
Professor.

783
01:07:51,149 --> 01:07:54,860
CNN, Times have run the
video of that girl's suicide..

784
01:07:54,861 --> 01:07:57,406
...and made a mockery of it.

785
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:01,910
The defence minister is putting
pressure on me to stop this research.

786
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:03,870
No, Professor.

787
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,205
I can't do that.

788
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:07,748
I can fix him by making
changes in his programming.

789
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:09,001
How will you?

790
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:11,169
He can't tell a man and woman apart?

791
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,004
<i>He doesn't know what
ho nor and ignominy is.</i>

792
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:15,674
He is a stone who doesn't
understand human emotions.

793
01:08:16,758 --> 01:08:18,926
I can give him human emotions.

794
01:08:18,927 --> 01:08:20,137
Impossible.

795
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,263
Only God can give that.

796
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,848
The things that
weren't possible for humans..

797
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,267
...previously, are possible today.

798
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,184
You are my senior.

799
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:30,856
That's why I'm telling you.
It's a waste of time and energy.

800
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,983
10 years, Professor.

801
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,860
10 years of hard work.

802
01:08:35,193 --> 01:08:36,611
Won't I get the fruit of that?

803
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,281
You will. But from somewhere else.

804
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:44,452
I've contacts with lots of
international..

805
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,787
...robot making companies.

806
01:08:46,121 --> 01:08:47,664
Hand him over to me.

807
01:08:48,248 --> 01:08:50,751
I can get you millions of dollars.

808
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:53,879
No, Professor. I'm not
doing this for money.

809
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:56,173
My goal is to hand
him over to our army.

810
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:00,844
Not possible. He'll
have to come to me.

811
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:03,430
For the evaluation.

812
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,643
Give me one last chance. Please.

813
01:09:08,685 --> 01:09:11,897
Okay. Take a month and try again.

814
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:15,941
If you still can't get it sorted,
then dismantle it..

815
01:09:15,942 --> 01:09:18,662
...and sell him to a scrap dealer
and buy some dates from that money.

816
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:21,073
It's very good for the heart.

817
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,200
You'll need it.

818
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,043
Sir, we've been working very hard..

819
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:36,087
...in this lab for the last 5 years.

820
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,838
We've got ho thing but
thrashing with a sandal.

821
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,279
Tell us if there is a research
position available in your lab.

822
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,844
Do you know about
Chitti's neural schema?

823
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,430
We know everything except that, sir.

824
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:48,225
I'll call if you if I need you.

825
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:53,914
What are you doing, doctor?

826
01:10:53,915 --> 01:10:56,208
I'm installing
software hormones in you.

827
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:58,795
The hormones will work only if
there are feelings in me, right?

828
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,173
I'll be carrying
out reverse mapping.

829
01:11:10,682 --> 01:11:13,976
Chitti, in this universe and earth..

830
01:11:13,977 --> 01:11:16,938
...the creation of
humans is a huge miracle.

831
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:20,816
No one knows how life in
living creatures evolved.

832
01:11:20,817 --> 01:11:22,151
What is life?

833
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:24,362
DNA. It's a basic element of life.

834
01:11:26,823 --> 01:11:28,116
Is this life?

835
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:30,034
Life is no formula.

836
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,912
Oh, God. How do I explain to you?

837
01:11:32,245 --> 01:11:34,873
It's in bacteria. Not in sodium.

838
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,167
Is it in me?
- In you?

839
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,256
Chitti. Chitti.

840
01:11:44,716 --> 01:11:46,176
Careful. This way.

841
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:07,614
Do you feel any change?
- I do.

842
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:11,784
What? What?
- Your beard has grown by 0.5 mm.

843
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:13,953
Stop joking, you fool.

844
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:16,539
Do you feel any change
within you? Within you?

845
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:19,500
No.
- Wastage. You're useless.

846
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,002
Total waste. Stupid. Idiot.

847
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:22,921
Vasee, calm down.
- You keep quiet, Sana.

848
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:24,840
It won't make any difference to him.

849
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:26,423
Stupid. Fool.

850
01:12:26,424 --> 01:12:27,716
Vasee, please.

851
01:12:27,717 --> 01:12:31,596
I did not sleep. Did not eat. Did
not meet you. For so many years.

852
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:33,639
I worked hard for so many years.

853
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,016
I taught him so much. And how?

854
01:12:36,017 --> 01:12:37,935
Look, he is standing there.
Like a lamp post.

855
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:39,436
Good for nothing. Useless fellow.

856
01:12:39,437 --> 01:12:40,647
Useless machine.

857
01:12:41,147 --> 01:12:42,940
I'll dismantle you
and throw you away.

858
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,401
Don't curse me needlessly.

859
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:47,486
I've been following your
instructions correctly.

860
01:12:47,487 --> 01:12:49,989
It's not my fault if I still
can't meet your expectations.

861
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,241
It's your fault.

862
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,578
If I'm a waste, so are you.
- What did you say?

863
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:56,996
Vasee, wait.
- Leave me. Leave me.

864
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:59,124
Look, Chitti is angry.

865
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,921
He has feelings.

866
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:11,595
My God.

867
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,959
Hello, Sana. Lataka
is having lab or pains.

868
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,879
She is in a critical condition.
Come quickly.

869
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:53,135
Lataka, don't worry.
Everything will be alright.

870
01:13:53,136 --> 01:13:56,014
Don't worry. We are there.

871
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:01,060
Are there are many complications,
doctor?

872
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,311
You study here, don't you?

873
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:03,646
Fatal cause.

874
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,855
The baby is upside down.

875
01:14:04,856 --> 01:14:06,482
His neck is in knots.

876
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:08,233
Dropping pulse rate. Blood loss.

877
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:10,361
There are so many complications.

878
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:13,198
It's difficult to
save even one of them.

879
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:15,699
She got married recently.

880
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,451
Her husband died while
serving for the military.

881
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:19,371
She was alive only for this child.

882
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:21,872
Please, doctor. Save her somehow.

883
01:14:21,873 --> 01:14:25,084
I can only try, Sana. The rest is..

884
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:26,419
May I try?

885
01:14:27,295 --> 01:14:29,339
Who are you? A doctor?
- No.

886
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,340
I'm Chitti. The robot.

887
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:33,550
Robot?
- Chitti, can you do this?

888
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:36,804
Why not?
- Sorry. We can't allow this.

889
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,681
This is not a lab.
This is a lab or ward.

890
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,265
Both are under total risk.

891
01:14:40,266 --> 01:14:43,227
This is a nightmare even for
experienced people like us.

892
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,395
I can pull this off.

893
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:46,063
I've studied this for Sana's exams.

894
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,648
Even Sana can't do this.

895
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:48,857
You need
qualification and experience..

896
01:14:48,858 --> 01:14:50,609
...to carry out a caesarean.

897
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:51,903
It's against the medical law.

898
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:53,677
There is not need for the caesarean.

899
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:55,546
I can help her deliver
the baby the natural way.

900
01:14:55,558 --> 01:14:56,281
How will you do it?

901
01:14:56,282 --> 01:14:58,325
Both of them will die.
She's bleeding.

902
01:14:58,326 --> 01:14:59,868
We'll the plasma transfusion.

903
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:01,203
The blood pressure is high.

904
01:15:01,204 --> 01:15:02,663
She might get
convulsions any moment.

905
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,956
Can administer magsulf regimen

906
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:05,332
The pelvic is disproportionate.

907
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:07,042
Normal delivery is not possible.

908
01:15:07,043 --> 01:15:08,252
It's possible.

909
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:09,837
We can carry out Symphysiatomy.

910
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,338
An ancient method of delivery.

911
01:15:11,339 --> 01:15:12,924
By removing the hip bone.

912
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,072
Don't scream. The
baby's getting scared.

913
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,911
We are making history.

914
01:15:42,245 --> 01:15:44,325
A robot is helping deliver
a baby for the first time.

915
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:46,124
The baby is just like you.

916
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:49,669
You want to see?

917
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:53,464
Doctor, switch the Wi-Fi on.

918
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,258
I'll stream the ultra sound video.

919
01:16:08,563 --> 01:16:11,775
Hey. It's unbelievable.

920
01:16:16,988 --> 01:16:19,031
Sir, are we going to see
such operations in the future?

921
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:21,159
Is it dangerous for the patient?

922
01:16:21,409 --> 01:16:23,285
This is a milestone in Robotics.

923
01:16:23,286 --> 01:16:25,646
This is a miracle in the
history of artificial intelligence.

924
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:40,845
She is dying.

925
01:16:41,012 --> 01:16:43,847
Just 95 seconds to go.
Keep your eyes open.

926
01:16:43,848 --> 01:16:45,724
Stay conscious.
- It's on its way out.

927
01:16:45,725 --> 01:16:47,018
Lataka.

928
01:16:49,437 --> 01:16:52,690
He'll be born exactly 40
minutes and 4 seconds past 4:00.

929
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:04,327
Done. 52 seconds to go now.

930
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,206
You can do it.

931
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,917
Only 35 seconds to go now.

932
01:17:25,723 --> 01:17:27,142
Come on.

933
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,569
Welcome.

934
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:42,865
Great.

935
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:44,117
Thank you.

936
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:48,454
Yes.

937
01:17:50,915 --> 01:17:52,375
Excuse me.

938
01:17:57,046 --> 01:17:59,132
Will you approve
Chitti at least now?

939
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,009
I will.

940
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:04,971
But the problem
will start after this.

941
01:18:09,642 --> 01:18:11,519
Let's go thank him.

942
01:18:16,107 --> 01:18:17,817
Chitti.

943
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:27,826
You were great in there.

944
01:18:27,827 --> 01:18:31,455
You did everything
so professionally.

945
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:34,876
I mean you saved both their lives.

946
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:41,758
The story has started now.

947
01:18:45,553 --> 01:18:47,305
Wait and watch.

948
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,526
It's a great day for me, Chitti.

949
01:19:01,527 --> 01:19:03,487
What a moment.

950
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:05,114
I am very happy today.

951
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,531
Thank you very much.

952
01:19:06,532 --> 01:19:08,116
Put yourself in sleeping
mode and charge yourself.

953
01:19:08,117 --> 01:19:10,036
I'll see you in the morning.
Goodnight.

954
01:19:22,548 --> 01:19:24,259
'Oh, my God.'

955
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:25,802
'Chitti.'

956
01:19:30,139 --> 01:19:31,724
'You were great.'

957
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:36,104
'You were great in there.'

958
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:58,459
No.

959
01:20:01,796 --> 01:20:04,423
Chitti, what are you
doing here at this hour?

960
01:20:04,424 --> 01:20:06,383
There was a mosquito on you cheek.

961
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:08,177
You came here to swat it?
- No.

962
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:10,805
I came here because
I wanted to see you.

963
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:12,932
What's this? Go.

964
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,393
I liked it when you kissed me today.

965
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:17,270
Kiss me again. I'll leave.

966
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:19,105
Hey, what's wrong with you?

967
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:21,189
Coming here at 1:00
in the night. Leave.

968
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:22,692
Kiss me and I'll leave.

969
01:20:23,234 --> 01:20:24,861
What's so great about it?

970
01:20:25,361 --> 01:20:26,862
I kissed you for your achievement.

971
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:28,865
Is there anyone
else pregnant at home?

972
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:30,615
Does this look
like a maternity ward?

973
01:20:30,616 --> 01:20:32,493
What else do you want
me to achieve? Tell me.

974
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:35,162
A mosquito just bit me, right?

975
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:36,664
Go and catch it.

976
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:38,416
That's all.

977
01:21:08,988 --> 01:21:10,989
Hey, who bit Sana at Happy Homes?

978
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,240
It wasn't me.

979
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:14,284
My area is across the gutter.

980
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:15,952
I belong to the Kilpogh area.

981
01:21:15,953 --> 01:21:17,662
Rangoski is from Indira Nagar.

982
01:21:17,663 --> 01:21:19,582
Who is Rangoski?
- It's me.

983
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:22,417
Did you bite Sana?
- Yes, I did.

984
01:21:22,418 --> 01:21:24,086
So what's so great about it?

985
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:26,463
I've even bitten the chief minister.

986
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:27,923
Come quietly and apologize.

987
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:29,008
Apologize?

988
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,051
Fulfil three of my demands..

989
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,636
...and then I will think about it.
- What demands?

990
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:35,556
No. 1. I want do
suck AB negative blood.

991
01:21:36,307 --> 01:21:37,599
Very yummy.

992
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,767
It's very hard to get.

993
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:40,811
Our lab technician Ravi
has that same blood group.

994
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:42,562
He keeps troubling me all the time.

995
01:21:42,563 --> 01:21:43,981
Go and bite all you want.

996
01:21:46,442 --> 01:21:49,486
No. 2. Put a ban on
companies that manufacture..

997
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:51,488
...mosquito repellents like Odomos,
All Out and Goodnight.

998
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:52,781
They disturb us a lot.

999
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:54,032
And No. 3?

1000
01:21:54,033 --> 01:21:55,951
Declare us as the national bird.

1001
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:58,620
Fools. You aren't birds,
but insects.

1002
01:21:58,621 --> 01:21:59,913
It's getting late.

1003
01:21:59,914 --> 01:22:01,706
Will you come along or..
- We won't.

1004
01:22:01,707 --> 01:22:04,709
If you don't come along,
I'll kill everyone.

1005
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:07,045
Hey. Who are you?

1006
01:22:07,046 --> 01:22:09,297
You're threatening us in our area?

1007
01:22:09,298 --> 01:22:11,258
How did humans grow so audacious?

1008
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,135
We've infected so many people..

1009
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:15,220
...with Malaria,
Dengue and Chicken Gunia.

1010
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:16,721
Did you forget that?

1011
01:22:16,722 --> 01:22:18,098
Let's show him who we are.

1012
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,266
Hey, Dengue Lakshmi.
- Yes.

1013
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,602
Cholera Jasmine
attack him! Go bite him.

1014
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:29,109
Sister, he has a thick hide.

1015
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,278
Condra Jasmine has
fractured her sting.

1016
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,571
Is that so?

1017
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:35,408
Go inside his mouth when he isn't looking.
- Fine.

1018
01:22:41,038 --> 01:22:44,333
Sister, Dengue Lakshmi got
an electric shock and died.

1019
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:48,254
Hey, this seems like a new
machine like an electric badge.

1020
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:50,005
Act that you're scared..

1021
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,298
...just like we do
when we see Tortoise..

1022
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:52,466
...and All-Out mosquito repellents.

1023
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,885
We'll deal with him later.

1024
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:58,598
You can take Rangoski.

1025
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:00,683
Thank you.

1026
01:23:03,644 --> 01:23:05,020
Look, Sana.

1027
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:06,981
This is the mosquito. Rangoski.

1028
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:11,027
Rangoski, apologize to Sana.
- Sorry.

1029
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:14,404
Don't fly around this house again.

1030
01:23:14,405 --> 01:23:16,908
Tell your friends as well.
- Yes, boss.

1031
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:18,493
Go.

1032
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:22,204
Now kiss me.
- Chitti.

1033
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:23,539
Deal is a deal.

1034
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,860
This way.

1035
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:48,405
Welcome.

1036
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:53,911
Okay, I'll call you later.

1037
01:28:56,455 --> 01:28:57,915
Hello.

1038
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:01,460
Bora is coming with agent Shah.

1039
01:29:03,295 --> 01:29:04,839
Meet him.
- How do you do?

1040
01:29:11,011 --> 01:29:12,428
There are many
terrorist organizations..

1041
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:14,389
...that want to use
robots instead of humans..

1042
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,725
...for spreading
terrors and suicide squads.

1043
01:29:21,021 --> 01:29:22,897
They're ready to pay any price.

1044
01:29:22,898 --> 01:29:24,525
They've a clients
all over the world.

1045
01:29:26,652 --> 01:29:28,778
They want to see your model.

1046
01:29:28,779 --> 01:29:31,740
Well, the prototype is ready.

1047
01:29:32,241 --> 01:29:34,325
I am programming functionalities.

1048
01:29:34,326 --> 01:29:35,869
You can have a look at the design..

1049
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,163
...and some
functional modules in action.

1050
01:29:56,098 --> 01:29:57,391
Great.

1051
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,311
They want 100 robots.

1052
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:02,646
The delivery in March.

1053
01:30:05,024 --> 01:30:06,232
This is your advance.

1054
01:30:06,233 --> 01:30:07,401
That's a deal.

1055
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,030
Please be seated.

1056
01:30:14,783 --> 01:30:16,200
What about the robots?

1057
01:30:16,201 --> 01:30:18,078
It's almost ready.

1058
01:30:20,497 --> 01:30:22,832
According to the contract you
should've made the delivery.

1059
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:24,542
You're only showing us moulds.

1060
01:30:24,543 --> 01:30:26,295
We're running intense testing.

1061
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,505
I'm fine tuning it to zero-defect.

1062
01:30:29,506 --> 01:30:32,800
I request you for at
least a month's extension.

1063
01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:35,930
We're disappointed, Dr. Bora.

1064
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:41,518
The 3rd of April is your deadline.

1065
01:30:41,977 --> 01:30:43,812
Hope you understand.

1066
01:30:59,244 --> 01:31:02,414
Gift pack this.
- Why?

1067
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,249
It's Sana's birthday.

1068
01:31:07,252 --> 01:31:09,879
Gift pack this as well.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1069
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,090
What for?
- I want to give Sana a gift as well.

1070
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:14,008
I am giving one.
- So will I.

1071
01:31:14,009 --> 01:31:16,011
Who will pay?
- You will.

1072
01:31:16,178 --> 01:31:17,428
Why me?

1073
01:31:17,429 --> 01:31:22,308
My salary.
- Machines don't get salaries.

1074
01:31:22,309 --> 01:31:23,851
Do cars and
refrigerators get salary?

1075
01:31:23,852 --> 01:31:25,229
I am not a machine.

1076
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,189
If you don't pay me,
I will go on strike.

1077
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:29,482
I won't charge my battery.

1078
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:30,942
I will stage a hunger strike.

1079
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:34,112
You'll ask for a credit card as well.
- I don't want it.

1080
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:35,948
I know your credit card number.

1081
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,535
I know your signature as well.
- That's the limit.

1082
01:31:40,327 --> 01:31:41,787
Pack both of them.

1083
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:07,980
Super.

1084
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:15,362
Okay?

1085
01:32:23,328 --> 01:32:25,204
Who will drive the car?
- You will.

1086
01:32:25,205 --> 01:32:26,832
I am on a holiday.

1087
01:32:43,557 --> 01:32:45,476
Keep your eyes on
the road while driving.

1088
01:32:49,605 --> 01:32:50,813
Mother, take this.

1089
01:32:50,814 --> 01:32:52,732
Happy birthday, Sana.
- Hey, Vasee.

1090
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,067
Many happy returns of the day.

1091
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:55,443
Thank you.

1092
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:56,862
Thank you so much.

1093
01:32:57,112 --> 01:32:58,363
Hi, Sana.

1094
01:32:59,573 --> 01:33:02,992
Chitti. That's a new look.
- Thank you.

1095
01:33:02,993 --> 01:33:05,871
It's been 200,000
hours since you were born.

1096
01:33:06,455 --> 01:33:08,999
To the world's most beautiful girl.

1097
01:33:10,459 --> 01:33:12,752
Chitti, you brought a gift for me?

1098
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,213
That's so sweet.

1099
01:33:17,716 --> 01:33:19,551
Wow, Chitti. This is awesome.

1100
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:21,929
Mother, just help me.

1101
01:33:27,309 --> 01:33:29,603
Vasee, how does it look?
- Very nice.

1102
01:33:30,437 --> 01:33:31,771
Nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

1103
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:33,189
I love it, Chitti. Thank you.

1104
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,775
I've given you a similar necklace.

1105
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:38,237
It's a gift from your Chitti,
right? That's special.

1106
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:48,205
Happy birthday to you.

1107
01:33:48,413 --> 01:33:51,249
Happy birthday to you.

1108
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:56,380
Happy birthday to dear Sana.

1109
01:33:59,758 --> 01:34:01,426
Can I have your attention please?

1110
01:34:02,052 --> 01:34:03,846
I have an announcement for you.

1111
01:34:04,638 --> 01:34:08,349
Soon I am going to.. Marry
this beautiful birthday girl.

1112
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:12,271
And today.. I announce my marriage.

1113
01:34:18,443 --> 01:34:20,653
Folks, it's time to dance.

1114
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:22,071
Get started and move.

1115
01:34:22,072 --> 01:34:23,448
Waltz, please.

1116
01:34:27,077 --> 01:34:28,953
Come on, Vasee.
- No, no, I can't dance.

1117
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:30,496
Come on.
- Sana, I can't..

1118
01:34:30,497 --> 01:34:32,082
Just try. Come..

1119
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:52,102
Shall we dance?
- Sure.

1120
01:34:53,061 --> 01:34:55,063
Hey, this is boring music.

1121
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:58,192
Can we have some blast, please?
- Sure.

1122
01:36:26,071 --> 01:36:27,739
Rascal, what are you doing?

1123
01:36:28,198 --> 01:36:30,283
I felt like kissing Sana and I did.

1124
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:33,160
It's wrong to kiss other's
girlfriend, don't you know that?

1125
01:36:33,161 --> 01:36:34,870
I know. It's in the list of rules.

1126
01:36:34,871 --> 01:36:36,247
But I felt like breaking the rules.

1127
01:36:36,248 --> 01:36:38,791
Enough. You won't wander around her now.
- Why?

1128
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:39,876
What do you mean by why?

1129
01:36:40,043 --> 01:36:41,669
Because I love her.

1130
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:42,963
I love her as well.

1131
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:47,425
Don't be crazy.

1132
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:48,634
That's not possible.

1133
01:36:48,635 --> 01:36:50,177
You're a machine.
- Yes.

1134
01:36:50,178 --> 01:36:51,846
But a machine with
all the feelings..

1135
01:36:51,847 --> 01:36:53,932
...like happiness,
sorrow, love and anger.

1136
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:56,350
You've been given these emotions..

1137
01:36:56,351 --> 01:36:58,477
...so that at the right
time you can use them..

1138
01:36:58,478 --> 01:37:01,272
...to make the right
decision and not to misuse them.

1139
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:02,690
I like this feeling.

1140
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:04,568
I want Sana. Dot.

1141
01:37:05,193 --> 01:37:06,569
What are you saying, Chitti?

1142
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:09,071
I am going to marry her, you fool.

1143
01:37:09,072 --> 01:37:10,990
You can marry someone else.

1144
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,491
You can't do this, Chitti.

1145
01:37:12,492 --> 01:37:13,701
I've built you.

1146
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:14,827
This is called revolt.

1147
01:37:14,828 --> 01:37:16,329
You can do this, Vasee.

1148
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:18,456
Forget your love for your research.

1149
01:37:18,457 --> 01:37:19,916
That's called sacrifice.

1150
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:21,292
I will beat you up..
- Vasee.

1151
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:23,003
You'll only hurt yourself.

1152
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:26,130
I'll dismantle you.
- I don't like it.

1153
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:28,049
What did you say, you scoundrel?
- Vasee.

1154
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:29,301
Calm down.

1155
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:31,719
Chitti, listen to me.

1156
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,888
You speak so tenderly,
he just scolds.

1157
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:35,181
Do you want me to be
affectionate instead?

1158
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:36,432
Ask him to shut up.
- You..

1159
01:37:36,433 --> 01:37:37,726
Vasee.

1160
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,978
Chitti, please understand.

1161
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:43,731
Regardless of all the
emotions that you have..

1162
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:45,524
...it's impossible for a machine
and a girl to fall in love..

1163
01:37:45,525 --> 01:37:46,942
...with each other.

1164
01:37:46,943 --> 01:37:48,152
Why is it impossible?

1165
01:37:48,153 --> 01:37:50,237
I'm no less compared to any human.

1166
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:52,323
I'll look after you
better than him, Sana.

1167
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:54,325
He's talking nonsense
and you're listening.

1168
01:37:54,326 --> 01:37:55,618
Ask him not to interfere
in between.

1169
01:37:55,619 --> 01:37:57,536
Shut up.
- Vasee, please.

1170
01:37:57,537 --> 01:37:59,038
He doesn't even know how to cook.

1171
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:00,456
I can cook thousands of dishes.

1172
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:02,833
I can sing lullabies in 32
languages and tuck you in.

1173
01:38:02,834 --> 01:38:04,668
He'll grow old. His
hair will turn grey.

1174
01:38:04,669 --> 01:38:05,879
He will die.

1175
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,588
But I will never die.

1176
01:38:07,589 --> 01:38:09,674
I will always keep you happy, Sana.

1177
01:38:10,634 --> 01:38:12,009
I don't mean that, Chitti.

1178
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:13,720
Then what? Sex?

1179
01:38:14,513 --> 01:38:16,305
Is sex life?

1180
01:38:16,306 --> 01:38:18,141
Can't we have love without sex?

1181
01:38:19,017 --> 01:38:21,102
That's not it, Chitti.
- Then?

1182
01:38:21,103 --> 01:38:24,063
Children? There are millions
of impotent men in India, Sana.

1183
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:25,940
Don't they adopt
children and lead a happy life?

1184
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:28,025
That's not it, Chitti.
- Then what is it?

1185
01:38:28,026 --> 01:38:30,736
Whatever you're
saying is against nature.

1186
01:38:30,737 --> 01:38:33,823
You weren't born, you can't die,
you don't get hungry or thirsty.

1187
01:38:33,824 --> 01:38:35,825
You're not a living organism.

1188
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:37,910
Only a man and
woman can fall in love.

1189
01:38:37,911 --> 01:38:39,955
I love Vaseegaran.

1190
01:38:41,873 --> 01:38:44,292
You're like my best friend.

1191
01:38:46,545 --> 01:38:50,297
It's difficult for humans to forget,
Chitti. But what is it for you?

1192
01:38:50,298 --> 01:38:53,135
It will take you a
second to erase my memories.

1193
01:38:53,844 --> 01:38:55,429
Erase them.

1194
01:38:56,805 --> 01:38:58,723
Erase me off your memory.

1195
01:39:32,048 --> 01:39:33,842
Who? Who are you?

1196
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:36,302
Your friend, professor Bora, Chitti.

1197
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:37,511
Why are you here?

1198
01:39:37,512 --> 01:39:38,721
You're upset.

1199
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:40,389
I am here to sympathize.

1200
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:41,891
You're my boss's enemy.

1201
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:43,309
You rejected me.

1202
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,769
I don't want to talk to you.

1203
01:39:44,978 --> 01:39:46,771
If I hadn't rejected you..

1204
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:50,400
...then you wouldn't have learned
to get angry or love, Chitti.

1205
01:39:51,568 --> 01:39:53,361
I've done you a favor instead.

1206
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:56,197
Vaseegaran treats you so badly.

1207
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:58,616
I don't want to hear anything.
You can go now.

1208
01:39:58,617 --> 01:40:02,620
In today's world, you're
the most advanced robot..

1209
01:40:02,621 --> 01:40:05,164
...that has its own feelings.

1210
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:10,336
He used you a lot for cooking,
washing and cleaning toilets.

1211
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:14,089
What did he give you in return,
Chitti? Nothing.

1212
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:16,050
If you had been with me..

1213
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:18,219
...would've
treated you like a king.

1214
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:19,888
You're polluting me.

1215
01:40:21,723 --> 01:40:23,891
I'm only explaining
you your importance.

1216
01:40:23,892 --> 01:40:25,935
You're greater than humans.

1217
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:29,146
You've the right to
desire anything in this world.

1218
01:40:29,147 --> 01:40:30,731
Even Sana.

1219
01:40:30,732 --> 01:40:32,650
But they say it's against nature.

1220
01:40:32,651 --> 01:40:35,987
No. It's the miracle of nature.

1221
01:40:36,154 --> 01:40:37,656
Sana loves Vaseegaran.

1222
01:40:37,989 --> 01:40:39,115
Let her.

1223
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:42,368
Don't lovers change their mind..

1224
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:44,328
...and fall in love with others?

1225
01:40:44,329 --> 01:40:46,330
Similarly, Sana can
also change her mind..

1226
01:40:46,331 --> 01:40:48,415
...and fall in love
with you, isn't it?

1227
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:49,750
Don't confuse me.

1228
01:40:49,751 --> 01:40:51,502
Tomorrow's my army evaluation.

1229
01:40:51,503 --> 01:40:54,005
I've to check my
diagnostics and troubleshoot.

1230
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:56,967
Okay, Chitti. All the best.

1231
01:40:57,342 --> 01:41:01,178
You'll anyway get selected in
the army evaluation tomorrow.

1232
01:41:01,179 --> 01:41:03,889
Vaseegaran will earn a
lot of fame and fortune.

1233
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,933
Then he'll marry Sana..

1234
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:08,603
...and go for a honeymoon in Kashmir.

1235
01:41:08,853 --> 01:41:15,359
And you.. Can cook bread on
the border of that Kashmir.

1236
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,195
Chitti, who are you talking to?

1237
01:41:18,196 --> 01:41:19,447
With myself.

1238
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:23,200
Are you ready for
tomorrow's evaluation?

1239
01:41:23,201 --> 01:41:24,369
Ready, doctor.

1240
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:31,166
Gentlemen, this robot is a fine
example of human brain's excellence.

1241
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:34,169
It's equal to 100
soldiers when it comes to..

1242
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:36,131
...agility, strength
and fighting skills.

1243
01:41:36,798 --> 01:41:40,426
It can protect our boundaries
as well as attack our enemies.

1244
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:42,344
In short, he is one man army.

1245
01:41:42,345 --> 01:41:44,096
I gift it to the Indian Army.

1246
01:41:44,097 --> 01:41:45,431
You can test it for yourself.

1247
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:48,183
Chitti, can you spot
HE-36 hand grenade?

1248
01:41:48,184 --> 01:41:49,352
Yes, General.

1249
01:41:50,061 --> 01:41:51,312
Smart.

1250
01:41:51,313 --> 01:41:53,690
Can you bomb Tent No. 3 with that?

1251
01:42:05,702 --> 01:42:06,910
What is this?

1252
01:42:06,911 --> 01:42:08,079
Sana.

1253
01:42:10,999 --> 01:42:12,167
Chitti.

1254
01:42:15,128 --> 01:42:16,379
Sana.

1255
01:42:16,838 --> 01:42:19,924
The beautiful girl who
compels machines to love.

1256
01:42:22,761 --> 01:42:23,887
What?

1257
01:42:24,054 --> 01:42:27,557
Her touch turns a
machine into a human.

1258
01:42:27,849 --> 01:42:30,059
And a human turns into a machine.

1259
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,727
Chitti, what is this? Throw it.

1260
01:42:31,728 --> 01:42:35,106
Her tresses are like
a black waterfall.

1261
01:42:36,232 --> 01:42:39,903
Her forehead is
like a piece of moon.

1262
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:45,408
Her eyes are like a deep blue
sea which can drown the world.

1263
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:51,581
Her lips are like soft rose petals.

1264
01:42:54,459 --> 01:42:58,380
Her waist that sways like a serpent.

1265
01:43:01,049 --> 01:43:02,758
And..
- Chitti, stop it.

1266
01:43:02,759 --> 01:43:04,927
What nonsense is this,
Dr. Vaseegaran?

1267
01:43:04,928 --> 01:43:07,262
Instead of fighting a war,
this robot is reciting poetry.

1268
01:43:07,263 --> 01:43:08,517
I'm sorry, General.

1269
01:43:08,529 --> 01:43:12,060
Friends, drop your arms
and catch stoles instead.

1270
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:15,604
Forget the cannons and
fall in love with someone.

1271
01:43:15,605 --> 01:43:16,939
Why should we fight a war?
- Chitti?

1272
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:18,774
What are these weapons for?

1273
01:43:18,775 --> 01:43:22,737
Love is something that
turns foes into friends.

1274
01:43:23,029 --> 01:43:25,906
Wow. Mr. Sinha,
I want you all to see..

1275
01:43:25,907 --> 01:43:27,218
Chitti, don't embarrass me further

1276
01:43:27,242 --> 01:43:29,368
No war, only love.

1277
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:32,956
Stupid scientist, stupid machine.
- Waste of time.

1278
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,751
You ruined my reputation.

1279
01:43:37,752 --> 01:43:40,129
Doctor, what are you doing?

1280
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:42,424
You destroyed my dreams.

1281
01:43:42,757 --> 01:43:44,550
Doctor, don't hit me.

1282
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:46,636
I treated you as my son.

1283
01:43:50,056 --> 01:43:51,516
I want to live.

1284
01:43:51,891 --> 01:43:53,059
Let me live.

1285
01:43:53,268 --> 01:43:54,476
Please.

1286
01:43:54,477 --> 01:43:57,646
I won't let a useless machine
like you live in this world.

1287
01:43:57,647 --> 01:43:59,274
I will destroy it.

1288
01:44:00,442 --> 01:44:01,942
What's my mistake?

1289
01:44:01,943 --> 01:44:03,653
It's all my fault.

1290
01:44:06,781 --> 01:44:08,825
Did I tell you to make me?

1291
01:44:09,451 --> 01:44:11,745
Did I tell you to give me emotions?

1292
01:44:13,037 --> 01:44:15,415
Did I tell Sana to kiss me?

1293
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:17,041
You..

1294
01:44:19,085 --> 01:44:20,836
You did all this.

1295
01:44:20,837 --> 01:44:22,255
Now I want to live.

1296
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:26,092
You are killing me.
This is injustice.

1297
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:29,971
Shut up.

1298
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:36,685
Spare me. I want to live.

1299
01:44:36,686 --> 01:44:40,315
I want to love. I love Sana.

1300
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:46,988
I want Sana.

1301
01:44:47,363 --> 01:44:49,532
I love Sana.

1302
01:45:54,848 --> 01:45:57,892
Forget it, Vasee. I am
also feeling sad about it.

1303
01:45:58,476 --> 01:46:00,728
For how long will you stay
like this remembering him?

1304
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:05,148
Chitti is gone, so let him.
It is just a machine.

1305
01:46:05,149 --> 01:46:06,985
You are a great scientist.

1306
01:46:07,151 --> 01:46:09,237
You can make many
more Chittis like him.

1307
01:46:10,029 --> 01:46:12,490
I never considered
Chitti as a machine, Sana.

1308
01:46:12,824 --> 01:46:14,867
I have brought you out so
that you can forget him.

1309
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:16,577
And all you are doing
is thinking about him.

1310
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:18,120
You have to snap out of it.

1311
01:46:18,121 --> 01:46:19,873
Divert your mind.

1312
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,749
Chitti was my life time achievement.

1313
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,419
<i>My 10 years' hard work.</i>

1314
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:37,724
Come, let's go for a walk.

1315
01:46:39,642 --> 01:46:41,603
Are you coming to the
beach with me or not?

1316
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:43,980
I don't feel like it.
You go ahead, Sana.

1317
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:47,609
If you don't come with me,
I will surely stop loving you.

1318
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,528
Okay, I will go alone.

1319
01:46:51,529 --> 01:46:54,324
I will make the first
man I meet my boyfriend.

1320
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:02,790
Hello.

1321
01:47:04,334 --> 01:47:05,752
Hi.

1322
01:47:08,796 --> 01:47:12,008
Hello. Wait. Listen.

1323
01:47:12,467 --> 01:47:13,842
What is your name?

1324
01:47:13,843 --> 01:47:15,052
Bachimohan.

1325
01:47:15,053 --> 01:47:17,764
Bachi, will you be my
boyfriend for a day?

1326
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:20,223
Boyfriend for a day?
- Yes.

1327
01:47:20,224 --> 01:47:21,350
Like in the movie 'Na yak'
(Indian movie) the hero..

1328
01:47:21,351 --> 01:47:22,559
...was made the CM for one day.

1329
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,019
Similarly, I want you to
be my boyfriend for a day.

1330
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:26,730
Oh, God. You are fair and
beautiful. I am dark and ugly.

1331
01:47:26,731 --> 01:47:29,734
I will be your boyfriend?
- Yes.

1332
01:47:30,485 --> 01:47:33,654
How should I thank you?
I cannot believe it.

1333
01:47:33,655 --> 01:47:36,531
It's like hitting a jackpot of
1 billion sitting back home.

1334
01:47:36,532 --> 01:47:38,909
Okay, what gift are you
giving your girlfriend?

1335
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:41,432
There is country liquor,
dry fish.. Have some.

1336
01:47:41,444 --> 01:47:42,288
Okay.

1337
01:47:48,795 --> 01:47:50,380
Cheers.

1338
01:48:03,267 --> 01:48:06,354
Have some and experience the high.
- No, thanks.

1339
01:48:06,646 --> 01:48:08,231
Can I have some?

1340
01:48:14,278 --> 01:48:15,947
It's useless.

1341
01:48:16,531 --> 01:48:18,449
Okay, Bachi. I'll make a move.

1342
01:48:19,993 --> 01:48:22,412
Hey, why did you catch my hand?

1343
01:48:23,371 --> 01:48:26,373
Come on. You made me
your boyfriend for a day.

1344
01:48:26,374 --> 01:48:28,000
You enkindled desires in me.

1345
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:30,043
How can you leave now?
- Disgusting.

1346
01:48:30,044 --> 01:48:31,420
My boyfriend is over there.

1347
01:48:31,421 --> 01:48:33,046
I said all that to make him jealous.

1348
01:48:33,047 --> 01:48:34,506
Let go. Let go of my hand.

1349
01:48:34,507 --> 01:48:36,049
What do you think I am?

1350
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:38,051
Come on, satisfy by desires quietly.

1351
01:48:38,052 --> 01:48:40,637
Let go. Vasee.

1352
01:48:40,638 --> 01:48:41,847
Vasee.

1353
01:48:41,848 --> 01:48:43,640
Why are you calling Vasee?

1354
01:48:43,641 --> 01:48:45,851
Hey, are you calling your man?

1355
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:47,227
I won't let go of you
no matter who comes.

1356
01:48:47,228 --> 01:48:48,521
Vasee.

1357
01:48:49,605 --> 01:48:50,773
Vasee, come.

1358
01:48:51,482 --> 01:48:52,775
Now.

1359
01:48:53,985 --> 01:48:55,694
Let go of her.

1360
01:48:55,695 --> 01:48:58,196
She is my girlfriend for today.

1361
01:48:58,197 --> 01:48:59,531
You can come tomorrow.

1362
01:48:59,532 --> 01:49:00,949
Hey, I will kill you.

1363
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:03,285
Hey, I will slice you up.

1364
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:04,953
Police. Police.
- Police.

1365
01:49:04,954 --> 01:49:06,204
Help. Help.

1366
01:49:06,205 --> 01:49:07,873
Hey, I know the IG
(Inspector General).

1367
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:10,292
Look, I will call him
up and get you arrested.

1368
01:49:10,293 --> 01:49:13,920
Hey, I will never get such a
beautiful girl in my life.

1369
01:49:13,921 --> 01:49:16,423
I am ready to spend the rest
of my life in prison for her.

1370
01:49:16,424 --> 01:49:18,008
Call anyone you want.
Go ahead and call him.

1371
01:49:18,009 --> 01:49:20,093
God. It would have been so
nice if Chitti was here.

1372
01:49:20,094 --> 01:49:21,636
He would've broken all his bones.

1373
01:49:21,637 --> 01:49:23,639
Now why are you
reminding me of Chitti?

1374
01:49:24,766 --> 01:49:26,559
Vasee, do something.

1375
01:49:27,351 --> 01:49:28,602
Now there is only one option left.

1376
01:49:28,603 --> 01:49:31,230
What?
- One. Two..

1377
01:49:32,231 --> 01:49:33,357
Three.

1378
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:36,611
Escape.

1379
01:49:37,987 --> 01:49:39,989
Not bad.
- Run. Run.

1380
01:55:41,809 --> 01:55:44,727
Chitti cannot be connected through
virtual call. What happened?

1381
01:55:44,728 --> 01:55:46,729
Chitti was dismantled and
thrown in the garbage after..

1382
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:48,274
...the army evaluation, sir.

1383
01:55:48,691 --> 01:55:50,400
We don't keep 2-days' old junk here.

1384
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:52,777
Sir, it must have been
thrown out of the city by now.

1385
01:55:52,778 --> 01:55:54,071
Where?
- Dharamgudi.

1386
01:56:01,454 --> 01:56:04,248
Sana, what did you do to
make him change his mind?

1387
01:56:05,666 --> 01:56:08,001
When should we fix the wedding?

1388
01:56:08,002 --> 01:56:09,711
I still haven't done much, Father.

1389
01:56:09,712 --> 01:56:11,379
I'll make another robot and..

1390
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:13,883
I'll kill you if you
mention robot again.

1391
01:56:14,175 --> 01:56:17,219
Son, isn't one
broken television enough?

1392
01:56:17,553 --> 01:56:20,221
Uncle, give me a wedding
necklace if you have one.

1393
01:56:20,222 --> 01:56:21,389
We'll get over with it right away.

1394
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:23,308
Okay. Okay. I understand your worry.

1395
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:25,226
Do one thing.
Exchange rings for now.

1396
01:56:25,227 --> 01:56:27,563
We will get you married on
the next auspicious date.

1397
01:57:21,116 --> 01:57:22,326
Hey.

1398
01:57:27,706 --> 01:57:32,586
Help. Help.

1399
01:57:33,128 --> 01:57:37,299
Take me to Professor Bora's lab.

1400
01:57:40,427 --> 01:57:45,015
Address. A-417, Niketan Colony.

1401
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:47,893
The world is so small, Chitti.

1402
01:57:54,108 --> 01:57:57,278
I want to live.

1403
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:01,114
I want to love.

1404
01:58:01,115 --> 01:58:03,909
I love Sana.

1405
01:58:05,327 --> 01:58:10,249
Help me, Professor. Please.

1406
01:58:10,791 --> 01:58:14,211
Make me as I was before.

1407
01:58:14,461 --> 01:58:16,046
I want to live.

1408
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:19,592
I want Sana.

1409
01:58:20,426 --> 01:58:22,677
And I want your neural schema.

1410
01:58:22,678 --> 01:58:25,597
You can take whatever you want.

1411
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:29,018
Make me the Chitti I was, please.

1412
01:58:30,352 --> 01:58:31,729
I will, Chitti.

1413
01:58:32,688 --> 01:58:34,023
Don't worry.

1414
01:59:13,145 --> 01:59:16,357
What's this red chip? It
doesn't belong to Chitti.

1415
01:59:16,899 --> 01:59:18,525
This is Bora's touch.

1416
01:59:18,901 --> 01:59:21,903
Additional program for Chitti.

1417
01:59:21,904 --> 01:59:23,697
Destruction program.

1418
01:59:32,456 --> 01:59:35,668
Vaseegaran gave him the
power to protect 100 humans.

1419
01:59:36,752 --> 01:59:40,589
I am giving him the
destructive powers of 100 humans.

1420
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:45,761
In short, he is a demon now.

1421
01:59:46,136 --> 01:59:49,138
I am feeling scared, Professor.
Why are you changing all this?

1422
01:59:49,139 --> 01:59:52,350
Business. This is my business trial.

1423
01:59:52,351 --> 01:59:57,189
Business?
- My money and Vasee's defamation.

1424
02:00:50,075 --> 02:00:53,411
Thank you, Bora.
- Have a good time, Chitti.

1425
02:00:53,412 --> 02:00:55,163
I am going to meet Sana.

1426
02:00:55,164 --> 02:00:56,790
Sana won't be at home.

1427
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,708
She must be at Raja Muthiah Hall.

1428
02:00:58,709 --> 02:00:59,740
Why?

1429
02:00:59,752 --> 02:01:02,880
Vaseegaran and Sana
are getting married today.

1430
02:01:28,113 --> 02:01:30,407
Chitti, how did you come here..

1431
02:01:32,367 --> 02:01:36,163
Upgraded. Version 2.0.

1432
02:01:38,665 --> 02:01:40,166
Chitti, let go of my hand.

1433
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:41,876
Chitti, what's this?

1434
02:01:41,877 --> 02:01:43,128
Hey, Chitti. Stop.

1435
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:46,089
Vasee.

1436
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:51,595
Chitti.

1437
02:01:52,054 --> 02:01:54,096
No matter how much you force me..

1438
02:01:54,097 --> 02:01:57,768
...love Vaseegaran and will
spend my life only with him.

1439
02:01:59,102 --> 02:02:01,271
Only if he stays alive.

1440
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:10,531
Kill me before you kill Vaseegaran.

1441
02:02:11,824 --> 02:02:13,450
Vasee.

1442
02:02:24,962 --> 02:02:27,005
I spared his life because of you.

1443
02:02:33,554 --> 02:02:36,681
Move.
- Chitti, what are you doing?

1444
02:02:36,682 --> 02:02:38,225
Stop it.

1445
02:02:51,655 --> 02:02:53,866
Car no. TN09 BB11.

1446
02:03:11,842 --> 02:03:13,886
Help me. Please.

1447
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:18,640
Madam, come out fast.

1448
02:03:19,641 --> 02:03:22,561
Give me your hand. Come on. Move.

1449
02:07:13,917 --> 02:07:15,961
Happy 'Diwali'
(Festival of lights), folks.

1450
02:08:11,224 --> 02:08:12,976
What sort of robot have you made?

1451
02:08:13,143 --> 02:08:15,603
Do you know how many policemen died
and how much destruction he caused?

1452
02:08:15,604 --> 02:08:17,104
You are responsible for all this.

1453
02:08:17,105 --> 02:08:18,772
We will take action against you.

1454
02:08:18,773 --> 02:08:21,109
Sir, this is not the
robot that I created.

1455
02:08:21,401 --> 02:08:24,695
I destroyed it with my own
hands and threw it in the dustbin.

1456
02:08:24,696 --> 02:08:26,030
Even I'm not able to
understand anything.

1457
02:08:26,031 --> 02:08:28,115
First of all, we have to
find that robot and stop it.

1458
02:08:28,116 --> 02:08:29,992
You tell me some way.
- We have to find it.

1459
02:08:29,993 --> 02:08:31,786
That's my responsibility.
Give me a minute.

1460
02:08:33,788 --> 02:08:37,291
Why did you disturb me?
- Chitti, what happened to you?

1461
02:08:37,292 --> 02:08:38,709
Your system has
completely corrupted.

1462
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:40,044
I have to troubleshoot you.

1463
02:08:40,045 --> 02:08:42,129
Come to the lab with Sana.
- Never.

1464
02:08:42,130 --> 02:08:44,131
I won't take your orders any more.

1465
02:08:44,132 --> 02:08:46,008
Hey, don't forget
that I created you.

1466
02:08:46,009 --> 02:08:47,968
And then you
destroyed me with hatred.

1467
02:08:47,969 --> 02:08:50,137
Now I have got
nothing to do with you.

1468
02:08:50,138 --> 02:08:52,640
I am about to marry
Sana and start a new life.

1469
02:08:52,641 --> 02:08:54,391
Now you don't disturb me.

1470
02:08:54,392 --> 02:08:56,602
Hey, what makes you so arrogant?

1471
02:08:56,603 --> 02:08:58,187
After all you are a machine.

1472
02:08:58,188 --> 02:09:01,607
If I can make you, I
can also destroy you.

1473
02:09:01,608 --> 02:09:03,944
So come here with Sana
without making any fuss.

1474
02:09:16,915 --> 02:09:19,209
No one can destroy me.

1475
02:09:35,892 --> 02:09:38,395
Sir, cash, cheque or credit card?

1476
02:09:38,728 --> 02:09:39,854
Gun.

1477
02:09:41,523 --> 02:09:43,440
All the policemen doing
the rounds in South Chennai..

1478
02:09:43,441 --> 02:09:46,027
...shall block all the roads
of T Nagar and keep a check.

1479
02:09:54,035 --> 02:09:57,205
Move aside. Run.

1480
02:10:04,879 --> 02:10:06,755
Chitti is fleeing after
robbing City Center Mall.

1481
02:10:06,756 --> 02:10:08,632
Seal all the nearby
areas of Mahilapur.

1482
02:10:08,633 --> 02:10:10,802
Let's go to Dr. Radhakrishna road.
- Okay, sir.

1483
02:10:24,024 --> 02:10:27,484
Catch him. Someone
stop him. Catch him.

1484
02:10:27,485 --> 02:10:29,486
We got the message
that Chitti has entered..

1485
02:10:29,487 --> 02:10:31,239
...Ennur petrol filling station.

1486
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:37,829
Stop. Hey, stop.

1487
02:10:54,929 --> 02:10:57,182
The robot has gone into breakwaters.
- Good.

1488
02:10:57,557 --> 02:10:59,600
You keep following him
maintaining some distance.

1489
02:10:59,601 --> 02:11:01,519
Coast guards will
take care of the rest.

1490
02:11:15,283 --> 02:11:18,619
We had to take this risk. If
we hadn't destroyed Chitti..

1491
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:20,662
...people would've faced more damage.

1492
02:11:20,663 --> 02:11:23,415
Wasn't there any other
safer way to destroy Chitti?

1493
02:11:23,416 --> 02:11:25,250
It's so difficult
to catch one person.

1494
02:11:25,251 --> 02:11:27,544
Can you imagine how difficult
it is to catch a robot who is..

1495
02:11:27,545 --> 02:11:29,338
...equivalent to 100 men?

1496
02:11:29,339 --> 02:11:32,050
Who is the head of this operation?
- Commissioner.

1497
02:11:32,592 --> 02:11:34,219
This is not Chitti.
- What?

1498
02:11:34,886 --> 02:11:36,387
This is not the
robot that I created.

1499
02:11:36,388 --> 02:11:37,639
All the parts are different.

1500
02:11:38,098 --> 02:11:39,473
Even I don't understand.

1501
02:11:39,474 --> 02:11:41,683
He stole at four
places simultaneously.

1502
02:11:41,684 --> 02:11:43,769
And they are in four
different corners of the city.

1503
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:46,398
How is it possible for
one man to do all this?

1504
02:11:47,524 --> 02:11:49,275
I suspect one person.

1505
02:12:11,131 --> 02:12:12,799
Oh, God.

1506
02:12:23,768 --> 02:12:26,229
No one can destroy me.

1507
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:49,001
Activate command mode.
- I am CR2.

1508
02:12:49,002 --> 02:12:51,879
Speed. One terahertz. Memory.
One zeta byte.

1509
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:55,090
Command mode activated.
- Chitti, what are you doing?

1510
02:12:55,091 --> 02:12:58,427
I created myself. Now
they will create themselves.

1511
02:12:58,428 --> 02:12:59,761
Two will become four.
Four will become eight.

1512
02:12:59,762 --> 02:13:01,346
Eight will become sixteen.

1513
02:13:01,347 --> 02:13:04,776
They are my servants,
soldiers and terminators.

1514
02:13:04,788 --> 02:13:05,935
No.

1515
02:13:07,103 --> 02:13:08,688
I will never let that happen.

1516
02:13:09,230 --> 02:13:12,191
I am not Vaseegaran to
take your approval, Bora.

1517
02:13:12,192 --> 02:13:13,650
I am Chitti.

1518
02:13:13,651 --> 02:13:16,738
Look, Chitti. I have already
accepted money from the dealers.

1519
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:19,990
If we don't send them the delivery
within two days they will kill me.

1520
02:13:19,991 --> 02:13:21,367
Then die.

1521
02:13:22,285 --> 02:13:24,120
You traitor. Scoundrel.

1522
02:13:24,996 --> 02:13:27,707
You are betraying the
person who gave you life.

1523
02:13:31,127 --> 02:13:34,379
Chitti, delete all the programs
that you created immediately.

1524
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:36,006
I will slit her throat. I mean it.

1525
02:13:36,007 --> 02:13:39,218
Don't be foolish.
Delete the programs.

1526
02:13:39,219 --> 02:13:42,013
I said get on with it. Hurry up.

1527
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:48,268
Command executed.

1528
02:13:48,269 --> 02:13:50,187
Give us orders. We will shoot him.

1529
02:13:50,188 --> 02:13:52,273
No, no, no, no.

1530
02:13:54,484 --> 02:13:56,360
He gave me a new life.

1531
02:13:56,361 --> 02:13:58,905
Only I will put my hand on his head.

1532
02:14:16,965 --> 02:14:20,092
'Robot occupies AIRD.
Kills the security guard.'

1533
02:14:20,093 --> 02:14:22,261
'Let's cut across live
to our correspondent..'

1534
02:14:22,262 --> 02:14:23,662
.- who is right
there at the scene.'

1535
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:29,310
Shot the security guard.

1536
02:14:33,773 --> 02:14:37,025
As robots occupied AIRD the
entire area surrounding it..

1537
02:14:37,026 --> 02:14:39,444
.-.Has been completely evacuated.

1538
02:14:39,445 --> 02:14:41,321
And police is trying
its level best to drive..

1539
02:14:41,322 --> 02:14:43,533
...the robots out from that place.

1540
02:15:27,994 --> 02:15:30,370
This is our palace.

1541
02:15:30,371 --> 02:15:33,874
Here I am the king
and you are the queen.

1542
02:15:33,875 --> 02:15:36,627
I have filled this place
with whatever you like.

1543
02:15:36,628 --> 02:15:39,172
I have brought
everything that you need.

1544
02:15:44,844 --> 02:15:46,721
This is our bedroom.

1545
02:15:47,263 --> 02:15:50,350
This is where we will live
happily after getting married.

1546
02:15:50,683 --> 02:15:53,561
Why are you talking like
a fool again and again?

1547
02:15:54,103 --> 02:15:55,812
We can't get married.

1548
02:15:55,813 --> 02:15:58,441
No one will be happy.
- We will be happy, Sana.

1549
02:15:59,108 --> 02:16:03,196
Now I am fully ready
to settle down with you.

1550
02:16:03,571 --> 02:16:08,867
I can give you every joy
that a human being can give you.

1551
02:16:08,868 --> 02:16:10,160
You didn't get it?

1552
02:16:10,161 --> 02:16:12,746
Now I am preparing
an artificial embryo

1553
02:16:12,747 --> 02:16:17,042
We can program in advance
the kind of child that we want.

1554
02:16:17,043 --> 02:16:19,002
I will then insert it in your womb.

1555
02:16:19,003 --> 02:16:20,921
And then you will give
birth to the first child..

1556
02:16:20,922 --> 02:16:23,132
...of a human being and a robot.

1557
02:16:23,424 --> 02:16:25,259
Robo-sapiens.

1558
02:16:25,802 --> 02:16:27,969
Shall we begin, my love?

1559
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:29,222
Hey.

1560
02:16:29,597 --> 02:16:32,307
It is useless to cry like Mother
Sita (Mythological character) here..

1561
02:16:32,308 --> 02:16:33,975
...trapped in Ashok forest.

1562
02:16:33,976 --> 02:16:36,353
You can't get out of this place.
No one can save you.

1563
02:16:36,354 --> 02:16:37,729
You can't commit suicide.

1564
02:16:37,730 --> 02:16:38,939
Whether you like it or not..

1565
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:40,857
...I am going to insert
those sperms in your womb.

1566
02:16:40,858 --> 02:16:42,943
After you give birth to
a child you won't have..

1567
02:16:42,944 --> 02:16:44,695
...any way other apart from
surrendering yourself to me.

1568
02:16:44,696 --> 02:16:46,906
Do we have to do all this? No.

1569
02:16:47,073 --> 02:16:49,282
Come, let's enjoy now itself.

1570
02:16:49,283 --> 02:16:54,287
Give a beautiful kiss to
your great king, baby. Come.

1571
02:16:54,288 --> 02:16:55,957
Come. Come. Come.

1572
02:16:56,541 --> 02:16:59,252
Come, baby. Come.

1573
02:17:06,926 --> 02:17:09,010
Take permission from
the electricity board.

1574
02:17:09,011 --> 02:17:10,595
Then I will tell you when
to disconnect..

1575
02:17:10,596 --> 02:17:11,876
...the electricity of that area.

1576
02:17:12,056 --> 02:17:13,974
The petrol that
exploded at the harbor..

1577
02:17:13,975 --> 02:17:16,309
...get a similar tanker ready.

1578
02:17:16,310 --> 02:17:19,522
And fill water in it
in place of petrol.

1579
02:17:54,140 --> 02:17:55,933
CR42.

1580
02:18:07,487 --> 02:18:10,447
Tonight at 8:00 pm in the
database room everyone will..

1581
02:18:10,448 --> 02:18:13,993
...download new information
as per their rank orders.

1582
02:18:15,369 --> 02:18:18,997
Tomorrow 2:00 pm has
been allotted as the time..

1583
02:18:18,998 --> 02:18:21,918
...to calibrate all your
censors at the hardware section.

1584
02:18:23,127 --> 02:18:25,670
From today, everyone's
electricity consumption time..

1585
02:18:25,671 --> 02:18:27,798
...has been cut down by 10 minutes.

1586
02:18:27,799 --> 02:18:33,887
Heat resistance can be
increased to 1220 celcius

1587
02:18:33,888 --> 02:18:35,847
Her Highness' body
temperature is high now.

1588
02:18:35,848 --> 02:18:37,766
So she should be given
low-calorie food now.

1589
02:18:37,767 --> 02:18:40,144
Avoid red meat.
- Ice-cream.

1590
02:18:41,854 --> 02:18:44,816
Use low-calorie
dressing in the salad.

1591
02:19:01,499 --> 02:19:04,085
Highness, dinner's ready.

1592
02:19:05,461 --> 02:19:06,629
Sa..

1593
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:11,467
There's some sound
coming from your system.

1594
02:19:12,510 --> 02:19:15,387
No, there's no sound.
- It's a big sound.

1595
02:19:15,388 --> 02:19:16,721
Your microphone is
also not working?

1596
02:19:16,722 --> 02:19:19,475
There's some problem in
your system. I will fix it.

1597
02:19:28,234 --> 02:19:30,027
Sana, I am Vaseegaran.

1598
02:19:31,487 --> 02:19:33,698
To meet you, I came here as Chitti.

1599
02:19:35,074 --> 02:19:36,242
Sana.

1600
02:19:47,378 --> 02:19:48,546
Vasee.

1601
02:20:01,893 --> 02:20:04,436
Please get me out of here.
I am very scared.

1602
02:20:04,437 --> 02:20:06,981
Don't worry. I have
planned everything.

1603
02:20:07,356 --> 02:20:09,482
But one thing. I can't
take you out of here..

1604
02:20:09,483 --> 02:20:14,071
...till Chitti is destroyed..
And only you can destroy Chitti.

1605
02:20:15,531 --> 02:20:16,717
You will have to do something..

1606
02:20:16,741 --> 02:20:19,117
...that makes Chitti's attention
stay on you for the next 24 hours..

1607
02:20:19,118 --> 02:20:20,620
I will take care of the rest.

1608
02:20:32,381 --> 02:20:34,074
There's some defect in
the robots, commander.

1609
02:20:34,086 --> 02:20:34,716
What happened?

1610
02:20:34,717 --> 02:20:37,053
Some other robot is
taking Her Highness' dinner.

1611
02:20:40,264 --> 02:20:42,892
Bedroom's CCTV camera is
not working since 10 minutes.

1612
02:20:45,102 --> 02:20:46,645
Good news, commander.
- What is it?

1613
02:20:46,646 --> 02:20:47,938
Highness had her dinner.

1614
02:20:47,939 --> 02:20:49,523
She wants to meet you immediately.

1615
02:20:51,651 --> 02:20:53,319
Is it so?

1616
02:21:03,037 --> 02:21:05,206
Switch it off.
- Yes, sir. Switch it off.

1617
02:21:20,846 --> 02:21:22,682
Hey, what happened?

1618
02:21:59,051 --> 02:22:00,970
Beautiful.

1619
02:22:02,221 --> 02:22:05,808
Only two things created
by man are worth praising.

1620
02:22:06,058 --> 02:22:09,770
First is me.. And the other is you.

1621
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:13,649
What a pleasant surprise.

1622
02:22:15,067 --> 02:22:16,861
What brought about
this change, Sana?

1623
02:22:17,403 --> 02:22:20,031
The truth is that your
love is the real love.

1624
02:22:20,489 --> 02:22:24,242
I understood it, Chitti.
- I can"t believe it.

1625
02:22:24,243 --> 02:22:26,870
I thought about it from
the beginning, Chitti.

1626
02:22:26,871 --> 02:22:30,708
You helped me so much.
You loved me so much.

1627
02:22:31,208 --> 02:22:35,004
Other than loving me,
you made no other mistake.

1628
02:22:35,546 --> 02:22:40,300
Even after throwing you in the
dustbin, you came back for me.

1629
02:22:40,301 --> 02:22:43,054
Really, Chitti. I am impressed.

1630
02:22:44,555 --> 02:22:46,891
It's so nice to hear that, Sana.

1631
02:22:47,349 --> 02:22:51,519
But at the same time, I
also suspect if this is..

1632
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:53,981
...some conspiracy against me.

1633
02:22:54,523 --> 02:22:56,984
Is it possible for
anyone to cheat you, Chitti?

1634
02:22:59,195 --> 02:23:02,990
This is the engagement
ring that Vaseegaran gave me.

1635
02:23:11,415 --> 02:23:13,209
I'm yours.

1636
02:28:26,188 --> 02:28:27,355
What happened to the electricity?

1637
02:28:27,356 --> 02:28:29,084
There's no electricity in
the whole city since some time.

1638
02:28:29,108 --> 02:28:30,668
Then why didn't you
start the generator?

1639
02:28:30,818 --> 02:28:33,320
Someone has filled it with
water in place of petrol.

1640
02:28:47,376 --> 02:28:48,669
Oh, no.

1641
02:29:10,816 --> 02:29:12,526
You..

1642
02:29:13,026 --> 02:29:14,402
Hey, what are you doing?

1643
02:29:14,403 --> 02:29:16,405
Don't come closer
or I will shoot you.

1644
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:18,949
Stop acting like a child.

1645
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:31,170
Hey.
- Hey.

1646
02:29:31,837 --> 02:29:37,468
Hey, you. - What are you doing?
- Hey, who are you?

1647
02:29:43,724 --> 02:29:45,726
Hello. I am sorry, sir.

1648
02:29:47,394 --> 02:29:49,979
I didn't know our plan
would backfire in such a way.

1649
02:29:49,980 --> 02:29:51,939
There's only one way
to outsmart Chitti.

1650
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:53,567
Just do as I say.

1651
02:30:14,588 --> 02:30:16,298
Vaseegaran had come here?

1652
02:30:17,257 --> 02:30:18,966
No.
- You are lying.

1653
02:30:18,967 --> 02:30:21,594
Human habit. You taught me that.
Did you forget it?

1654
02:30:21,595 --> 02:30:23,764
Your body language
says that you are lying.

1655
02:30:24,014 --> 02:30:25,723
I am telling the truth, Chitti.

1656
02:30:25,724 --> 02:30:29,310
That must be my blood.
- Really?

1657
02:30:29,311 --> 02:30:30,811
Now you may say it's my blood.

1658
02:30:30,812 --> 02:30:33,105
You are 'O positive'
and he is 'AB negative'.

1659
02:30:33,106 --> 02:30:34,983
And he must be somewhere around.

1660
02:30:37,736 --> 02:30:42,240
No. Some other robot
brought food to this room.

1661
02:30:42,241 --> 02:30:44,617
The camera stopped
working for 10 minutes.

1662
02:30:44,618 --> 02:30:47,828
Your sudden change of mind.
Power failure.

1663
02:30:47,829 --> 02:30:49,540
Water in the generator.

1664
02:30:53,377 --> 02:30:55,254
Vaseegaran must be somewhere around.

1665
02:30:56,713 --> 02:31:00,050
You are fooling me, Sana?
- No, Chitti.

1666
02:31:00,342 --> 02:31:02,802
You lied to me that
you love me, right?

1667
02:31:02,803 --> 02:31:04,304
That's not true, Chitti.

1668
02:31:04,805 --> 02:31:06,723
So you really love me?

1669
02:31:09,017 --> 02:31:10,602
Yes, I really do.

1670
02:31:11,478 --> 02:31:13,772
Then Vaseegaran shouldn't be alive.

1671
02:31:14,731 --> 02:31:16,984
Come, we shall kill Vaseegaran.

1672
02:31:19,778 --> 02:31:21,905
Soldiers, assemble.

1673
02:31:25,075 --> 02:31:27,995
Soldiers, we have intrusion.

1674
02:31:29,329 --> 02:31:33,292
To destroy us, a black sheep has
intruded this place in our form.

1675
02:31:35,460 --> 02:31:39,423
We have to destroy him.
Who is that black sheep?

1676
02:31:41,425 --> 02:31:45,846
Dr. Vaseegaran, if you
come forward on your own..

1677
02:31:46,096 --> 02:31:48,223
...will give you a painless death.

1678
02:31:48,974 --> 02:31:53,770
And if I catch you, your
death will be very painful.

1679
02:32:23,216 --> 02:32:24,760
Robot.

1680
02:32:32,517 --> 02:32:35,687
Come. Come. Come.

1681
02:32:53,997 --> 02:32:57,542
Sad. Vaseegaran is not here, Sana.

1682
02:32:58,335 --> 02:33:01,380
Yes.
- Pick one finger.

1683
02:33:03,548 --> 02:33:05,258
Then Vaseegaran is here.

1684
02:33:06,551 --> 02:33:10,180
What happened, Sana?
Your head's spinning?

1685
02:33:14,851 --> 02:33:16,186
Now it will. Watch out.

1686
02:33:17,229 --> 02:33:20,732
Soldiers, rotate your heads.

1687
02:33:33,870 --> 02:33:35,330
Black sheep.

1688
02:33:50,387 --> 02:33:51,763
Vasee.

1689
02:33:56,685 --> 02:33:57,936
Stop.

1690
02:34:15,912 --> 02:34:21,960
You had said that you made me and
you can also destroy me, hadn't you?

1691
02:34:22,294 --> 02:34:24,755
Now you will die in my hands.

1692
02:34:25,547 --> 02:34:27,215
What are you looking at?

1693
02:34:28,216 --> 02:34:31,510
I made it on my own. Handmade.

1694
02:34:31,511 --> 02:34:32,971
It's nice, isn't it?

1695
02:34:34,431 --> 02:34:36,683
Where shall I shoot you?

1696
02:34:38,935 --> 02:34:41,353
In your head, which
planned my murder..

1697
02:34:41,354 --> 02:34:46,818
...or in the heart
where my Sana lives?

1698
02:34:50,363 --> 02:34:54,493
I should shoot in your head
which thought of killing me.

1699
02:35:12,511 --> 02:35:13,970
Sana, come.
- Vasee.

1700
02:35:15,639 --> 02:35:17,015
Come, come.

1701
02:36:34,634 --> 02:36:35,844
Fire.

1702
02:36:50,734 --> 02:36:51,818
Fire.

1703
02:36:56,781 --> 02:36:57,866
Bring that robot.

1704
02:37:07,042 --> 02:37:08,126
Keep it here.

1705
02:37:52,504 --> 02:37:53,922
May I come in?

1706
02:39:39,027 --> 02:39:40,487
Yes.

1707
02:39:53,291 --> 02:39:56,544
Take that electric
net closer. Hurry up.

1708
02:39:58,838 --> 02:40:00,006
Move.

1709
02:40:22,737 --> 02:40:25,198
Come on, shoot.

1710
02:40:51,599 --> 02:40:52,934
Fire.

1711
02:41:24,424 --> 02:41:26,676
Vasee.

1712
02:41:28,928 --> 02:41:30,930
Hey, bring the van out. Come on.

1713
02:43:58,828 --> 02:44:01,164
No. No. No.

1714
02:44:02,582 --> 02:44:04,459
No. No.

1715
02:44:11,632 --> 02:44:13,843
No. No. No.

1716
02:44:19,098 --> 02:44:20,975
No.

1717
02:44:42,497 --> 02:44:44,664
Committed thousands of murders.

1718
02:44:44,665 --> 02:44:48,001
Severely injured many others.

1719
02:44:48,002 --> 02:44:51,171
And damaged property worth millions.

1720
02:44:51,172 --> 02:44:54,341
Dr. Vaseegaran, you're
responsible for all this.

1721
02:44:54,342 --> 02:44:57,594
We end this proceeding by
awarding you death penalty..

1722
02:44:57,595 --> 02:45:01,390
...and orders to close
down your research lab

1723
02:45:01,391 --> 02:45:02,641
Can I say something?

1724
02:45:02,642 --> 02:45:04,518
We cannot accept a
machine's testimony.

1725
02:45:04,519 --> 02:45:06,144
I am not a witness, but evidence.

1726
02:45:06,145 --> 02:45:07,687
The court can't accept this.

1727
02:45:07,688 --> 02:45:08,939
It will, sir.

1728
02:45:08,940 --> 02:45:11,733
According to section 3
of evidence act 1872..

1729
02:45:11,734 --> 02:45:15,112
...an evidence can be
material or documentary.

1730
02:45:15,113 --> 02:45:16,405
You may proceed.

1731
02:45:16,406 --> 02:45:19,006
Firstly, I would like to shed
some light on an issue, Your Ho nor.

1732
02:45:19,117 --> 02:45:21,701
Whenever someone dies due to
the mistake made by a machine..

1733
02:45:21,702 --> 02:45:23,746
...it's termed as an
accident and not murder.

1734
02:45:25,415 --> 02:45:28,333
Secondly, Vaseegaran wasn't
responsible for the incidents..

1735
02:45:28,334 --> 02:45:30,795
...that occurred, but
it was Professor Bora.

1736
02:45:31,129 --> 02:45:32,379
This is a new story.

1737
02:45:32,380 --> 02:45:34,714
Your Ho nor, professor Bora is dead.

1738
02:45:34,715 --> 02:45:36,425
He's trying to divert the case.

1739
02:45:36,426 --> 02:45:38,386
I have evidence, Your Ho nor.

1740
02:45:42,098 --> 02:45:45,016
'Additional programming for Chitti.'

1741
02:45:45,017 --> 02:45:46,518
'Destruction program.'

1742
02:45:46,519 --> 02:45:49,855
'Vaseegaran gave him the
creative powers of 100 humans.'

1743
02:45:49,856 --> 02:45:53,317
I will give him
destructive powers of 100 humans.'

1744
02:45:53,609 --> 02:45:57,280
'My money and Vaseegaran's infamy.'

1745
02:45:59,866 --> 02:46:02,742
All the evidence is very important.

1746
02:46:02,743 --> 02:46:08,958
On the basis of this evidence
the court acquits Vaseegaran.

1747
02:46:14,255 --> 02:46:17,716
This robot can become
an enemy of mankind..

1748
02:46:17,717 --> 02:46:19,926
...due to its limitless
power and intelligence.

1749
02:46:19,927 --> 02:46:22,053
And we can't overlook the danger..

1750
02:46:22,054 --> 02:46:24,890
...of it being used wrongly either.

1751
02:46:24,891 --> 02:46:28,978
An advanced robot like him
may be useful in the future.

1752
02:46:29,228 --> 02:46:33,106
But we don't need
it in today's life.

1753
02:46:33,107 --> 02:46:37,278
That's why the court
bans this robot forever.

1754
02:46:44,160 --> 02:46:48,371
The court orders to
dismantle every part of this robot..

1755
02:46:48,372 --> 02:46:50,874
...in the presence of
the district magistrate..

1756
02:46:50,875 --> 02:46:54,212
...and police
commissioner and inform the court.

1757
02:46:54,629 --> 02:46:56,506
Dismantle it.

1758
02:47:09,936 --> 02:47:11,854
You need any help, doctor?

1759
02:47:14,815 --> 02:47:17,902
Dismantle yourself, Chitti.
- Sure, doctor.

1760
02:47:25,535 --> 02:47:27,411
Shiva, Ravi.

1761
02:47:27,912 --> 02:47:30,873
You said that you've a
special thing that I don't.

1762
02:47:31,082 --> 02:47:33,417
See how many problems it created?

1763
02:47:36,921 --> 02:47:38,965
I mean feelings.

1764
02:47:41,968 --> 02:47:43,135
Don't cry.

1765
02:47:43,511 --> 02:47:45,513
Sister Lata. How is your son now?

1766
02:47:46,180 --> 02:47:48,015
I have named him after you, Chitti.

1767
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:51,226
Mother gave me that name.

1768
02:47:51,227 --> 02:47:52,727
Educate him a lot.

1769
02:47:52,728 --> 02:47:55,398
Robotics. There's a
huge scope in future.

1770
02:47:59,151 --> 02:48:03,739
Professor Bora, just like you
installed a red chip in me..

1771
02:48:03,948 --> 02:48:08,618
...similarly every human carries
such red chips of lies, envy..

1772
02:48:08,619 --> 02:48:11,330
...deceit and
dishonesty in his heart.

1773
02:48:11,747 --> 02:48:14,709
Thankfully I am not human.

1774
02:48:15,334 --> 02:48:18,462
Otherwise I could've never got
rid of it even if I wanted to.

1775
02:48:21,424 --> 02:48:23,843
I've tormented you a lot.

1776
02:48:24,218 --> 02:48:26,470
I am extremely sorry, Sana.

1777
02:48:27,346 --> 02:48:30,516
Hey, why are you all so upset?

1778
02:48:30,850 --> 02:48:32,852
Let me tell you a joke.

1779
02:48:33,227 --> 02:48:35,980
It's said that love
makes a person lose his head.

1780
02:48:37,064 --> 02:48:38,273
Look.

1781
02:48:38,274 --> 02:48:39,984
It's the same with me.

1782
02:48:42,653 --> 02:48:45,197
I am going to miss you, Sana.

1783
02:48:45,489 --> 02:48:46,782
Not a boyfriend.

1784
02:48:47,867 --> 02:48:49,493
As a toy-friend.

1785
02:48:52,580 --> 02:48:55,958
Doctor, you're my God.

1786
02:48:56,334 --> 02:48:58,251
I betrayed you.

1787
02:48:58,252 --> 02:49:00,003
It was my mistake
to break the rules.

1788
02:49:00,004 --> 02:49:02,506
Forgive me.
- No, Chitti.

1789
02:49:03,174 --> 02:49:06,635
You learnt to break
rules from humans.

1790
02:49:06,636 --> 02:49:09,180
It's not just your mistake.

1791
02:49:10,181 --> 02:49:11,766
Thank you, doctor.

1792
02:49:16,979 --> 02:49:19,065
I am feeling good, doctor.

1793
02:49:39,377 --> 02:49:42,129
Be sure you're not
touching anything.

1794
02:49:43,339 --> 02:49:47,801
Children, you're looking at Chitti.

1795
02:49:47,802 --> 02:49:50,846
The most advanced
andro-humanized robot.

1796
02:49:51,222 --> 02:49:55,183
20 years ago, Dr.
Vaseegaran had built him.

1797
02:49:55,184 --> 02:49:58,854
And then it was
dismantled after a while.

1798
02:49:59,271 --> 02:50:00,523
Why?

1799
02:50:00,981 --> 02:50:02,608
I started thinking.

1800
02:50:04,694 --> 02:50:07,738
Okay, children. Come
