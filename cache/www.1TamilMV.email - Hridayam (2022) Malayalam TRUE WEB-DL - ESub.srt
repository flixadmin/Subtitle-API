1
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,562
<i>For the kind attention of passengers.</i>

2
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:07,593
<i>Train no. 6602...</i>

3
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:11,281
<i>Chennai Mail from
Mangalore to Chennai,</i>

4
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:18,244
<i>will reach platform
number 1 at 19:35 hours.</i>

5
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,782
Sir, my friend got late
to leave from home.

6
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,367
He will reach by 7:45 PM.
Will the train wait here until then?

7
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:46,469
Why not?
I'll tell the driver!

8
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,534
Thank you, sir.

9
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,863
-Such a nice man.
-Yeah, right!

10
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,181
As if Indian Railways
is his ancestral property!

11
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,066
Shucks!

12
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,710
Please, sir. I'm no. 10 on the waiting list.
Get me a seat somehow.

13
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,190
This waiting list
is not a license...

14
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,838
for people who don't have a ticket
to board the train.

15
00:04:16,862 --> 00:04:18,635
There are no berths
even for RAC tickets.

16
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:20,862
I'm fed up of Malayali students
like you, who come to Chennai.

17
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,737
Please, sir.
Just try! Somehow!

18
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,003
Somehow...
Please, sir.

19
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:26,922
Do one thing. There's a loser over there
who's no. 57 on the waiting list.

20
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:27,955
Go and sit with him.

21
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,758
Okay.
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

22
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:31,292
But sir...

23
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:32,986
Where is he sitting?

24
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,211
You'll know when you see him.

25
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,588
Got it?
Get going.

26
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,993
[singing a famous Malayalam song]

27
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:41,878
Pass the snack, please.

28
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,417
Excuse me.

29
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,089
-What is it?
-Err....

30
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:53,826
Are you no. 57 on the waiting list?

31
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,698
That's correct.
How did you know that?

32
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:04,636
Well, the ticket examiner
had told me.

33
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,330
Is that so?
Sit down.

34
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,581
Come on!

35
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:10,106
Are you studying in Chennai?

36
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:12,024
I'm going to join... KC Tech.

37
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:13,384
I'm also joining KC Tech.

38
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:14,619
New admission, ECE.

39
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:15,988
I'm also doing ECE.

40
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,706
So we're classmates, dude!

41
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,260
He has also done ECE.

42
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,073
He's working in LSB Corp now.

43
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:25,854
-Andrew.
-Arun.

44
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:27,714
I studied in KPR college.

45
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:28,800
Isn't it a good college?

46
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,121
It's a good college, alright.

47
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,198
But there's only one problem.

48
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:32,676
If we talk to girls,
we'll be dismissed immediately.

49
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:34,502
-Seriously?
-Yeah!

50
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:36,675
This problem isn't limited
to students alone.

51
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,519
The same rule applies
for the teachers there.

52
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:41,368
Separate seating for girls
and boys in the college bus,

53
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:42,645
with an iron rod in the centre.

54
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:45,543
-It's too much, man!
-But your college gives a lot of freedom.

55
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:47,355
KC Tech, Karappakkam.

56
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:49,480
Oh, it's a beautiful campus!

57
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:51,762
Brother...

58
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:53,410
-How's Chennai?
-Chennai?

59
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,832
You're going to be there
for the next four years, right?

60
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,441
When you board the train back home
once you finish your studies,

61
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:01,418
you'll feel as if someone is tugging
at your heartstrings.

62
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:03,971
At that moment, you'll realize
what Chennai is.

63
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:11,106
<i>♪ Do you hear the voice? ♪</i>

64
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:19,119
<i>♪ Do you hear the voice of Mother Thamizh
Who lets her visitors flourish? ♪</i>

65
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,403

00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:24,071
<i>♪ Is it inviting you? ♪</i>

67
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:31,758
<i>♪ Is the college road inviting you,
  Showering flowers upon you? ♪</i>

68
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,931
-Step forward.
-Get lost.

69
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:37,285
Step forward.

70
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:38,981
Silence!

71
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:41,065
Varikkappara, go check!

72
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,847
Didn't you hear it?
Silence!

Arun, look at that.

76
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:00,648
They have a Tabla too.
It will be awesome.

77
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:03,770
-Arun Neelakandan, first year ECE.
-Prateek Tiwari, first year CSE.

78
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,550
-Antony.
-Ankur Saxena.

79
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:07,372
So, you guys are musicians?

80
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:08,847
Ah, well.

81
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,192
-We try.
-Sort of!

82
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:11,581
I see you play the guitar as well.

83
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:12,833
Yeah, a lil'.

84
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:13,527
Cool, bro.

85
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:14,552
We should jam sometime.

86
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:15,983
Why not!
Jam Jam!

87
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:18,002
-Anto, from Kottayam.
-I'm Lijo, from Kottayam.

88
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:19,169
Are you both from Kottayam?

89
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,059
Are you from Kottayam?

90
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,435
-Yeah, I'm from Kanjikkuzhi.
-I'm from Lakkattoor.

91
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,989
-Ron.
-Where are you from?

92
00:07:23,014 --> 00:07:24,513
-Abu Dhabi.
-Where? Abu Dhabi?

93
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:26,310
-Yeah, dude.
 -Oh! Nice gold chain!

94
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:27,542
It will be useful later.

95
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:28,973
-Arun, right?
-Arun.

96
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,910
-I'm from Palakkad.
-Which one's your room?

97
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:32,810
-Ours is at that corner.
-But it's the toilet at the corner, right?

98
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:36,309
You see this?
This lock and grill is to protect you...

99
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,963
from a major part
of the ragging.

100
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:39,496
So you don't have
to worry that much.

101
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:41,393
What is he saying?

102
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,815
Dude, this grill will be locked
at 9:30 PM.

103
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:47,878
So the Malayali seniors cannot come
downstairs and rag us.

104
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,338
Ragging is rampant here, huh?

105
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:52,315
Yes, mostly among Malayali students.

106
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:55,947
Our people are like this,
wherever we go!

107
00:07:55,972 --> 00:07:56,972
Don't smile!

108
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:58,526
Does anyone of you ride a horse?

109
00:07:58,805 --> 00:07:59,886
You do horse-riding?

110
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,362
Err, no.
I'd like to learn, though.

111
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:02,395
Cool. Join me!

112
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:04,411
-You do horse-riding?
-No, I'll come walking.

113
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,464
-Okay.
-What's all this?

114
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:07,723
Organ and music system?

115
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:08,802
This is not allowed here.

116
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:10,676
Throw it out!
Come on!

117
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:16,079
Keep the volume down.

118
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,070
-Who is it? Come here.
-Get lost!

119
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:27,163
-Are you in first year?
-Yes, sir.

120
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:28,172
Twins, huh?

121
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,300
Hey! Ask him to
switch on the motor!

122
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:32,653
Hey Manoharan!
You scoundrel!

123
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,372
-Who called me scoundrel?
-I did, you scoundrel!

124
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,012
-Who called me scoundrel?
-Switch on the motor!

125
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,037
Come, dude!

126
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:41,481
The first years will be introduced
to the college.

127
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:43,511
-Didn't you have it in your school?
-No, Kanjikkuzhi doesn't have all this.

128
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:44,754
Which damn school
did you study in?

129
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:48,003
We always put our students
as the highest priority

130
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,097
when it comes to academics,
in KCG College of Technology.

131
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,370
We have a great
academic curriculum.

132
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:56,675
So students, I welcome you all
to this prestigious institution.

133
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:58,331
This is the main quadrangle.

134
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:01,472
This side, if you can see,
there's the mechanical laboratory here.

135
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,659
And our IT department
is on that side.

136
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,698
So guys, this is the analog circuit lab.

137
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:09,276
You know what has to be done here!

138
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,018
There's something very
special about this space.

139
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,458
Can you see that door?

140
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:17,488
That actually leads to an alley.

141
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:22,020
That is known as the secret alley.

142
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:23,880
Hey! What's she saying?

143
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,840
Do you see the door
at that corner?

144
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:27,964
It's called 'The Secret Alley'.

145
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:29,731
Annie?

146
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,334
Not 'Annie', it's Alley!

147
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,438
That means, a secret path.

148
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:34,943
So, on the last day...

149
00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:36,310
When we're in our final year,

150
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:37,928
on the last day of college,

151
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,901
the Vice-Principal will give us
the key to that alley.

152
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:42,046
Only on that day can
we see what's inside.

153
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:45,190
God, I hope I'll be able
to reach final year.

154
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,617
Can't we get a duplicate key
to this alley?

155
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:48,695
We'll see.

156
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,829
So what's actually
inside the secret alley?

157
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:53,945
I'll know it at the end
of my college days.

158
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:56,048
So, till then, let it be a secret.

159
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:57,309
-Okay.
-Yeah.

160
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,362
-It's gonna be epic.
-It's good to wait for good things.

161
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:00,941
-Akash Gupta?
-Yes, sir.

162
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,551
-Akhil Sathyan?
-Yes, sir.

163
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:03,996
Alan George Akkara?

164
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,415
Antony Thadikkaran?

165
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:07,347
Sir!

166
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:08,910
-Arun Neelakandan?
-Present, sir.

167
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,589
-Puneet Singh?
-Yes, sir.

168
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,386
Ron Valiveettil?

169
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,206
Sir, it's 'Valiyaveettil'.

170
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:15,784
Valiveettil. That's right.

171
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:16,847
Sit down, man!

172
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,393
Why Tamil people are like this?

173
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,472
-Selva Soundarrajan.
-Yes, sir!

174
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:23,192
Students!

175
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,004
I am very strict about one thing.

176
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,667
No arrears in my class.

177
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,731
-What does 'arrears' mean?
-Supplementary exams!

178
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,363
-Oh! 'Supply'!
-Sir?

179
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:32,129
-Your name?
-Alan George.

180
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,162
Come in.

181
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:37,721
So, today we discuss about
engineering mechanics.

182
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:41,426
The seniors have called all the
Malayali juniors to the hostel.

183
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:43,332
Welcome to St. Thomas Hall.

184
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,980
There are certain things that
you need to be aware of, while you're here.

185
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,941
There are some rules
that you have to follow.

186
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,840
The first one is...

187
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:52,527
'Engineer's salute!'

188
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:54,652
Farooq!

189
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:55,832
Explain it to them.

190
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,372
Place your left hand
on your forehead.

191
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,761
Cover your groin area
with your right hand,

192
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:03,230
thrust your backside forward,

193
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,878
and make the sound - 'Phyung'!

194
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:06,630
Who laughed now?

195
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,714
Which pig laughed now?

196
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:09,747
Huh?

197
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:12,020
Laugh!

198
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:13,825
Laugh again!

199
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,091
Baiju!

200
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:17,864
Repeat what Farooq said.

201
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:19,223
Engineer's salute!

202
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:21,433
Repeat!

203
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,401
'Phyung'!

204
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:23,496
Good.

205
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,005
Now, on to the next point.

206
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:26,823
As Indian citizens,

207
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:29,348
it is the duty of each one of you,

208
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:31,333
to support local industries.

209
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:33,590
-Isn't that so?
-Yes.

210
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,942
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

211
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:38,113
So,

212
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:40,169
for this entire academic year,

213
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,496
you will only use Indian-made clothes,

214
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:45,128
and Indian-made undergarments.

215
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,629
Okay?

216
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,512
What underwear are you wearing, kiddo?

217
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,278
Which one was it?

218
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:54,997
-Jockey.
-Ah!

219
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:57,660
What about you?

220
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:00,810
Calvin Klein.

221
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,839
Huh? Calvin Klein?

222
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:05,215
Hey you!

223
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:07,471
If you wear a foreign brand ever again,

224
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,464
you'll face a barrage of punches.

225
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:13,449
Go to some shady shop in Thiruvanmiyur
or Adyar today itself,

226
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:16,621
and buy shirts, pants and underwear,
that are unfashionable and ill-fitting.

227
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,130
You heard me?

228
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,628
And... one more thing.

229
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:21,667
The sleeves of your shirts should
be rolled down and buttoned.

230
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:24,198
And since watches and shoes
are against Indian culture,

231
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:25,231
you won't use them.

232
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,269
You can use Indian sandals though.

233
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:28,761
Farooq...

234
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:30,784
Tell them about the ID card,
as well.

235
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:33,886
And wherever you see Malayali seniors,

236
00:12:34,215 --> 00:12:35,223
you should salute us,

237
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:36,772
and show us your ID cards.

238
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:38,778
Okay, right?

239
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:39,906
It is okay.

240
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:40,937
So, Farooq...

241
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:42,499
Give them their
Indian names, as well.

242
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:44,093
Give them great nicknames.

243
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,593
-Kanaran!
-Huh?

244
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,927
Damu!

245
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,122
Moosa!

246
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:49,520
Syedali!

247
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:50,988
Korah!

248
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:52,004
Ambadi.

249
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:53,036
Purushu!

250
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,450
-Ambu!
-Salute!

251
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:55,369
Phyung!

252
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:56,581
Repeat!

253
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:57,607
Phyung!

254
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,651
My Indian name is quite pathetic.

255
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:01,996
Damu!

256
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:04,129
What's yours?

257
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:05,994
Kanaran!

258
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:08,902
Mine's not so bad then.

259
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:11,113
Do they get to decide
what clothes we should wear?

260
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:12,270
This is too much!

261
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,120
-Shall we complain?
-Ah!

262
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:17,340
Mess with them
as soon as you join!

263
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,987
Dude, this ragging won't last
for the entire year.

264
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,416
It will loosen up
after the first semester.

265
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:24,856
-Then they will become friends with us.
-Of course!

266
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,270
And in my opinion,

267
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,973
let's listen to those guys for now.

268
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:29,783
Which college doesn't have ragging now?

269
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,816
Not in Kanjikkuzhy, though.

270
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,253
And when we get to second year,
we can do all this too, right?

271
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,286
That's all!

272
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,249
Cut chart paper to the size
of your college ID,

273
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:46,585
and stick your photo here.

274
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:51,288
Your name, Indian name,
name of your course and your underwear.

275
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,675
That's how it should be written.

276
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,652
Also, the name of your underwear,

277
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:57,636
should be cut out from your underwear
and stapled on to your ID.

278
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:59,386
The ID should be laminated.

279
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:04,215
-Hey! A rickshaw is coming.
-Bro!

280
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,426
-Hey Lijo!
-Take us to Karappakkam.

281
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,886
-This cab is too small, man!
-Shut up!

282
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:10,043
Scoundrel from Abu Dhabi!

283
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:11,347
Hey!

284
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:12,784
-Good morning, sir.
-Where's your ID card?

285
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:13,817
-Where is it?
-Sir...

286
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:14,850
Here it is, Sir.

287
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:17,238
-Salute us quickly and get going.
-Fools!

288
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
Phyung!

289
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:21,987
Who's next?

290
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:24,500
'Don't know' is not a movie!

291
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,019
Hit him!
Come on!

292
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:28,137
Whom do we catch next?

293
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:29,168
Yes, this should be fun.

294
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:30,739
What is the...

295
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:33,043
chemical name of Potassium,

296
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,208
in Chemistry?

297
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:36,293
-"P".
-P?

298
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,832
Pee in your mouth, man!

299
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:40,418
It's 'K', man!
Hit him! Hit him!

300
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,778
Harder! Come on!

301
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:46,426
How many states in Tamil Nadu?

302
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,792
Tamil Nadu?
How many states?

303
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:50,169
Fast!
How many states in Tamil Nadu?

304
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,168
-Tell me.
-44.

305
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:52,223
Forty four?

306
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:54,183
-Congratulations! Great! Great!
-Thank you.

307
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,262
Give him a prize!

308
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:57,004
Tamil Nadu itself is a State, you dumbo!

309
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,644
Hit him! Hit him!

310
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:00,465
Hit him hard!

311
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:02,394
How many checks in your shirt?

312
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:04,691
It's not mine.
It's his shirt.

313
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:05,724
Is he cursing us?

314
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:08,370
Dude, that bald HOD is coming.
Let's escape.

315
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:11,104
Dude, those guys have left.
Come on, get up.

316
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,544
Get up.
They have left.

317
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:13,577
Get up, dude!

318
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,434
I don't know what it is.

319
00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:55,864
There's something about her.

320
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:57,645
Her eyes,

321
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,097
hair...

322
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:00,661
Her smile...

323
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,277
I want to know her name!

324
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,012
-I want to find out now.
-Calm down!

325
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:07,370
We'll ask someone.
It's okay.

I don't want to know her name

to know her name...

328

00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,614
I want to romance a girl like her
and marry her somehow.

I can listen to songs

Why go for someone like her?

334

and get married to her!

Come, it's time for the lab session.

She'll be here.

-Really nice voice.

Do we have a guitarist?

343

There's someone from first year ECE.

344
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:08,960
Okay.
You talk to him then.

345

When are we starting
the rehearsals?

346
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:12,093
We should start practising soon.

347

You are so damn confident, man!

356
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,632
Once you like a girl,
you should never shy away.

357
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:45,792
It's bad enough to not do
anything about it.

358
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:47,468
Stalking is even worse.

359
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:49,291
We should approach
them directly.

If she's single,

361
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:52,152
she'll be thinking about me now.

362
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:54,465

00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:29,555
Okay, let's go.

489
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:34,261
-Are you sure that he's alone there?
-Yes.

490
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:36,042
-Who told you?
-Our spy.

491
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:36,934
Shall we complain?

492
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,590
Bro, you're gonna perform
with Darshana.

493
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:39,832
I'm performing with Darshana?

494
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,490
We don't encourage
ragging in this campus.

495
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:48,341
Okay.

496
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:49,880
And if the seniors
have done this,

497
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:51,878
strict action will be taken
against them.

498
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:52,919
Thank you, sir.

499
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:02,785
Are you afraid of them?

500
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:04,581
I'm not afraid of anyone!

501
00:25:05,388 --> 00:25:06,396
Come!

502
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,301
-We must beat him up!
-We will!

503
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,356
Let's make this
more interesting.

504
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:14,708
You go ahead.
I'll follow you.

505
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:17,519
Has anyone dared to mess with us
in the past three years?

506
00:25:17,544 --> 00:25:18,950
When I asked for the ID card, he...

507
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,911
I'm telling you!
We'll teach him a lesson!

508
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:45,722
<i>She walked along with me,
showing her middle finger...</i>

509
00:25:45,747 --> 00:25:48,527
<i>to the seniors
who beat me to pulp.</i>

510
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,839
<i>I had my arms around her.</i>

511
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,725
<i>In that moment,</i>

512
00:25:52,871 --> 00:25:55,035
<i>I felt like a king.</i>

513
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,161
Smack him!

514
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:01,186
Punch him hard!

515
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:06,070
Why are you laughing?

516
00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:08,688
Why are you laughing?

517
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:10,454
Hit me with everything you've got, bro!

518
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,638
I don't give a damn!

519
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,990
You know why?

520
00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:16,434
'coz Darshana is mine!

521
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:19,304
And there's nothing you can
do to change that, you sucker!

522
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,067

Thank you, Arun.

531
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:22,281
Can I have your number?

532
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:23,906
No!

533
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Wait! Wait! Wait!

534
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:36,453
Darshana, we will be here
for four years.

535
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:37,750
Four academic years.

536
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:40,725
Around 800 days in total,
not counting the holidays.

537
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,404
Out of that, twenty days
have already passed.

538
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:46,482
I don't want to regret
not having told you earlier.

539
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:48,202
So I'm coming
straight to the point.

540
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:52,319
I'm crazy about you!

541
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,897
I fell in love with you
the minute I saw you.

542

I'd like to know
what you feel about me.

543
00:28:00,688 --> 00:28:01,875
Arun, I....

544
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,023
I need to think about it.

545
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:05,336
Go ahead!

546
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:07,187
But don't take too much time.

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,399
Darshana!

549
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:21,688
Please don't tie your hair up.

550
00:28:21,744 --> 00:28:22,908
Just try leaving it loose.

551
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:25,143
You look amazing when
you leave your hair loose.

565
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,365
Maybe!

566
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:55,980
And you're coming to college
like this, you dumbo?

567
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,137
You do one thing.

568
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:59,306
Go to our room.

569
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:00,989
Over there, on top
of the record book,

570
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:02,816
you can find my compact
and foundation.

571
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:06,223
There are some earrings
in a small box.

572
00:30:06,248 --> 00:30:07,378
Take whatever you like.

573
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,176
Then, there's a pink colour box.

574
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:14,325
Once you open it,
you'll find a tiny little thing inside.

575
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:19,268
A Malayali guy who won't fall for that,

585
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:37,896
I went overboard, I know.

586
00:31:38,131 --> 00:31:40,021
-Please! Sorry.
-Can you ride a bike?

587

00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:53,998
Yes, it does.

590
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,277
But that sound strikes straight into the heart
of the girl who's sitting behind.

591
00:31:57,302 --> 00:31:58,904
Guys who can ride,
know these things.

592

It's your first outing, right?

593
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,178
Yeah.

00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:03,211

00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,730
So, the security sleeps
at 12 o'clock, okay?

598
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,395

everytime you look at me

613
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,231
I've felt like shouting out loud...

that I really like you!

615
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,096
But there's this thrill
in making you wait...

616

What I have to tell you now..
is something you've already told me.

What's the matter?

645
00:36:12,615 --> 00:36:15,199
There's a girl who I used to chat with,
on Yahoo Messenger.

646
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:17,722
She was very co-operative, online.

00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,434
My computer was struck by lightning
during the monsoon.

649
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,731
By the time I got it repaired
and came back online to chat,

650
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:26,161
she fell for someone else.

651
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:27,990
But now,

652
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:30,653
she has come back
with a vengeance, bro!

653
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,779
I want to celebrate
her comeback!

654
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,651
And you want me to come along,
for this ribaldry?

655
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:35,684
Huh?

656
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:37,295
In my life so far,

657
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:38,896
nothing has happened!

658
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,107
Nothing at all!

659
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:42,131
Can you come with me?

660
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:43,717
I will.

661
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,147
Bro!

662
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:48,532
We'll have a blast in Kochi!

663
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:53,709
What is this?
Crushed pickle?

664
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:56,521
-'Morning Sir.
-Hi.

665
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,091
Thanks.

666
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:02,993
Sir, that's a finger bowl.

667
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:04,278
I know!

668
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:05,436
It doesn't have sugar.

669
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:07,727
It's for washing your hands.

670
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,991
But it's good water.
We can drink it.

671
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:17,840
Aren't you done yet?

672
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:19,318
I mean, are you done?

673
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:20,865
What do you think?
Are they serious?

674
00:37:20,904 --> 00:37:22,114
Didn't you ask your friend?

675
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,568
No. She asked me to come
and I tagged along.

676
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:31,734
Your campus life must be awesome
in Chennai, right?

677
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:34,148
Hostel, full freedom...

678
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:36,551
When I see students going
back home on the bus,

679
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:37,919
I feel slightly jealous.

680
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:40,990
Home-cooked food, parents...
I miss all that.

681
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,910
My parents are divorced.

682
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:45,826
I'm sorry.

683
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:48,802
Don't be!
They were always at loggerheads.

684
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:50,701
So, isn't it better
to get separated?

685
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:55,052
I like your hair colour.

686
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,358
I like your eyes.

687
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:02,409
Do you have a girlfriend?

688
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,014
No!

689
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:44,339
That side is fully occupied.
Let's sit over there.

690
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:50,799
One second.
I'll be right back.

691
00:38:58,114 --> 00:38:59,723
How much does this umbrella cost?

692
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:00,756
250 Rupees.

693
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:24,278
Run! Run!
Those scoundrels are here!

694
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:32,887
-Damn! I should've just worn pants!
-Don't run away, dear!

695
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,929
-Get lost, you dog!
-I came all the way from Madras for this!

696
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,648
Wait! Let's go to some isolated place.

697
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:39,032
Wait, please!

698
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,130
Chicken Lasagunia!

699
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:42,240
Beef stick!

700
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:44,341
Lime juice without sugar!

701
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:45,904
And the bus tickets, to and fro.

702
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:48,443
I am such a colossal disaster, Oh God!

703
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,427
Shucks!

704
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:50,808
I cheated on Darshana.

705
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:51,857
Aargh!

706
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:53,615
Don't keep repeating yourself!

707
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:55,849
You didn't even touch that girl.

708
00:39:56,881 --> 00:39:58,240
I couldn't touch my girl either.

709
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:01,525
Yet, I chose to forget
her for a while,

710
00:40:02,853 --> 00:40:04,426
and had other
thoughts in mind, right?

711
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,387
Look at me!
Who doesn't have such thoughts?

712
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:08,236
Even Mahatma Gandhi
has had such thoughts!

713
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:09,926
Read his autobiography
if you have a doubt.

714
00:40:11,098 --> 00:40:14,028
And... don't go and blabber
anything to her, out of guilt.

715
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:17,209
Listen, you haven't done anything to her.

716
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:20,818
Let's just...

717
00:40:21,303 --> 00:40:22,311
forget this day!

718
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:26,482
Bloody Chicken Lasaguniya!

719
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,943
-Lasagna!
-I know! Don't rub it in!

720
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,981
I felt sad watching
the news yesterday.

721
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:36,762
Can't anyone in Kerala be in love?

722
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,676
Those were not family
members or relatives.

723
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:43,121
Some random people
were beating up those kids.

724
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:45,856
They took an umbrella from a boy
and hit him on his head.

725
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:49,388
One boy wearing a T-shirt like yours,
was running for his life.

726
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:52,162
Okay, I'll message you
once the lab session is over.

727
00:40:52,474 --> 00:40:53,918
Let's bunk class
and go for a movie.

728
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:01,029
Darshana!

729
00:41:01,115 --> 00:41:02,123
Yes?

730
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:05,598
I have to tell you something.

731
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:09,942
I don't know how
you're going to take it.

732
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:11,857
Arun!

733
00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:14,573
I got here on time, thanks to this umbrella
I found in your room!

734
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:28,498
Darshana!
Darshana, wait!

735
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,170
-Let go of me.
-Darshana, please!

736
00:41:30,248 --> 00:41:31,615
-Darshana, listen to me!
-Let go!

737
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:33,459
Darshana, I haven't
done anything wrong!

738
00:41:34,177 --> 00:41:36,668
When Antony said he wanted
to meet a girl, I went along.

739
00:41:37,014 --> 00:41:38,552
I sat on that bench
with her friend.

740
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,637
When she asked me if I had a girlfriend,
I said no.

741
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:42,146
I haven't done anything wrong.

742
00:41:42,928 --> 00:41:44,732
Why did you say that
you don't have a girlfriend?

743
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:47,615
Well, when such a hot chick
is in front of me..

744
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:50,278
Shucks!

745
00:41:56,997 --> 00:41:58,630
What the hell did you tell her, dude?

746
00:42:02,154 --> 00:42:03,161
Shucks!

747
00:42:24,614 --> 00:42:25,622
Hello, Megha?

748
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,192
Don't call on my friend's phone, okay?

749
00:42:28,217 --> 00:42:29,903
Darshana, please listen to me.

750
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:31,911
There's nothing between us any more.

751
00:42:31,936 --> 00:42:32,622
Forever!

752
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:34,278
Just listen to me, Darshana.
 Please!

753
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:35,154
I'm really sorry.

754
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:37,232
But don't think that
I will spare you!

755
00:42:37,568 --> 00:42:41,343
I'll romance another guy and walk around
hugging him, right before you.

756
00:42:42,232 --> 00:42:43,490
You wanted to kiss me, right?

757
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:46,638
I'll kiss him a hundred times,
right in front of your eyes.

758
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:49,693
With that umbrella in your hand,
you can stand and watch,

759
00:42:49,718 --> 00:42:51,177
you bloody pervert!

760
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:52,529
Will you do that?

761
00:42:52,826 --> 00:42:53,834
Will you do that?

762
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,137
Then listen to this, as well.

763
00:42:56,826 --> 00:42:58,240
After running away from there,

764
00:42:58,498 --> 00:43:02,122
Antony and I checked in
at Hotel Kochi Courtyard with those girls.

765
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,615
He was in 202...

766
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:05,771
and I was in 203.

767
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,474
It was awesome!

768
00:43:08,248 --> 00:43:10,888
Go and say this to all
the girls in your hostel!

769
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:12,349
That's not necessary.

770
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,107
All of them are listening.

771
00:43:14,857 --> 00:43:16,544
You're on loudspeaker, you moron!

772
00:43:17,716 --> 00:43:18,716
Aargh!!

773
00:43:22,061 --> 00:43:25,115
Yet again, I've become a colossal disaster
for no reason at all, dear God!

774
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:28,503
Sandeep!

775
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:33,004
-Hey Arun!
-Are you happy now?

776
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:34,708
-Let go of him!
-She broke up with me!

777
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:37,425
That umbrella! Didn't you
do it deliberately, you dog?

778
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,066
-Let go of him!
-Move away!

779
00:43:39,091 --> 00:43:40,450
I know, you dog!

780
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:44,301
You snitched on me to the seniors
and ruined my life, you piece of shit!

781
00:43:44,326 --> 00:43:46,240
-I will kill you.
-Wait. Calm down!!

782
00:43:46,265 --> 00:43:47,653
What do you even know?

783
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:51,105
He told the seniors everything that
happened here, because they beat him up.

784
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,905
He didn't give that umbrella
to you, on purpose!

785
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,147
-Let go of him!
-Move aside!

786
00:43:56,349 --> 00:43:57,842
Who is he to beat me up!

787
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,870
There's nothing between us any more.
Forever!

shall I try to get her?

Why not!
But she has a certain class!

801
00:45:19,948 --> 00:45:22,089
She won't fall for street dogs.

802

This is a Levi's shirt, isn't it?

822
00:48:03,032 --> 00:48:05,038
Sir, it's my Mumma's birthday gift.

823
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:12,100
Haven't we told you not
to wear branded clothes?

00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:13,576
-That's the rule.

You won't listen to what I say?

Joe, are you okay?

00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:10,467
Mommy!

968
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,812
WHAT?

969
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,219
WHY?

970
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:15,061
WHO ARE YOU???

971
00:57:19,172 --> 00:57:21,438
Not on the face, please!

972
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:26,621
What?

973
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,459
Oh my God!

974
00:57:44,226 --> 00:57:45,460
-Serves him right!
 -Shruthi!

975
00:57:45,485 --> 00:57:47,281
Shruthi!

976
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:49,929
George, Kedar is not here.

977
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:51,679
-I think he has left.
-Stop it, dude!

978
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:15,855
What are you trying to prove?

979
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,891
I know what to do
with people who hurt me.

980
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:20,531
I don't need help from anybody!

981
00:58:21,274 --> 00:58:23,874
And not even for a moment should you
think that you're any better than him!

982
00:58:25,805 --> 00:58:27,578
Can't you see that
two people are talking?

983
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:29,398
And you're grinning
in between that?

984
00:58:31,922 --> 00:58:32,930
Come.

985
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:45,511
What?
Do you want to hit me?

986
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:46,797
No, bro.

987
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:48,157
I've come to take him.

988
00:58:51,956 --> 00:58:53,737
This is the fourth time you're getting
beaten up this month. Aren't you fed up?

989
00:58:53,753 --> 00:58:54,679
Shut up!

990
00:58:54,703 --> 00:58:56,413
Reverse! Reverse! Reverse!

991
00:58:56,438 --> 00:58:58,378
-Brother, go to the hospital quickly.
-Okay.

992
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:28,656
My father is really sick.

993
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:30,761
I've been thinking about
going to my home town.

994
00:59:30,786 --> 00:59:32,036
What about the exams?

995
00:59:33,852 --> 00:59:35,648
I am feeling really stressed
staying here.

996
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,539
Go and come back soon.

997
00:59:49,227 --> 00:59:50,641
Have you ordered any food, bro?

998
00:59:50,985 --> 00:59:53,235
-Woah!
-Oh my God!

999
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,468
Shut up!

1000
00:59:54,492 --> 00:59:56,313
Oh my darling!

1001
00:59:56,338 --> 00:59:57,445
Losers!

1002
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,664
Where does he get
these girls from?

1003
00:59:59,689 --> 01:00:01,609
-Oh my God!
-Learn from him!

1004
01:00:01,634 --> 01:00:03,305
Don't destroy our image as well.
Keep quiet!

1005
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,672
-I can't bear this, you dog.
-It's alright. Just chill.

1006
01:00:57,188 --> 01:00:58,803
-Who cleaned all this?
-Hey!

1007
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,687
Get the snacks. Joji, the opener
must be somewhere over there.

1008
01:01:01,712 --> 01:01:03,435
-Bring it.
-I'll open it with my mouth.

1009
01:01:03,657 --> 01:01:04,664
It's so hot.

1010
01:01:04,766 --> 01:01:07,070
-I can't find it here.
-Bring it quickly, dude.

1011
01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:08,539
Bro, can you give me
that girl's number?

1012
01:01:09,344 --> 01:01:10,352
Hi sir.

1013
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:12,539
Arun, pay for it.

1014
01:01:12,564 --> 01:01:13,572
I'll pay you later.

1015
01:01:14,188 --> 01:01:15,196
I don't have money.

1016
01:01:15,344 --> 01:01:16,960
Sorry, sir.
I can't take it back.

1017
01:01:16,985 --> 01:01:17,992
You can't?

1018
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:20,789
-No, sir.
-Then you shove it up!

1019
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:23,680
What is this?
Didn't I say that I'll return the money?

1020
01:01:23,712 --> 01:01:25,336
When have you ever
returned the money?

1021
01:01:25,985 --> 01:01:28,336
You come here only to drink
and sleep with girls, right?

1022
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:33,719
Why are you talking like this,
you scoundrel?

1023
01:01:33,766 --> 01:01:35,785
There's a limit to how much
a person can tolerate.

1024
01:01:36,578 --> 01:01:37,586
Is this even a house?

1025
01:01:38,497 --> 01:01:40,523
Is there even an inch
of clean space here?

1026
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:44,969
Whenever I walk in, this place
reeks of vomit and urine.

1027
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,639
I even throw your condoms
into the garbage.

1028
01:01:49,976 --> 01:01:51,109
Hey Arun!

1029
01:01:51,134 --> 01:01:52,843
Don't go overboard.

1030
01:01:53,312 --> 01:01:54,320
Here you are!

1031
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,620
Change your name from Lijo
to 'Anto's lackey'.

1032
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,978
Why do you alone have
such an issue with me, you prick?

1033
01:02:07,696 --> 01:02:09,381
No one else has any issue.

1034
01:02:09,406 --> 01:02:10,421
That's right.

1035
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,753
I'm the only one
who has an issue.

1036
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,495
None of you have any issue!

1037
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:18,321
Right?

1038
01:02:25,368 --> 01:02:27,764
Arun, come on.
Let's arrive at a compromise.

1039
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:30,227
You know, right?
It's Anto! It's our Anto!

1040
01:02:30,352 --> 01:02:31,929
Come on.
Let's arrive at a compromise.

1041
01:02:31,954 --> 01:02:32,962
Compromise?

1042
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:34,727
You go compromise.

1043
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:39,844
You guys can rot inside this filth
for the next two years and die!

1044
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:50,978
Hey!
Come in!

1045
01:02:51,672 --> 01:02:52,679
Dude...

1046
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,819
-Just for tonight.
-What's this, man?

1047
01:02:54,844 --> 01:02:56,120
Come inside.

1048
01:02:58,305 --> 01:03:00,323
Mom, this is Arun!

1049
01:03:00,366 --> 01:03:01,476
Hello!

1050
01:03:01,735 --> 01:03:02,922
The food will be ready now.

1051
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:04,820
-Akku..
-You can go and freshen up, son.

1052
01:03:04,845 --> 01:03:06,875
-Show him the room.
-What is this? Why are you like this?

1053
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:08,384
Come, go and get freshened up.

1054
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,869
We'll have dinner after that, okay?

1055
01:04:11,234 --> 01:04:12,708
-Sir?
-Over?

1056
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:14,335
No, sir.
Additional sheet, please.

1057
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,258
Thank you.

1058
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,240
It's been two days
since he came here.

1059
01:04:38,366 --> 01:04:39,881
He hasn't spoken to me at all.

1060
01:04:40,827 --> 01:04:42,146
I told you, right?

1061
01:04:42,321 --> 01:04:45,404
Didn't you notice his face and his body?

1062
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,615
I have a strong feeling
that he has been drinking.

1063
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:50,264
Please talk to him.

1064
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:56,929
I'm well aware...

1065
01:04:57,234 --> 01:05:00,211
of how I lived my life,
when I was your age.

1066
01:05:00,844 --> 01:05:02,959
That's why I don't advise you,

1067
01:05:04,118 --> 01:05:05,781
though your mother
keeps compelling me to.

1068
01:05:07,031 --> 01:05:08,881
I know that you're away from us.

1069
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,132
But...

1070
01:05:10,422 --> 01:05:12,412
don't think
that you are alone.

1071
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:14,889
For anything and everything,

1072
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,539
your father is here for you.

1073
01:05:17,422 --> 01:05:18,429
Understood?

1074
01:05:21,813 --> 01:05:23,149
You should quit alcohol.

1075
01:05:26,735 --> 01:05:27,742
Dad...

1076
01:05:28,071 --> 01:05:29,079
I don't really...

1077
01:05:29,462 --> 01:05:30,469
drink.

1078
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:34,552
What hurts me more than
you drinking alcohol,

1079
01:05:34,836 --> 01:05:36,385
is the fact that
you're lying to me.

1080
01:05:37,914 --> 01:05:38,922
Will you quit?

1081
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:46,447
If you won't feel embarrassed,

1082
01:05:46,922 --> 01:05:48,331
can I give you a hug?

1083
01:06:01,078 --> 01:06:02,086
What is this, son?

1084
01:06:09,117 --> 01:06:10,690
So, just like the last time,

1085
01:06:11,148 --> 01:06:12,925
-Puneet Singh is first.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1086
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:15,480
Selva Soundarrajan is second.

1087
01:06:15,811 --> 01:06:17,540
-Good job, Selva.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1088
01:06:17,649 --> 01:06:19,046
-Akhil Sathyan is third.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1089
01:06:19,071 --> 01:06:20,538
-Lokesh is fourth.
-Thanks, Ma'am.

1090
01:06:20,563 --> 01:06:22,210
-And Dhruv is fifth.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1091
01:06:22,304 --> 01:06:24,686
Congratulations, guys.
Most of you have improved,

1092
01:06:25,087 --> 01:06:26,616
except for the Malayali students.

1093
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:30,137
Arun has cleared one paper.

1094
01:06:30,608 --> 01:06:32,318
Rest, all of you are washed out.

1095
01:06:33,391 --> 01:06:34,857
Can't you join some other course?

1096
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:37,435
Wasting so many
seats unnecessarily!

1097
01:06:45,266 --> 01:06:46,274
Arun!

1098
01:06:47,164 --> 01:06:48,172
Bye!

1099
01:06:50,935 --> 01:06:52,669
-Awesome job, bro!
-How, bro?

1100
01:06:52,694 --> 01:06:54,365
There's nothing like that, bro.

1101
01:06:55,298 --> 01:06:56,570
Hey!

1102
01:06:56,991 --> 01:06:58,154
Our classmate, Selva?

1103
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,311
He's running a combined study group.

1104
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:03,813
Shall we ask him if we can also join?

1105
01:07:05,931 --> 01:07:07,774
He has no airs about himself.

1106
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:10,031
We'll ask him, huh?

1107
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:11,938
Yes.

1108
01:07:13,609 --> 01:07:15,399
Combined study it is, then.

1109
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:20,633
Hey! Over there.

1110
01:07:20,851 --> 01:07:21,859
Hey Selva!

1111
01:07:22,382 --> 01:07:23,608
-Selva!
-Yes!

1112
01:07:23,937 --> 01:07:25,577
Hey! What are you guys doing here?

1113
01:07:27,593 --> 01:07:28,601
Selva!

1114
01:07:28,726 --> 01:07:30,358
Will you let us join your
combined study group?

1115
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:31,984
Oh! You may join!
Hold this.

1116
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,194
-Usha Akka! I've kept the water here.
-Selva, the milk packet!

1117
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,624
-They kept it here?
-It's leaking!

1118
01:07:37,866 --> 01:07:38,874
Come on.

1119
01:07:39,304 --> 01:07:41,265
-Hey! Keep it there.
-Here?

1120
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,366
There's no water here.

1121
01:07:42,607 --> 01:07:45,303
This has been a never ending
problem in our city, for many years.

1122
01:07:50,273 --> 01:07:51,280
Come, dude!

1123
01:07:51,703 --> 01:07:52,823
This is our area!

1124
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:56,807
-Maari Anna!
-Yes!

1125
01:07:57,047 --> 01:07:58,553
Pay your electricity
bill today itself.

1126
01:07:58,578 --> 01:07:59,679
They will disconnect
it otherwise.

1127
01:07:59,812 --> 01:08:00,820
-Okay, Selva.

1128
01:08:02,273 --> 01:08:03,281
Hey!
Careful, guys!

1129
01:08:12,211 --> 01:08:13,219
Lachu Paatti (grandma)!

1130
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:14,999
Five minutes!

1131
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:17,601
-<i>Sambar Saadham</i> is getting ready.
- Okay!

1132
01:08:20,921 --> 01:08:22,687
Hey Arun!
Come, dude!

1133
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:26,584
What is this?
A bandit's hideout?

1134
01:08:27,545 --> 01:08:28,553
Come on!

1135
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:33,093
-Hey! Give me your hand!
-Selva!

1136
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:37,273
This is our place!

1137
01:08:37,937 --> 01:08:39,077
Anyone can come here...

1138
01:08:39,178 --> 01:08:40,186
and learn!

1139
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,530
75% of the people here...

1140
01:08:43,184 --> 01:08:45,106
are not from
well-to-do families.

1141
01:08:45,507 --> 01:08:47,233
They were sidelined
because they were poor.

1142
01:08:47,453 --> 01:08:49,452
But wait and watch!
Ten years from now,

1143
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:52,842
each student in this group
will be going places!

1144
01:08:55,656 --> 01:08:57,779
Don't look at it as just
another combined study group.

1145
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:59,075
This is a student movement.

1146
01:08:59,984 --> 01:09:01,682
To change our destiny,

1147
01:09:02,284 --> 01:09:04,098
we initiated this
silent revolution.

1148
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:09,547
Shucks!

1149
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:12,793
x-u=t

1150
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:16,175
dx=dt

1151
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:18,614
x=t+u

1152
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:33,527
-Yaay!
-Yes!

1153
01:09:34,142 --> 01:09:35,842
-Raja!
-Selva!

1154
01:09:38,538 --> 01:09:39,634
His name is Raja.

1155
01:09:39,733 --> 01:09:40,837
He's from Pannaipuram.

1156
01:09:41,265 --> 01:09:42,577
He creates amazing music.

1157
01:09:43,462 --> 01:09:45,240
You have arrears in the
fourth semester, right?

1158
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:46,265
Yes.

1159
01:09:46,344 --> 01:09:47,351
Third semester?

1160
01:09:47,376 --> 01:09:48,400
Yes.

1161
01:09:48,448 --> 01:09:49,500
Second?

1162
01:09:49,656 --> 01:09:51,179
We have arrears
in every semester, Selva.

1163
01:09:51,203 --> 01:09:53,226
Don't hurt our feelings
talking about all that.

1164
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,585
So, let's start with Maths and Physics.

1165
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,218
If you understand
Maths and Physics,

1166
01:09:58,351 --> 01:10:00,178
it's like you've understood
the whole world.

1167
01:10:00,203 --> 01:10:01,211
Here you go.

1168
01:10:02,515 --> 01:10:03,523
Kaali!

1169
01:10:04,172 --> 01:10:06,576
-First semester, Maths.
-We've just started. Come on!

1170
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:07,788
Go!

- Selva!
- Yes!

1188
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:46,728
You're going to
become an engineer.

1189
01:11:46,753 --> 01:11:49,174
-Yes.
-Her father presses clothes for a living.

1190
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,308
-So what?
-Have you really thought about it?

1191
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:54,403
To think about all possibilities
and plan everything in advance,

1192
01:11:54,442 --> 01:11:56,161
do you think I'm a Malayali?

1193
01:11:56,776 --> 01:11:58,182
I'm a Tamilian!

1194
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:00,527
A pure Tamilian!

What's your dream, Selva?

1204
01:12:55,492 --> 01:12:57,358
I dream of the day my parents
can sleep without a worry.

1205
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,648
What more can I ask for?

1206
01:13:03,682 --> 01:13:06,443
The semester results are quite
surprising this time.

1207
01:13:06,851 --> 01:13:08,250
Selva is first!

1208
01:13:08,674 --> 01:13:09,904
-Selva!
-Thank you!

1209
01:13:12,252 --> 01:13:14,154
-Puneet Singh is second.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1210
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:15,860
Gia D'Costa is third.

1211
01:13:16,064 --> 01:13:17,813
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-Girl power, finally!

1212
01:13:18,315 --> 01:13:20,150
-Akhil Sathyan is fourth.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1213
01:13:21,519 --> 01:13:23,282
Arun Neelakandan is fifth.

1214
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:25,135
Bro!

1215
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:28,011
Awesome!

1216
01:13:30,314 --> 01:13:33,540
Arun, you've cleared 18
back papers in one stretch?

1217
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:35,323
Yes, Ma'am.

1218
01:13:36,406 --> 01:13:37,414
Wow!

1219
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:45,087
Superb, bro!
That's awesome.

1220
01:13:45,112 --> 01:13:46,464
Congratulations!

1221
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:47,852
And you too, Antony!

1222
01:13:48,401 --> 01:13:50,086
You also have cleared
a lot of papers.

1223
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:51,750
Me?

1224
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:53,937
Good going!

1225
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:56,680
I'm too good, bro!

1226
01:13:56,705 --> 01:13:57,713
Arun!

1227
01:13:57,738 --> 01:13:59,042
When are you giving us a treat?

1228
01:13:59,089 --> 01:14:00,760
We have class only
till noon today, right?

1229
01:14:00,985 --> 01:14:03,133
Let's go to Hotel Crescent
and have Mutton Biriyani.

1230
01:14:03,633 --> 01:14:05,274
-Can I call our boys?
-Call everyone!

1231
01:14:05,299 --> 01:14:06,299
Super!

1232
01:14:06,565 --> 01:14:08,125
By the way, bro...

1233
01:14:08,565 --> 01:14:10,742
After that, can you come
with me to meet Selvi?

1234
01:14:11,073 --> 01:14:12,080
I have...

1235
01:14:13,331 --> 01:14:14,604
bought a saree for her.

1236
01:14:14,629 --> 01:14:16,557
Huh? You're already
buying her sarees and all?

1237
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:18,104
Hey! Don't yell bro!

1238
01:14:18,129 --> 01:14:19,471
I hope the people there
don't pummel you!

1239
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:20,504
Shut up!

1240
01:14:32,472 --> 01:14:33,682
-What is it?
-Forget it.

1241
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:34,940
Hey!

1242
01:14:35,025 --> 01:14:36,704
Please stop at an ATM
counter on the way.

1243
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:39,869
Do you even have to say?
We're going to make you splurge!

1244
01:14:51,573 --> 01:14:53,618
Calm down!
Please calm down!

1245
01:14:54,565 --> 01:14:55,573
Don't go forward.

1246
01:14:55,628 --> 01:14:57,078
You cannot go forward.

1247
01:14:57,103 --> 01:14:58,384
There has been a small accident.

1248
01:14:58,503 --> 01:14:59,753
What accident, sir?

1249
01:14:59,784 --> 01:15:00,792
I'll tell you later.

1250
01:15:00,886 --> 01:15:02,120
Move back now.

1251
01:15:02,487 --> 01:15:04,331
-Go back, please.
-What happened, sir?

1252
01:15:04,356 --> 01:15:06,400
The bus ran over
a third year student!

1253
01:15:06,425 --> 01:15:07,612
-Hey!
-What?

1254
01:15:07,885 --> 01:15:09,970
Selva!!!

1255
01:15:09,995 --> 01:15:11,354
Selva!

1256
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:19,736
Selva!

1257
01:15:21,713 --> 01:15:23,070
Selva!

1258
01:15:25,526 --> 01:15:26,534
Move away!

1259
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:30,547
Make way!

1260
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:55,632
I found this in Selva's bag.

1261
01:15:58,736 --> 01:16:00,655
The saree he bought for Tamizhselvi.

1262
01:16:08,909 --> 01:16:09,917
Arun...

1263
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:12,117
His house is near Arakkonam.

1264
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,478
Since it's outside the city,

1265
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:16,555
I don't think many students
would come there.

1266
01:16:17,321 --> 01:16:19,032
Shouldn't we go and see him?

1267
01:16:22,799 --> 01:16:23,986
I can't see him like that!

1268
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:35,307
Don't come if you don't want to.

1269
01:16:36,347 --> 01:16:37,362
I will go!

1270
01:16:38,096 --> 01:16:40,674
I won't let him burn to ashes
without anyone by his side.

1271
01:16:41,456 --> 01:16:42,464
I will go!

1272
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:16,190
<i>Amma</i>, how do we go
to the cremation ground?

1273
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:17,307
-Go straight.
-Straight?

1274
01:17:35,744 --> 01:17:37,177
Selva!

1275
01:17:37,245 --> 01:17:39,587
Where have you gone,
leaving us behind?

1276
01:17:43,386 --> 01:17:44,784
Selva!

1277
01:17:44,972 --> 01:17:45,979
Selva!

1278
01:17:50,018 --> 01:17:52,400
Look at our Selva.

1279
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:55,010
Whom do we have now?

1280
01:17:58,878 --> 01:18:00,040
Selva's parents.

1281
01:18:03,236 --> 01:18:04,836
What's your dream, Selva?

1282
01:18:04,924 --> 01:18:06,790
I dream of the day my parents
can sleep without a worry.

1283
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,150
What more can I ask for?

1284
01:18:11,243 --> 01:18:12,532
We shouldn't cry, brother.

1285
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:16,203
It's just his body that's
being consumed by the fire.

Is he just that?

1288
01:18:20,423 --> 01:18:21,813
Is that all there is to Selva?

1289
01:18:23,322 --> 01:18:24,329
He is hiding.

1290
01:18:24,963 --> 01:18:26,220
He is here, somewhere.

Bye.

1337
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:11,228
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1338
01:23:11,511 --> 01:23:12,518
What happened?

1339
01:23:12,558 --> 01:23:13,558
Papa...

1340
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:17,510
He was wearing this shirt
even this morning.

1341
01:23:24,025 --> 01:23:26,064
We have no one now, Arun.

1342
01:23:36,331 --> 01:23:38,424
If I ask you something,

1343
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:40,964
will you say the truth?

1344
01:23:43,909 --> 01:23:44,917
Have you ever...

1345
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:47,996
loved me the way you
loved Darshana?

1346
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:18,813
<i>That was a night which made me
feel extremely lonely and guilty.</i>

1347
01:24:20,344 --> 01:24:23,711
<i>Someone who was always around,
but someone whom I'd never spoken to...</i>

1348
01:24:23,735 --> 01:24:26,344
<i>On that night, I noticed
a cycle tea-seller.</i>

1349
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:28,547
<i>I felt like talking to him.</i>

1350
01:24:30,151 --> 01:24:32,338
How many years has it been
since you came to Chennai?

1351
01:24:34,087 --> 01:24:36,202
I came here when this city
was called <i>Madras</i>.

1352
01:24:37,636 --> 01:24:38,643
When I came here,

1353
01:24:40,339 --> 01:24:41,672
none of this was here.

1354
01:24:43,784 --> 01:24:45,284
Did you come here
in search of a job?

1355
01:24:45,846 --> 01:24:46,853
Cinema!

1356
01:24:47,112 --> 01:24:48,119
Acting?

1357
01:24:52,682 --> 01:24:53,698
In the '80s,

1358
01:24:54,792 --> 01:24:58,485
I had produced around
seven to eight Malayalam films.

1359
01:24:59,721 --> 01:25:00,729
What's your name?

1360
01:25:10,002 --> 01:25:12,687
<i>A heavy downpour happened
and ceased over the same night.</i>

1361
01:25:13,768 --> 01:25:15,374
<i>Semester exams began, soon after.</i>

1362
01:25:16,298 --> 01:25:18,671
<i>None of us realized how
another year went by.</i>

1363
01:25:19,386 --> 01:25:20,813
<i>Campus placements,</i>

1364

<i>preparations for higher studies...</i>

1365
01:25:23,596 --> 01:25:26,578
<i>In the meanwhile, I patched up
with my Malayali friends.</i>

1366
01:25:26,695 --> 01:25:28,837
I'm asking this because we've royally
flunked all our exams.

1367
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:30,852
Shall we join
your combined study group?

1368
01:25:31,073 --> 01:25:32,829
Why not! You should all come.
We'll see.

1369
01:25:32,854 --> 01:25:33,862
That's great.

1370
01:25:34,424 --> 01:25:36,033
-How much?
-200 Rupees.

1371
01:25:36,072 --> 01:25:37,072
Two Hundred...

1372
01:25:37,284 --> 01:25:38,721
Hey Arun!
I'll pay!

1373
01:25:39,542 --> 01:25:40,550
Let's split it.

1374
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:43,791
<i>All the top students in my class...</i>

1375
01:25:43,821 --> 01:25:46,439
<i>were targeting foreign
universities and studying accordingly.</i>

1376
01:25:47,533 --> 01:25:49,454
<i>Darshana, Kaali and I...</i>

1377
01:25:49,721 --> 01:25:51,424
<i>got jobs in
campus placements.</i>

1378
01:25:52,323 --> 01:25:54,783
<i>The ones who clear a lot
of back papers at one go,</i>

1379
01:25:54,808 --> 01:25:58,230
<i>will be adept at meeting deadlines.
Due to this finding by the HR department,</i>

1380
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:01,643
<i>even our Malayali group could
secure jobs at good companies.</i>

1381
01:26:02,136 --> 01:26:04,174
-Yaay!
-Maya!

1382
01:26:06,651 --> 01:26:08,573
<i>During the last semester,</i>

1383
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:12,401
<i>I could see an extremely happy Maya
laughing out loud.</i>

1384
01:26:25,916 --> 01:26:26,924
Joe!

1385
01:26:30,048 --> 01:26:31,292
I'm really sorry, Joe.

1386
01:26:33,292 --> 01:26:34,299
It's okay, sir.

1387
01:26:35,526 --> 01:26:36,810
You don't have to call me <i>Sir</i>.

1388
01:26:37,924 --> 01:26:38,932
Call me Arun.

1389
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:41,244
Okay, Arun.

1390
01:26:42,995 --> 01:26:44,002
Arun...

1391

Can I ask you something?

1392
01:26:48,963 --> 01:26:49,970
Maya...

1393
01:26:50,353 --> 01:26:52,160
Why did she break up with you?

1394
01:26:55,979 --> 01:26:57,271
She deserved someone better.

1508
01:37:50,302 --> 01:37:52,010
It barely covers my fuel bills.

It's a new venture, right?

1512
01:37:59,299 --> 01:38:01,799

But there's one thing.

1514

I feel really peaceful.

That feeling...

1516
01:38:08,665 --> 01:38:10,456
I have no idea how
to achieve that.

1517
01:38:11,954 --> 01:38:13,704
I don't have any
particular passion either.

1518

I don't know what to do.

1519

-Quit your job.

1522

Wander around for a bit.

1523
01:38:22,698 --> 01:38:24,490
Then, find what you really like.

1524
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:25,656
And get into that.

1525
01:38:25,823 --> 01:38:27,323
Money will follow.

1526
01:38:27,365 --> 01:38:28,365
What if it doesn't?

1527
01:38:28,448 --> 01:38:29,573
You will starve!

1528

But she had a point.

Are you a photographer?

1535
01:39:15,865 --> 01:39:17,156

-It's okay for me.
-Is it?

-Can I have a look?
-Err...

-This is beautiful.
-Thank you.

-What's your name?
-Arun.

1543

I am Jimmy.

1544

I'm a wedding photographer.

What about you?

1546
01:39:42,031 --> 01:39:43,865
I was with Infomax,
but now I'm not working.

1547
01:39:43,906 --> 01:39:45,573
-So you're not working currently?
-Nope.

1548
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:48,740
Not working currently!

1549
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,135
Do you believe in destiny?

1550
01:39:52,731 --> 01:39:55,273
-I don't know much about all that.
-Ah! It's good that you don't.

1551
01:39:55,273 --> 01:39:56,356
You'll go crazy!

1552
01:39:57,106 --> 01:39:58,273
You know how it is for me?

1553
01:39:58,565 --> 01:40:00,190
If I wish for something,

1554
01:40:00,273 --> 01:40:01,690
it will be brought right before me.

1555
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,565
-By whom?
-God!

1556
01:40:05,148 --> 01:40:06,815
I was just thinking
of quitting my job,

1557
01:40:06,815 --> 01:40:09,315

-Well, I..
-Why? You don't want to collaborate?

1562
01:40:17,856 --> 01:40:18,981
I didn't mean that.

1563
01:40:18,981 --> 01:40:20,856
-I'm not a professional.
-That's not a problem.

1564
01:40:20,898 --> 01:40:22,216
And, we just met, right?

1565
01:40:22,224 --> 01:40:24,082
Yeah! We should have met
much earlier.

1566
01:40:24,106 --> 01:40:26,065
We got late.
I felt so too.

1567
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:31,023
I have great contacts.

1568
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:33,190
I'm serious.

1569
01:40:34,402 --> 01:40:36,736
We can cover at least four
or five weddings in a month.

1570

I'll pay you Rs. 20,000

01:40:38,773 --> 01:40:39,773
What say?

1572
01:40:39,815 --> 01:40:42,065
-How much?
-Err... 20,000 Rupees.

1573

Okay!
Twenty five!

1574
01:40:48,148 --> 01:40:50,815
Fine! 30,000.
Don't ask for more than that. Please!

1575
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:52,731
I need to think about it.

1576
01:40:52,773 --> 01:40:54,606
Go ahead.
I'll be right here.

1577
01:40:56,106 --> 01:40:57,398
-Sir, ticket?
-I didn't buy it?

1578

No.

-Hey Sathish!
-Move away, you!

1587
01:41:16,273 --> 01:41:17,940
Don't crowd around.
Please move!

1588
01:41:18,328 --> 01:41:19,703
-Over here!
-Excuse me!

1589
01:41:22,843 --> 01:41:23,885
Smile, damn it!

The feast is ready
at the dining hall.

1593

After getting photos clicked,

1594

all of you may proceed
to the dining hall.

1595

he should feed her.

1598

1599
01:41:42,574 --> 01:41:43,574
Feed, feed!

01:42:05,362 --> 01:42:06,403
Careful!

1603
01:42:07,356 --> 01:42:08,398
Hey!

1604
01:42:08,648 --> 01:42:09,648
What is this?

1605
01:42:10,429 --> 01:42:11,637
What kind of photos are these?

1606
01:42:12,871 --> 01:42:15,232
You've covered the groom's family
really well.

1607
01:42:15,523 --> 01:42:17,273
-We're the ones paying you, right?
-There's still more to pay.

1608
01:42:17,332 --> 01:42:19,040
-I'm the bride's mother, right?
-Yeah!

1609
01:42:19,065 --> 01:42:20,687
Have you clicked a single photo
of me smiling?

1610
01:42:20,703 --> 01:42:21,332
No.

1611
01:42:21,356 --> 01:42:23,106
What kind of photographer are you?

1612
01:42:24,933 --> 01:42:26,433
-What's your name?
-Jimmy!

1613
01:42:26,488 --> 01:42:27,488
Nice name!

1614
01:42:27,606 --> 01:42:28,731
Take this with you!

1615
01:42:28,815 --> 01:42:30,648
-But I..
-Just get lost!

1616
01:42:32,565 --> 01:42:33,690
What?

1617
01:42:35,414 --> 01:42:37,706
They think they can say anything
 if they are paying us!

1618
01:42:37,731 --> 01:42:39,315
But they want
everything to be done!

1619
01:42:39,315 --> 01:42:40,815
It's a grand wedding, right?

1620
01:42:40,856 --> 01:42:43,148
Candid photography,
traditional photography...

1621
01:42:43,148 --> 01:42:44,606
Traditional with candid photography...

1622
01:42:44,606 --> 01:42:46,356
Helicam, Jimmy Jib and what not!

1623
01:42:46,944 --> 01:42:49,069
Where do I take all this?
To that town hall!

1624
01:42:49,094 --> 01:42:50,427
And that place has no AC or fridge!

1625
01:42:50,452 --> 01:42:51,827
I mean... no fans!

1626
01:42:52,073 --> 01:42:53,615
And there are those
saree-clad aunties,

1627
01:42:53,726 --> 01:42:55,851
sweating like they just took a steam bath.

1628
01:42:56,698 --> 01:42:59,365
Didn't that hag say that
there's no smiling photo of hers?

1629
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:01,948
To make people smile when they don't,
have I learned morphing?

1630
01:43:02,198 --> 01:43:03,656
-Jimmy bro!
-What?

1631
01:43:04,031 --> 01:43:05,031
Come here.

1632
01:43:06,448 --> 01:43:07,948
What do you think
about these photos?

1633
01:43:09,615 --> 01:43:10,615
They are really nice.

1634
01:43:11,906 --> 01:43:14,406
They were clicked in Chennai
by a photographer named Danny

1635
01:43:14,448 --> 01:43:16,156
for a company called
'Weddings by Alpheus'.

1636
01:43:16,531 --> 01:43:18,406
This company doesn't
cover grand weddings.

1637
01:43:18,865 --> 01:43:20,891
They cover only small weddings
of people who are educated,

1638
01:43:20,916 --> 01:43:22,306
wise and mature enough.

1639
01:43:23,115 --> 01:43:25,740
With just immediate family members
and close friends in attendance,

1640
01:43:25,781 --> 01:43:26,948
Intimate weddings!

1641
01:43:28,381 --> 01:43:30,506
There's no brand which specializes
exclusively in intimate weddings,

1642
01:43:30,531 --> 01:43:31,656
currently in Kerala.

1643
01:43:32,031 --> 01:43:33,073
Why don't we start one?

1644
01:43:33,115 --> 01:43:34,823
Why not?
Let's start it today itself.

1645
01:43:35,115 --> 01:43:36,948
So that we can sit at home
from tomorrow.

1646
01:43:37,906 --> 01:43:39,156
Dude, what do you think?

1647
01:43:39,698 --> 01:43:42,531
You think weddings are conducted
in Kerala to get two people married?

1648
01:43:42,698 --> 01:43:44,448
A wedding here is a huge
celebratory event,

1649
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:46,115
where people invite relatives,
friends and acquaintances...

1650
01:43:46,156 --> 01:43:47,490
... to show off their pomp and grandeur.

1651
01:43:47,531 --> 01:43:49,823
Take your <i>intimate</i> concept to
them and watch how they react!

1652
01:43:49,865 --> 01:43:51,531
-Sheesh!
-Jimmy bro!

1653
01:43:52,156 --> 01:43:55,281
Many people are reconsidering
the idea of having grand weddings.

1654
01:43:55,323 --> 01:43:57,240
Most Hindi actors are getting
married like this now.

1655
01:43:57,656 --> 01:43:59,198
Even our actor Prithviraj
got married like this!

1656
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,448
Oh yeah!
Rajuettan is awesome!

1657
01:44:01,865 --> 01:44:03,865
If we target Kerala alone,
we'll be in a fix.

1658
01:44:04,281 --> 01:44:06,406
We should market our company
all over India.

1659
01:44:07,406 --> 01:44:08,615
If we start this now,

1660
01:44:09,281 --> 01:44:11,531
when intimate weddings
start trending in Kerala,

1661
01:44:11,615 --> 01:44:13,490
we will be the kings here!

1662
01:44:15,659 --> 01:44:18,406
Everyone is running
after grand weddings now.

1663
01:44:19,031 --> 01:44:21,906
Should we run along with them,
or ahead of them?

1664
01:44:22,281 --> 01:44:23,281

-Yes.

Dude, he's a top singer in Bollywood.

1678
01:45:13,073 --> 01:45:15,573
He charges millions for an ad.
Don't you know all this?

1679
01:45:15,615 --> 01:45:17,615
-We needn't pay him in millions.
-How much, then?

1680
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:19,240
Is 10,000 fine?

So, please do come, see us.
Okay?

1685
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:35,781
I have something to share
with you guys.

1686
01:45:35,948 --> 01:45:37,656
I have a friend, Arun Neelakandan.

1687
01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:40,240
And he's one of the best photographers
that I know personally.

1688
01:45:40,281 --> 01:45:41,990
Dude, he's hyping you up!

1689
01:45:42,156 --> 01:45:44,281
Now he's starting his own
wedding photography brand...

1690
01:45:44,323 --> 01:45:45,781
...called <i>Blue Eye
Intimate Weddings</i>.

1691
01:45:45,823 --> 01:45:46,823
Ours?

1692
01:45:46,865 --> 01:45:49,365
So, the first couple to book
their wedding with this brand,

1693
01:45:50,281 --> 01:45:52,156
I will sing at their wedding,

1694
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,240
for free!

1695
01:45:53,531 --> 01:45:56,281
Did he say that he'll sing for free,
at our first wedding?

1696
01:45:56,406 --> 01:45:57,948
Did he just say <i>free</i>?
Are you sure?

1697
01:45:57,948 --> 01:46:00,031
-Prateek, I love you man!
-I love you too, dude!

1698
01:46:00,156 --> 01:46:01,240

1699

1701
01:46:07,156 --> 01:46:08,156
Sure, sir.
Sure, sir.

1702
01:46:08,531 --> 01:46:09,573
We can do all that.

1703
01:46:09,865 --> 01:46:11,698
With that single video
from Prateek Tiwari...

1704
01:46:12,448 --> 01:46:15,740
we received around 20 wedding
enquiries in two days.

1705
01:46:16,115 --> 01:46:18,948
The most surprising fact was that
many of them were from Kerala.

1706
01:46:19,406 --> 01:46:21,198
If we get all this advance money,
we'll rock it!

1707

is the freedom that we get.

When we go for certain weddings,

1739
01:47:53,031 --> 01:47:54,781
we feel that the bride
is nothing...

or bridesmaids. So many girls!

01:57:20,865 --> 01:57:22,115
This is called <i>Bun Parotta</i>.

1919
01:57:22,156 --> 01:57:23,281
Madurai style!

1920
01:57:24,198 --> 01:57:25,656
When are you going to Chennai?

1921
01:57:26,156 --> 01:57:27,240
Tomorrow evening.

1922
01:57:27,281 --> 01:57:28,490
-By train?
-Yes.

1923
01:57:32,281 --> 01:57:33,365
Shall I come with you?

1924
01:57:36,794 --> 01:57:38,698
I'm travelling in a second
class compartment.

1925
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:40,615
Should I upgrade to an AC coach?

1926
01:57:41,073 --> 01:57:43,073
Nah!
The windows can't be opened.

1927
01:57:43,573 --> 01:57:44,781
Can't feel the wind either.

1928
01:57:45,615 --> 01:57:46,865
Second class is fine!

1929
01:57:48,577 --> 01:57:49,577
Sure!

1930
01:57:56,208 --> 01:57:57,950
A bit more windy
than you expected, right?

1931
01:58:31,323 --> 01:58:32,365
Good morning!

1932
01:58:33,096 --> 01:58:34,096
Good morning!

1933
01:58:39,901 --> 01:58:40,901
Hi kiddo!

1934
01:58:44,101 --> 01:58:45,518
-Hey!
-Bro!

1935
01:58:45,559 --> 01:58:46,601
-How are you?
-Hi.

1936
01:58:46,976 --> 01:58:48,351
-Who is this, bro?
-My friend.

1937
01:58:48,393 --> 01:58:49,768
-Your friend? Hello.
-Hi.

1938
01:58:50,268 --> 01:58:51,518
-Come on.
-Now tell me.

1939
01:58:51,809 --> 01:58:53,143
-Who's the client?
-The client?

1940
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,809
You've come so far.
Now see for yourself.

1941
01:59:08,559 --> 01:59:09,851
It's my daughter's wedding.

1942
01:59:10,559 --> 01:59:11,643
We'll make it grand!

01:59:45,941 --> 01:59:49,434
Identify all the relatives and close
friends of the bride and groom.

1953
01:59:49,476 --> 01:59:50,143
Okay.

-Can you tell me...

1963
02:00:10,809 --> 02:00:13,434
-who the close relatives are?
-I'll tell you. You're really beautiful!

1964
02:00:13,476 --> 02:00:14,976
I am a production
controller in the movies.

1965
02:00:15,018 --> 02:00:16,997
I'll get you a chance
to act as a heroine.

1966
02:00:17,013 --> 02:00:17,952
Give me your number.

1967
02:00:17,976 --> 02:00:19,143
I won't chat with you.

1968
02:00:19,226 --> 02:00:20,726
Only video calls!

1969
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:23,018

Arun!

1976
02:00:43,228 --> 02:00:45,228
I've got all the details.
It's all set.

1977
02:00:46,476 --> 02:00:48,518
This is my old camera.
You can join me.

1978
02:00:48,559 --> 02:00:49,976
I don't know how to use this.

1979
02:00:49,976 --> 02:00:51,101
Just make sure
that the photos are in focus.

1980
02:00:51,143 --> 02:00:53,143
Oh! Photography is so easy, huh?

1981
02:00:53,143 --> 02:00:54,684
Oh!
Give it back!

1982
02:00:55,143 --> 02:00:56,518
No!
Let me try.

1989
02:01:43,934 --> 02:01:44,934
Sure!

1990
02:02:14,726 --> 02:02:17,018
Hey Maari! Why haven't you
paid the electricity bill?

1991
02:02:17,018 --> 02:02:18,393
I'll pay it today!

1992
02:02:18,393 --> 02:02:19,643
Do whatever you want!

1993
02:02:39,163 --> 02:02:40,205
Who are you?

1994
02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:41,271
Huh?

1995
02:02:42,726 --> 02:02:43,726
Who are you?

1996
02:02:46,851 --> 02:02:47,934
Lachu Paatti?

1997
02:02:47,934 --> 02:02:49,726
No. We've been staying
here for three years.

1998
02:02:49,726 --> 02:02:51,018
There's no one like that here.

1999
02:02:53,476 --> 02:02:54,851
-Okay.
-Okay.

2000
02:03:06,643 --> 02:03:07,643
Arun bro!

2001
02:03:11,809 --> 02:03:13,309
-How are you, dear?
-I am great.

2002
02:03:13,309 --> 02:03:14,309
I am married now.

2003
02:03:14,351 --> 02:03:15,351
I can see that.

2004
02:03:16,809 --> 02:03:17,809
Are you happy?

2005
02:03:17,934 --> 02:03:19,154
I am at peace, brother.

2006
02:03:19,768 --> 02:03:21,518
I had gone to Lachu Paatti's house.

2007
02:03:21,559 --> 02:03:22,726
But nobody is there.

2008
02:03:22,726 --> 02:03:23,726
Lachu Paatti?

2009
02:03:26,386 --> 02:03:27,428
You want to see her?

2010
02:03:30,726 --> 02:03:32,309
Hey Arun!

2011
02:03:32,309 --> 02:03:33,851
-Grandma!
-Come on in!

2012
02:03:33,893 --> 02:03:34,893
Please come.

2013
02:03:37,476 --> 02:03:38,851
I'm seeing you
after so many years!

2014
02:03:38,851 --> 02:03:40,976
-It's been really long, Grandma!
-Don't you remember this grandma?

2015
02:03:41,018 --> 02:03:43,184
-It's not like that.
-As soon as you left after your studies,

2016
02:03:43,226 --> 02:03:44,518
you forgot this grandma, right?

2017
02:03:44,518 --> 02:03:45,934
Have I forgotten you?

2018
02:03:45,934 --> 02:03:46,976
Never!

2019
02:03:47,434 --> 02:03:48,434
Vijay!

2020
02:03:48,518 --> 02:03:49,809
-Look who's here!
-Hi!

2021
02:03:49,809 --> 02:03:50,809
-Hi.
-Hi. Vijay.

2022
02:03:50,851 --> 02:03:51,851
Arun.

2023
02:03:51,893 --> 02:03:53,184
Grandma has told me
a lot about you.

2024
02:03:53,184 --> 02:03:55,476
Okay. Please carry on.
I'll see you later.

2025
02:03:55,518 --> 02:03:57,143
Wait.
I'll bring coffee for you.

2026
02:03:57,726 --> 02:03:58,726
Grandma!

2027
02:03:58,768 --> 02:04:00,184
Can I get some <i>Sambar Saadham</i>?

2028
02:04:01,893 --> 02:04:03,018
Wait, I'll bring it.

2029
02:04:16,947 --> 02:04:20,072
The two of you should always
stay together and be happy.

2030
02:04:21,226 --> 02:04:23,101
Grandma, we're just friends.

2031
02:04:23,768 --> 02:04:25,601
Oh! Friends, huh?

2032
02:04:27,143 --> 02:04:28,851
Seems like the two of you
are best friends?

2033
02:04:28,893 --> 02:04:29,893
No.

2034
02:04:29,932 --> 02:04:31,848
I swear, we're just friends, Grandma.

2035
02:04:35,851 --> 02:04:37,018
Are you that crazy about him?

2036
02:04:37,059 --> 02:04:38,393
He's a sweetheart, sis'.

2037
02:04:39,893 --> 02:04:41,726
You had a boyfriend
in college, right?

2038
02:04:41,726 --> 02:04:43,184
What was his name?
Tin? Aluminium?

2039
02:04:43,184 --> 02:04:44,184
Tinson!

2040
02:04:44,309 --> 02:04:47,101
-Is this guy like him?
-No! He's not like that loser!

2041
02:04:47,726 --> 02:04:49,768
Back then, he had
his eyes on me.

2042
02:04:49,851 --> 02:04:51,601
That's just your imagination.

2043
02:04:52,226 --> 02:04:54,018
Okay, agreed.
He had his eyes on you.

2044
02:04:54,059 --> 02:04:56,768
Now, please talk to Papa
and Mumma about this.

2045
02:04:57,726 --> 02:04:58,726
Let me see.

2046
02:04:59,309 --> 02:05:00,309
Thank you!

2047
02:05:02,643 --> 02:05:04,559
Wedding photographer?
No way!

2048
02:05:04,768 --> 02:05:05,934
Why not?

2049
02:05:06,018 --> 02:05:08,768
She is an engineer working
at a software company.

2050
02:05:08,809 --> 02:05:09,934
He's also like that.

2051
02:05:10,018 --> 02:05:11,601
When he got bored,
he quit that and started this.

2052
02:05:11,601 --> 02:05:12,809
What does he earn by doing this?

2053
02:05:12,851 --> 02:05:15,268
He earns much more than
what you earn in a month, Papa.

2054
02:05:15,643 --> 02:05:17,309
-Sis'!
-Through wedding photography?

2055
02:05:17,476 --> 02:05:18,726
But it won't work out.

2056
02:05:18,934 --> 02:05:20,922
There are a thousand
still photographers,

2057
02:05:20,969 --> 02:05:22,494
walking around with cameras.

2058
02:05:22,518 --> 02:05:24,309
It's an extremely competitive field.

2059
02:05:24,893 --> 02:05:26,809
If he goes jobless tomorrow,
who will take care of her?

2060
02:05:26,851 --> 02:05:28,101
Why should he take care of me?

2061
02:05:28,184 --> 02:05:29,309
I can take care of myself.

2062
02:05:29,351 --> 02:05:31,434
And if he's jobless,
I'll take care of him, as well.

2063
02:05:31,851 --> 02:05:33,768
What?
Do you think I can't, Papa?

2064
02:05:34,601 --> 02:05:36,726
My dear, you don't know
how men are!

2065
02:05:36,851 --> 02:05:38,559
They are really complicated!

2066
02:05:38,559 --> 02:05:40,101
If they lose their jobs,

2067
02:05:40,101 --> 02:05:42,309
or if the wife earns
more than the husband,

2068
02:05:42,351 --> 02:05:44,143
they will have all sorts of complexes.

2069
02:05:44,226 --> 02:05:45,684
It will create huge problems
in your family life.

2070
02:05:45,726 --> 02:05:47,351
-Papa, he's not like you.
-He's not?

2071
02:05:47,559 --> 02:05:50,434
Today's boys are not as problematic
as the men from your generation.

2072
02:05:50,434 --> 02:05:53,226
Now you don't join them
and make them like you.

2073
02:05:54,726 --> 02:05:55,726
Papa...

2074
02:05:56,518 --> 02:05:57,559
If you say no,

2075
02:05:57,726 --> 02:05:58,934
I won't marry him.

2076
02:05:59,934 --> 02:06:03,559
But some other clever girl
will definitely snatch him away.

2077
02:06:04,059 --> 02:06:05,518
If that happens,

2078
02:06:05,643 --> 02:06:07,184
I will never forgive you, Papa.

2079
02:06:09,018 --> 02:06:10,768
In case he develops a complex,

2080
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:13,035
and it becomes an issue
like you mentioned,

2081
02:06:13,059 --> 02:06:14,726
I won't wait even for a second.

2082
02:06:15,059 --> 02:06:17,601
I'll get divorced and come
back to you immediately.

2083
02:06:17,643 --> 02:06:18,643
You spoiled brat!

2084
02:06:19,018 --> 02:06:20,101
What is this?

2085
02:06:20,101 --> 02:06:22,684
Pampered her, didn't you?
Deal with it!

2086
02:06:23,684 --> 02:06:24,768
Papa!

2087
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,351
Eventually I'm going to get married.

2088
02:06:26,518 --> 02:06:28,143
Might as well marry
someone I love.

2089
02:06:28,715 --> 02:06:29,924
Please agree, Papa.

2090
02:06:31,101 --> 02:06:32,101
Please!

2091
02:06:32,518 --> 02:06:34,226
-Please?
-Please agree, Papa!

2092
02:06:34,226 --> 02:06:35,393
Agree, Papa!

2093
02:06:35,434 --> 02:06:37,101
-Please agree.
-Do whatever you want!

2094
02:06:37,101 --> 02:06:38,726
Say it happily!

2095
02:06:38,976 --> 02:06:40,018
Do whatever you want!

2096
02:06:40,059 --> 02:06:41,351
A little more!

2097
02:06:41,393 --> 02:06:43,059
More happiness, Papa!
Come on!

2098
02:06:43,101 --> 02:06:44,726
Marry whoever you want!

2099
02:06:44,726 --> 02:06:46,559
Awww! Thank you!

2100
02:06:47,601 --> 02:06:49,726
Thank you, Papa!

2101
02:06:56,851 --> 02:06:58,184
-Huh?
-Oh no!

2102
02:06:58,643 --> 02:06:59,643
Arun!

2103
02:07:00,268 --> 02:07:02,309
-My friend Arun is getting married.
-God bless him.

2104
02:07:02,358 --> 02:07:03,358
Same to you!

2105
02:07:04,476 --> 02:07:05,476
-Hello?
-Hey!

2106
02:07:05,976 --> 02:07:07,018
All set, huh?

2107
02:07:07,184 --> 02:07:08,184
Bro!

2108
02:07:08,434 --> 02:07:09,643
Congratulations!

2109
02:07:09,684 --> 02:07:12,643
Bro, I'm working as an assistant
in Allu Arjun's film.

2110
02:07:12,684 --> 02:07:14,851
I'm at the sound mixing studio.
I'll be there.

2111
02:07:15,268 --> 02:07:18,184
More punch, bro!
More punch!

2112
02:07:18,309 --> 02:07:19,559
I'll be there, for sure.

2113
02:07:20,643 --> 02:07:21,268
Okay!

2114
02:07:21,309 --> 02:07:24,226
Congratulations, bro! I'll be there
the night before! I'll call you!

2115
02:07:25,976 --> 02:07:26,976
I will come, dude!

2116
02:07:27,018 --> 02:07:28,809
We'll have a blast!

2117
02:07:30,726 --> 02:07:31,726
Okay!

2118
02:07:31,871 --> 02:07:34,538
-Two double large, please.
-Can't give you any more, sir.

2119
02:07:34,572 --> 02:07:36,113
Hey! Congratulations, buddy!

2120
02:07:36,351 --> 02:07:38,143
-Thank you.
-Okay. Check my Facebook live.

2121
02:07:38,226 --> 02:07:39,351
I'm doing something for you.

2122
02:07:39,393 --> 02:07:40,893
I'm doing something
special for you, okay?

2123
02:07:40,976 --> 02:07:42,684
-All the very best, Prateek.
-Cheers!

2124
02:07:43,476 --> 02:07:46,059
Hello Mumbai!

2125
02:07:46,351 --> 02:07:47,893
How are you, public?

2126
02:07:48,676 --> 02:07:49,676
Woah!

2127
02:07:50,018 --> 02:07:51,518
It's a lovely night, guys!

2128
02:07:51,809 --> 02:07:54,601
And I just got a message
from a very dear friend of mine.

2129
02:07:54,851 --> 02:07:56,184
His name is Arun.

2130
02:07:56,393 --> 02:07:58,518
In college I used to call
him <i>Mallu Aunty</i>.

2131
02:07:58,851 --> 02:08:00,226
And he's getting married!

2132
02:08:00,934 --> 02:08:02,809

Thank you so much for coming.

2155
02:10:43,559 --> 02:10:44,684
Come in.

2156
02:10:45,033 --> 02:10:47,824

-Darshana!

2157

-Why are you so late?
-Sorry! Sorry!

2158

-Yaay!
-That's awesome!

2160
02:10:54,101 --> 02:10:55,559
Hey Puneet, pass the guitar
to Arun, no?

2161
02:10:55,559 --> 02:10:57,559
-O' dear! Another acoustic song?
-Come on, Arun!

2162
02:10:57,559 --> 02:10:58,684
Arun, 3-4.

-What scale?
-That you play, man!

I'm shifting to the apartment
next door.

What's this?

2176
02:11:39,101 --> 02:11:40,643
The wedding night
is tomorrow, right?

2177
02:11:40,684 --> 02:11:42,393
This is a trial for the decorations.

2178
02:11:42,393 --> 02:11:43,851
It needn't flop
tomorrow, right?

Sorry, I got a little late.

2182

This is Nithya's wedding dress.

2183
02:11:50,476 --> 02:11:51,643
It was given for alteration.

02:11:51,643 --> 02:11:53,434
Hey! Why did you
bring it here now?

2185
02:11:53,476 --> 02:11:55,643
Why disturb them at midnight?
I'll give it in the morning.

2186
02:11:55,684 --> 02:11:57,101
-Okay.
-I'm so hungry!

2187
02:11:57,143 --> 02:11:58,143
-Have you eaten?
-No.

2188
02:11:58,184 --> 02:12:00,143

have a couple of drinks.

Darsh...

What happened, Darshana?

2201
02:14:04,143 --> 02:14:05,809
He is getting married, Antony!

2202
02:14:11,518 --> 02:14:13,851
When he was in other relationships,

2203

I never felt anything.
But...

2204
02:14:18,809 --> 02:14:20,434
Now he'll be gone!

2205
02:14:21,976 --> 02:14:23,768
He'll just go, forever!

2206
02:14:25,809 --> 02:14:27,559
I can't bear it, Antony!

2207
02:14:32,072 --> 02:14:35,572
Only those who wish him well
should be present at his wedding.

2208
02:14:35,784 --> 02:14:36,826
I'm leaving.

2209
02:14:36,851 --> 02:14:37,851
Hey! Wait!

2210
02:14:44,059 --> 02:14:46,226
He should never know
whatever I told you now.

02:15:06,476 --> 02:15:09,184
Where's the bar, bro?
I want to drink like a fish!

2214
02:15:09,226 --> 02:15:10,226
Shut up, you nincompoop!

2215
02:15:10,268 --> 02:15:11,268
Arun, bye!

2216
02:15:11,726 --> 02:15:13,143
Bye, Antony!

2217
02:15:13,226 --> 02:15:14,809
Hey! Where did Darshana go?

2218
02:15:16,893 --> 02:15:19,726
There was a death in her family.
She had to leave quickly.

2219
02:15:20,976 --> 02:15:22,226
Don't call her now.

2220
02:15:22,518 --> 02:15:24,101
I mean...
She is okay.

2221
02:15:24,976 --> 02:15:26,768
It's past 12 AM.
Don't you want to sleep?

2222
02:15:27,309 --> 02:15:30,268
Get some sleep, man! You might
not be able to sleep tomorrow.

2223
02:15:30,434 --> 02:15:31,851
Look at your silly smile!

2224

It's raining cats and dogs.

2225
02:15:52,601 --> 02:15:54,643
I had asked you to book
the indoor stadium.

2226
02:15:54,643 --> 02:15:55,726
Do you ever listen to me?

2227
02:15:55,726 --> 02:15:57,934
A cricket tournament is going on
at the indoor stadium!

2228
02:15:57,934 --> 02:16:00,018
How come it's raining
so much in April?

2229
02:16:00,184 --> 02:16:01,393
Are you asking me that?

2230
02:16:01,393 --> 02:16:03,434
Great! Who am I asking!
Sorry!

2231
02:16:03,434 --> 02:16:05,893
A low-pressure area must have
formed over the Bay of Bengal.

2232

You made me wear this
<i>Churidar</i> in the morning.

2233
02:16:07,768 --> 02:16:08,809
Uncle, it's not a <i>Churidar</i>.
It's a <i>Kurta</i>.

2234
02:16:08,851 --> 02:16:10,601
What's the difference
between your outfit and mine?

2235
02:16:10,643 --> 02:16:11,643
Even the stole is the same.

2236
02:16:11,726 --> 02:16:13,268
-Can you keep quiet, please?
-Arun...

2237
02:16:13,476 --> 02:16:15,226
Arun, the auspicious
time is about to pass.

2238
02:16:15,268 --> 02:16:16,643
What do we do now?

2239
02:16:16,684 --> 02:16:17,726
What do you think?

2240
02:16:17,726 --> 02:16:19,518
Shall we get married in the rain?

2241
02:16:19,518 --> 02:16:20,684
It will be unique.

2242
02:16:20,768 --> 02:16:22,226
The pictures will be awesome, right?

2243
02:16:22,684 --> 02:16:24,726
You convince your family.
Let me talk to mine.

2244
02:16:24,726 --> 02:16:25,684
Okay.

2245
02:16:25,684 --> 02:16:26,851
What did she say?

2246
02:16:26,851 --> 02:16:28,309
She said we needn't wait for
the auspicious time to be over...

2247
02:16:28,351 --> 02:16:30,018
-and that we'll get married in the rain.
-Awesome!

2248
02:16:30,018 --> 02:16:31,143
-Mommy..
-Yes.

2249
02:16:31,184 --> 02:16:33,809
Mommy, shall we get
married like this?

2250
02:16:33,851 --> 02:16:35,393
-Won't it be awesome?
-In this rain?

2251
02:16:35,393 --> 02:16:36,697
It will be fine, Uncle.
We needn't waste time.

2252
02:16:36,722 --> 02:16:37,839
What if someone catches a fever?

2253
02:16:37,864 --> 02:16:39,280
We can serve medicines
along with the feast.

2254
02:16:39,309 --> 02:16:41,059
Uncle, relax.
Come, let's have a couple of drinks.

2255
02:16:41,101 --> 02:16:42,434
Oh God! Please take him away!

2256
02:16:42,476 --> 02:16:44,184
I won't step out in the rain,
wearing this <i>Churidar</i>.

2257
02:16:44,226 --> 02:16:45,143
It's not a <i>Churidar</i>.
It's a <i>Kurta</i>!

2258
02:16:45,184 --> 02:16:46,726
Can you stop being
so ridiculous, Uncle?

2259
02:16:47,184 --> 02:16:48,976
Don't talk to me in English!
You know, right?

2260
02:16:49,018 --> 02:16:50,726
I won't accept this!

2261
02:16:50,726 --> 02:16:52,393
-It's only for a short while.
-No way.

2262
02:16:52,434 --> 02:16:54,643
-I wanted the indoor...
-Mommy, please.

2263
02:16:54,643 --> 02:16:56,976
There are too many people.
Everyone will catch a fever.

2264
02:16:56,976 --> 02:16:57,976
We'll see.
Please!

2266

02:17:01,309 --> 02:17:02,934
-Yeah!
-Okay. So be it!

2268
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:04,059

-Diya?
-Yes.

02:18:18,809 --> 02:18:19,809

02:18:40,018 --> 02:18:41,559
-Why?
-Just do what I said!

2294
02:18:48,393 --> 02:18:50,518
Now, you guys go

Come!

2298
02:19:03,268 --> 02:19:04,809
I've heard about <i>First night</i>.

2299
02:19:04,809 --> 02:19:06,684
This is the first time
I'm seeing <i>First day</i>.

2300
02:19:07,393 --> 02:19:08,518
Huh?

2301
02:19:08,976 --> 02:19:10,184
You are really funny!

2303
02:19:11,554 --> 02:19:13,311

02:19:15,934 --> 02:19:17,934
No.

-Dude, let's go.

She didn't agree, huh?

2314
02:19:38,226 --> 02:19:40,101
You idiot! Don't mess with me.
Come quickly!

2315
02:19:40,309 --> 02:19:41,393
I can't come so quickly.

2316
02:19:41,434 --> 02:19:42,684

Come quickly.

Now we're good friends.

2364
02:22:47,393 --> 02:22:49,059
Oh! So you're still
in touch with her?

2365
02:22:49,351 --> 02:22:50,393
Yeah!

2366
02:22:50,476 --> 02:22:51,518
Is that a problem?

2367
02:22:51,518 --> 02:22:52,518
What?

2368
02:22:52,559 --> 02:22:53,559
Of course not!

2369
02:22:55,309 --> 02:22:56,309
I trust you.

2370
02:22:58,601 --> 02:23:00,309
I sense something wrong!

2371
02:23:01,143 --> 02:23:03,434
I checked Darshana's Facebook
and Instagram accounts.

2372
02:23:03,726 --> 02:23:06,143
She has liked and commented
on every photo Arun has posted.

2373
02:23:06,184 --> 02:23:07,456
But she has not
liked or commented

2374
02:23:07,464 --> 02:23:08,910
on even a single photo
in which I'm with him.

2375
02:23:08,972 --> 02:23:10,431
She still has something for him!

2376
02:23:10,621 --> 02:23:12,121
Don't you have any other job?

2377
02:23:12,434 --> 02:23:14,393
Have you noticed
how he looks at you?

2378
02:23:15,351 --> 02:23:17,726
No scumbag has looked at me
like that, in my whole life.

2379
02:23:19,434 --> 02:23:21,393
-Just a minute.
-Oh! Take your time!

2380
02:23:21,684 --> 02:23:22,684
Okay.

2381
02:23:23,059 --> 02:23:24,059
Hey!

2382
02:23:25,518 --> 02:23:28,726
He is a solid guy!

2383
02:23:30,059 --> 02:23:32,559
But you should check his phone
and WhatsApp every now and then.

2384
02:23:32,684 --> 02:23:35,184
Though he's a solid guy,
don't give him a chance to cheat.

2385
02:23:35,226 --> 02:23:37,476
Uh oh! But checking his phone
is bad, right?

2386
02:23:37,518 --> 02:23:38,518
It's really bad...

2387
02:23:38,559 --> 02:23:40,226
if he finds out!
Do it without his knowledge.

2388
02:23:40,397 --> 02:23:41,355
Okay!

02:24:44,684 --> 02:24:45,851
Arun!

2396
02:24:56,434 --> 02:24:57,434
What happened, Arun?

2397
02:24:59,476 --> 02:25:00,518
What happened?

2398
02:25:04,309 --> 02:25:06,101
Around 10:30 PM,

2399
02:25:06,226 --> 02:25:07,726
Nithya started having labour pain.

2400
02:25:09,684 --> 02:25:10,726
At 11 PM,

2401
02:25:11,684 --> 02:25:12,976
we brought her to the hospital.

2402
02:25:14,559 --> 02:25:15,559
Since then,

2403
02:25:16,393 --> 02:25:17,684
I had been waiting here.

2404
02:25:20,726 --> 02:25:22,059
Around five minutes back,

2405
02:25:22,393 --> 02:25:23,934
the nurse came out
and asked for me.

2406
02:25:25,934 --> 02:25:26,934
Then...

2407
02:25:28,768 --> 02:25:31,934
she placed a tiny little
thing into my palms.

2408
02:25:34,726 --> 02:25:35,726
It's a boy!

2409
02:25:39,559 --> 02:25:40,726
I've become a father!

2410
02:25:44,268 --> 02:25:46,184
You're the first person
I felt like calling.

2411
02:25:49,059 --> 02:25:50,059
If I continue talking,

2412
02:25:50,934 --> 02:25:51,934
I might lose it.

2413
02:25:52,393 --> 02:25:53,393
I'm hanging up.

2414
02:26:17,101 --> 02:26:18,101
Darshana!

2415
02:26:18,809 --> 02:26:19,809
What happened?

2416
02:26:21,101 --> 02:26:22,476
Arun just had a baby!

2417
02:26:23,143 --> 02:26:24,684
Even your ex-boyfriend had a baby!

2418
02:26:25,351 --> 02:26:27,146
When are we going to talk
about marriage?

2419
02:26:27,309 --> 02:26:29,726
Woah!

2420
02:26:30,184 --> 02:26:31,393
Darshana, answer him!

2421
02:26:33,268 --> 02:26:35,143
Answer him, Darshana!
Come on!

2422
02:26:50,193 --> 02:26:51,484
Didn't you tell me that...

2423
02:26:53,145 --> 02:26:55,161
we'll call him by the name
that comes to your mind,

2424
02:26:55,186 --> 02:26:56,287
when you see him?

2425
02:26:59,278 --> 02:27:00,450
What do we call him?

2426
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:03,193
What if you don't like
the name I call him?

2427
02:27:04,068 --> 02:27:05,318
He's our baby!

2428
02:27:06,318 --> 02:27:07,818
Call him what you like!

2429
02:27:26,943 --> 02:27:27,943
Selva!

2430
02:27:30,193 --> 02:27:31,193
Selva!

2431
02:27:35,734 --> 02:27:36,734
Nice name.

2432
02:27:39,734 --> 02:27:40,734
Selva Arun.

2433
02:27:41,484 --> 02:27:42,484
No.

2434
02:27:45,734 --> 02:27:47,443
Selva Nithya Arun.

2435
02:27:49,193 --> 02:27:50,193
Thank you!

2436
02:28:11,568 --> 02:28:12,693
It's nothing, dear.

2437
02:28:12,734 --> 02:28:14,818
Why has the baby been
crying for so long?

2438
02:28:15,318 --> 02:28:16,318
Give him to me.

2439
02:28:16,359 --> 02:28:17,651
Let me see.

2440
02:28:17,693 --> 02:28:19,026
-Come.
-He's not crying now.

2441
02:28:23,484 --> 02:28:25,234
He started crying only now.

2442
02:28:25,568 --> 02:28:26,734
That's enough.

2443
02:28:26,818 --> 02:28:27,901
Give the baby to me.

2444
02:28:29,234 --> 02:28:30,484
Don't cry, dear.

2445
02:28:31,401 --> 02:28:33,109
You must not feed
formula milk to the baby.

2446
02:28:33,109 --> 02:28:34,651
You must only feed
him mother's milk.

2447
02:28:34,734 --> 02:28:37,193
Can we let the baby starve
until she produces milk?

2448
02:28:37,234 --> 02:28:38,943
Why should you make
the baby wear diapers?

2449
02:28:38,943 --> 02:28:40,109
Ask her to put him
on a rubber sheet.

2450
02:28:40,109 --> 02:28:41,401
If we put him on a rubber sheet,

2451
02:28:41,401 --> 02:28:43,568
how many times do we clean it?
Will she do it?

2452
02:28:43,734 --> 02:28:45,984
Are you feeding him
with a plastic bottle, dear?

2453
02:28:45,984 --> 02:28:47,359
This is really bad for him.

2454
02:28:47,401 --> 02:28:49,568
This is not ordinary plastic.
It's BPA free.

2455
02:28:49,609 --> 02:28:51,484
Plastic is plastic!

2456
02:28:51,568 --> 02:28:53,068
Why don't you take the baby
out in the sun in the morning?

2457
02:28:53,068 --> 02:28:54,193
He needs to get
Vitamin D, right?

2458
02:28:54,193 --> 02:28:56,318
You come and sleep with
the baby at night, then.

2459
02:28:56,359 --> 02:28:57,984
We aren't able to sleep
because the baby keeps crying.

2460
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:00,276
He has to get enough milk, right?
That's why he doesn't sleep.

2461
02:29:00,318 --> 02:29:02,401
My daughter is feeding him very well.

2462
02:29:02,401 --> 02:29:04,943
Babies cry! It's the same,
all around the world.

2463
02:29:04,984 --> 02:29:07,026
Can all of you please
leave this house?

2464
02:29:07,734 --> 02:29:08,734
I want to sleep!

2465
02:29:10,318 --> 02:29:12,401
It's been two days since I slept!

2466
02:29:13,109 --> 02:29:14,568
What a temper she has!

2467
02:29:14,609 --> 02:29:16,693
Couldn't you fall in love
with a docile girl?

2468
02:29:19,609 --> 02:29:21,193
If these three women
stay here together,

2469
02:29:21,318 --> 02:29:22,776
you will be done for!

2470
02:29:22,943 --> 02:29:23,943
That's for sure!

2471
02:29:25,026 --> 02:29:26,026
What should I do now?

2472
02:29:27,859 --> 02:29:29,234
I have taken leave
for three months.

2473
02:29:29,276 --> 02:29:30,693
I can take care
of my wife and son.

2474
02:29:30,718 --> 02:29:32,134
I don't need help from anyone!

2475
02:29:32,234 --> 02:29:33,443
If you don't want it,
we don't want it either.

2476
02:29:33,443 --> 02:29:35,068
You became a father
only now, right?

2477
02:29:35,109 --> 02:29:36,943
-Neelan, control yourself!
-No!

2478
02:29:36,984 --> 02:29:39,359
We won't stay here
even for a second longer.

2479
02:29:39,401 --> 02:29:41,318
Dhanya, go pack our bags!
Come on!

2480
02:29:42,984 --> 02:29:44,818
What are you waiting for?
Go and pack our bags!

2481
02:29:45,026 --> 02:29:46,318
Sorry.
Please pack our bags!

2482
02:29:48,668 --> 02:29:50,168
He'll get it from me.

2483
02:29:50,193 --> 02:29:51,276
What a performance!

2484
02:29:52,109 --> 02:29:53,359
You guys should have
been in the movies!

2485
02:29:53,401 --> 02:29:54,401
We should've, right?

2486
02:30:10,568 --> 02:30:12,008
<i>You should never
listen to the advice</i>

2487
02:30:12,039 --> 02:30:13,669
<i>from your father
and father-in-law...</i>

2488
02:30:13,693 --> 02:30:14,901
<i>about raising a baby.</i>

2489
02:30:14,926 --> 02:30:16,801
<i>I learned that lesson
on that very day.</i>

2490
02:30:18,859 --> 02:30:20,568
<i>Though they may create a ruckus,</i>

2491
02:30:20,568 --> 02:30:22,234
<i>with no women in the house,</i>

2492
02:30:22,276 --> 02:30:23,859
<i>we are doomed!</i>

2493
02:30:24,901 --> 02:30:27,068
Didn't I tell you not
to order it online?

2494
02:30:27,388 --> 02:30:29,346
-Why can't you buy it from a shop?
-I'll buy it right away.

2495
02:30:29,396 --> 02:30:30,479
Oh God!

2496
02:30:30,526 --> 02:30:31,943
You've been shopping
for so long!

2497
02:30:31,984 --> 02:30:33,484
Don't you want to come home?
Come quickly!

2498
02:30:33,484 --> 02:30:35,568
I just got into the lift.
I'm pressing the button.

2499
02:30:48,984 --> 02:30:50,568
Baby!!!

2500
02:30:52,693 --> 02:30:54,651
Please don't cry, baby!

2501
02:30:55,526 --> 02:30:57,901
My back is aching, Arun!

2502
02:30:58,026 --> 02:30:59,568
Shall I get you some
<i>Amrutanjan</i> balm?

2503
02:30:59,609 --> 02:31:01,276
Go give it to that ex
of yours, you idiot!

2504
02:31:01,734 --> 02:31:03,068
I'll bring Volini spray.

2505
02:31:03,109 --> 02:31:04,734
Oh God! I wonder
where the Volini is.

2506
02:31:04,734 --> 02:31:06,026
Oh! Baby!

2507
02:31:06,568 --> 02:31:07,651
Don't cry, dear.

2508
02:31:07,693 --> 02:31:09,401
Dude, the trailer of
<i>Baahubali 2</i> is out.

2509
02:31:09,443 --> 02:31:10,443
Did you watch it?

2510
02:31:10,443 --> 02:31:11,443
Me?

2511
02:31:12,026 --> 02:31:13,234
You're asking me?

2512
02:31:21,359 --> 02:31:23,151
-Hello?
-Were you asleep?

2513
02:31:24,068 --> 02:31:25,068
It's okay.
Tell me.

2514
02:31:25,734 --> 02:31:28,068
What's your opinion
about me getting married?

2515
02:31:29,443 --> 02:31:30,443
What?

2516
02:31:31,901 --> 02:31:33,568
What's your opinion...

2517
02:31:33,609 --> 02:31:37,109
about me getting married
and starting a family life?

2518
02:31:37,859 --> 02:31:39,443
Very good opinion!

2519
02:31:40,443 --> 02:31:42,568
Very, very good opinion!

2520
02:31:45,234 --> 02:31:47,193
Don't delay it any further.
Do it immediately!

2521
02:31:53,026 --> 02:31:54,484
I haven't seen you
in so many years.

2522
02:31:54,693 --> 02:31:55,776
Arun!

2523
02:31:55,818 --> 02:31:56,901
I recognized you only
when you told me.

2524
02:31:56,901 --> 02:31:58,359
We had met back in Kerala, right?

2525
02:31:58,359 --> 02:31:59,943
-How are your kids doing?
-They are fine.

2526
02:31:59,984 --> 02:32:02,026
Bro! Welcome back to Madras!

2527
02:32:02,068 --> 02:32:03,693
-Thank you! How's it going?
-Hey Nithya! How are you?

2528
02:32:04,818 --> 02:32:07,109
-Was it too much trouble for you?
-It's alright. How was his journey?

2529
02:32:07,276 --> 02:32:08,901
-It was okay.
-Woah! He's crying a lot, huh?

2530
02:32:08,901 --> 02:32:10,859
I'm fed up of these Malayali
students who come to Chennai.

2531
02:32:10,859 --> 02:32:13,318
They get in with a waiting
list ticket and ask for seats..

2532
02:32:13,359 --> 02:32:14,526
Do you know him?

2533
02:32:15,083 --> 02:32:16,458
I've seen him somewhere.

2534
02:32:24,609 --> 02:32:26,109
Where does Darshana stay?

2535
02:32:26,401 --> 02:32:28,619
Darshana bought an apartment
worth 1.5 Crores in Kottivakkam.

2536
02:32:28,674 --> 02:32:29,710
Her life is set!

2537
02:32:29,734 --> 02:32:31,026
How does she have so much money?

2538
02:32:31,068 --> 02:32:32,901
Dude, the reach for her videos
is unbelievable.

2539
02:32:32,943 --> 02:32:34,568
She has so many fans
and followers.

2540
02:32:34,568 --> 02:32:36,901
And she gets paid really well
for collaborations too.

2541
02:32:37,901 --> 02:32:40,484
Shucks!
I missed a millionaire, huh?

2542
02:32:42,693 --> 02:32:43,901
I love you, baby!

2543
02:32:44,109 --> 02:32:45,109
I love you, baby!

2544
02:32:45,318 --> 02:32:46,776
-Get lost.
-What is this, man?

2545
02:32:47,859 --> 02:32:48,859
It's nothing, dear.

2546
02:32:50,318 --> 02:32:51,859
-I don't have a place to stay.
-You can stay with me.

2547
02:32:51,901 --> 02:32:53,109
-Hey! That's Arun!
-Hey, yeah!

2548
02:32:55,443 --> 02:32:56,568
Hello!

2549
02:32:56,818 --> 02:32:58,609
Didn't you guys go to the hotel?

2550
02:32:58,651 --> 02:33:00,526
No. He wanted to drop by.

2551
02:33:00,595 --> 02:33:03,637
[indistinct chatter]

2552
02:33:03,901 --> 02:33:05,651
We'll take care of the child.

2553
02:33:06,484 --> 02:33:07,651
We'll bring him soon.

2554
02:33:07,901 --> 02:33:10,818
-Nithya, they will bring the child.
-You guys carry on.

2555
02:33:10,859 --> 02:33:12,109
He's so cute!

2556
02:33:12,151 --> 02:33:13,818
-Where's the apartment?
-Arun! Arun!

2557
02:33:17,734 --> 02:33:19,234
-Arun, our baby!
-He'll be fine. Come!

2558
02:33:19,276 --> 02:33:20,443
Arun! Hey!

2559
02:33:20,771 --> 02:33:22,271
You should have brought
it earlier, right?

2560
02:33:22,296 --> 02:33:24,463
Why do you have to keep
everything for the last minute?

2561
02:33:25,401 --> 02:33:27,568
You're in full form early
in the morning itself, huh?

2562
02:33:27,991 --> 02:33:29,325
-When did you reach?
-Just now.

2563
02:33:29,734 --> 02:33:31,526
I thought I'll see you
and head to the hotel.

2564
02:33:32,068 --> 02:33:33,276
Darshana, Hi!

2565
02:33:33,276 --> 02:33:34,859
It's so nice to finally meet you!

2566
02:33:34,901 --> 02:33:37,026
I keep watching all your videos.
I mean, I'm a huge fan!

2567
02:33:37,026 --> 02:33:39,620
That video you shot
in Rajasthan, was awesome!

2568
02:33:39,644 --> 02:33:40,419
Thank you.

2569
02:33:40,444 --> 02:33:42,194
And what you've managed
to do for yourself

2570
02:33:42,217 --> 02:33:44,918
in just 6-7 years is just amazing!

2571
02:33:44,943 --> 02:33:47,193
The video you shot
in Punjab was so good.

2572
02:33:47,234 --> 02:33:49,401
-Nithya, that's enough.
-Sorry, I'm going on and on.

2573
02:33:49,651 --> 02:33:51,276
-Must be just excited or something.
-Darshana!

2574
02:33:51,318 --> 02:33:52,318
-Did you see him?
-Aww!

2575
02:33:53,151 --> 02:33:54,609
Awww!

2576
02:33:56,068 --> 02:33:57,193
He's so cute!

2577
02:33:59,943 --> 02:34:01,984
He actually looks a bit
like Arun, no?

2578
02:34:09,318 --> 02:34:10,526
Hey! He's crying.

2579
02:34:10,568 --> 02:34:12,151
Megha, can you hold him please?

2580
02:34:12,193 --> 02:34:13,609
Just a minute.
I'll be right back.

2581
02:34:13,693 --> 02:34:14,984
-Hey baby!
-Aww!

2582
02:34:15,693 --> 02:34:17,234
Who is this?
Who is this?

2583
02:34:17,276 --> 02:34:18,484
Is this your Papa?

2584
02:34:30,943 --> 02:34:44,776
<i>♪ The face, as beautiful
As the full moon in the sky ♪</i>

2585
02:34:45,693 --> 02:34:59,943
<i>♪ The mind, as pure and constant
As the elixir ♪</i>

2586
02:35:03,109 --> 02:35:04,859
Did you have food from outside?

2587
02:35:05,026 --> 02:35:07,193
-We'll eat from the hotel.
-Why don't you eat here?

2588
02:35:07,234 --> 02:35:09,193
-There's <i>idli</i> and <i>sambar</i> here.
-Have you eaten?

2589
02:35:09,234 --> 02:35:12,026
You look so different in a saree.

2590
02:35:13,526 --> 02:35:16,443
If your food vlogging fans see this,

2591
02:35:16,484 --> 02:35:17,734
they will snatch you away!

2592
02:35:18,859 --> 02:35:20,651
Arun!
Did you have food?

2593
02:35:20,943 --> 02:35:21,943
-No.
-Come!

2594
02:35:21,984 --> 02:35:23,568
Come, come.
 Everybody, come!

2595
02:35:35,377 --> 02:35:36,835
Once the function is over...

2596
02:35:36,859 --> 02:35:38,984
Mom, don't serve him <i>idli</i>.
He likes <i>upma</i>.

2597
02:35:39,026 --> 02:35:40,359
Give him <i>upma</i>.

2598
02:35:41,484 --> 02:35:42,859
Do you like <i>upma</i>?

2599
02:35:43,443 --> 02:35:44,776
Yes, I love it.

2600
02:35:46,734 --> 02:35:48,359
But you never told me that.

2601
02:35:49,484 --> 02:35:51,651
Does anyone keep telling
everyone that they like <i>upma</i>?

2602
02:35:57,068 --> 02:35:58,276
How's the <i>upma</i>?

2603
02:35:58,443 --> 02:36:00,193
Yeah!
Terrific!

2604
02:36:10,859 --> 02:36:11,859
Darshana?

2605
02:36:12,068 --> 02:36:13,151
I need to talk to you.

2606
02:36:13,734 --> 02:36:14,943
Come to Palavakkam beach.

2607
02:36:15,151 --> 02:36:16,151
Darsh...

2608
02:36:40,318 --> 02:36:41,318
Arun!

2609
02:36:43,526 --> 02:36:44,651
Where are you going?

2610
02:36:48,359 --> 02:36:51,693
Err.. my friends are partying
in another hotel nearby.

2611
02:36:53,411 --> 02:36:54,577
I'll be back soon.

2612
02:37:29,609 --> 02:37:30,609
Darshana had called.

2613
02:37:32,568 --> 02:37:33,818
She said she wants to meet me.

2614
02:37:36,359 --> 02:37:37,359
Shall I go?

2615
02:37:42,734 --> 02:37:43,734
Go and come back soon.

2616
02:38:18,193 --> 02:38:19,443
Do you remember this place?

2617
02:38:31,359 --> 02:38:33,318
I've been thinking
for the past two days,

2618
02:38:33,734 --> 02:38:35,568
whether I should
get married or not.

2619
02:38:37,109 --> 02:38:39,734
Once I get married,
will I lose my freedom?

2620
02:38:41,643 --> 02:38:44,185
Will I be able to continue working
the way I am now?

2621
02:38:45,484 --> 02:38:48,193
Will I be able to take care
of my parents like I am now?

2622
02:38:48,584 --> 02:38:52,459
Will another person have control
over my financial matters?

2623
02:38:52,484 --> 02:38:54,818
So many things on my mind!

2624
02:38:55,960 --> 02:38:57,294
And then I was thinking...

2625
02:38:59,276 --> 02:39:01,193
Vishak is a great guy!

2626
02:39:02,361 --> 02:39:03,986
I fight a lot with him!

2627
02:39:05,859 --> 02:39:07,318
But he gets it!
He's...

2628
02:39:07,818 --> 02:39:09,234
He's so understanding.

2629
02:39:13,193 --> 02:39:16,318
I'm probably overthinking
these things, right?

2630
02:39:16,901 --> 02:39:17,901
Absolutely!

2631
02:39:24,818 --> 02:39:25,818
Arun,

2632
02:39:27,026 --> 02:39:29,693
if I had forgiven you
during our first year in college,

2633
02:39:30,576 --> 02:39:32,326
would we be together even now?

2634
02:39:35,693 --> 02:39:37,651
When you asked me this
at the station that day,

2635
02:39:38,151 --> 02:39:39,443
I didn't have an answer.

2636
02:39:39,818 --> 02:39:41,276
And do you have an answer now?

2637
02:39:46,359 --> 02:39:48,318
A few days after my son was born,

2638
02:39:49,234 --> 02:39:50,568
one morning,

2639
02:39:53,026 --> 02:39:54,484
I sat down for a while,

2640
02:39:54,509 --> 02:39:57,801
just looking at
the two people lying next to me.

2641
02:40:02,401 --> 02:40:04,193
There are some moments in life,

2642
02:40:04,193 --> 02:40:06,193
that make you realize
what you're living for.

2643
02:40:07,109 --> 02:40:08,401
It was a moment like that.

2644
02:40:10,401 --> 02:40:12,401
There will be a phase
like that in your life too.

2645
02:40:13,979 --> 02:40:15,109
What if it were like this...

2646
02:40:15,151 --> 02:40:16,318
What if it were like that...

2647
02:40:17,318 --> 02:40:18,984
You'll stop thinking
about all that.

2648
02:40:20,193 --> 02:40:21,318
You will understand,

2649
02:40:22,109 --> 02:40:23,151
"This is it!"

2650
02:40:23,401 --> 02:40:24,609
This is how it's going to be!

2651
02:40:26,443 --> 02:40:28,443
All this sounds great, but...

2652
02:40:30,068 --> 02:40:33,109
But I see so many marriages
just falling apart, it's...

2653
02:40:37,401 --> 02:40:39,440
What if these moments
you had in your life,

2654
02:40:39,519 --> 02:40:41,199
don't happen in mine?

2655
02:40:41,276 --> 02:40:42,818
If they don't,
you are doomed!

2656
02:40:45,734 --> 02:40:47,568
It's your wedding tomorrow!

2657
02:40:47,818 --> 02:40:49,026
Stop racking your brains,

2658
02:40:49,068 --> 02:40:51,109
go home and sleep peacefully.

2659
02:40:52,343 --> 02:40:54,177
It's not tomorrow.
It's today!

Shucks!

2674
02:42:10,568 --> 02:42:12,155
Arun, in that case...

2675
02:42:12,172 --> 02:42:14,280
Mithra has a shop
in Thoraippakkam, right?

2676
02:42:14,387 --> 02:42:15,803
Shall I go shop there?

2677
02:42:15,828 --> 02:42:17,537
Okay.
We have time anyway.

2681
02:42:25,109 --> 02:42:26,318
-Okay, sir.
-What happened?

2682
02:42:27,609 --> 02:42:28,859
Shall I visit my college?

2683
02:42:29,068 --> 02:42:30,070
We have time, right?

2684
02:42:30,102 --> 02:42:31,539
You finish your shopping

02:42:42,359 --> 02:42:43,359
Okay, sir.

2688
02:42:46,026 --> 02:42:47,359
So, I'll see you in a bit?

2689
02:42:47,484 --> 02:42:48,484
Okay.

2690
02:42:53,526 --> 02:42:54,526
Say bye!

2691
02:42:54,568 --> 02:42:55,568
Bye, Papa!

2692
02:43:58,109 --> 02:43:59,109
Arun?

2693
02:44:02,561 --> 02:44:03,603
I'm Jasleen.

2694
02:44:03,776 --> 02:44:04,776
Remember?

2695
02:44:05,109 --> 02:44:06,193
Your senior?

2696
02:44:08,208 --> 02:44:11,041
Darshana... jumping over the wall?

2697
02:44:11,609 --> 02:44:12,818
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2698
02:44:12,859 --> 02:44:14,109
Oh my God!
How come...

How come you're here?

2700
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:17,443
I helped many people
get out of this college.

2701
02:44:17,651 --> 02:44:18,859
I got stuck here!

2702
02:44:18,901 --> 02:44:19,943
I'm teaching.

2703
02:44:20,276 --> 02:44:21,276
Seriously?

2704
02:44:21,484 --> 02:44:22,484
Yeah!

2705
02:44:22,568 --> 02:44:23,568
Oh God!

2706
02:44:24,693 --> 02:44:25,734
"Oh God?"

2707
02:44:27,424 --> 02:44:28,549
So...

2708
02:44:29,734 --> 02:44:31,526
Who else...
I mean...

2709
02:44:31,663 --> 02:44:33,497
Who else is here
from our college days?

2710
02:44:33,568 --> 02:44:34,734
Who else...?

2711
02:44:34,943 --> 02:44:36,359
There are mainly four factors.

2712
02:44:36,484 --> 02:44:37,651
Effect of temperature,

2713
02:44:37,693 --> 02:44:39,026
effect of grain size,

2714
02:44:39,193 --> 02:44:41,026
effect of heat and...

2715
02:44:46,234 --> 02:44:47,776
Oh! You've got a beard now?

2716
02:44:48,026 --> 02:44:49,276
Like you've got gray hair.

2717
02:44:49,818 --> 02:44:51,526
I coloured it gray,
to get that look!

2718
02:44:51,984 --> 02:44:52,984
Yeah, right!

2719
02:44:54,276 --> 02:44:55,651
I came for Darshana's wedding.

2720
02:44:55,818 --> 02:44:57,526
-I'm on my way back.
-Missed it!

2721
02:44:57,693 --> 02:44:58,859
Special class!

2722
02:45:01,818 --> 02:45:04,484
Ma'am.... could you give me
the key to the secret alley?

2723
02:45:05,193 --> 02:45:06,234
Arun, you know right?

2724
02:45:06,234 --> 02:45:08,693
We give it only on
the final day of the final year.

2725
02:45:08,734 --> 02:45:09,818
It's the Principal's rule.

2726
02:45:09,818 --> 02:45:11,401
I'm in no position to change it.

2727
02:45:12,484 --> 02:45:13,484
Sorry!

2728
02:45:13,818 --> 02:45:14,818
It's okay.

2729
02:45:24,318 --> 02:45:25,318
Vijayetta!

2730
02:45:25,609 --> 02:45:26,609
All well?

2731
02:45:26,859 --> 02:45:28,568
You can call me Varikkappara.

2732
02:45:28,984 --> 02:45:30,109
I heard that you've come.

2733
02:45:30,359 --> 02:45:32,693
I'm working as the Vice-Principal's
staff now.

2734
02:45:33,901 --> 02:45:36,401
There was a friend of yours
who thrashed me back then, right?

2735
02:45:36,484 --> 02:45:37,484
What was his name?

2736
02:45:38,276 --> 02:45:39,901
-Anto!
-Yes.

2737
02:45:40,234 --> 02:45:41,526
Where is he now?

2738
02:45:41,526 --> 02:45:42,818
He's in America now.

2739
02:45:43,026 --> 02:45:44,234
Convey my regards to him.

2740
02:45:44,568 --> 02:45:45,568
Sure!

2741
02:45:45,984 --> 02:45:48,109
Keerthy Ma'am asked me
to give you something.

2742
02:45:50,484 --> 02:45:51,609
Return it quickly, okay?

2743
02:45:54,943 --> 02:45:56,234
Thank you, Vijayetta.
