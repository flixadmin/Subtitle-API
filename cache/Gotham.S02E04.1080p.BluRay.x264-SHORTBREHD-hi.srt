00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,525
Call me Penguin.

174
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,653
I thought I heard you hated that name.

175
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,571
It grew on me.

176
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,199
Penguin it is. Please, sit.

177
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,494
- How's your head?
- Oh, healing, thank you. (CHUCKLES)

178
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,329
Gave me quite a scare.

179
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,373
You were lucky to get out of there
with your life.

180
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,792
Wasn't I just?

Do you two know each other?

185
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,845
We've met.

00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,101
Oh, my.

00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,145
The Arkham breakout,

188
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,358
the G.C.P.D. massacre,
Jerome and the Maniax.

189

<i>- Of course.</i>
- Guilty. (CHUCKLES)

191
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,034

I could trick the King of Gotham.

BARBARA: Here.

193
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,371
You need this more than me.

194
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,373
I'll make another.

195
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:28,713
My sister tells me you're doing a
stellar job of organizing your new empire.

- I try.
- (TABITHA SCOFFS)

197
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,342
You're not the King of Gotham,

00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,177
you're the King of Garbage.

199
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,055
A year ago, I held Fish Mooney's umbrella.

200
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,099
<i>Now she's dead by my hand.</i>

201
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,184
Along with Maroni.

202
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,188
Falcone is in hiding
and all of their businesses are mine.

203
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:51,193
They all underestimated me.
I suggest you not make the same mistake.

204
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,238
THEO: My sister is too blunt.

205
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,032
But she is honest.

206
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:00,745
The foundations of this great city
were laid 200 years ago

207
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,873
by some very dedicated people.

208
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:09,253
Now, it's an old, crumbling pigsty,
full of human waste.

209
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,881
<i>It's time to move into the future.</i>

210
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,259
A cleaner, brighter

00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,679
future.

212
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,564
COBBLEPOT: Uh...

213
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,650
Those are all residential areas.

214
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,863
So, thousands of homes would
have to be destroyed, wouldn't they?

215
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:37,573
TABITHA: Yeah, so?

216
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,577
THEO: <i>Here's the rub.</i>

217
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,871
In order to rebuild,
I need first to destroy.

218
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,289
But I can't do that.

219
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,166
I mean, watch the news, I'm a hero.

220
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:51,253
But you have a certain flair
for such a task.

221
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,464
You, Penguin.

222
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,301
You will be my destroyer.

223
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:58,969
(CHUCKLES)

224
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,889
Truly, I'm flattered.

225
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,141
<i>Thank you so much for thinking of me.</i>

226
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,437
<i>But, my dear sir, you have me all wrong.</i>

227
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:13,317
I have no flair for destruction.
I'm a builder, a problem solver.

228
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:18,239
Besides, such a huge project would need
the support of hundreds of city officials.

229
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:21,409
Yes. Only the highest authority
could see it through correctly.

230
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,787
Say, a mayor with a landslide mandate.

231
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,665
But you're not a candidate.

232
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:29,041
Oh, I will be.

233
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,752
(INHALES DEEPLY) By popular demand.

234
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,464
Alas, some of my fellow candidates
actually stand a chance of winning,

235
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,676
so, they'll have to go.

236

240
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,896
to do with my fellow candidates' demise.

241
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,865
That's smart thinking.

242
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,576
However, with all due respect,
Mr. Galavan,

243
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,327
I'm not your man.

244
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:07,997
You need an assassin.

245
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,708
This is Gotham,

she cries and bangs on the door.

He's dead to you.

Out of your life. Not "dead" dead.

I'm gonna use the restroom.

You blew it, dummy. Nice work.

Leave me alone!

No.

649
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,355
Honestly, Kristen,
I wasn't talking to you.

Who else is there?

651
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,652
I talk to myself.

652
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,655
It's crazy, I know, just...
I have this, uh...

653
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,533
I have this voice inside my head,

654
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:07,495
a sort of stronger version of me,
that keeps this me in line,

655
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:08,913
because I'm such a klutz.

656
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,044
I can understand that.

657
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:20,049
I think that we all have
a voice like that.

658
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:23,052
You think?

659
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,929
What was your inner voice saying?

660
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,431
He was mad at me for spoiling the mood.

661
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:29,141
- Mmm-hmm.
- (CHUCKLES)

662
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,811
It was... It was a really nice mood.

663
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:38,150
But my inner voice is telling me that

664
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:41,237
I think maybe we can get back there.

Was that you, too?

- Not now.
- And Hobbs?

Walk away, Jim. Let me be.

676
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,524
The G.C.P.D. has new leadership.

<i>With no warrant, no cuffs,
no backup, and why?</i>

for your new captain to find out

about how you gunned down
Ogden Barker in cold blood.

I suppose you did not ask me

691
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:46,695
to run Commissioner Loeb out of town
so that you could get your old job back?
