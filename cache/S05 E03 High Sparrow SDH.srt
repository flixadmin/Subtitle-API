1
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,243
(Water dripping)

2
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,545
(Voices whispering)

3
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,840
Valar morghulis.

4
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,134
Valar dohaeris.

5
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,507
I've been sweeping this floor for days.

6
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,633
Good.

7
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,593
I didn't come here to sweep floors.

8
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,013
No? Why come, then?

9
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,516
You said I could be your apprentice.

10
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,645
You said you'd teach me
how to be a faceless man.

11
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,689
A man teaches a girl.

12
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,862
Valar dohaeris. All men must serve.

13
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,030
Faceless men most of all.

14
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,993
I want to serve.

15
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,081
A girl wants to serve herself.

16
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,292
Here we serve the many-faced god.

17
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,835
To serve well,

18
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,463
a girl must become no one.

19
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,131
Which one's the many-faced god?

20
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,511
I see the stranger. I see the drowned god.
I see the weinnood face.

21
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,014
There is only one god.

22
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,223
A girl knows his name.

23
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,977
And all men know his gift.

24
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,600
Where are they taking him?

25
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,573
- (Bells tolling)
- (People shouting)

26
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,622
- Queen margaery!
- Queen margaery!

27
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,546
Man: Queen margaery!

28
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,716
Queen margaery!

29
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,260
Queen margaery!

30
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,643
- Margaery: I am his and he is mine.
- Tommen: I am hers and she is mine.

31
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,105
Both: From this day
until the end of my days.

32
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,765
(Breathing heavily)

33
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,859
Did I hurt you?

34
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,320
No. You were lovely.

35
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,656
- It all happened so fast.
- Yes. (Chuckles)

36
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,991
I was scared maybe I hurt you.

37
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,077
- It sounded like...
- No, no, no.

38
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,621
You're very sweet.

39
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,999
The sweetest king who ever lived.

40
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,921
This is all I want to do all day,
every day, for the rest of my life.

41
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,673
(Laughs) Wouldn't that be glorious?

42
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,885
Shouldn't we rest a little while?

43
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,763
Just to catch our breath?
There's no rush, is there?

44
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,972
Of course not.

45
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,558
Are you hungry?

46
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,061
Should I have them bring you
some cake or pomegranate juice?

47
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,063
No, I'm fine.

48
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,982
I just want you all to myself.

49
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:26,821
I want to know everything there is to know
about king tommen, first of his name.

50
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,657
King tommen.

51
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,618
Still sounds strange to me.

52
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,746
Does queen margaery sound strange to you?

53
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,582
So strange.

54
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,584
- Husband.
- Wife.

55
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,794
(Laughs)

56
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,965
Sometimes it feels odd.

57
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,633
I'm the king,

58
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,011
I've married the most
beautiful woman in the world,

59
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,534
and it's all because my brother died.

60
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,017
I understand.

61
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,354
But it's not your fault.
You know that, don't you?

62
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,189
You mustn't feel guilty.

63
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,234
I don't feel guilty.

64
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,569
That's what's odd.

65
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,199
Do you like to sail?

66
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,201
I love to sail.

67
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,537
I do, too.

68
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,540
I think we're going to be very happy,
you and I.

69
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,625
I do, too.

70
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,465
Living in a tower
so high it touches the clouds.

71
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,512
Of course, my grandmother
couldn't wait to go home.

72
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,181
The capital's not for everyone, I suppose.

73
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,394
Does your mother like it here?

74
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,022
I don't think so.

75
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,441
She told me
never to trust anyone in king's landing.

76
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,904
It's so wonderful
to have her watching over you.

77
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,115
A lioness guarding her cub.

78
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,659
Well, but I'm a man now.

79
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,205
You are.

80
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,292
And the king.

81
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,672
But you'll always be her baby boy.

82
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,215
Isuppose.

83
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,970
I adore her. She's always been
so generous with me, so kind.

84
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,098
And the horrors she's had to endure...

85
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,977
Losing her husband,
her eldest child, and her father.

86
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,646
It's no wonder she's so protective of you.

87
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,441
She'll never let you out of her sight.

88
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,905
Cersei: You look very much in love.

89
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,282
The first days of marriage
are often so blissful.

90
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,119
She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?

91
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,164
Like a doll. She smiles quite a lot.

92
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,085
Do you think she's intelligent?

93
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,545
I can't quite tell.

94
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,756
Not that it matters.

95
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,382
Do you ever miss casterly rock?

96
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,593
There's nothing for me in casterly rock.

97
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,887
That's where you grew up.

98
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,170
You always told me
that you liked the people there better.

99
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,937
You said that king's landing
smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

100
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,146
(Chuckles)

101
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,109
Why are we speaking of casterly rock?

102
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,028
The way that you talked about it,

103
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,405
I always thought that you missed it.

104
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,116
That you...

105
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,259
That it was your real home.

106
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,411
This is my real home now,
where my family lives.

107
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,873
I want you to be happy, mother.

108
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,543
I know that.

109
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,630
I know you do. My sweet boy.

110
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,799
But wouldn't you be happier
in casterly rock?

111
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,930
Margaery: I said,
"darling, surely four times is enough.

112
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,950
- "Are you trying to set a new record?"
- (Women giggling)

113
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,561
He said, "well, what is the record?
I'm sure we can break it."

114
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,568
Mother.

115
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,486
Welcome.

116
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,365
Don't you look lovely?
Marriage agrees with you.

117
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,160
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?

118
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,037
I wish we had some wine for you.
It's a bit early in the day for us.

119
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,001
No, no, I can't stay.

120
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:13,673
I just wanted to let you know if
there's ever anything I can do for you...

121
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,675
You are very sweet.

122
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,760
Tommen seems quite taken
with his new queen.

123
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,430
I absolutely adore him.

124
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,058
You raised a gallant young man.
I'm forever grateful.

125
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,476
Good.

126
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,230
Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.

127
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,774
Ecstatic. I really am.

128
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,610
- Exhausted, to be honest.
- (Women giggle)

129
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,947
But what could I expect?
He is half lion, half stag.

130
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,365
(Women laugh)

131
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,534
I'll leave you to it, then.

132
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,578
Oh, forgive me.

133
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,164
I haven't been at court for long.
I get so confused.

134
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,416
What's the proper way to address you now?

135
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,835
Queen mother or dowager queen?

136
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,380
There's no need for such formalities.

137
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,967
In any event,
judging from the king's enthusiasm,

138
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,094
the queen mother will be
a queen grandmother soon.

139
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,763
Won't that be a lovely day?

140
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,892
Can you imagine the celebrations?
They'll ring the bells all day and night.

141
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,644
Remember,

142
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,022
anything you need.

143
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,242
(Women giggling)

144
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,870
(Laughter echoing)

145
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,455
(Horse neighs)

146
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,420
(Men shouting)

147
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,014
(Animals squawking)

148
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,713
(Flies buzzing)

149
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,680
(Caws)

150
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,308
Bolton: We can't hold the north
with terror alone.

151
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,995
Ramsay: You can't hold the north
if you let these lesser lords insult us.

152
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,646
Bolton: I sent you there to collect taxes,
not bodies.

153
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,607
Ramsay: Lord cennyn refused to pay.

154
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,027
Said the warden of the north
would always be a stark,

155
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,696
and he'd be damned
if he'd kiss a traitor's boot.

156
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,492
Bolton: He left you no choice.

157
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:50,455
I flayed him living,
along with his wife and brother.

158
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,498
Made his son watch.

159
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,043
And?

160
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,420
The new lord cen/vyn paid his taxes.

161
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,429
I've something important to tell you.

162
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,765
Stop eating and listen.

163
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:23,363
We don't have enough men to hold the north
if the other houses rise up against us.

164
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,739
Do you understand that?

165
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,422
Our pact with the lannisters protects...

166
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,451
I had a pact with tywin Lannister.

167
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,870
And tywin Lannister is dead.

168
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,956
The remaining lannisters are a
thousand miles away dealing with that fact.

169
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,834
They've never once,
in the history of the seven kingdoms,

170
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,836
sent their army this far north.

171
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,005
If you think they will
for us, you're a fool.

172
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,386
We've become a great house by
entering into alliances with other houses,

173
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,764
and parlaying those alliances
into greater power.

174
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:54,894
The best way to forge a lasting alliance
isn't by peeling a man's skin off.

175
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,437
The best way is marriage.

176
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,234
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,

177
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,028
it's high time you
married a suitable bride.

178
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,158
And as it happens,

179
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,495
I've found the perfect girl
to solidify our hold on the north.

180
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,102
Sansa: That's moat cailin.

181
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,647
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

182
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,941
You've been here before?

183
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,028
On our way down to king's landing
with my father and Arya.

184
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,030
Where are you taking me?

185
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,657
Home.

186
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,244
The boltons have winterfell.

187
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,292
Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.

188
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:07,300
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family.

189
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,926
He did.

190
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,887
He serves the lannisters.

191
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,305
For now.

192
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,682
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

193
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,226
- Not anymore.
- Always.

194
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,313
You're a stark.
Dying your hair doesn't change that.

195
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:25,234
You're sansa stark, eldest surviving child
of ned and catelyn stark.

196
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,652
Your place is in the north.

197
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:30,865
I can't marry him. You can't make me.
He is a traitor. A murderer!

198
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,909
You're not marrying roose Bolton.

199
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,454
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir, ramsay.

200
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,419
One day he'll be warden of the north
and you...

201
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,707
- No.
- Sansa.

202
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,504
No, you can't make me. I will starve myself.
I will die before I have to go there.

203
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,882
I won't force you to do anything.

204
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,551
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

205
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,971
Say the word and we turn the horses around,
but listen to me.

206
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,640
Listen.

207
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,808
You've been running all your life.

208
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,854
Terrible things happen to your family
and you weep.

209
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,024
You sit alone in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

210
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,529
You've been a bystander to tragedy
from the day they executed your father.

211
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,156
Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?

212
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,449
Stop running.

213
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,957
There's no justice in the world.

214
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,251
Not unless we make it.

215
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,712
You loved your family.

216
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,466
Avenge them.

217
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,425
(Horse neighs)

218
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,884
Man: Banners!

219
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,778
Podrick: How do we get through there?

220
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:33,988
Brienne: We don't.

221
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,948
We go around.

222
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,534
Takes us miles out of the way.

223
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,827
We'll lose sight of them.

224
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,955
Brienne: Doesn't matter.
I know where they're going.

225
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,295
Aren't you getting a
bit old to be a squire?

226
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,551
How did you end up squiring for the imp?

227
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,428
He hates that nickname.

228
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,889
Well, he's not here to complain about it,
is he?

229
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:08,230
I squired for a knight named ser lorimer
during the war of the five kings.

230
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,484
One night, he had a bit too much to drink,

231
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,153
and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

232
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,321
He borrowed it?

233
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,697
He wasn't a thief.

234
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,033
He was drunk, and hungry,
and he wasn't thinking.

235
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,369
I was drunk, too.

236
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,495
He gave me half the ham.

237
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,626
Next morning,
one of the guards saw him passed out

238
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,671
under a wagon
with the hambone still in his hand.

239
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,715
They hanged him that afternoon.

240
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,330
They tied the noose for me, too,

241
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,388
but lord tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

242
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,764
so he pardoned me,

243
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,308
and sent me to king's landing
to squire for his son.

244
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,728
As punishment for both of you.

245
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,689
It didn't seem that way.

246
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,524
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

247
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,901
Yes, all your lords have
been very kind to you.

248
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,695
All except me.

249
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,114
Sorry, you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

250
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,317
I'm not sorry.
You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

251
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,827
You beat the hound.

252
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,996
I'm proud to be your squire.

253
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,295
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

254
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,673
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

255
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,712
You want to be a knight, pod?

256
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,723
Yes.

257
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,559
Starting tomorrow,
we'll train with the sword twice a day,

258
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,362
before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp in the evening.

259
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,082
And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.

260
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,107
Thank you.

261
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,609
I can't knight you,
but I can teach you how to fight.

262
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,528
I suppose that's more important.

263
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,209
You weren't a knight,

264
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,045
but you were a kingsguard
to renly Baratheon, weren't you?

265
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,590
I was.

266
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,009
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

267
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,512
He was.

268
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,807
How did you end up serving renly?

269
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,192
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

270
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,945
I'm his only living child,
so he wanted to make a good match for me.

271
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,615
He invited dozens of young lords to tarth.

272
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,493
I didn't want to go,
but he dragged me to the ballroom.

273
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,623
And it was wonderful.

274
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,587
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

275
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,632
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

276
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,009
when they thought it
was their turn to dance.

277
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,429
They whispered in my ear

278
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,141
how they wanted to marry me
and take me back to their castles.

279
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,522
My father smiled at
me, and I smiled at him.

280
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,275
I had never been so happy.

281
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,864
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

282
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,391
And then they all started to laugh.

283
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,496
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

284
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,248
They were toying with me.

285
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:17,294
"Brienne the beauty," they called me.
Greatjoke.

286
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,508
And I realized I was
the ugliest girl alive.

287
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,428
A great lumbering beast.

288
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,770
I tried to run away,
but renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

289
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,440
"Don't let them see
your tears," he told me.

290
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,359
"They're nasty little shits,

291
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,320
"and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

292
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,177
He danced with me, and none of
the other boys could say a word.

293
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,120
Renly was the king's brother after all.

294
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,416
But wasn't he...

295
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,253
Lord Tyrion said he was...

296
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,132
Yes, pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot.

297
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,885
He didn't love me. He didn't want me.

298
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,680
He danced with me because he was kind,
and didn't want to see me hurt.

299
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,642
He saved me from being a joke.

300
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,271
From that day until his last day.

301
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,234
And I couldn't save him in return.

302
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,408
Nothing's more hateful
than failing to protect the one you love.

303
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,662
One day I will avenge king renly.

304
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,582
But you said a shadow murdered him.

305
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,709
How do you fight a shadow?

306
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,295
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

307
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,634
I know it was Stannis.
I know it in my heart.

308
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,847
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

309
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,518
And a man can be killed.

310
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,440
- Lord commander.
- Your grace.

311
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,359
I'd like to speak alone.

312
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,694
Olly is my steward now,

313
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,030
as I was lord commander mormont's.

314
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,534
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

315
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,705
One day he might command.

316
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,377
Very well.

317
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,587
Have you considered my offer?

318
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,298
I have.

319
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,425
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

320
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,971
All my life I wanted to be Jon stark.

321
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,597
Say the word and you will be.

322
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,309
But I have to refuse you.

323
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,397
I'm lord commander of the night's watch.

324
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,107
My place is here.

325
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,068
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

326
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,697
to take back the castle where you grew up.

327
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,826
To rule the north.

328
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,245
I wish I could fight beside you.

329
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,205
Believe me, I do.

330
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,417
But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood.

331
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,586
I pledged my life to the night's watch.

332
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,588
You're as stubborn as your father.

333
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,590
And as honorable.

334
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,843
I can imagine no higher praise.

335
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,094
I didn't mean it as praise.

336
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,555
Honor got your father killed.

337
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,492
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

338
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,853
May I ask how long you plan
to stay at castle black?

339
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,479
Are you bored of us already?

340
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,443
You saved us from mance rayder's army.
We will never forget that.

341
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,695
But it's a question of survival.

342
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,406
The night's watch can't continue
to feed your men

343
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,200
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

344
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,369
Winter is coming.

345
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,622
I know it.

346
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,918
We march on winterfell within the
fortnight, before the snows trap us here.

347
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,379
And the wildlings?

348
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,631
If they'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it.

349
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,966
I leave their fate to you.

350
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,054
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

351
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,101
Or you could see if this tormund fellow

352
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,854
is more willing to compromise
than mance ever was.

353
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,274
I assume the brothers of the night's watch
would rather see the wildlings dead.

354
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,234
Most of the brothers, yes.

355
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,946
There's little love for the free folk here.

356
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,658
You're the lord commander. Your decision.

357
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:17,826
(Door opens)

358
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,745
You have many enemies in castle black.

359
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,831
Have you considered
sending alliser Thorne elsewhere?

360
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,794
Give him command of eastwatch-by-the-sea.

361
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,254
I heard it was best
to keep your enemies close.

362
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,632
Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

363
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,308
Davos: He sees something in you.

364
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,855
Might not be apparent from his tone,
but it's the truth.

365
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,190
He believes in you.

366
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,442
I'm sorry I disappointed him.

367
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,698
The king is a complicated man,

368
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,285
but he wants to do what's right
for the seven kingdoms.

369
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,703
As long as he's ruling them.

370
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,539
He's the one true king.

371
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,166
He has a blood right to that throne.

372
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,920
I've sworn to stay clear of the politics
of the seven kingdoms.

373
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,255
Have you now?

374
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,885
How does the night's watch vow go again?

375
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,930
I'll bet you've got it memorized
since you got here.

376
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,643
Night gathers and now my watch begins.

377
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,646
No, not that bit. The bit at the end.

378
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,816
I am the sword in the darkness,

379
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,651
the watcher on the walls,

380
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,570
the shield that guards the realms of men.

381
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,663
- I pledge my life...
- Right, that's enough.

382
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,116
The shield that guards the realms of men.

383
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,279
That's what you swore to be.

384
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,328
Now, I'm not a learned man,

385
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,722
but the best way to help the most people

386
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,916
might not be sitting in a frozen castle
at the edge of the world.

387
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,920
It just might mean wading in the muck,
getting your boots dirty,

388
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,964
and doing what needs to be done.

389
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,340
And what needs to be done?

390
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:59,261
As long as the boltons rule the north,
the north will suffer.

391
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,264
Just one man's opinion.

392
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,315
(Door closes)

393
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,700
(Door opens)

394
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,961
What do you want?

395
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,923
Who are you?

396
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,257
What?

397
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,719
You, who walk in here
with a coin you never earned,

398
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,804
whose value you do not respect.

399
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,353
Who are you?

400
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,981
No one.

401
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,859
- Cunt!
- A lie.

402
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,153
A sad little lie. Who are you?

403
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,321
I told you, I'm...

404
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,281
Do that again, and...

405
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,909
Who are you?

406
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,078
You're about to find out.

407
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,206
What are you doing?

408
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,959
We were only playing. The game of faces.

409
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,169
- A girl is not ready.
- Clearly not.

410
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,629
I am ready.

411
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:18,715
For what?

412
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,384
For whatever you want.

413
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,178
To be a faceless man. To be no one.

414
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,227
Jaqen: Whose sword is that?

415
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,770
It belongs to Arya stark.

416
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,941
Arya stark's sword, clothes, stolen silver.

417
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,235
A man wonders,

418
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:43,532
how is it that no one came to be
surrounded by Arya stark's things?

419
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,605
(Sighs)

420
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,022
(Door closes)

421
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,737
What do we do with them after we wash them?

422
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,852
Man 1: Open gate!

423
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,150
Man 2: Honor guard, stand to!

424
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,994
Man 3: Hold up. Easy.

425
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,638
Lady sansa. Welcome.

426
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,771
Lord Bolton.

427
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:12,110
May I introduce my son, ramsay Bolton?

428
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,366
It's an honor to meet you, my lady.

429
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,469
I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.
You must want to wash.

430
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,929
Thank you.

431
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,518
Welcome home, lady stark.

432
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,230
The north remembers.

433
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,570
(Men chatting)

434
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,952
Sam?

435
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,414
Maester aemon?

436
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,583
He apologizes for not being here.

437
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,919
He's not feeling well.

438
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,212
Take good care of him.

439
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,757
- Brothers.
- (Chatter stops)

440
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,720
As you all know too well, it's long
past time to dig a new latrine pit.

441
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,055
(Men laughing)

442
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,936
First builder yannyck and I
have decided to appoint a latrine captain

443
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,854
to oversee this crucial task.

444
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,272
(Men laugh)

445
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,072
Brian.

446
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,616
Seems like a good job for a ginger.

447
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,123
- That's him!
- That's him.

448
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,749
Ser alliser.

449
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,632
You have more experience
than any other ranger at castle black.

450
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,093
You proved your valor many times over

451
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,262
while defending the wall
from the wildling attack.

452
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,434
I name you first ranger.

453
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,644
Men: Hear, hear!

454
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,771
(Pounding on tables)

455
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,777
Lord janos.
I'm giving you command of greyguard.

456
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,697
Greyguard is a ruin.

457
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,784
Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.
Restore it as best you can.

458
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,661
First builder yannyck
can spare 10 of his...

459
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,431
Janos: I was charged
with the defense of king's landing

460
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,415
when you were soiling
your swaddling clothes.

461
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,666
Keep your ruin.

462
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:33,960
(Men shouting)

463
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,923
- All right! That's enough of that.
- (Shouting stops)

464
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,675
You mistake me, my lord.

465
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,554
That was a command, not an offer.

466
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,850
Pack your arms and armor,
say your farewells,

467
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,394
and ride for greyguard.

468
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,566
I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.

469
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,694
Give it to one of the fools
who cast a stone for you.

470
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:04,115
I will not have it. Did you hear me, boy?
I will not have it!

471
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,701
Are you refusing to obey my order?

472
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,710
You can stick your
order up your bastard ass.

473
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,378
(Men murmuring)

474
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,385
Take lord janos outside.

475
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,473
Olly, bring me my sword.

476
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,319
- Get out.
- You cannot do this!

477
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:56,626
Get your hands off me! Scum, all of you!

478
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,591
If the boy thinks he can frighten me,
he's mistaken.

479
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,926
Yes, very mistaken.

480
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,681
Disgrace!

481
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,141
I have friends.
Important friends in the capital.

482
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,685
- You'll see.
- Kneel!

483
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,892
If you have any last words, my lord,
now's the time.

484
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,399
I was wrong. You're the lord commander.
We all serve you. I'm sorry.

485
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,694
Not only for this, for
all I've done and said.

486
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,739
I was wrong.

487
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,075
My lord, please! Mercy! Mercy!

488
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,786
I'll go! I will! (Sobbing)

489
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,496
Please.

490
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,457
I'm afraid.

491
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,167
(Whimpering)

492
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,586
I've always been afraid.

493
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,527
(Women giggling)

494
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:08,424
You have served us well, my son.

495
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:09,884
Thank you, father.

496
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,012
Which of the seven will you worship today?

497
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,138
The maiden.

498
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,890
Always the maiden.

499
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,143
Septon: And the stranger.

500
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,438
- Two is extra, you realize?
- Yes, yes.

501
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,690
(Snaps fingers)

502
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,033
(Gasps)

503
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,159
What are you doing?

504
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,870
This establishment belongs
to lord petyr baelish. You can't...

505
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:38,997
(Groans)

506
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,999
You have profaned our faith,

507
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,127
the faith of our fathers and forefathers.

508
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,295
I am the high septon of the...

509
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,506
- You are a sinner.
- (Groans)

510
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,425
And you shall be punished.

511
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,021
- (Cracks)
- Ah!

512
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,272
(Woman laughs)

513
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,275
- Sinner.
- Sparrows: Sinner.

514
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,027
- Sinner. Sinner.
- Man 1: Repent!

515
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,319
Sinner.

516
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,363
- Sinner.
- (Groans)

517
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,782
Sinner. Sinner.

518
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,076
- Man 2: Shame on you.
- Sparrows: Sinner.

519
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,294
(Doors close)

520
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,632
Your grace, grand maester, lord Tyrell...

521
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,053
It doesn't matter.

522
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,222
As the high septon of
the faith of the seven,

523
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:43,227
I give voice to the will of the gods and
am their foremost servant in this world.

524
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,272
An insult to me is an insult to the gods.

525
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,526
An assault on my person
is an assault on our very religion.

526
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,153
- You were assaulted?
- I was.

527
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,697
By those fanatics
who call themselves sparrows.

528
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,908
They humiliated me, they beat me,

529
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,994
they left me naked and bleeding
on the cobblestones.

530
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,621
I am lucky to be alive.

531
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,665
I heard this assault
began in littlefinger's brothel.

532
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,628
This is a rather shocking thing to hear.

533
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,422
Septon: I tend to both the highest born
and the lowliest amongst us.

534
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,758
Even prostitutes
may earn the mercy of the mother.

535
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,595
So, you were ministering
to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

536
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,723
A man's private affairs
ought to stay private.

537
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,185
What do you want from us, high septon?

538
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,812
Jusfice.

539
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,164
I ask that you protect our faith

540
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:31,025
by arresting these criminals
and throwing them in the black cells.

541
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,904
I ask that you execute their leader,
this so-called high sparrow.

542
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,282
He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.
If he goes unpunished...

543
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,951
And where do I find this man?

544
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,787
This high sparrow?

545
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,965
I don't think this is a good idea.

546
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,176
Nonsense, ser meryn.
These are deeply religious people.

547
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,554
Where can I find the high sparrow?

548
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,432
Man 1: Seven blessings.

549
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,226
- (People coughing)
- (Flies buzzing)

550
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,230
(Baby crying)

551
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,406
- Man 2: Thank you.
- Man 3: Just a little more.

552
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,657
(Baby continues crying)

553
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,075
Woman 1: Thank you.

554
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,871
Man 4: Thank you.

555
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,416
A young man said I'd find
the high sparrow back here.

556
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,460
- Where is he?
- High sparrow?

557
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,962
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

558
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:36,757
Like lord duckling or king turtle.

559
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,593
Still, it's meant to.

560
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,679
We're often stuck with the names
our enemies give to us.

561
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:45,183
The notion that we're all equal
in the eyes of the seven

562
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,603
doesn't sit well with
some, so they belittle me.

563
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,955
Woman 2: Seven blessings to you.

564
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,106
Seven blessings to you, my dear.

565
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:56,527
It's only a name.
Quite an easy burden to bear.

566
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,529
Far easier than hers.

567
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,658
Cersei: Why no shoes?

568
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:06,120
Because I gave them away
to someone who needed them more.

569
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,206
We all do that.

570
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,918
It stops us from forgetting
what we really are.

571
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,712
Is that why you came to king's landing?

572
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,255
To remind everyone?

573
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:19,592
Everyone? Hard enough job
reminding myself.

574
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:24,055
Well, I tell them no one's special, and
they think I'm special for telling them so.

575
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:26,807
Perhaps they're right.

576
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,145
It would be comforting to believe that,
wouldn't it?

577
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,690
Have the gods sent you here to tempt me?

578
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,526
I hope not.

579
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:42,615
I had assumed
you'd only come here to arrest me

580
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,533
for that incident with the high septon.

581
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,870
An unacceptable way
to treat the chosen representative

582
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,581
of the gods in this
world, wouldn't you say?

583
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,042
Hypocrisy is a boil.

584
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,629
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

585
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,131
Although they could have been
more careful with the blade.

586
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:03,594
The high septon came to speak to me today.

587
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,598
He doesn't want me to arrest you.
He wants me to execute you.

588
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,729
I wouldn't presume
to know your thoughts on the matter.

589
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,735
My thoughts on the matter
are in line with your own.

590
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:24,240
The high septon's behavior was corrosive,
as was his attitude.

591
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:28,369
Having a man like that reside in the sept
eats away at the faith from the inside.

592
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,790
So now he resides
in the red keep dungeons instead.

593
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,962
The faith and the crown are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

594
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,131
One collapses, so does the other.

595
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:45,761
We must do everything necessary
to protect one another.

596
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,600
(Squeaking)

597
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,111
- ( Flesh squelches)
- ( Rat squeals)

598
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,656
Your grace.

599
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,367
Send a raven with this message
to littlefinger at the eyrie,

600
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,619
or wherever he's slithering about.

601
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,207
At once, your grace.

602
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,668
How's your work coming along?

603
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,211
Very well.

604
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,880
You've made progress?

605
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,506
More than I expected.

606
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,259
- Still a way to go, but...
- Very good.

607
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,927
I'll leave you to it, then.

608
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:31,265
Make sure littlefinger is clear
on the meaning of the word "immediately."

609
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,614
(Bottles rattle)

610
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:48,908
Shh.

611
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,620
Easy, friend.

612
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,040
(People shouting)

613
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,978
Ramsay: She really is lovely.

614
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,815
I hope I can make her happy.

615
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,900
I hope so, too.

616
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:26,904
I've become quite fond of lady sansa
during our travels together.

617
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,240
She's suffered enough.

618
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,827
I'll never hurt her. You have my word.

619
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,039
I've heard very little about you,

620
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,043
which makes you quite a rare thing
as lords go.

621
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,755
I haven't been a lord very long.

622
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,340
I was a bastard.

623
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,050
And you're not anymore.

624
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,720
Allow me a moment alone with lord baelish.

625
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,055
Yes, father.

626
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,807
And thank you, lord baelish.

627
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,226
I'm forever in your debt.

628
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,109
He seems pleased.

629
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,193
Shouldn't he be?

630
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,530
I assure you, she's still a virgin.

631
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,701
Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By
the law of the land, she is no man's wife.

632
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,037
Inspect her, if you must.

633
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,833
I'll leave that to the brothel keeper.
It's her name I need, not her virtue.

634
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,252
Then I have delivered
everything I promised.

635
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,006
And you're prepared for the consequences

636
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,633
when the lannisters hear
I've wed sansa stark to ramsay?

637
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,344
The Lannister name
doesn't mean what it once did.

638
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,929
Tywin is dead.

639
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:36,891
He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

640
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,269
Without him,
Jaime has one hand and no allies.

641
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:45,107
Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.

642
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,567
The queen will be enraged.

643
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,611
Queen margaery adores sansa.

644
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,739
Cersei is queen mother,

645
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,492
a title whose importance
wanes with each passing day.

646
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,327
And yet she still has friends,

647
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,955
men in important places
whom she can ask for favors.

648
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,042
A message for you from Cersei Lannister.

649
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,171
A rider arrived from the eyrie
shortly before dawn.

650
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,134
Apparently she thinks
you're still in the vale.

651
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,842
A message for me, you say?

652
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,761
Strange that the seal is broken.

653
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,597
I'm sure you understand my position,
lord baelish.

654
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,882
If you receive word in the night
from the queen mother,

655
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,269
it does make me question our new alliance.

656
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,773
The lannisters made you
one of the great lords of Westeros,

657
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,068
yet here you are in the north
undermining them.

658
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,153
Why gamble with your position?

659
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,990
Every ambitious move is a gamble.

660
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,619
You gambled when you drove a dagger
into robb stark's heart.

661
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,082
It appears that your gamble paid off.

662
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,875
You're warden of the north.

663
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,961
I had tywin Lannister's backing.

664
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,171
Who supports me now? You?

665
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,757
The eyrie is mine.

666
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:56,720
The last time the lords of the eyrie formed
an alliance with the lords of the north,

667
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:00,015
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

668
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,312
I'd like to borrow one of your birds.

669
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,606
Cersei will expect a reply.

670
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,025
I'd like to read the reply.

671
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,717
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

672
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,176
Volantis is a large city.

673
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,429
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

674
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:42,516
The likelihood of you being spotted here
increases a hundredfold.

675
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,280
Mmm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

676
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,995
(Sighs) I'm not sure how many new ways
I can find of saying this.

677
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:56,322
I will not be of any use to
Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind.

678
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,700
I can't remember the last face I saw
that wasn't yours.

679
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,493
It's a perfectly good face.

680
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,245
I am losing my mind.

681
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,581
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll lose more than that.

682
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:09,001
Look, we are thousands of miles
from Westeros.

683
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,504
What am I?

684
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,674
One more drunk dwarf.

685
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,092
(Knocks)

686
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,844
- Driver: Whoa!
- (Horses neigh)

687
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,432
(Seagull screeching)

688
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:44,953
(People shouting)

689
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,580
Woman: We have to go now.

690
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,832
Come on, hold it. Hold it.

691
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,042
Are you ready?

692
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,587
Slaves.

693
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,591
Yes, the volantene masters
are very organized.

694
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,094
Flies for dung shovelers.

695
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,930
Hammers for builders.

696
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,058
Tears for whores.

697
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,935
Lest they forget.

698
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,270
(Woman speaking valyrian)

699
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:17,695
(Speaking valyrian)
Lord cast your light upon us.

700
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:18,821
(Crowd repeating)

701
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,782
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

702
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,076
We should keep moving.

703
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,204
(Crowd repeating)

704
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,293
I was once as you are how.

705
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,921
Bought and sold,

706
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,340
scourged and branded,

707
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,803
the only red priest we had in
king's landing was thoros of myr.

708
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,947
This one's much better-looking.

709
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,014
The lord of light hears your voice.

710
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:49,893
He hears the king as he hears the slave;

711
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,271
he hears the stone men in their misery.

712
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:54,189
Stone men.

713
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,735
Good luck stopping
the spread of greyscale with prayer.

714
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,903
You'd have better luck
dancing away the plague.

715
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,572
He has sent you a savior!

716
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:06,160
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world!

717
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:09,913
The dragon queen!

718
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:13,625
We're going to meet the savior.
You should have told me.

719
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:16,170
Who doesn't want to meet the savior?

720
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,394
Come on.

721
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,856
Let's find a brothel.

722
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,487
- (People shouting)
- (Animals calling)

723
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,698
Man: Build your house in a day.

724
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,379
(Speaking valyrian)
It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.

725
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,883
It's even better luck
to suck a dwarf's cock.

726
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,848
See? We blend right in.

727
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:13,227
Just two more travelers mad with lust.

728
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,691
Varys: Thank you.

729
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:20,901
(Sniffing)

730
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,369
What curious hair.

731
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,413
The mother of dragons!

732
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,916
(Men laugh)

733
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,212
It appears you're not
the only Targaryen supporter.

734
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,006
We were just heading east to see you.

735
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,800
I've got a dragon for you.

736
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,094
How much to make him spit fire?

737
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:55,018
Someone who inspires priests and whores
is worth taking seriously.

738
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,562
What makes you worth that much?

739
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,106
- I'm magic.
- I'll bet you bloody are.

740
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,607
(Laughing)

741
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,611
Well, she's taken.

742
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,406
Where are you going?

743
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,908
I need to speak to someone with hair.

744
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,745
- Hello.
- Hello.

745
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,205
You've got no drink.

746
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,040
You've got no money.

747
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,209
Do I look like a man without money?

748
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,629
Never trust looks.

749
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,507
Until quite recently,
I was one of the richest men in the world.

750
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:26,758
(Laughs)

751
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,804
But who needs wealth
when you can make a woman laugh?

752
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,975
I always pay my debts.

753
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,810
I'm well known for it.

754
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,312
(Laughter)

755
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,150
You like her.

756
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,069
They all like her.

757
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,353
They all want to fuck a queen.

758
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,257
That's because they've never met a queen.

759
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,574
You're just saying that.

760
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,326
You know how to spot a liar.

761
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,704
If I could pick any girl here,

762
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,247
I would pick you.

763
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,586
Because you have a skeptical mind.

764
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:10,594
All right, then. I'm warning you,
we're going to have to wash you first.

765
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,346
Come on.

766
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,315
I'm sorry, I can't.

767
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,152
Of course you can. You're shy.

768
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,738
I'm not.

769
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,449
Have another drink.

770
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,327
Gladly, but this, I can't do.

771
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,330
Believe me, no one is
more shocked than I am.

772
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,374
I hope it passes.

773
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,543
What will I do in my spare time?

774
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,257
Go for a piss. That's a start.

775
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:57,849
(Urinating)

776
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,898
(Mug splashes)

777
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,070
No need to worry. I was just...

778
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,615
I thought you were someone else.

779
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:15,993
Show's almost over.

780
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:20,330
I'm sure there are girls inside
who'd be happy to oblige.

781
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,433
You've made some kind of mistake.

782
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,252
Why don't you tell me
what you think you're doing, and then...

783
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,089
I'm taking you to the queen.
