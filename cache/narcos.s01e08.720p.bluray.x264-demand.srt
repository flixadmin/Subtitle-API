1
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:24,957
There's no respect.
I couldn't even grab the cigarettes.

2
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:29,962
I'm gonna shoot every fucking hostage
in the head. That's right.

3
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,171
Who's doing this?

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,049
Carrillo and Search Bloc,
I'm sure of it.

5
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,803
- In the middle of our negotiations?
- Either Gaviria is trying to catch me...

6
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:46,604
or Carrillo doesn't give a shit
about the negotiations.

7
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:51,066
You know what we have to do, Pablo.
We have to close the deal fast...

8
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,319
before they find us and kill us.

9
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,741
Not before we build our own jail.

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,454
And that fucking pussy president
will have to agree to that,

11
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:07,333
even if I have to stick a bomb up his ass.

12
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:11,419
It's so fucking cold.
Is there a jacket there for me?

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,840
- Check it out, fag.
- What's up?

14
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:19,552
It's a miniskirt with your name on it.

15
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:21,848
- "Gustavo Gaviria."
- Give me that.

16
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:27,812
All right, let's call the boys.

17
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,902
And what about you?
Are you all right?

18
00:01:35,987 --> 00:01:37,863
If Gaviria'd let us put US boots
on the ground,

19
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,157
we would've caught the son of a bitch
in five minutes.

20
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:43,284
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Escobar is a lot smarter than he looks.

21
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:45,453
- Oh, shit.
- Hold on, hold on!

22
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,331
We picked up a signal in the woods
surrounding the target area.

23
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:50,375
OK, boys, we're in the clear.

24
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,211
Pick us up at El Mariano pass.

25
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:56,923
- We got new Escobar coordinates.
- Smarter than he looks, huh?

26
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:58,633
Yeah, don't count your chickens just yet.

27
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:02,762
We have a tracking signal
on the phone presumed to be Escobar's,

28
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:04,890
five clicks from the finca.

29
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,851
Request Colombian units to be sent ASAP.

30
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:09,394
Search Bloc,

31
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:13,106
we are registering the latitude
and longitude at a fixed point.

32
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,693
The subject appears
to have stopped moving.

33
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:20,113
You've gotta be shitting me.

34
00:03:57,711 --> 00:04:00,756
I know.

35
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:09,556
He got away.

36
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:12,768
Again.

37
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,354
- Shh.
- You hear what I said?

38
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:19,650
Come on.

39
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:24,696
Yeah, I'm a little preoccupied, Steve.

40
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,033
I think she's got colic.

41
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:29,242
What is that?

42
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:32,496
Well, it means she can't sleep,
which means neither can I.

43
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:36,833
Did you call the orphanages?

44
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:40,379
You think I could explain the situation
in English, let alone Spanish?

45
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:43,548
I still don't understand
why you brought her back here.

46
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,176
Well, let's take her to a hospital.

47
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:49,428
No, Steve, we can't just take her to
a hospital. It's not like a puppy shelter.

48
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:52,766
Look, I know you're busy, but we've gotta
figure out what we're gonna do with her.

49
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,392
There's a war going on, Connie.

50
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:56,811
You said it was only
gonna be for a couple of days.

51
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:59,857
It's already been a week.
What are we doing here?

52
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:04,694
- Is that my t-shirt?
- We're out of diapers.

53
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:08,115
Why don't you go get some more before
she shits through your whole closet?

54
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:24,006
How nice to see
that you have made friends.

55
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:28,093
Careful, son.
This woman is very clever.

56
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,137
She can grab your gun
and shoot you in the head.

57
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:32,681
My apologies, boss.

58
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,737
How do you feel?

59
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:51,409
As well as one might expect.

60
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:55,204
I need you to record another tape for me.

61
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,374
No.

62
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:02,002
No, not until you free more hostages.

63
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:07,257
Maruja is very ill.
Ricardo has an ulcer.

64
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:10,135
I'm the only one you need to negotiate.

65
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,680
Then why does the Colombian government
keep trying to capture me?

66
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,184
Look...

67
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,938
I admire your bravery very much.

68
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:27,902
But Gaviria is a piece of shit, and,
with all due respect, so is your father.

69
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:29,780
And what did you expect?

70
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:32,866
To get into Congress
like it was nothing?

71
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:37,121
Without it mattering that you,
in fact, traffic drugs?

72
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,041
I expected respect.

73
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:46,713
You had respect
when you built homes for the poor.

74
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:52,677
But when you didn't get that respect
from a herd of egocentric bureaucrats,

75
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,430
you threw a tantrum.

76
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:02,313
I was going to do marvelous things
for this country.

77
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:09,361
If I have made myself into a monster,
like all of you say,

78
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,198
that is the fault of people
like your father...

79
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,076
and those politicians "of always."

80
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,496
Those oligarchs and those people

81
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:23,582
were never going to tolerate
that little paisa from Medellín

82
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:29,423
who had more money
and was more intelligent than all of them.

83
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,385
Yes.

84
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,096
You would have done marvelous things.

85
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:39,475
And that is the saddest part.

86
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:46,231
Mr. Escobar has promised
to free two more hostages.

87
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:51,610
But in exchange, he has asked that you
continue negotiations with transparency.

88
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:56,491
President Gaviria...
he knows what you are doing.

89
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:58,910
He knows.

90
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:03,249
If you insist on trying to capture him
with the help of the Americans...

91
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,503
they're going to kill us all.

92
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:15,134
You are risking my daughter's life!

93
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:18,679
No, Nydia, with all due respect,
we are not risking anyone's life.

94
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,476
Our priority is the life of your daughter
and the lives of the rest of the hostages.

95
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:26,188
But our priority
is also to capture Escobar.

96
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:28,940
You cannot have both things at once.

97
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,027
Negotiate with Escobar
while trying to capture him?

98
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:34,738
Do you know what he is demanding?

99
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:41,078
That we call a constitutional referendum
to abolish extradition.

100
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:46,541
That he only plead guilty
to having trafficked drugs one time.

101
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:50,169
And worst of all,
he wants to build his own jail

102
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,631
and have his own guards
to watch over him.

103
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:56,009
This is a deal with the devil.

104
00:08:56,218 --> 00:09:00,556
You are the president of a country
that became a living hell some time ago.

105
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:03,976
With whom else did you expect
to be making a deal?

106
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:09,147
Gaviria could easier
cut a hundred deals with the devil

107
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,483
before he could cut one with Pablo.

108
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,194
Bowing to Pablo's demands
was political suicide.

109
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:19,115
So, he did what politicians do best:
he stalled.

110
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:22,743
He kept our planes in the air
and prayed to God that we got a hit.

111
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:24,371
Hello. It's Gorilla.

112
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,707
Ground units,
begin trilateration for signal origin.

113
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,630
And when we did, it was
not the hit that we were hoping for.

114
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,758
Forgive me, Gorilla, I don't feel well.

115
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,846
Miss Diana...

116
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:44,683
why are you so unpleasant with the boss?

117
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,480
You are loyal like a sheep,
aren't you?

118
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:57,529
That man is your kidnapper... and mine,
and that of the whole nation.

119
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,114
Here, you go first.

120
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:34,358
Hide in here, quickly!

121
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,467
Who would've thought a failed raid
would result in Escobar's biggest victory?

122
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:05,389
Pablo didn't even have
to pull the trigger. We did it for him.

123
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,934
Guys, we have a problem.

124
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,566
For the battle-fatigued
citizens of Colombia,

125
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,402
Diana's death was the final straw.

126
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,862
This wasn't just an oligarch dying.

127
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:26,326
Her presence on the nation's TV screens
and in their homes transcended class.

128
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:29,537
The people were devastated.

129
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:33,416
For President Gaviria,
there was little room left to move.

130
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,755
Mr. President!

131
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:40,424
You killed my daughter.

132
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,926
Let her pass.

133
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,637
Wait...

134
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,933
If you had accepted his terms,
my daughter would still be alive!

135
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,438
Give him whatever he wants.

136
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:59,191
Don't let others go through the suffering
we've had to endure.

137
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:01,737
Mr. President... we need to leave.

138
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:10,454
God be with you, Nydia.

139
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,140
There's something
I want to make very clear.

140
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:36,188
You are not to blame for Diana's death.
OK? That has to be clear.

141
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:40,817
Escobar has the resources
for this to go on forever.

142
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:42,568
Yes, and so do we.

143
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:44,278
We are the state.

144
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,199
We are going to fight, do whatever we have
to do, and we are going to finish him.

145
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,867
We have options.

146
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:54,831
For instance, why don't we allow
the American military to come in?

147
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:58,751
I know... We don't like it.
I personally don't like it.

148
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:01,629
But if it's a specific, clear mission...

149
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,921
- No.
- Something covert.

150
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,049
No!

151
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:10,848
It's time to end all of this.

152
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,563
Give Escobar what he wants.

153
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:22,317
Let's go.

154
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:38,243
If your Congress
abolishes extradition, we lose our teeth.

155
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,044
- We're a paper fucking tiger!
- Everything we have done is lost.

156
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,838
We have no choice.

157
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:46,923
The people, the public... it's tired
of all these bombs and bloodshed!

158
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:48,551
Right, and business goes as usual,

159
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,887
- he just runs it from that jail.
- Exactly!

160
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:54,516
All things considered,
it's a victory to put Escobar in jail.

161
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:57,310
For public relations?

162
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,145
It's capitulation.

163
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,481
You want Escobar.

164
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:04,234
Why?

165
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:07,236
Why?

166
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:12,324
Because you want to parade him
in your DEA jackets?

167
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:14,327
You think this is a game, right?

168
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:17,830
This is Colombia,
and our people want peace!

169
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,999
This is not a fucking game!

170
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:31,427
Well...
at this time, our friend, Fernando,

171
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:34,180
is going to tell us a little something.

172
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:40,519
The Colombian government is going
to allow Pablo to turn himself in,

173
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,567
accepting only one simple charge:
drug trafficking.

174
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:48,778
And...

175
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,155
they are going to let him build a jail

176
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:57,202
which the police
cannot be within three kilometers of.

177
00:14:57,203 --> 00:15:00,706
At last...
we have liberated ourselves from tyranny!

178
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:04,043
- Long live Colombia, motherfuckers.
- ¡Viva!

179
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,713
- Fernando...
- Mm?

180
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:10,967
- Thank you very much.
- No problem, Pablo.

181
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:15,805
And do you know when Congress
is going to vote to abolish extradition?

182
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:20,893
Mm! Yes, it's...
It's a matter of... of weeks.

183
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:24,772
And at that time, you will be able
to turn yourself over to the authorities.

184
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:28,359
It pleases me very much to finish my work
with you with such a great victory.

185
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,531
No, brother. Now is when I am
going to need your services the most.

186
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:39,287
- How... How's that?
- Fernando...

187
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:46,962
now it's time for us to find legal means
to reduce my sentence even more.

188
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,550
Right?

189
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:16,741
And what does this mean for us, huh?

190
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:22,831
It means, my love...
that now I have a jail.

191
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:29,922
And for you,
visiting days will be...

192
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:33,716
every day.

193
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:36,302
- I'm serious, Pablo.
- So am I.

194
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:41,473
The problem, Pablo, is that...

195
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:44,977
now that you have admitted
to trafficking in narcotics,

196
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:48,523
my image as a journalist
cannot be associated with yours.

197
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,070
Hm.

198
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,740
So then...

199
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:06,124
now you think I am going to damage your
credibility as a journalist... is that it?

200
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,461
You understand what I'm saying.

201
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,423
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do.

202
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:21,138
I think that... it's time for me

203
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:27,104
to set you free, so that...
you can find a boyfriend who's honest...

204
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:33,525
so that you can get a little house,
have little kids,

205
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:35,945
- little dogs...
- Don't joke around, Pablo.

206
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,906
No, I'm not joking.

207
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,786
I just want you to know...

208
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,289
that you, Valeria...

209
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:50,836
are a bandit, just like me.

210
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:58,135
So don't come to me with bullshit.

211
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,987
Looks like you got away with it,
eh, asshole?

212
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:27,789
Shit, I'd thought you'd gone crazy.

213
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:40,300
Geniuses...
are always branded as crazy.

214
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:43,138
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

215
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,229
- The Ochoas...
- The Ochoas what?

216
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,315
You can bet
they're going to be pissed off.

217
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:57,194
Because of the treaty?

218
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,239
Or because you're fucking their sister?

219
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:16,755
That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo.

220
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:25,972
Let's hope they don't
charge you for it later.

221
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:28,390
The race was on.

222
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:32,103
Pablo needed to build his jail
as fast as possible.

223
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,398
As for his enemies, they needed
to get to him before that happened.

224
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:40,069
As soon as he walked inside,
Pablo would be safe.

225
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,697
And everyone on the outside wouldn't.

226
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:47,034
We got an official cease
and desist order for any further operation

227
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:49,287
when Pablo officially surrenders.

228
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:52,749
- Search Bloc is gonna be disbanded.
- We heard the terms.

229
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,294
- No cops within two miles of the prison.
- This is a fucking sham.

230
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:58,671
It's a death warrant for my men.

231
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,008
I won't be able to protect them.

232
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:05,678
I won't let that happen.

233
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:12,269
There are cops that hate Escobar
just as much as I do.

234
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:14,813
More.

235
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:19,151
They're not gonna stop
just because they're told to.

236
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:22,528
You talking about vigilantes?

237
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:27,616
Call it what you like... but I'm still
gonna need those intel reports.

238
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:30,535
- We'll get you anything we find.
- Javi, you gotta cool it with that shit.

239
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:33,206
They know we've been helping.
One more and we're out.

240
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:35,083
I thought you said you were all in.

241
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:38,544
The soccer field will be over here.

242
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:44,842
Here, I want to have
a little doll house for Manuela,

243
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:50,347
and downstairs,
a bar with a Jacuzzi for the guys.

244
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:52,892
My family will live in a house
down the hill.

245
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:57,147
I'm going to install a telescope
so I can look at them whenever I want.

246
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,274
Yeah, right. More like
you can look at other girls' asses.

247
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:05,155
No. The family, the family.
To see my kids.

248
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:10,534
- What can we do to help you, Pablo?
- Well...

249
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,745
while we're in prison,
Gustavo and me,

250
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:19,585
I will count on you, Moncada, and you,
Galeano, to oversee operations.

251
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,005
Thank you, Pablo.

252
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:28,260
We're privileged to be given
that responsibility. You can count on us.

253
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:32,056
We've already spoken about the operational
plan and everything's clear, right?

254
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,184
Yes. We won't let you down, Pablo.

255
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:36,519
Did you tell them about the tax?

256
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,064
- No, I didn't.
- The tax?

257
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,025
What tax is this?

258
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,529
Who paid for the war we fought?

259
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,114
You.

260
00:21:50,158 --> 00:21:53,245
- You, Don Pablo.
- That's right.

261
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:57,248
We have peace now.

262
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,919
You're going to directly
benefit from that.

263
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,383
It's only fair that you contribute
to the legal and security costs

264
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:10,136
that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.

265
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:13,931
And about how much will that be?

266
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:18,561
We agreed to what,
$200,000 a month, right?

267
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,896
Yes, 200 grand.

268
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:23,232
200 grand?

269
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:27,236
That's a lot of money, brother.
A lot of money.

270
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:29,196
But consider it done.

271
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:33,492
And again... thank you
very much for this responsibility,

272
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:36,079
- and for considering us.
- All right, then.

273
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:39,916
Don Pablo. All right. Gustavo.

274
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,676
Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?

275
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:55,639
Why should I let them
reap the fruits of our labor

276
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,475
without compensating us for it, Gustavo?

277
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:02,230
I agree with you.

278
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:07,652
But right now, we really
need those two fags to be loyal.

279
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,905
And what?
You don't think I inspire loyalty?

280
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:14,450
My loyalty?
Yes, you know you have it.

281
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:16,577
But I'm not sure about everyone else's.

282
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:21,373
You know, the thing is, Pablo...
you won.

283
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:23,750
There's no arguing that.

284
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:25,669
But you gave in.

285
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,340
And there are people
who will see that as weakness.

286
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:34,262
We've gotta keep our enemies close,
now more than ever.

287
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,226
Thank you.

288
00:23:42,103 --> 00:23:45,231
It's great to see you again, Valeria.

289
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:49,985
Likewise, Pacho.
I'm very happy to see you.

290
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:54,366
Although, I must say...
it was a little unexpected.

291
00:23:55,574 --> 00:23:57,994
We are worried about you.

292
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:02,165
And... why are "we" worried?

293
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,667
Pablo's cutting a deal
with the government.

294
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:07,628
He's going to have
to admit to certain things.

295
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:12,091
Things that may damage
your reputation by association.

296
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:19,849
If I'm good at anything,
it's protecting my reputation.

297
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,019
Listen, this time it's different.

298
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:29,484
Look... you helped create
that "Robin Hood Paisa" bullshit.

299
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:34,238
And when it all goes to shit, you'll have
to take responsibility for that.

300
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,116
Maybe he tricked me, too.
Like the rest of the world.

301
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,368
You have enemies, see?

302
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,246
They're not gonna
let you get away with it.

303
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:44,540
Look, Valeria...

304
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:50,129
we have a lot of connections in New York,
a strong presence, you could say.

305
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:53,507
You should go there,
at least for a little while.

306
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:54,884
And leave Colombia.

307
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,220
There are a million Colombians there.

308
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:01,056
A new audience.

309
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:04,102
And they don't care if you shared your bed
with a monster or not.

310
00:25:07,813 --> 00:25:10,399
Just for a while.

311
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,600
When this is all over, you'll be able to
come back here with your head held high,

312
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:15,654
I guarantee it.

313
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:21,660
And not only that, you'll have earned
a brand-new audience in the United States.

314
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:27,624
- Betrayal is not my style.
- What betrayal?

315
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,462
And what would you be betraying?

316
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,756
Your role as his mistress?

317
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:41,012
You remain loyal to a man who has never
thought you good enough to be his wife.

318
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:43,765
His wife? Me?

319
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:46,518
No, no, no,
you're very much mistaken, my dear.

320
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,480
The last thing I want
is to be married to him.

321
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:52,775
Besides...
do you think I'd want to be his wife?

322
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:59,364
Do you think I want to be locked up,
waiting all day at the Monaco building,

323
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:01,159
while he's out with...

324
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,829
with me?

325
00:26:06,623 --> 00:26:07,957
No.

326
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,085
That's too boring.

327
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:22,096
I missed you so much.

328
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:24,932
I missed you, too.

329
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:36,986
No, it was terrible.

330
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:39,571
It was terrible.

331
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:42,283
Every day in a different house...

332
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,120
worried about you...

333
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,207
the kids...

334
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,589
The truth is...

335
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,094
it's very good to be home.

336
00:27:03,804 --> 00:27:06,723
- You look happy.
- Of course.

337
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:12,021
That time has passed.

338
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,733
It's the happiest face I've ever seen
on a man about to go to jail.

339
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,493
- The kids!
- The kids, Pablo!

340
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:27,952
- The kids!
- No, Tata!

341
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:30,163
- I have to go to them!
- Stay here!

342
00:27:30,164 --> 00:27:32,790
- My children!
- Stay here!

343
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:35,043
I'll go get them. Stay here.

344
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:39,131
Juan Pablo!

345
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,008
Juan Pablo!

346
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,968
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

347
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:45,263
Come on.

348
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:52,937
Go to your mother.
Go to your mother.

349
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:58,149
Come on, come on.

350
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,703
The explosion was
from a car bomb on the street below,

351
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:12,122
about 800 pounds' worth of dynamite.

352
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,999
It made little Manuela
forever deaf in one ear.

353
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,377
In this war,

354
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:20,089
the innocent always seemed
to be the ones who got hurt.

355
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:26,429
For Escobar, the Monaco bombing
told him two things:

356
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:31,850
First, it showed him that the cops
weren't his biggest problem.

357
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:35,228
They would never use a bomb.

358
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:40,818
This was a new player, one that
wasn't above going after his family.

359
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:43,738
Don't worry, cousin.

360
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:48,075
We're going to kill them all.

361
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:53,456
Second, and the one
that fucked with his head the most...

362
00:28:55,874 --> 00:29:02,089
was that for the first time in his life...
someone had given him up.

363
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:07,345
And worse yet,
he had no idea who.

364
00:29:15,728 --> 00:29:16,936
Hello?

365
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:20,565
Valeria, there was an attempted hit
at the Monaco building.

366
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:25,487
- Just now?
- Yes, a few minutes ago. A car bomb.

367
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:28,825
- Who was inside?
- We don't know.

368
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:32,118
What other information do you have?

369
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:35,163
That's all the information
we have right now.

370
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,915
OK, thanks.

371
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,108
He always takes her to the same motel.

372
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:10,074
- Marina.
- Where are you going?

373
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,660
I'm going to the city.

374
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,872
I have to get out of this prison.

375
00:30:16,873 --> 00:30:19,667
- Come here, Marina.
- Yes?

376
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,338
Have a good time.

377
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:27,174
Be safe.

378
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:29,594
Thanks.

379
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:42,522
You know what he's going to do, right?

380
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:45,066
He's going to continue conducting
his business behind those walls

381
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:48,653
that are protected
by the Colombian government.

382
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:51,615
We should give him credit.
The man is a genius.

383
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:55,661
Well... all the more reason
that we should negotiate our surrender.

384
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,289
But you know that Pablo
took it upon himself to close that door.

385
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,499
So we need to take advantage
of your political contacts,

386
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,086
especially General Jaramillo.

387
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:06,838
Can you talk to him for us?

388
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:09,340
Yes, of course.

389
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:12,009
But I don't think it will be enough.

390
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,386
What are you saying?

391
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:16,640
That you're going
to have to offer something more,

392
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:20,394
something that interests them enough
to make a deal with you.

393
00:31:22,354 --> 00:31:23,940
Gustavo Gaviria.

394
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:27,818
He is the key to Pablo's business.

395
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,219
If that son of a bitch goes down,
the whole empire goes down.

396
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:34,867
Indeed, that could work.

397
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,787
That could work.

398
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:44,459
It is often said
there is no honor among thieves.

399
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,211
That's doubly true of drug dealers.

400
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:50,925
The Ochoas, with the help of Cali,
made their own surrender deal.

401
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:54,177
No extradition, no stiff sentence.

402
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:57,849
The Colombian government
was willing to overlook their part

403
00:31:58,056 --> 00:32:02,477
in the largest cocaine empire
on the face of the earth.

404
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:05,021
Instead, they would
serve reduced sentences.

405
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:07,148
- The charge?
- Follow me.

406
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:11,194
Illegally importing bulls from Spain.
I shit you not.

407
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,989
They went to jail
with smiles on their faces,

408
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,616
'cause all they had to do
was use their sister as bait

409
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:19,620
to catch a fish the cops actually wanted.

410
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,233
Kiss me.

411
00:33:07,543 --> 00:33:09,920
- You look pretty, baby.
- Yeah, sure.

412
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,965
What I mean is
you've always looked pretty.

413
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:25,811
Gustavo.

414
00:33:30,816 --> 00:33:32,443
What's happening?

415
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,028
Nothing.

416
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:38,949
Nothing is happening here.
Isn't that right, Colonel Carrillo?

417
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,826
That's up to you.

418
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:47,290
- Say goodbye.
- No.

419
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,667
No, no, no.
Gustavo, look at me. Gustav...

420
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:51,502
Does your family know where you are?

421
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:53,213
- Gustavo!
- Calm down, Marina.

422
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:00,471
You're making a big mistake, Carrillo.

423
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:05,725
We're already in negotiations
with the government.

424
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:09,063
- You have no reason to be doing this.
- You're right.

425
00:34:10,689 --> 00:34:12,566
That's why I'm not here.

426
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:17,571
Then what the fuck do you want?

427
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,366
Don't act stupid.

428
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:26,497
Give me your cousin...
and I'll let you live.

429
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,964
All right.

430
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:39,051
Kill me, then, motherfucker.

431
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:42,096
I won't do that myself.

432
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:48,226
But I want to introduce you to some people
who would love to do it for me.

433
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:52,397
This guy? This is Lastia.

434
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:59,403
His sister died in a bookstore in Bogotá
in a bombing you coordinated.

435
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:01,448
She was 17 years old.

436
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:04,368
And this guy here...

437
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,748
this is Trujillo.

438
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:16,421
You killed his father
and his brother for being cops.

439
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,468
- That has nothing to do with me.
- No?

440
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:28,559
You know...
if you support evil, you are evil.

441
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,436
Look at them.

442
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:34,023
I just want you to look at their faces.

443
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:37,359
A few of the victims
you've left in your wake.

444
00:35:38,777 --> 00:35:40,112
Tell me...

445
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:45,576
have you ever felt
the swift vengeance of justice?

446
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:52,415
Give me your cousin...

447
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:56,087
or I'll let these men
show you that vengeance with their fists.

448
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,520
Do it, then...
you sons of bitches.

449
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:15,313
OK, then.

450
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:22,947
We'll see how you feel...
after ten minutes.

451
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,616
Do it.

452
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:54,352
Tell me where your cousin is.

453
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:57,940
It doesn't have to end like this.

454
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,212
Tell me where your cousin is.

455
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:27,970
We...

456
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:34,018
are bandits...
not snitches, motherfucker.

457
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:55,288
You're...
You're all gonna die, motherfuckers!

458
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:58,166
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

459
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:00,877
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

460
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:06,924
You, your families,
your wives are all dead, motherfuckers!

461
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:08,135
You're all dead!

462
00:38:12,014 --> 00:38:15,225
Dump his body on the road to Sabaneta.

463
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,853
Colonel, they're going
to make us pay for this.

464
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:24,192
Report his death as a result
of a shoot-out with the police.

465
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:26,862
Make sure you report that he fired first.

466
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,031
But Colonel, he's all beat up.

467
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:37,706
That work for you?

468
00:38:48,884 --> 00:38:55,682
There is nothing... more beautiful
and more important in my life than this.

469
00:38:57,142 --> 00:39:00,854
We're all here together... united.

470
00:39:03,648 --> 00:39:07,569
Now let's eat and enjoy
this marvelous food.

471
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:13,491
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, yeah, the beets.

472
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,953
- Tata?
- Boss?

473
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:20,373
Hello, son. Have a seat.

474
00:39:20,374 --> 00:39:23,335
- Sit down...
- Boss, I don't know how to say this.

475
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,672
Tell me like a man.

476
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,842
- Gustavo is dead.
- What?

477
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:37,598
They found his body on the outskirts
of Sabaneta, badly beaten.

478
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,517
How's that?

479
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:41,145
They also shot him, boss.

480
00:39:41,353 --> 00:39:44,356
No, no!
How dare you come to my house saying that!

481
00:39:44,564 --> 00:39:47,650
How dare you!
Leave! Get out of my house!

482
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:51,446
You... you are leaving right now!
Get out of my house! Go on!

483
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:55,116
No! Gustavo, no. Pablo...
Go on! Get out of here!

484
00:39:55,117 --> 00:39:59,536
It's OK.
Everything's going to be fine.

485
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:11,925
Are you sure about this?

486
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:14,011
Yes, boss.

487
00:40:18,556 --> 00:40:21,059
I want you to take him
to the funeral home...

488
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,231
and guard his body the entire time
until it's buried.

489
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,026
- All right.
- Go on.

490
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:42,414
How are you doing, son?

491
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:21,995
I'm going to miss him so much, Mama.

492
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:28,626
When...

493
00:41:30,837 --> 00:41:37,927
you were nine... or ten...
do you remember?

494
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:42,057
How you would
ride around on your bicycles.

495
00:41:45,685 --> 00:41:49,355
You'd go up into the mountains
and just disappear.

496
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:53,193
The whole day would go by...

497
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,947
Oh, my.

498
00:41:57,864 --> 00:42:00,033
And we would call you...

499
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:06,164
We seemed crazy,
yelling for you all over the place...

500
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,836
until finally you would appear.

501
00:42:13,255 --> 00:42:15,257
Oh, my God.

502
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:18,469
"Where were you?"

503
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:22,764
"Where have you been, son?"
I would yell out.

504
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:26,851
"In the mountains, Mama."

505
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:34,443
"Higher than the clouds, Auntie,"
Gustavo would say, laughing.

506
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:43,284
He...

507
00:42:43,285 --> 00:42:45,870
He always wanted to go farther.

508
00:42:48,915 --> 00:42:51,334
He always did.

509
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,753
But with you.

510
00:42:54,712 --> 00:42:56,798
Only with you.

511
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:04,556
I didn't think it would end this way.

512
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,676
Good afternoon.

513
00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:48,433
Boss? Someone came
all the way out here to see you.

514
00:43:51,936 --> 00:43:53,771
Miss Valeria.

515
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:10,247
Good day, ma'am. Pablo.

516
00:44:11,122 --> 00:44:12,707
What's she doing here?

517
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:15,710
I'm here only because
I have important information.

518
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:17,170
I hope it's very important.

519
00:44:17,379 --> 00:44:19,839
It's about Gustavo.

520
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:22,800
Tell us, then.

521
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:27,638
I've been told the Ochoa brothers
have been seen in Cali.

522
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:30,891
They are the ones
who turned Gustavo over,

523
00:44:30,892 --> 00:44:34,645
in exchange for the cartel helping them
seal a deal with the government.

524
00:44:34,646 --> 00:44:35,980
How do you know that?

525
00:44:36,189 --> 00:44:38,650
You know me, Pablo.

526
00:44:39,651 --> 00:44:41,403
I have my ways.

527
00:44:50,412 --> 00:44:52,748
Who in Cali?

528
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:56,668
Pacho Herrera.

529
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,339
Pablo wanted to send a message to Cali,

530
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,594
so he ordered his sicarios
to hit them during a soccer match.

531
00:45:06,595 --> 00:45:09,931
It was very effective.

532
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:16,521
He did get 14 Cali men that day.

533
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:20,816
The problem was, everyone on
the soccer field was dressed the same.

534
00:45:28,074 --> 00:45:30,867
By the time the sicarios spotted Pacho,

535
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:32,621
he was already running away.

536
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:39,085
"Will you hide yourself forever, Lord?

537
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:43,255
Will your wrath burn like fire?

538
00:45:43,256 --> 00:45:46,383
Remember how fleeting is my life,

539
00:45:46,384 --> 00:45:50,845
for what futility
you have created the children of men."

540
00:45:50,846 --> 00:45:54,141
Pablo had Gustavo
buried in the hills of Medellín,

541
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:56,435
where the cousins had played as kids.

542
00:45:56,436 --> 00:45:58,145
In his mind,
losing his best friend

543
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:01,732
was a price he had to pay
to defeat extradition.

544
00:46:01,733 --> 00:46:05,236
So he ordered the burial
to take place at the exact same time

545
00:46:05,445 --> 00:46:08,614
that Congress was voting to repeal it.

546
00:46:08,615 --> 00:46:13,160
Whether it was Gaviria's support,
Pablo's "plata or plomo,"

547
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:15,747
or maybe people
were just sick of the violence...

548
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:19,167
extradition was defeated by a landslide.

549
00:46:20,126 --> 00:46:22,795
Hours after the vote,
a military helicopter

550
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:25,922
was dispatched to coordinates
just outside Medellín,

551
00:46:25,923 --> 00:46:28,134
where Pablo was waiting.

552
00:46:39,604 --> 00:46:42,606
As you know,
I come on behalf of President Gaviria

553
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:43,775
and the Colombian government.

554
00:46:43,983 --> 00:46:48,488
This is the offer of our terms
for your surrender.

555
00:46:48,697 --> 00:46:51,906
Peña and I
had to go see it with our own eyes.

556
00:46:51,907 --> 00:46:56,245
A terrorist, a drug dealer and a murderer
surrendering to a grateful nation

557
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:59,289
who gave him everything he asked for.

558
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:03,420
It was the closest we'd ever come to him,
and we never felt further away.

559
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:06,297
All right, then.

560
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,594
Let me hand over my gun.

561
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:17,642
- You won.
- We both did.

562
00:47:19,143 --> 00:47:22,105
Now Gaviria can announce
that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.

563
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:26,567
Except that's not so true.

564
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:28,820
You and I know it's a big lie.

565
00:47:29,028 --> 00:47:30,655
Mm.

566
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:38,747
Lies are necessary... when the truth
is too difficult to believe. Right?

567
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,419
It wasn't a fucking surrender.

568
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,422
Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.

569
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:53,136
He was escaping it.
And all anyone could do was watch.

570
00:47:58,974 --> 00:48:03,271
Once again, Escobar had used violence
to bend the world to his will.

571
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:08,567
They called it "la gran mentira,"
"the big lie."

572
00:48:08,568 --> 00:48:10,779
And it was a lie.

573
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:16,409
Except as I watched him
fly away to his luxury prison...

574
00:48:17,993 --> 00:48:20,162
I couldn't help but think
there was some truth in it.

575
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,623
Damn it. Fucker.

576
00:48:22,624 --> 00:48:25,418
A truth that I hadn't
been willing to accept.

577
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:32,717
He'd beat us because
he was willing to do what we weren't.

578
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:36,137
Bad guys don't play by the rules.

579
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,765
That's what makes 'em bad.

580
00:48:40,015 --> 00:48:42,309
Maybe that's what lets 'em win.

581
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,145
Lagarto,
are we gonna party tonight or what?

582
00:48:45,146 --> 00:48:48,650
I got Poison at 400
to 1700 megahertz, gentlemen.

583
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,819
La Dispensaria.

584
00:48:51,778 --> 00:48:54,237
So who do we give this to? DEA?

585
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:57,741
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

586
00:48:57,742 --> 00:48:59,619
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

587
00:49:00,411 --> 00:49:03,664
I made a promise to myself
that when the time came

588
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:06,000
that I could strike a blow
against Escobar,

589
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:09,169
even if it meant breaking the rules,
oh, I was gonna do it.

590
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,256
- Hello?
- Hey, Central Spike here.

591
00:49:12,465 --> 00:49:14,049
All right.

592
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:22,391
You wanna tell me a good guy
wouldn't have pushed the buttons

593
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,019
on these motherfuckers?

594
00:49:25,854 --> 00:49:28,146
You wanna call me a bad guy?

595
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:39,950
Fine. But if you do, it just means
that you haven't met enough bad guys yet

596
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:41,118
to know the difference.

597
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:45,581
There's one thing I've learned
down here in Colombia,

598
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:49,001
good and bad are relative concepts.

599
00:49:49,002 --> 00:49:52,128
<i>Yesterday, I fought the devil
Who they say is very brave</i>

600
00:49:52,129 --> 00:49:56,717
<i>I hacked him with my machete so bad
That even I got freaked out</i>

601
00:49:56,718 --> 00:49:59,762
<i>I jumped back, dodging his attack</i>

602
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:04,308
<i>And in one fell swoop
I cut off his tail</i>
