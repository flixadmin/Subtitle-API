HELENA: Take your hands off me.
-What do you think you were doing?

4
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,011
That man was the leader of the Triad.

5
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,972
My father blames them
for the recent hits against his men.

6
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,391
-These are men you killed.
-That's right.

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,729
I take out Zhishan and the Triad retaliates.
I've weakened my father's organization...

8
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,190
...to the point where there's no way
he can survive their onslaught.

What, and then you have your revenge?

10
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,029
Then I have justice.

11
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,698
For what he did to Michael and me.

12
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,658
It's not justice.

13
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,869

-Because you have everything figured out.

I don't think you're one to judge.
I saw you kill people.

Okay. Last time you and I spoke,
you were on your way...

...to stop Helena Bertinelli
from her one-woman war against the Mafia.

How'd that work out for you?

Nick Salvati,
Frank Bertinelli's right hand...

47
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,613
...was found with his neck snapped,
along with a few of his thugs.

-"We"?

She knows, Diggle. About me.
It was my secret or her life.

-She's not what you think she is.

Her father found it, thought it belonged
to her fiancé, and had him murdered.

57
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,689
All right, that's a heavy thing, but it doesn't
change the fact that she is dangerous.

-Some people don't change.
-She can. I can help her.

All right, maybe you think
you're more persuasive than you are...

I wasn't the only one who tracked it.

The laptop.

464
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,482
He's going away, Helena,
for the rest of his life.

465
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,526
This is justice.

466
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:58,323
Then I guess you were right.
I'm more interested in revenge.

467
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,116
Stay out of my way, Oliver.

468
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,578
Or I'll make sure your secret
doesn't stay secret.

469
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:05,997
Helena.

470
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,794
What I did...

471
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,258
...everything that I've done,
I've done because I care about you.

472
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,805
Too bad I can't say the same.

473
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,737
Hey, you. Thanks for the call.

474
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,783
-What are ex-sisters-in-law for?
-Mm.

475
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:50,291
DIGGLE:
Chili cheese fries with jalapenos. Mm.

476
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,588
That's a cry for help if I've ever seen one.

477
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,051
I don't know what hurts worse, this...

478
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,762
...or getting shot
with a curare-laced bullet.

479
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,390
-Been there, done that. Definitely the bullet.
-Heh.

480
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,893
[SIGHS]

481
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,564
You know, Oliver, I'm no expert at this...

482
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:18,486
...but I don't think love
is about changing or saving a person.

483
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,574
I think it's about finding the person
who's already the right fit.

484
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,537
One day you will.

485
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,999
I think I burned that particular bridge.

486
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,587
-Napalmed it, actually.
-So things didn't work out as you planned.

487
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,547
You did save Frank Bertinelli's life.

488
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,092
He'll be doing time for a while.
Justice wins out.

489
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,305
Helena doesn't see it that way.

490
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,559
You opened up,
took a risk with your heart.

491
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,605
The Oliver I met a few months ago
would not have been able to do that.

492
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:59,319
And when you meet the right person,
you'll be ready for her.

493
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,413
[BOTH LAUGHING]

494
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:18,046
-What are you doing?
-Needs to be dark if we're gonna do this.

495
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:22,634
If I'd had more time to think of that
sentence, it wouldn't have sounded so dirty.

496
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,344
Look.

497
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,519
-I don't see anything.
-I got these from Applied Sciences.

498
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,481
They're able to pick up the sub-visible
variations in the UV spectrum.

499
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,400
Now look at the book again.

500
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,177
Hi.

501
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,472
Look, I'm sorry about last night.

502
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:14,185
I just... I let it get too far, us sitting
at the same table. That was...

503
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:18,439
-That was stupid.
-No, I was stupid.

504
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,986
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

505
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,698
My dad cut me off.

506
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,743
He froze all my funds.
I am living on fumes.

507
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,413
Really?

508
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,084
-Why didn't you say anything?
-Embarrassment, shame, jealousy.

509
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,837
Probably a few other emotions
I'm not used to feeling.

510
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,715
Tommy, my trust fund is your trust fund.

511
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,761
No, that is the easy answer.

512
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,765
And believe me,
I have loved easy answers.

513
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,934
What I need is a job.

514
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,314
I'm trying to change.

515
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,150
Not sure into what yet...

516
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,820
...but I don't wanna be
what I was anymore.

517
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:13,161
It just so happens that I have
a general manager position that is available.

518
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,957
-You're probably the guy for the job.
-Will I get dental? This smile wasn't cheap.

519
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,710
-I will look into that.
-Thank you.

520
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,547
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

521
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:33,056
-You okay?
-I will be.

522
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,849
Something happen with Helena?

523
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,809
We had a falling out.

524
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,439
But I have a feeling
that I will be seeing her again.
