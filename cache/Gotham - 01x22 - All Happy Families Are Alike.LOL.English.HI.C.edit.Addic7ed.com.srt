No surprise, um, but I
haven't seen him today.

Bruce, your father was a true stoic.

15
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,484
He kept his best self hidden.

16
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:34,085
Your father was a good man.

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,288
But even good men have secrets.

18

- Classical music...

- he would play for hours.
- That's right.

61

Mom and I would read books

62

66
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,289
Was the door always locked, Alfred?

67
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:17,991
Yeah, well, I suppose
so, when he was working.

68
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:20,494
Why, though?

69
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,729
Why lock the door?

That's what doors are for, isn't it?

71

Brass are gonna fire me just as
soon as this gang war cools off.

Much better.

113
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:34,761
Yes.

114
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,797
You are. This is your last checkup.

115
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,298
You are all healed physically.

116
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,400
But you need to get some trauma counseling.

117

Doc, I'm happy.

118

I am happy to be alive.

119

00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,411
without saying thank you properly.

121
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:54,982
Thank you for saving my life.

122
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:58,118
I was glad to do it.

trauma counseling, like, yesterday.

125
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:04,958
I have several recommendations for you.

126
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:07,661
- Really, Doc, I am fine.
- You're not fine.

127
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:10,330
After what you've been
through, nobody would be fine.

128
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:13,500
Fine. If you will be my counselor.

129
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:16,937
And we do it at my place.

130
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,973
No. I have some trauma training,

131
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:22,109
but it's not my area of focus.

132
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:23,343
I like you.

133
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:25,279
Hey, I can talk to you.

134
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:26,513
Please?

135
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:33,820
Okay.

136
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:35,455
Deal.

137
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,624
Thank you.

138
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,992
Hmm?

139
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:42,496
All right, last warning to all of you!

140
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,431
Don't free that guy!

141

Hey, Jim, did you hear the news?

142
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,801
Don Falcone just got hit.

143
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:49,136
- Jim?
- What?!

144
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,138
Falcone got hit 20 minutes ago.

145
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:52,506
Maroni's boys blew up his car.

146
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,007
- He's dead?
- No. He's at the hospital,

147
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,043
- but he'll be dead soon enough.
- (sighs)

148
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:59,179
Listen, Essen said City Hall
and the bigwigs okayed the hit.

149
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:01,114
They switched their support to Maroni.

150
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:03,116
Maroni? That hothead?

151
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:04,551
They think he can run this city?

152
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:05,786
- (phone ringing)
- Someone had to go.

153
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,021
This war has been bad for business.

154
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:10,057

Oh, Penguin, thank God.

Get me out of here.

168

Maroni's men will be here any minute.

169
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:07,281
Yes, I imagine so.

170
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:09,116
Mustn't stay long.

171
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,287
But... I knew I'd regret it

172
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:15,956
if I didn't say good-bye to you in person.

173
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:25,299
It was me, old friend.

174
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,202
I did this to you.

175
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:34,241
I started the war.

176
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,810
From the day I met you,
I was planning your end.

177
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:40,714
I'm sorry it has to be in this...

178
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:44,751
squalid little corner, but...

179
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:53,727
c'est la vie.

180
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:56,263
Why?

181
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:59,833
Nothing personal, I assure you, sir.

182
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:03,637
You have been a wise mentor

183
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:06,707
and a good friend,

184
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,343
but...

185
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,777
business must come first.

186
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:12,446
(snickers)

187
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:17,251
I'm gonna take your place, old man.

188
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:20,120
And I'm gonna be the
King of Gotham. (laughs)

189
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:22,256
You?

190
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,991
Never.

191
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,760
You're going to burn in Hell.

192
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,536
I do worry about that.

193
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,538
(sniffles)

194
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:40,841
But you first,

195
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,277
old friend.

196
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:46,847
You first.

197
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,448
Nobody move!

198
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:50,484
(grunts)

199
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:57,391
- Walk away!
- Shut up.

200
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,626
You're both under arrest
for attempted murder.

201
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:07,892
(Oswald groans)

202
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:10,061
Didn't you hear?

203
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,996
Falcone is out by official decree.

204
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,231
Everyone agreed.

205
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:14,499
I heard.

206
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,734
So, release me, Jim.

207
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:18,336
Get on the winning side.

208
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,732
Winning side, my ass.

209
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:22,851
Maroni's a fool. He can't replace me.

210
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:25,320
A thousand rivals will
jump up to challenge him.

211
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:27,322
There'll be civil war.

212
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:29,691
If I die now, Gotham falls apart.

213
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,793
I agree, but can you turn things around?

214
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:33,695
Can you take back control?

215
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,764
Of course.

216
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:37,766
Two days at my safe house.

217
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,802
I need two days to make some moves,

218
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:44,306
and I'll skin Maroni and those
disloyal scum like rabbits.

219
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,841
OSWALD: Wake up, Napoleon!

220
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,943
Maroni's louts are minutes away

221
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:50,212
from coming here and cutting your throat,

222
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:52,547
and the thing is, Jim,
they aren't very fond

223
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:55,317
of me, either, so, seriously,

224
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,886
you need to uncuff me... Jim?!

225
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:04,626
(phone blips, beeps)

226
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:06,328
(line ringing)

227
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:07,996
Jim, where the hell'd you run off to?

228
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:09,164
Harv,

229
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,832
I'm in the hospital with Falcone.

230
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,034
There's nobody here.

231
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:14,236
No kidding. What the
hell are you doing there?

232
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,504
You gotta get out now.

233
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:17,272
They'll be coming back to finish him off.

234
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,975
Yeah. Any moment now.

235
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,743
Unless I get him out of here.

236
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:23,211
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

237
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:26,682
- I could use some help.
- No way. Are you nuts?

238
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:29,384
He's a bad man, but he's
the best bad man we got.

239
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,919
If Falcone loses control,

240
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:33,488
Maroni's too wild to run Gotham.

241
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:35,590
- There'll be anarchy.
- Yeah, probably,

242
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,326
but Falcone already lost control.

243
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,660
And he'll get it back.

244
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:42,297
Listen, you're all twisted
over what happened to Barbara.

245
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,999
You're not thinking straight.

246
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,335
Yeah. Maybe.

247
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:48,704
But I'm done in this town anyhow.

248
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:52,107
- What do I have to lose?
- Your life. Huh?

249
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,743
How 'bout your life?

250
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:56,011
(phone beeps off)

251
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:58,046
(phone snaps shut)

252
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:01,950
What the hell are you doing here?

253
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:05,187
I thought the fix was in with you guys.

254
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,225
(chuckles)

255
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,668
Can you walk?

256
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:20,936
- If I have to.
- Let's get you

257
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,738
out of here... I'll take
you to your safe house.

258
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,806
Jim, my friend,

259
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:27,042
you are making a terrible mistake.

260
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:29,111
I'm doing this for the city,

261
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:30,279
not you.

262
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:31,813
You're the least worst option.

263
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,815
If I didn't think you
could take back control,

264
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,341
I'd let you die.

265
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:38,487
- Just so we're clear.
- We're clear.

266
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,489
You can't leave me here.

267
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:42,324
Maroni's men will kill me!

268
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:43,558
Possible.

269
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:45,694
No. No, you-you arrested us.

270
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:47,930
We are in your custody.

271
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:49,831
That's true.

272
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,900
You owe me a favor, Jim.

273
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:53,502
You owe me!

274
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:55,103
Damn it.

275
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,372
LOEB (in distance): James Gordon!

276
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:01,109
Detective Gordon!

277
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,456
Don't kill 'em.

278
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,933
Morning, fellas.

279
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:26,401
What can I help you with?

280
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:27,936
Yes, Gordon.

281
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:30,272
As usual, wrong place, wrong time.

282
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,174
Go. Now.

283
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,510
Why? So these men can kill Carmine Falcone?

284
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:37,846
I have no knowledge of that.

285
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,847
Go.

286
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,616
That's an order.

287
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,951
You're a disgrace, Loeb.

288
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:46,255
I hope to see you behind bars very soon.

289
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,923
Or dead.

290
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,458
Whichever.

291
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:53,462
Hope.

292
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,163
It's for losers...

293
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:57,199
Jim.

294
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:04,039
<i>He's all yours!</i>

295
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:07,476
(exhales)

296
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,785
Get him!

297
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:22,424
Move, move, move, move.

298
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,260
(grunting)

299
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,397
Aah!

300
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,240
(guns blasting)

301
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:57,025
(grunting)

302
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:09,238
(shouts)

303
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,207
Jim! Jim! Don't shoot! It's me!

304
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:15,043
We gotta go... there are
ambulances in the basement.

305
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:16,445
Where's your man?

306
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,447
Uh...

307
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,616
about that.

308
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,951
We got to take Penguin and Gilzean, too.

309
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:24,319
<i>- Penguin and Gilzean?
- I arrested 'em</i>

310
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:26,088
for attempted murder.
They're in my custody.

311
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:27,823
(groans) I don't even
want to argue with you.

312
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,892
Come on! Let's go! Go!

313
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:32,561
Tommy... Tommy!

314
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:35,264
(engine revving, tires screeching)

315
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:36,999
MAN: Boss! Boss! Look out!

316
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:39,268
(gunfire, bullets clanking and popping)

317
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:40,469
Get down!

318
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:49,144
(tires screeching)

319
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,952
Damn it.

320
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:09,029
What exactly

321
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:10,664
are we looking for, Master Bruce?

322
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:14,602
When I find it, I'll know.

323
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:23,344
(engine squeaking, clanking)

324
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,681
(rumbling, squeaking)

325
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:30,951
(engine sputters, stops)

326
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:35,189
Nobody knows about this
place, right? Nobody?

327
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:37,625
Nobody. Anybody who did is dead.

328
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:40,060
We'll be safe here.

329
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:46,000
Hello.

330
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:50,504
What's up?

331
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:52,740
(door rattling)

332
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,817
I know, I know.

333
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:05,819
It's astonishing.

334
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:09,023
Sometimes I astonish myself.

335
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:15,888
I feel like, uh,

336
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:17,890
this is all a dream,

337
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:20,093
and I'm gonna wake up soon.

338
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:26,299
Barbara,

339
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,368
you were abducted.

340
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:31,337
Your parents were killed in front of you.

341
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:33,373
Yeah. Yeah, that's real.

342
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:39,779
I'm talking about this. Now. This...

343
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,814
this is the dream.

344
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:44,217
I'm gonna wake up

345
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:45,885
and...

346
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,888
he's still alive...

347
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:51,924
and he's coming for me.

348
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:59,298
<i>MOONEY: I thought for sure you were dead.</i>

349
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,301
Let me look at you.

350
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:04,003
Fish?

351
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:10,176
Is it real... It's really you?

352
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,080
It's... it's me, Butch. I'm home.

353
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:19,018
My poor baby. What did they do to you?

354
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,687
(panting)

355
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:22,355
Nothing good.

356
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,358
It's him, boss.

357
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:32,231
Don Maroni.

358
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,900
(chuckles softly)

359
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:35,368
Yes.

360
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:38,371
Alive and well.

361
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:41,841
That's a long story.

362
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,876
We need to talk.

363
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:48,348
I have something you want.

364
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:50,383
(grunting, gasping)

365
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:56,723
They didn't find my knife.

366
00:18:57,758 --> 00:18:59,726
Ah.

367
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,861
So we're saved then.

368
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:03,663
It's in my sock.

369
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:05,932
If you get the chance,
take some of them with us.

370
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,433
I'll try.

371
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,435
Hey, you.

372
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,404
Selina, what are you doing here?

373
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:14,040
Chillin'. How 'bout you?

374
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,541
Kind of jammed up.

375
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:16,943
Yeah.

376
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:19,379
That's too bad.

377
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:26,252
Oh...

378
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,287
that's mime for "help us out here."

379
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:29,789
- Eh.
- And totally blow

380
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:33,259
the coolest gig ever just because we kinda,

381
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:35,928
sorta know each other?

382
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:37,297
Right?

383
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:39,065
(sighs)

384
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,101
Hello, fellas.

385
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:45,505
Hmm. Carmine.

386
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,976
Penguin.

387
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,745
Nothing to share?

388
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,647
Well, I have a little something.

389
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:59,118
I just made a sweet deal with Maroni.

390
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:02,455
He just told me I could
have all my territories back,

391
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,424
and all I have to do in return...

392
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:08,795
is give him Carmine's head.

393
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:14,033
Uh, Fish, I-I need to go lie down.

394
00:20:14,068 --> 00:20:15,835
(exhales)

395
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:19,872
What did you do to that
poor soul, you sadist?

396
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:21,441
I assure you...

397
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:24,177
You will die

398
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:28,681
a slow, painful death on account of Butch.

399
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:30,183
You, too, Carmine.

400
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:34,187
You...

401
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:38,691
We'll keep it simple.

402
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:42,228
And you?

403
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:44,631
We're cool.

404
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,199
Any questions?

405
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:48,868
How you gonna kill 'em?

406
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:56,576
I love this girl.

407
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,578
(Mooney cackling)

408
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:06,471
<i>BARBARA: Jason saw right through me.</i>

409
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:09,102
He knew me instantly.

410
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:10,971
Like I was naked.

411
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:13,306
It was scary...

412
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:15,141
but thrilling.

413
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:16,643
And...

414
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,578
aren't...

415
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,847
all the best guys

416
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,016
a little scary?

417
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,851
I was

418
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:28,788
way more scared of Jim Gordon
the first date we went on.

419
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:31,992
So butch and...

420
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:33,894
stern.

421
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:36,163
That type, they-they often

422
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:38,165
have a bad temper.

423
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:41,434
Hmm. But Jim was a sweetie.

424
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:43,637
Never laid a finger on me.

425
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:47,541
It was kind of surprising.

426
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:48,909
Does he ever hit you?

427
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:51,812
Me? No. Why?

428
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:53,513
Wh-Why would he hit anyone?

429
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:54,648
Any woman?

430
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:56,583
You know.

431
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:58,485
Out of passion.

432
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,524
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

433
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,693
Only I heard you and Jim were dating.

434
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:08,995
No.

435
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:11,665
(laughs softly)

436
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:13,900
Y-Yes, we've been on a few dates.

437
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:16,169
I'm sorry, I didn't think that you knew.

438
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,672
If that makes you
uncomfortable in any way...

439
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:21,441
(laughing): No. Don't be silly.

440
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,777
I, uh... I'm happy for you.

441
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:26,713
He's one of the good guys.

442
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:29,449
Yeah, he is.

443
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:31,084
Hey, you hungry?

444
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:43,263
FISH: So, there he is.

445
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:47,868
MARONI: Fish, you
mysterious, crazy, gorgeous

446
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:49,069
killer, you.

447
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:50,403
- I love ya.
- (chuckles)

448
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,705
Come here. (grunts)

449
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,476
This...

450
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:59,045
this is delicious.

451
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,647
Finally.

452
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:03,750
- You're hard to kill, old man.
- No.

453
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,919
Your people are second-rate.

454
00:23:05,953 --> 00:23:07,120
(scoffs)

455
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:10,123
OSWALD: Miss Mooney,
if I may, a brief word.

456
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,459
I know my life is forfeit.

457
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:15,762
I speak not for my sake, but yours.

458
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:16,997
(panting): Because...

459
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,632
after all,

460
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,467
I still love and respect you.

461
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:23,270
Kill me if you must,

462
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:26,006
but keep Falcone alive.

463
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,642
As soon as he's dead,
Maroni has no use for you.

464
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:30,944
You are simply a threat. He will kill you.

465
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:32,412
Oh!

466
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,114
You think?

467
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:36,449
Why would he need another boss in town?

468
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:37,684
Another rival?

469
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:38,985
That's where you're wrong, smart guy.

470
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:41,855
(A) She's not a rival,

471
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,590
because she's not a boss.

472
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:44,925
She's an underboss.

473
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,727
An underboss takes orders.

474
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,763
I don't take orders.

475
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:51,531
- MARONI: I know that.
- We're cool.

476
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:52,933
Relax.

477
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:55,602
I'm relaxed.

478
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,204
I don't think you are, babes.

479
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,842
Please don't call me babes.

480
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,044
MARONI: You see?

481
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:06,446
Not relaxed.

482
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,516
Babes? Really?

483
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,052
It's a term of endearment.

484
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:14,221
It means I like you.

485
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:18,124
Fine. I misspoke.

486
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,801
You're not an underboss
and you're not a babe.

487
00:24:21,116 --> 00:24:23,730
You tell me what you are.

488
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,801
What we are, Sal...

489
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:31,538
are partners.

490
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,506
MARONI: Whatever you want.

491
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,775
Partners.

492
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,078
I'm partner number one,

493
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:40,180
and you're partner number two.

494
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:42,816
That's the deal, right?

495
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,951
I'm number one...

496
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:47,053
and you are...?

497
00:24:50,124 --> 00:24:51,758
Number two.

498
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,894
MARONI: There you go. Simple math.

499
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,663
One, two, babes. Oops.

500
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:58,732
Sorry.

501
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:01,201
That's the last time. I swear.

502
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,108
Guys!

503
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,777
Can you feel the buzz in the air?

504
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:13,179
That's victory.

505
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:14,614
Redemption.

506
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:16,750
Power!

507
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,451
When this old man dies,

508
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:20,920
a new day begins.

509
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:23,390
We will rule Gotham.

510
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:25,692
We are building a dynasty.

511
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:28,962
We will whip this town

512
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:31,765
like a rented mule.

513
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,566
Right, babes?

514
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:35,435
(others chuckling)

515
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:37,837
(chuckling): Oh-ho,
just... all right, relax.

516
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,406
I'm kidding you.

517
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,941
(chuckles)

518
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:42,976
Guys, no, seriously.

519
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:45,946
Don't call her "babes."

520
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,882
Or "toots" or what have you.

521
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,583
It's a woman's lib thing.

522
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,957
<i>I am relaxed.</i>

523
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,299
(gunfire, shouting)

524
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,105
GORDON: Let's go!

525
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:13,506
(gasping)

526
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:25,206
Barbara, we've been
circling around the subject,

527
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,210
but haven't talked about
what actually happened to you;

528
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:31,378
wh-what was done to you.

529
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:32,646
Lee...

530
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:34,682
you're a nice lady.

531
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:37,885
I could go there,

532
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,554
but I'm not sure you
want to go there with me.

533
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:42,690
Don't worry about me.

534
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:47,261
(helicopter flying over)

535
00:26:47,295 --> 00:26:49,296
(sighs quietly)

536
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,612
Has Jim told you he loves you?

537
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,413
- Barbara...
- Fair is fair.

538
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,649
I'm telling you all my little secrets.

539
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,452
No, he hasn't.

540
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:03,622
But he will, though, won't he?

541
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,657
You can feel it coming?

542
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,525
I mean, come on, look at you.

543
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,029
You're gorgeous and smart...
Of course he loves you.

544
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,364
Do you love him?

545
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,432
Barbara...

546
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,304
Tell me what happened.

547
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:23,375
(yelling and gunfire in distance)

548
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,681
If we can get to 7th
Avenue without being spotted

549
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,683
by Fish's people, we're home free.

550
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:34,786
- Then what?
- We find a safe place, regroup.

551
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,955
Maroni's death is a lucky break for you.

552
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,057
Spoken like a true mafioso.

553
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,459
You're the least worst
option, like you said.

554
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,428
Without you, the city falls apart.

555
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,564
Yes, I said that, and it might be true,

556
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,366
but this has been a long day

557
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,001
and I've had a long time

558
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,703
to look at this world I've created.

559
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,772
I'm done with this business.

560
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,173
I'm out.

561
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,509
I've got a place down south I can go to.

562
00:27:57,543 --> 00:28:00,378
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

563
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,814
I know. I'm letting you down.

564
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,150
I'm letting the city down. I know.

565
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,318
(door slams)

566
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,986
MAN: Hey, I heard something.

567
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,088
MAN 2: Yeah, flash it this way.

568
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,657
Down here, down here!

569
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,627
Okay, plan B.

570
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,403
(men talking in distance)

571
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,572
Keep the light up.

572
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,279
So you got a place down south, huh?

573
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,047
Nice? On the water?

574
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,716
Yes.

575
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,718
Any work for beat-up old cops?

576
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:41,052
Sure.

577
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,687
How's that sound, Jim?

578
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,623
Beaches, sunshine, fishing...

579
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:46,191
Yeah, tempting.

580
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,593
Hello again.

581
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,631
Cat got your tongue?

582
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:00,472
(whispers): Yes!

583
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:05,944
Selena.

584
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,712
Boys.

585
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,781
Bless you.

586
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,449
Got to hand it to you, Fish.

587
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:14,252
You really know how to stop a
show. I couldn't help myself,

588
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:16,888
Harvey, the man vexed me.

589
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,490
Crazy move.

590
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,825
Possibly a good move, too. We'll see.

591
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,028
The battlefield is in flux.

592
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,880
You could be looking at
the new Queen of Gotham.

593
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:28,519
Congratulations, my dear.

594
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:29,787
I'm quitting, Fish.

595
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:31,355
I'm out.

596
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,124
Does this mean I don't have to kill you?

597
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:35,359
You're gonna retire

598
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:37,328
someplace warm, lay back,

599
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:39,196
read your little funny papers?

600
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:41,365
- That was the thought.
- Yeah.

601
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,967
Nice thought.

602
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:47,371
(yells)

603
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:55,513
(panting)

604
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:57,782
OSWALD: Fish!

605
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:01,485
(panting)

606
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,987
Please, no.

607
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:06,657
Fish!

608
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:08,759
Where are you?!

609
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:12,597
(gasping)

610
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,000
Go!

611
00:30:16,034 --> 00:30:18,402
(gasps, grunts)

612
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:24,175
(tires squealing, engine revving)

613
00:30:34,887 --> 00:30:36,287
(sighs softly)

614
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:38,956
Then he left me.

615
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:41,526
For a long time.

616
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,928
Alone.

617
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:46,464
And I slept.

618
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:48,533
I don't know for how long.

619
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:51,502
And then he woke me up.

620
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:54,605
(helicopter flying
over) Road trip, he said.

621
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,864
We were halfway there when...

622
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:01,045
I realized...

623
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:06,450
we were going to my parents' house.

624
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:09,887
Go on.

625
00:31:09,922 --> 00:31:13,191
Well, then he tied them up to a chair...

626
00:31:14,993 --> 00:31:16,661
and, uh...

627
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:20,565
he told me to talk to them...

628
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,733
about my childhood issues.

629
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:24,502
So I did.

630
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:25,736
I...

631
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:29,540
just... told them
whatever came into my head.

632
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:32,376
And what came into your head?

633
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:33,878
You know...

634
00:31:33,912 --> 00:31:36,547
just stupid kid stuff, I guess,

635
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:39,250
like, uh...

636
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:42,753
my mom used to call me her
little piggy when I was little.

637
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:45,423
They threw away my posters.

638
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:48,392
Never nurtured my self-esteem.

639
00:31:48,427 --> 00:31:50,761
Just slowly...

640
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:53,931
steadily...

641
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:56,801
grinding away at my soul.

642
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:01,639
Trying to make me...

643
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:03,207
disappear.

644
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:07,011
That's not kid stuff.

645
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:10,781
To be fair to them...

646
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:13,451
they simply never understood me.

647
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:17,788
They have no clue

648
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:20,358
who I am.

649
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:23,895
Even when I was killing them,

650
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:25,696
they just gaped at me...

651
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:27,765
like fools.

652
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,635
No understanding.

653
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:32,670
Barbara...

654
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:34,839
Jason Lennon killed your parents.

655
00:32:34,873 --> 00:32:36,774
You didn't kill them.

656
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,478
Yes, I did.

657
00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:44,916
I stabbed them...

658
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,919
several times...

659
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:50,288
and then I slit their throats.

660
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:00,733
I'd like to leave now, please.

661
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,267
You uncomfortable?

662
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:05,070
How about now?

663
00:33:07,273 --> 00:33:09,008
(door opens)

664
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:20,974
(Barbara grunting, banging against door)

665
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,100
- (phone beeping)
- Damn.

666
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,907
(elevator bell dings)

667
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,945
(dog whimpers quietly)

668
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,686
(grunts)

669
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:53,397
(growling, screaming)

670
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,402
(grunts)

671
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,109
Aah!

672
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,629
Lee.

673
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:29,406
She... She just... She just went crazy.

674
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:35,239
Told him that woman was trouble.

675
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,812
(groaning, panting)

676
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,556
(yelling)

677
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,857
(grunting)

678
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,830
(grunting)

679
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,705
(screams) Aah!

680
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
(screams)

681
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,383
(grunting)

682
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,020
Butch.

683
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,655
About time.

684
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,924
- Shoot her, Butch.
- Oh, really?

685
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,561
Do as I say, Butch. Shoot her.

686
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:35,073
What are you doing? Drop him.

687
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:37,409
(groaning in distress) My friend,

688
00:35:37,443 --> 00:35:38,777
remember your training.

689
00:35:38,811 --> 00:35:40,712
- I order you to shoot her!
- Aah!

690
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:42,147
Butch!

691
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,216
Don't listen to him. He
did something to your mind.

692
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:46,684
I'm your girl.

693
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,586
Remember, I'm your girl.

694
00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:49,921
Kill her now!

695
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:51,456
(grunting)

696
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:53,625
Oh!

697
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,393
Aah! Oh.

698
00:35:56,629 --> 00:35:58,596
(moaning)

699
00:35:58,631 --> 00:36:00,365
FISH: Butch...

700
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,966
Oh, my God, what did I do?

701
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:05,070
I'm so sorry.

702
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:06,571
I'm so sorry, I would never hurt you.

703
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:09,407
- I love you, Fish.
- It's okay.

704
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:11,476
It's not your fault. I love you too.

705
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,144
He messed with your mind.

706
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:14,479
It's not your fault.

707
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:16,314
I'm gonna be fine.

708
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:17,782
You know me.

709
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:20,685
OSWALD: Aah! (groans)

710
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:24,622
(laughs slowly)

711
00:36:24,657 --> 00:36:26,591
Good-bye, Fish.

712
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,960
It's all good.

713
00:36:28,994 --> 00:36:32,397
(screaming)

714
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:33,665
- No!
- (shrieks)

715
00:36:36,669 --> 00:36:38,003
(distant splash)

716
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:50,515
- (thunder rumbles)
- I'm the King of Gotham.

717
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:54,219
(cackling)

718
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,354
I'm the King of Gotham!

719
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,356
(thunder rumbles)

720
00:36:58,391 --> 00:37:00,825
I'm the King of Gotham!

721
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,261
(laughing)

722
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:07,699
(footsteps approaching) Mr. Nygma.

723
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:09,034
Miss Kringle.

724
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:14,539
I just noticed something really weird.

725
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:16,574
Oh?

726
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:23,915
This note Officer Dougherty left for me...

727
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:26,885
The first letter of every
line spells out your name.

728
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:30,822
You see?

729
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:33,725
N, Y...

730
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:36,628
G...

731
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:39,030
M, A.

732
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:40,699
Yes.

733
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:43,101
How, that... How-How odd.

734
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:47,105
What-What a... What
an amazing coincidence.

735
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,442
- Coincidence?
- What else could it be?

736
00:37:52,511 --> 00:37:54,379
So you know nothing about this?

737
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:55,680
I... Me? No.

738
00:37:55,715 --> 00:37:57,182
No.

739
00:37:57,216 --> 00:38:00,752
No.

740
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,921
Huh.

741
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:21,873
(laughing quietly)

742
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:25,477
<i>DOUGHERTY: You're the
guy that likes riddles.</i>

743
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,579
Why are you laughing,
you fool? It's not funny.

744
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:29,447
What a creep.

745
00:38:29,482 --> 00:38:31,816
She'll keep digging.

746
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,219
Why did you have to leave a clue? Why?

747
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:36,721
Relax.

748
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:39,057
What can she find? What can she prove?

749
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:41,159
Nothing. There's no body. Stop worrying.

750
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:44,496
But she looks so sad and angry.

751
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,131
I hate it when she looks at me that way.

752
00:38:46,165 --> 00:38:47,165
<i>KRINGLE: Menacing and weird.</i>

753
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,267
- Please.
- Like it matters,

754
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:51,002
like you stand a chance with her.

755
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,470
She knows how you feel about her and she

756
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:54,339
<i>treats you like dirt. Treats you like dirt.</i>

757
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,841
I don't care, I still love her.

758
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,178
Oh, listen to yourself. Be a man!

759
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,646
(laughing)

760
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,149
You'll do better with that one
if she's a little scared of you.

761
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:06,351
<i>- Stop talking like that.

(helicopter flying over, siren wailing)

768
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,950
Beautiful, huh?

769
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:41,164
I'm gonna miss this town.

770
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,954
You won't change your mind?

771
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:47,358
- The town needs you.
- No.

772
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:51,396
Gotham needs a lawman now.
Not a criminal like me.

773
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:54,699
A strong lawman.

774
00:39:57,837 --> 00:39:59,304
You looking at me?

775
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:02,574
Someone needs to grab this city
by the neck and shake it hard.

776
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,576
That's you, Jim.

777
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,245
I know it in my bones.

778
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,747
There's a lot of powerful men

779
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,015
who would disagree with you on that.

780
00:40:16,188 --> 00:40:18,189
Nice knife, huh?

781
00:40:25,698 --> 00:40:27,232
That was your father's.

782
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:29,934
He gave it to me a long time ago.

783
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,170
A spur-of-the-moment
birthday gift.

784
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:33,705
I said no.

785
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,507
Such a beautiful knife,

786
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:38,510
and I have men with guns to protect me.

787
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:40,412
He said take it.

788
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:43,415
A knife is a good friend
when you have no other.

789
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,584
You were that close.

790
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:49,421
At one time.

791
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,861
The point of the story, Jim...

792
00:40:56,896 --> 00:41:00,165
Your father was the most
honest man I ever met.

793
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,268
But he carried a knife.

794
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,584
<i>ALFRED: Enough searching, Master B.</i>

795
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:21,619
<i>There's nothing here.</i>

796
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:26,257
Now, your father was a good man,

797
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:28,393
a flawed man, like anyone else.

798
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:29,961
Doesn't mean he had a secret life.

799
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:32,230
My intuition's nearly always correct.

800
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:34,132
Yeah, well.

801
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:36,801
It's a common delusion, I find.

802
00:41:38,471 --> 00:41:41,573
Arkham's full of men whose
intuitions are always correct.

803
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:44,976
There are none so blind.

804
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,450
None so blind.

805
00:41:53,953 --> 00:41:56,354
Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius!

806
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,822
What about him?

807
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,192
He was a Roman emperor.

808
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,495
Yes, well, I'm fully aware
of that, Master Bruce.

809
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:05,897
And a stoic. I think I
remember he was a stoic,

810
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:09,000
like my father.

811
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:11,536
Lucius Fox called my father a stoic.

812
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,973
Lots of people are called stoic.

813
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:16,975
Basically means a
hardnut. Doesn't say much.

814
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:18,543
Doesn't mean it's a bloody clue, does it?

815
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,980
It's a philosophy,
Alfred. It's a way of life.

816
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:25,683
Maybe... Maybe that as
well, I suppose, but...

817
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:29,621
Ah!

818
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:30,855
Oh...

819
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,964
What is it, do you think?

820
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,166
I don't know and I don't care,

821
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,567
and don't you dare
press that bloody button.

822
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,637
Why not? It could be a bomb.

823
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:48,072
Alfred, that seems improbable.

824
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,714
It's a stereo.

825
00:42:57,816 --> 00:42:59,317
