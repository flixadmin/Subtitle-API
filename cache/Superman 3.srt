1
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,523
Next!

2
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,524
Name?

3
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,026
Gus Gorman.

4
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,036
Ah, yes.
August Gorman.

5
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,539
Have you looked
for work this week?

6
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,541
Uh...yes.

7
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,042
What kind?

8
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,043
Uh...

9
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,045
Kitchen technician.

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,547
Dishwasher?
Any luck?

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,549
A little, but...

12
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,553
Mr. Gorman, you've been 
unemployed for 36 weeks.

13
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,554
No, it's 35.

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,556
Not counting this week.

15
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,058
You secured employment
last June

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,560
As a messenger
and were discharged

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
After one day
for losing--

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,564
No, no, they said
I lost it.

19
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,065
I did not lose it.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,567
It was stolen
by a pickpocket.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
A television set?

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,572
A teensy-weensy Japanese
2-inch television set.

23
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,574
The only other
employment you found

24
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,077
Was in a fast food
joint which lasted...

25
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,079
28 Minutes?

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,581
That's some record.

27
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,082
Talk about fast!

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,587
They expect you
to learn stuff in one day.

29
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,588
Hold the lettuce!

30
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,589
Hold the ketchup!

31
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,590
Can I have some sauce?

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,592
2 Buns! No buns!

33
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,594
Cheese! No cheese!

34
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,097
The city of Metropolis
is generous to a fault.

35
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,099
I'm not the fault!

36
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,601
36 Weeks of
chronic unemployment,

37
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,103
Living off the taxes of
hard-working citizens.

38
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,105
Do you know
what you are?

39
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,608
I'm not a bum!

40
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,109
You are...

41
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,111
I was about to say,

42
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,113
No longer eligible.

43
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,615
No longer--

44
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,616
Next!

45
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,618
I need this week!

46
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,119
Next!

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,121
You mean that's it?

48
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,123
Finished? Like, over?

49
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,125
Huh!

50
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,628
Next!

51
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,629
Next.

52
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,131
Next as in "bye."

53
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,633
Next!

54
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,137
Name?

55
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,140
Excuse me, brother,
can I have a light?

56
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,702
Say thank you.

57
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,204
Wow!

58
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,724
Way to go, Superman!

59
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,302
Computer: your drink
is on its way.

60
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,305
Uh, sir?

61
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,307
Excuse me, but...

62
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,809
What if you want to--

63
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,311
Enjoy your drink!

64
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,314
Program 2 bilateral
coordinates at once?

65
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,316
You can't do that.

66
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,817
But if you--

67
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,320
Computer technology
is very advanced,

68
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,822
But it can't do that.

69
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,825
But if we can't
do it that way...

70
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,826
Sir?

71
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,333
Good lord!

72
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,336
How did
you do that?

73
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,837
I don't know.

74
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,839
I just did it.

75
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:44,691
Who's this?

76
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,193
That's him,
ross webster,

77
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,694
Just after he
received the award

78
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,696
For humanitarian
of the year.

79
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,698
Oh, he is
good-looking!

80
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,700
I gave him
F-2 at 1/50th.

81
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,202
One thing
I don't understand

82
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,704
Was the point of the story
lois wrote

83
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,207
Is how this ross webster
got this great honor.

84
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,209
And you bring me
one picture of him

85
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,711
And 15 pictures
of this other person.

86
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,712
Who is she?

87
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,714
Lorelei ambrosia.
She's webster's--

88
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,716
She's just webster's.
Let's leave it at that.

89
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,218
Who's this
other woman?

90
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,720
That's his sister Vera.

91
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,222
Picture looks fuzzy.

92
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,723
The picture's fine.

93
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,225
She looks like that.

94
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,727
She's vice president
of Webscoe Industries.

95
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,729
I don't understand you.

96
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,730
A boring banquet,

97
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,732
And you bring me
3,000 boring pictures.

98
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,734
Superman saves a man
from drowning

99
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,736
On 3rd avenue,

100
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,739
And you don't
get one picture!

101
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,740
I didn't
have my camera!

102
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,244
A photographer eats
with his camera,

103
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,745
Sleeps
with his camera.

104
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,247
I'm glad I'm a writer.

105
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:44,751
Time to draw
the jingo number.

106
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,255
The prize is
a south American trip!

107
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,756
I don't know why--

108
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,258
Morning,
everybody.

109
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,259
Hi, Clark.

110
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,762
Jimmy, you've got
mustard on your lapel.

111
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,264
Mr. White, I hate
to interrupt--

112
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,267
I'm getting
a paper out!

113
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,269
Stick to
the printing press.

114
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,770
What's the number?

115
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,272
"53."

116
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,774
Mr. White?

117
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,276
53!

118
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,280
You've got to pull
3 more numbers.

119
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,782
Mr. White,
what do you think?

120
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,285
I don't know.

121
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,787
I think it would make
a terrific story.

122
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,290
What's a terrific story?

123
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,792
Kent's high school
class reunion.

124
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,794
Say!

125
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,796
Could we have
the next number?

126
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,299
It's practically
an American institution.

127
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,301
Most of
my classmates

128
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,303
Are still
in high school.

129
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,308
"33."

130
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,811
I thought the story
would be about--

131
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,313
33!

132
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,316
How much small
towns have changed.

133
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,819
Can I go back
to middle America

134
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,822
After having become
a Metropolis sophisticate?

135
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:00,327
I was looking around
in my closet last night

136
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,829
And I even found...

137
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,831
My high school sweater.

138
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,336
Uh...Smallville.

139
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,839
So should I make
my travel plans?

140
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,841
What about mine?

141
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,342
All right, Kent.

142
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,345
The prodigal son
is coming home.

143
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,347
Gee, thanks, Mr. White.

144
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,352
It's hard losing one
of my best reporters.

145
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:26,854
Oh, that's OK.

146
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,856
But you deserve
the vacation, lois.

147
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,357
Thank you.

148
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,361
Lois, are you
going someplace?

149
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:38,365
Some people get
to go to Smallville.

150
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,368
Others of us
have to go to...

151
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,369
Bermuda.

152
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,871
Golly.

153
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,373
Bye.

154
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,375
Have a good time.

155
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,378
Mr. White,
the next number, please.

156
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:55,883
Well, I guess
I'd better be going, too.

157
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,385
So...I'll be going.

158
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,890
Bye.

159
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,603
Couldn't
a computer do this?

160
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,627
Hey, what is this?

161
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,128
First paycheck?

162
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,130
First rip-off, man.

163
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,133
I'm supposed
to get 225 a week.

164
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,637
How am I supposed
to live on 143.80?

165
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,640
State tax, federal tax,
social security.

166
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,643
You'll get money
when you're 65.

167
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,144
When I'm 65?

168
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:53,649
I want mine now,
while I can enjoy it.

169
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:56,151
I want to get down!

170
00:12:56,652 --> 00:13:02,157
It's more like
$143.80 and 1/2 cent.

171
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,159
There are always
fractions left over

172
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,661
In big corporations,

173
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,162
But they
round it down.

174
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,164
What am I supposed
to do with 1/2 a cent?

175
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,667
You mean everybody
loses those fractions?

176
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,669
They don't
exactly lose them.

177
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,170
You can't lose
what you never got.

178
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,173
So the company
gets it?

179
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,176
Not really.
They can't be bothered.

180
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,679
Then what
happens to them?

181
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,682
They're just floating
around out there.

182
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,684
The computers
know where.

183
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,185
How many sugars?

184
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,688
One and a half.

185
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,697
It's quitting time.
You coming?

186
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:46,201
I've got some stuff
to finish up, so...

187
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,703
Working
overtime, huh?

188
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:51,206
What you doing,
looking for a raise?

189
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:55,210
Yeah.
Looking for a raise.

190
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,229
That's it.

191
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,582
You bet.

192
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:43,091
But my uncle Al
won't eat her stuffing.

193
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,093
He says it should be cooked
outside the turkey.

194
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,096
She cooks it on
the inside of the turkey.

195
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,599
Aunt helen,
my father's half sister--

196
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,101
I told you that,
right?

197
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,604
Yeah. Hey,
look at that.

198
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,106
Wow!

199
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:13,121
Turn back or pull over
here and wait.

200
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,122
For how long?

201
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,124
I don't know.

202
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,127
That fire's spreading
like wild...fire.

203
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,629
It's just
a building burning.

204
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,131
That's a chemical plant.

205
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,134
You know what I mean,
it's like chemicals.

206
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,636
If that goes
up in smoke,

207
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,138
We'll be in for
a hairy time around here.

208
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,641
OK.

209
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,142
Distract these people

210
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,145
So they don't know
what I'm doing.

211
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,647
What are you doing?

212
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:43,652
The chief says a photographer
always goes after a story.

213
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,154
That could
be dangerous.

214
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,658
Danger goes with
the territory, Mr. Kent.

215
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,703
How can I help?

216
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,704
Get this man
a helmet.

217
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,207
Oh, it's you.
Forget the helmet.

218
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,208
How bad is it?

219
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,709
It's a nightmare.

220
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,212
Everything's explosive,
inflammable, or worse.

221
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,218
Get me a number 3
ladder truck in here!

222
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:52,221
My god,
they're trapped!

223
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,724
What's he going to do,
fly them down one at a time?

224
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,744
Let's go!
Everybody down here!

225
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,746
Hurry up!

226
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,753
Go on down.
Take it easy.

227
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,757
All right,
everybody down.

228
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,796
You've got to
get out of here.

229
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,298
I cannot leave.

230
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:12,301
I've got to
look after those.

231
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,303
That's concentrated
beryltric acid.

232
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:17,306
If it heats
over 180 degrees,

233
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:20,809
This fire will
look like a picnic.

234
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,313
If it remains
stable, no problem.

235
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,816
If it heats up,
it'll turn volatile.

236
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,318
If that happens,
you'll get a cloud

237
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,820
That'll eat
through anything--

238
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,822
Steel, concrete, anything.

239
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,835
Who the hell's that?

240
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,837
Get off of there!

241
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,341
I'll just get
a couple more shots.

242
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:01,850
Oww!

243
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,852
Ahhh!

244
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:10,359
Have them bring
their hoses here! Quickly!

245
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:15,864
Help!

246
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,366
Help!

247
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:19,368
Help me!

248
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,870
Help!

249
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,872
Somebody help me!

250
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,874
Help!

251
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,876
Superman!
It's my leg.

252
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,378
Take it easy.

253
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,880
We'll go nice and easy.

254
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,883
All right?
Here we go.

255
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,890
Medics!
Over here, please!

256
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,892
That's it.
Here you go.

257
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,894
It's the left leg.

258
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,396
My camera.

259
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,397
Yeah.

260
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:52,401
It's a clean break
across the fibula.

261
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:53,902
Ow! My camera.

262
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,904
It's all right, Jimmy.

263
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,406
You'll be OK.

264
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:02,744
Get that fire out, or
you'll have an acid cloud!

265
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,750
Christ!
The pumphouse is gone!

266
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,252
The pumphouse!

267
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,753
We've lost
the water pressure!

268
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,755
We've got
to have water!

269
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,758
Lake canoga's
5 miles from here!

270
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,260
Where's this lake?

271
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,263
That way.

272
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:32,774
You told me we had
an adequate water supply.

273
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,354
That man's a miracle.

274
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,008
Carol, you got gorgeous!

275
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,010
?? Tell Tchaikovsky
the news??

276
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,513
?? I've got a rockin'
pneumonia??

277
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:29,016
?? I need a shot
of rhythm and blues??

278
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,018
?? Whoo??

279
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,519
?? I think I'll
call in all the writers??

280
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,022
?? Written down
by the rhythm reviews??

281
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,525
?? Roll over,
Beethoven??

282
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,527
?? Rockin' in
two by two??

283
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,032
I'll never forget it.

284
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:48,035
Fourth quarter,
score was tied.

285
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,038
We were back on
our 25-yard line.

286
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,541
The coach calls for
right flanker option.

287
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,043
?? Roll over, Beethoven??

288
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,045
?? Rocking in
two by two??

289
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,054
You really
have grown, Clark.

290
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,056
You look very well.

291
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,557
I can't complain.

292
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:14,061
I have these
little spells,

293
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,563
But, really,
I can't complain.

294
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,565
?? Well, early
in the morning??

295
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,067
?? I'm a-giving you
the warning??

296
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,570
?? Don't you step on
my blue suede shoes??

297
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,073
?? Hey, diddle-diddle,
I will play my fiddle??

298
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:28,075
Excuse me.

299
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,077
There's someone
I'd like to see.

300
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:33,080
?? And tell Tchaikovsky
the news??

301
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,581
Lana?

302
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,084
Lana lang?

303
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,586
It's great
to see you.

304
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,088
You look
wonderful.

305
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,589
You look...wow!

306
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,091
Here, let me.

307
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,593
Oh, no, no.
I can manage.

308
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,096
Uh...

309
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,599
Isn't this
your first visit

310
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,101
Since your mom
passed away?

311
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,103
Yeah--I'm sorry.

312
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,104
Um...

313
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:01,608
I heard that you
and donald split up.

314
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,610
Did you eat yet?

315
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,611
No.

316
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,113
I beg your pardon.

317
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,615
Excuse me. Sorry.

318
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,619
That's not right.

319
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,121
You're right about
donald and me,

320
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:17,124
But hold this
a second, OK?

321
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,625
Oh, sure.

322
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,128
Hi, Kent.

323
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,630
Oh, hi.
How you...doing?

324
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,632
I'm sorry.

325
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,634
I'm going nuts.
Thanks.

326
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,635
?? Well, early
in the morning??

327
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,637
?? I'm a-giving you
the warning??

328
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,139
Clark.

329
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,141
Yeah.

330
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,143
Hey, Lana.

331
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,645
Uh-oh. Um...

332
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,147
Hey, sweet.

333
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,648
Here I am.

334
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,651
Remember when
you were prom queen?

335
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,653
Everyone wanted
to dance with you.

336
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,156
There's only one guy
on your dance card now.

337
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,657
That's good old--

338
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,159
Brad Wilson.

339
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,660
Hi, brad.

340
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,663
Hi, Kent.
Long time no see.

341
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,665
You know, see. See?

342
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,167
Come on, Lana.

343
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,169
I can't.

344
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:03,670
Clark already asked me.

345
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,671
I did?

346
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,173
Oh, excuse me.

347
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:09,176
Lana, I haven't danced...

348
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,180
?? Roll over,
Beethoven??

349
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,682
?? Roll over,
Beethoven??

350
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,185
?? Stick to these
rhythm and blues??

351
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,192
?? Oh-oh-oh-oh??

352
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,193
?? Wa-a-a??

353
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,195
?? Oh-oh-oh-oh??

354
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,697
?? Earth angel??

355
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,200
?? Earth angel??

356
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,703
?? Will you be mine???

357
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,206
?? My darling dear??

358
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:42,709
?? Love you
all the time??

359
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,712
?? I'm just a fool...??

360
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,722
Ah, Gorman.

361
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,724
Another week,
another check.

362
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,228
Don't you have
another one for me?

363
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:04,231
I put in a voucher
for expenses.

364
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,732
What?

365
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,736
Oh, yeah, yeah.

366
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,238
Here you go.

367
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,250
Woooh!

368
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,253
A-hem.

369
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,262
Thanks for
helping me out.

370
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,265
A lot of guys would like
to be where I am.

371
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,766
You'd be surprised
how many offers

372
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,268
I didn't get.

373
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,769
Even brad wouldn't
stick around for this.

374
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,271
It isn't easy.

375
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,774
The streamers?
Just pull, and they...

376
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,776
Not the streamers.
Everything.

377
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,778
I don't know why,

378
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,782
I feel like
I can talk to you.

379
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:56,783
What?

380
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,785
I feel I can
talk to you!

381
00:26:58,785 --> 00:26:59,786
You can?

382
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:00,787
Yes.

383
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,789
You know
something, Lana?

384
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,791
What?

385
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,293
I, Uh...

386
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,296
I always wished
that you would.

387
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:13,300
Remember when you
were queen of the prom?

388
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,304
3 years after
the royal wedding,

389
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,305
The king abdicated.

390
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:19,806
Isn't that terrible?

391
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,308
Yeah, it sure is.

392
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,310
There must be
a gallon

393
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,812
Of potato salad
left over.

394
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,815
You know what
the problem is?

395
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,317
Too much mayonnaise?

396
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,818
Donald loved mayonnaise.

397
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,820
Why would you think
that was the problem?

398
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,322
The problem is,

399
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,823
Why do I stay
in Smallville?

400
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,826
Do you know
how lucky you are

401
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,828
To live in Metropolis,

402
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,330
The big apricot?

403
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,831
Lana, you could--

404
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,334
How? And what
about ricky?

405
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,836
Ricky?

406
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,337
My little boy.

407
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,339
You have...
That's great.

408
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,342
Here we have a house,
and I've got a job.

409
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,845
I'm only a secretary,
but it pays the bills.

410
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,346
Except for last winter

411
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,849
When the fuel bills
kept going up and up.

412
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:05,352
I had to pawn
my diamond ring.

413
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,854
That's a shame.

414
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,362
You never got married?

415
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:18,365
Me?

416
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,867
Yeah.

417
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,369
Well, I was...

418
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,371
No. Not.

419
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,881
You know,
years later,

420
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:37,384
You can look at
someone and think,

421
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:40,387
"That's the one
that got away."

422
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,892
Give me that again.

423
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,394
Run it by me
just one more time.

424
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,896
$85,000.

425
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,397
Missing?

426
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:51,899
Embezzled,
Mr. Webster.

427
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,901
Stolen
from the firm.

428
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,403
By whom? That's
what I want to know.

429
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,406
Vera, get a hold
of yourself!

430
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:01,909
Nobody else
ever will.

431
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,911
I don't know, who?

432
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,913
In the old days,
it was simple.

433
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:08,415
We kept books,

434
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,917
We had ledgers,

435
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,418
We knew what
was paid out.

436
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,922
A robber carried
a gun and said,

437
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,423
"Stick 'em up."

438
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,426
Now these blasted computers
do their dirty work.

439
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:21,428
My old friend,

440
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,930
You are yesterday.

441
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,433
Whoever pulled this 
caper is tomorrow.

442
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,935
Honey bunch?

443
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:30,437
Mr. Webster, it's time
for your massage.

444
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,439
Does she have the right
to burst in--

445
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,942
No, no, Vera, Vera!
Simpson, you know

446
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,443
My psychic
nutritionist?

447
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,444
Hello.

448
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:40,447
We're trying to hold
a meeting here!

449
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,950
Hold your breath instead.

450
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,953
Maybe you'll turn blue.
Ha! Improvement.

451
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:48,455
I'm about to
take a human life!

452
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,958
Simpson, would you
excuse us, please?

453
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:55,462
Tell her I won't
to stop-- let her--

454
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,464
Mouths closed.
Ears open.

455
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,465
She's a pig!

456
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,467
I can't have
anyone with me

457
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,969
Who isn't with me.

458
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,470
Now...

459
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,972
Simpson,

460
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,473
Well, old chum,
what now,

461
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,975
Kiss the 85 thou
goodbye?

462
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:10,978
Keep paying
the thief his salary

463
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,981
Until he thinks up more ways
to shake the money tree?

464
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:16,984
He'll slip up
sooner or later.

465
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:17,985
Why?

466
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,988
They say that
in the movies.

467
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,990
He won't slip up.

468
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,492
He'll keep
a low profile.

469
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,995
He won't do a thing

470
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,497
To call attention
to himself.

471
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:31,999
Unless, of course,

472
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,502
He is a complete
and utter moron.

473
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,062
We're first.
Um...Andrew.

474
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,063
I'll pick chris.

475
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:57,065
Um...mark.

476
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,067
I'll take Jamie.

477
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,069
We're stuck 
with ricky?

478
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,071
You lost
the toss.

479
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,073
Come on, ricky.

480
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,575
Come on, ricky.

481
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,076
Good luck.

482
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,578
I can't stand this.

483
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,579
He'll be OK.

484
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,080
I was a late
bloomer myself.

485
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,583
It's not just that
he's small for his age.

486
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:18,587
He's the only kid
in town without a father.

487
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,589
Look, he's stewed
to the gills

488
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,591
In the middle
of the afternoon.

489
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,093
He only had
chocolate milk.

490
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,094
I mean him.

491
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,095
Hey, sweet thing.

492
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,096
Kid getting
hassled, huh?

493
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,098
Kent, you still here?

494
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,100
I seem to be.

495
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,104
The kid needs pointers
from the champ here.

496
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:39,107
I won the all-country
bowling championship.

497
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,609
I didn't
know that.

498
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:42,611
Actually, I can play
any sport.

499
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,112
Brad, you'll just
make it worse.

500
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,615
Clark, he'll
make it worse.

501
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,624
Watch. He'll get
a spare.

502
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:57,626
Come on, ricky.

503
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:00,128
Hey, kid, you're
holding it all wrong.

504
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,631
I'll show you.

505
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,132
Uh, brad...

506
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,635
I think he'll
be better off

507
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,137
Doing it his way.

508
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,641
You got a big
mouth, Kent.

509
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:14,643
Ricky doesn't need
a bowling lesson

510
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,144
In front of
the other kids.

511
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:17,145
He needs a man
to show him.

512
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:18,647
He's doing fine
on his own.

513
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,148
Excuse me.

514
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,151
Here you go.

515
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:26,655
Give it
your best shot.

516
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:30,158
Oh! Sorry.

517
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,166
Ah-choo!

518
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:47,676
Gesundheit.

519
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,178
Thank you.

520
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,472
Hey, gus.

521
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,974
The boss wants
to see you.

522
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,976
He can see me
from here.

523
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:57,477
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

524
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:00,981
Not that boss.
The boss.

525
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,983
You you mean the boss?

526
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:03,984
Yep.

527
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,986
Wants to see me?

528
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:09,489
Why would
he want to see me?

529
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:10,991
Why would the boss

530
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,993
Want to see me?

531
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,996
There's no reason.

532
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:18,999
Oh, I know!

533
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:22,002
My suggestion for
the volleyball uniforms.

534
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,504
That's it.

535
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,517
Ross the boss.

536
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,018
Ross the boss.

537
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,020
Bossy ross the boss.

538
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,524
Be calm, be cool,
be collected.

539
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,527
OK, uh...

540
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,529
Mr. Web--Mr. Webster?

541
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,532
Mr. Webster?

542
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:54,034
Mr. Webster, I did not...

543
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,036
Mr. August Gorman?

544
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:58,038
Aah! Sir!
August Gorman here.

545
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,541
I know you're
a compassionate man.

546
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,543
I don't want
to go to jail

547
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:06,046
Because there's
robbers and rapists--

548
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,548
Just one question.

549
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,550
You've been
a naughty guy,

550
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,051
Haven't you?

551
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:12,553
Come on, admit it.

552
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:15,055
You've been
a little bit naughty.

553
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,056
I was--

554
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,058
That's all right,
I understand.

555
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:21,061
I can--what do
young folks say?

556
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:24,064
"Dig where you're
coming from, brother."

557
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:27,067
You want
to be rich, right?

558
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,068
Well, I...

559
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:29,069
I was born rich.

560
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,071
Never worn
the same socks twice.

561
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,073
What do you do
with your socks?

562
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,575
They're laundered

563
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:37,578
And sent to some
charitable institution.

564
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:40,581
Maybe they're turned
into dust rags

565
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:42,583
Or something like that.

566
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,084
Or maybe socks.

567
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:47,087
Yes. That never
occurred to me.

568
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,089
Gus, you know
something?

569
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,591
You're a genius.

570
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:52,092
A naughty genius,

571
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:53,594
But nobody's
perfect.

572
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:54,595
Cheers!

573
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,597
Because of the thing
with the computers.

574
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,600
Because computers
rule the world today,

575
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,102
And the fellow
that fools computers

576
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,605
Can rule the world.

577
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:07,107
I've been searching
for a long time

578
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,109
For somebody to make
these machines do

579
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,612
What they're not
supposed to do.

580
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,113
Understand?

581
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:14,114
Yes!

582
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,617
Webscoe, the Webscoe
industrial complex,

583
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:18,619
Is a family-owned
cartel.

584
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,120
Little
magnesium here,

585
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,122
Little zinc there.

586
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:23,624
You follow me?

587
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:24,625
I follow you.

588
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,127
You know
what I want now?

589
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,128
No.

590
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,630
I want coffee.

591
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,632
Black?
Cream or sugar?

592
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:33,133
You don't
understand.

593
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,135
Under different
company names,

594
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,137
I control the price
of coffee beans

595
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,639
In Venezuela, Brazil,
Bolivia, Jamaica,

596
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,641
And the republic of gabon.

597
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:42,142
But I've got a problem,

598
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,144
And I think
you can help me.

599
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,647
One country
won't play ball.

600
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,148
That can bug a guy.

601
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:49,650
That could bug...

602
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,151
What country?

603
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:53,153
Colombia.

604
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,655
Colombia!

605
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,657
Colombia has 2
important exports.

606
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,158
One is coffee.

607
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,161
I've tried
to reason with them.

608
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:03,664
But this one
miserable country

609
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:07,167
Thinks
it can dictate

610
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,669
The economy
of an open market.

611
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,170
Gus...

612
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,672
Gus, my friend,

613
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,675
We're going to teach
them a lesson,

614
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,176
Aren't we?

615
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:17,678
Mr. Webster...

616
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:20,180
Destroy the Colombian
coffee crop

617
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:23,183
Right down
to the last bean.

618
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,686
The last bean?
We are?

619
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:28,188
But you got so much.

620
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:29,189
You know--

621
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,191
A wise man said--

622
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:33,193
I think it was
Attila the Hun--

623
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:36,196
"It is not enough
that I succeed.

624
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,198
Everyone else
must fail."

625
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,700
Seems fair.

626
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,701
Gus.

627
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:41,702
What?

628
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:46,206
You are going
to do this for me.

629
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,709
How?

630
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,210
The weather.

631
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,714
You didn't tell me
your mother was here.

632
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,716
I'm his baby sister.

633
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:59,219
Gus, have you ever
heard of Vulcan?

634
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,721
Hi, miss Vulcan.

635
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,223
Vulcan is
the weather satellite

636
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,225
That's monitoring
the weather.

637
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,228
If somebody were
to reprogram it,

638
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:09,730
It could do more.

639
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,231
It could make weather.

640
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,734
Storms and floods.

641
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,235
Blizzards,
heat waves.

642
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:16,737
How do you do that?

643
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:20,240
Like everything
in the 20th century,

644
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:21,742
You push buttons.

645
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,243
There you go.

646
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:26,747
It's the first time
I've won anything.

647
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:28,248
You won my hand.

648
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:29,750
This is
the first time

649
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,251
I won anything
valuable.

650
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,754
Get one with
the sombreros.

651
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:36,757
Mr. White,
you be in this.

652
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:38,759
Do I have to?

653
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:39,760
Why do I?

654
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,761
You're lucky
I didn't fire you.

655
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:42,763
I get a chance
to get exclusive pictures

656
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,765
Of the biggest chemical
factory fire in history,

657
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,266
And he comes home
with a broken leg

658
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,769
And 12 melted
rolls of film.

659
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,270
It was hot.

660
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,272
Smile,
Mr. White.

661
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,275
South America.
What luck!

662
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:58,779
If you don't want
to be traced,

663
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:02,282
Punch in to some
rinky-dink outfit

664
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,785
That has
a mickey-mouse computer.

665
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:07,788
Someplace you can
sneak into, right?

666
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,291
Someplace where
nobody knows him

667
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,794
So they can't
connect him with us.

668
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,796
Webscoe has
112 subsidiaries.

669
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,297
They're all linked

670
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,800
Into the central
computer system.

671
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,803
How about
someplace...small?

672
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:25,806
Smallville!

673
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:27,307
This is Smallville.

674
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:30,310
We'll have
a 5-minute stop.

675
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:33,313
Watch your step, please.

676
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:34,815
Thanks, selma.

677
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,317
Have a good day.

678
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,323
Let me
help you, Lana.

679
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:46,326
Oh, I'm sorry.

680
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,831
Thanks, Clark.

681
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:52,332
Sit down, buster.
Good boy.

682
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:53,834
Come on,
buster.

683
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:55,335
Sit down!

684
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:56,837
All set? Great.

685
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,342
Wow.

686
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:14,354
That's it, OK?

687
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:19,234
Jesus Christ!

688
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:25,741
Don't they have
picnics in Metropolis?

689
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:28,744
Not like this,
ricky.

690
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,245
We do this a lot.

691
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:31,747
You do?

692
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,249
Stay close
and be careful.

693
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,751
OK, mom.

694
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,252
Come on, buster.

695
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:39,755
Let's find
a rabbit.

696
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,256
This is nice
for him.

697
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:42,758
It's even nicer

698
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:44,760
When there's
a man around.

699
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,261
There's a lot
of choices.

700
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,763
All the good
ones are married.

701
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:48,764
That's why
brad thinks

702
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:50,265
He's god's
gift to women.

703
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:53,769
He won't take no
for an answer.

704
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:57,773
I meant there's a lot
of choices here.

705
00:39:57,773 --> 00:39:59,775
This is some picnic.

706
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:01,276
There's some of that...

707
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,279
And...mmm!
Green stuff.

708
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,782
And...hey, pat?.

709
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:12,287
Boy, this pat?
Is really unusual.

710
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:13,789
I didn't make pa--

711
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:15,290
Oh, Clark.

712
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,292
That's buster's
dog food.

713
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:19,795
It's good.

714
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,296
Don't eat it!

715
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:22,798
This is nice.

716
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:23,799
Here.

717
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:25,801
It's all right, Lana.

718
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:27,803
Thanks.

719
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,807
Hey!
Where you going?

720
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:33,308
Come on! Buster!

721
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:38,313
How long--
I was thinking--

722
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:40,816
Sorry. Go ahead.

723
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,317
You.

724
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,321
Well...

725
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,826
I was thinking
somebody like you

726
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:53,328
Could do well
in Metropolis.

727
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:54,830
I have to face it.

728
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,331
I'm not going to
find what I want

729
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:59,334
In Smallville
anymore.

730
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:02,337
Could I make it
in Metropolis?

731
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,339
What would I do?

732
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,843
Call me.

733
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:09,845
I wouldn't want to.

734
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:12,347
Wouldn't want
to call me?

735
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,350
I wouldn't want
to be a nuisance.

736
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,854
You couldn't
be a nuisance, Lana.

737
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:22,858
Clark, may I
tell you something?

738
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,363
My oil pan
is leaking.

739
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:35,871
See? There's
something dripping.

740
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,372
You need a hand?

741
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:39,374
No, thanks.

742
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:41,376
I studied up
on auto repair.

743
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:43,879
Look at this.

744
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,882
Oh, boy.

745
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,910
Lana, I'll go see
if ricky's all right.

746
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,911
You OK?

747
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:16,912
Yeah.

748
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,462
Gosh!
Is he all right?

749
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:15,971
Hi.

750
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:20,976
Superman?

751
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,477
That's me.

752
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,982
Mom! Mom!

753
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:30,485
Ricky!

754
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:33,488
Have him checked
by a doctor.

755
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:35,490
Thank you.
I'm Lana lang.

756
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:36,992
This is ricky.

757
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,493
This is Clark.

758
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,997
I have to be going.
So long, ricky.

759
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,501
We were flying!

760
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:47,503
What were you doing?

761
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:49,004
Looking for buster.

762
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:50,506
Buster!

763
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:52,007
I found him!

764
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,509
Buster!

765
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,011
Mr. Kent?

766
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:57,513
Superman was here!

767
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:58,514
What?

768
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,015
He really was.

769
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:01,642
Aren't you excited?

770
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,143
I'm from Metropolis.

771
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:05,646
I see Superman
every day.

772
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:06,647
You do?

773
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:09,650
Could you get me
his autograph?

774
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,154
If I had a nickel
for every time...

775
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,179
What do you want?

776
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:41,181
We're in big trouble.

777
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:42,182
What?

778
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:45,686
First of all,
they lost the invoice,

779
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:49,690
Then realized they were 
short on some items.

780
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,193
I rented a car because
I missed the plane.

781
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:57,698
Had a flat tire
on the highway.

782
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:01,201
Had to fix it myself
with these pinkies.

783
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:05,205
I figured your boss
would be real peeved.

784
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,207
What are you
talking about?

785
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:10,711
He'll hang our butts
against the wall.

786
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:13,213
He wanted this order
installed

787
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:15,215
No later than tomorrow.

788
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:17,718
I got to set up tonight.

789
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,219
Get what set up?

790
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,731
Pal, you're a real
lifesaver.

791
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,733
I mean
a real lifesaver!

792
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,234
Where's the office?

793
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:35,736
Straight ahead.

794
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:36,737
Follow me.

795
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,238
Right behind you.

796
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,740
Oh, yeah.

797
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,241
Not bad.

798
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,743
Pretty good.

799
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:45,245
Do you know
what's wrong

800
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:47,247
With this
Singapore wing?

801
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:49,750
Sling.
Singapore sling.

802
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,252
What's wrong
with it?

803
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:54,254
There's not
enough vodka.

804
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,757
There's no
vodka in it!

805
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,759
What did
I tell you?

806
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:01,261
Put some vodka
in it.

807
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:02,763
What did you...

808
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,264
You know, hey...

809
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:11,772
There's vodka
in it now, buddy.

810
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:17,277
Yeah.
Yeah, perfect.

811
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:19,279
You never pass out,
do you?

812
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:20,280
Nope.

813
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:25,285
Never.

814
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:28,288
Cowboy's down, buddy.

815
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:31,291
You thought
I was drunk, too,

816
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:32,793
Didn't you?

817
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,294
Ha ha! Fooled you.

818
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:35,796
Get the keys.

819
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,637
Yeowww!

820
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:53,146
Some...some...
Somebody's drunk.

821
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:56,650
I'm not drunk.

822
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:03,156
Hello, baby.

823
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:04,658
Hello, baby.

824
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:06,159
OK.

825
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,161
All right.

826
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:10,163
Let's get down to it

827
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:12,165
And let's do it.

828
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:15,669
One, two,
button your shoe.

829
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,675
Then put it in...

830
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:33,687
Both keys...

831
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:36,190
At the same time?

832
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,691
Ho ho!

833
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:51,705
Wait. Wait a minute.

834
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:54,708
You think you've won,
don't you?

835
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,211
The philly flash.

836
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:02,216
Vroom! Vroom!

837
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,221
Vroom! Vroom!

838
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:50,264
OK...ready?

839
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:52,766
1...

840
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:53,767
2...

841
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,269
3!

842
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,821
Yeah. Now...

843
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:09,324
We'll see
what we'll see.

844
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:30,906
Oh!

845
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:35,410
Oh...

846
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:47,422
Oh.

847
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:30,257
Come on.
Please let me in.

848
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:34,261
There it is!

849
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:35,762
Hello. Now!

850
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:37,764
Getting down to business.

851
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:42,269
I am a genius.

852
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,273
I am a...

853
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,283
Um...longitude.

854
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:59,786
And the other thing...
Latitude, right?

855
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,304
Oh, look, Morey.

856
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,805
A native wedding.

857
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:36,823
I arriba!

858
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:47,835
They never told us
this was the rainy season.

859
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:26,373
Newscaster:
meteorologists are baffled

860
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,376
By the tornado
and torrential rainstorms

861
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:31,378
That struck Colombia
this afternoon,

862
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:33,881
Threatening to destroy
the nation's coffee crop

863
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,383
For the next 5 years.

864
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,885
Gale-force winds
up to 250 miles an hour

865
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:41,388
Have lashed
the countryside,

866
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:43,390
While 12 inches
of rainfall

867
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:46,393
Have been recorded
in one day.

868
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,061
A spokesman from cal tech

869
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:51,565
Said this was the most
awesome display of--

870
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:53,066
Turn it off!

871
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,068
If I laugh harder,

872
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:57,070
I'll split my sides.

873
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,573
...Seems to defy
all laws of weather systems

874
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:01,575
Known to science.

875
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,081
Poor little Colombia.

876
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:11,585
Well.
Ha ha ha ha!

877
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:22,095
Ooh! I'll get you
for that,

878
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:23,597
You big silly!

879
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:27,100
Bubba, do you realize
what we're on to?

880
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,104
Do I? Every time
a drunk sobers up,

881
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:32,606
He'll drink
webster coffee.

882
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:34,107
Why stop at coffee?

883
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:37,611
Coffee gets
the world off to work.

884
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:40,614
But what keeps
the world working?

885
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:42,616
Diet soda?

886
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:44,618
Vera, you mean...

887
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:46,119
You mean--

888
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,622
Today, coffee...

889
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:51,124
Tomorrow, the oil!

890
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:52,125
Oil?

891
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:54,628
If gus Gorman can push
the right buttons--

892
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:57,130
I can have it all.

893
00:54:57,631 --> 00:55:00,634
All the oil,
all the pumps,

894
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:02,636
All the tankers.

895
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,137
This is some
nifty idea, Vera.

896
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:05,138
Boss!

897
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,140
Just the man
I want to see.

898
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:10,143
It is not my fault.

899
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:12,145
What's
not your fault?

900
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:14,648
Superman started
doing his thing

901
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:17,150
When you started
doing yours.

902
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:19,653
What are you
talking about?

903
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:21,154
What am I--

904
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:23,657
It was on
television, man.

905
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:25,659
Don't call me man.

906
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:28,662
I saw Colombia
bite the dust.

907
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:32,165
You didn't see the man
flying out of the sky

908
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:34,668
With his cape
flapping in the...

909
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:42,176
His cape was
flapping in the wind.

910
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:45,679
He was flying!
He was great! Wooshhh!

911
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,183
His cape blew
in the wind like this,

912
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:52,186
And he landed
in the middle

913
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:54,188
Of this big plantation.

914
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:58,192
He checked everything out
with his x-ray vision.

915
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:00,694
Then he put laser beams

916
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:03,697
Out of his eyes
onto everything.

917
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:05,199
Bzzzz!

918
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:07,201
And guess what?

919
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,703
Dried up everything,
just like that!

920
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:11,205
Dried it up

921
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:13,707
Like machines
in men's rooms,

922
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:17,211
You know, where
the hot air comes out?

923
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:19,213
Sometimes
they don't work.

924
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:20,714
But Superman's worked.

925
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:23,717
And you think he took bows?

926
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:26,720
No, sir.
He flies off again!

927
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,223
He saw what
caused the trouble

928
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:31,225
And flew
into the tornado,

929
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:35,229
Went down to the bottom
of the tornado,

930
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:37,231
And turned it
upside down!

931
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:40,234
I thought
I'd go crazy!

932
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:43,237
I've never seen
anything like it!

933
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:46,740
The big end was
on the bottom.

934
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,244
The little end
was on the top.

935
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:52,246
Mr. Ross, it was...

936
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,250
Superman's bad.

937
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,752
I'll say he was.

938
00:56:58,752 --> 00:57:01,255
I mean, he was bad!

939
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:02,256
No.

940
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:03,257
No!

941
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:04,258
No!

942
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:06,260
Let me help.

943
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,263
It was a perfect plan,
foolproof!

944
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:10,764
We were the fools.

945
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:13,267
It's not my fault.

946
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:14,768
I did what I was
supposed to do.

947
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:16,270
He ruined it.

948
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:19,273
The lousy do-gooder
ruined it.

949
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:23,777
Now he'll stick his nose
into my oil scheme

950
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:25,779
And ruin that, too.

951
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,782
I've got to
get rid of him.

952
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:31,285
But how,
shoot him?

953
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:32,786
Kryptonite.

954
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:33,787
What?

955
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:36,790
Or Kryptonham...

956
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,292
Or Kryptonheimer?

957
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:41,295
There's stuff that
can hurt Superman.

958
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,297
How would you know?

959
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:44,798
I know some things.

960
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:48,302
So I understand from
the graffiti I've seen.

961
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:49,803
She's right.

962
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:52,806
Kryptonite! I remember
reading about it.

963
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:54,308
Where does
it come from?

964
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:55,809
The same planet
Superman came from--

965
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:56,810
Krypton.

966
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:00,314
Where is Krypton?

967
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:02,316
It blew up in space
many years ago.

968
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:05,819
They sent Superman here
when he was a baby.

969
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:06,820
I know some things, too.

970
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,821
Wait a minute.

971
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:11,825
You know what happens
when a planet explodes--

972
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:14,328
Debris, things
floating in space.

973
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:18,332
We have to find out
where in heaven Krypton was

974
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:21,835
And have gus contact
the Vulcan satellite.

975
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:23,837
Gus has
been thinking.

976
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,839
That's why
I keep you around.

977
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,842
I'm thinking I'm not
making enough money

978
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:30,344
For this gig.

979
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:32,846
Gus...

980
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:36,350
If there's anything
I hate, it's greed.

981
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:39,853
Greed? Mr. Ross,
just a minute.

982
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:41,855
Let me tell
you something.

983
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:43,357
I can't ski!

984
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:44,358
Ahhhhh!

985
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:48,862
Ahhhhh!

986
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:53,867
Ohhhhhh!

987
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:11,218
Ohh!

988
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:18,225
Ross: once gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite,

989
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:20,727
He orders it
to search outer space

990
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:23,730
Around where Krypton
went bye-bye.

991
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,741
The laser probe

992
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,243
Locks onto a chunk
of Kryptonite.

993
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:38,245
The computer analyzes
the components,

994
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:42,749
And the lab
duplicates the stuff.

995
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:44,751
Unknown?

996
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,753
Unknown?

997
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:05,772
What the hell?
They don't smoke it.

998
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:14,781
Mr. White can't
be disturbed.

999
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,784
After all,
he is the editor.

1000
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:19,286
Where is he?

1001
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,288
He'll pay for this.

1002
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:23,790
It's not
Mr. White's fault.

1003
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,793
Get out your wallet,
Mr. Editor!

1004
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,295
Good morning.

1005
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:30,297
Don't "good morning" me!

1006
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:34,301
"Old relationships suddenly
seem very much the same.

1007
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:36,803
"The prettiest
girl in school..."

1008
01:00:38,305 --> 01:00:41,308
"Is still the prettiest
girl in school."

1009
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:45,812
Hello.

1010
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:48,315
Hello?
Oh, hi, Clark.

1011
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,317
Lana! Hi.

1012
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:53,820
I was just
thinking about you.

1013
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,824
Oh! Listen, I have
a problem with ricky.

1014
01:00:57,824 --> 01:00:58,825
Why? What's wrong?

1015
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:02,829
It's the autograph
you got from Superman.

1016
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,331
He told the kids

1017
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:07,334
Superman's coming for
his birthday Wednesday.

1018
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:11,338
When Superman doesn't
show up, it's going to...

1019
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,340
Well, in this case,

1020
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:16,844
I think I can
speak for Superman.

1021
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:18,345
We're pretty close.

1022
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:22,349
Tell ricky Superman
will be there on Wednesday.

1023
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:26,353
Well, he'll get the best
home-cooked meal

1024
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:29,356
He's had
in a long time.

1025
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:32,359
Tell Superman we think
he's wonderful.

1026
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:34,361
But, Clark...

1027
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:36,363
You're the best.

1028
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:42,870
I'll take it to
the supreme court.

1029
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,372
It wasn't our fault.

1030
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:47,875
It was
an act of god.

1031
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,376
In a church?

1032
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:04,892
Hey, here's that
compound you ordered.

1033
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:08,395
Can't imagine
what you want with it,

1034
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:10,397
But you got it.

1035
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:17,404
What the hell
am I afraid for?

1036
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:18,906
I'm from earth.

1037
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:25,746
Lana, I really wasn't
expecting all this.

1038
01:02:25,746 --> 01:02:28,749
I guess they
got carried away.

1039
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:43,764
Superman...

1040
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:45,766
We all know

1041
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:48,268
That you're not
looking for honors,

1042
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:51,271
But when we heard

1043
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,273
You were coming
to see ricky,

1044
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:55,776
We realized this
was our chance

1045
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:57,778
To thank you

1046
01:02:57,778 --> 01:03:00,280
For putting
out the fire

1047
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,784
And for saving
little ricky.

1048
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:06,286
Since you already
have the key

1049
01:03:06,286 --> 01:03:07,287
To our hearts,

1050
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:08,789
Superman...

1051
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:10,290
May I present you

1052
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,794
With the key
to the city?

1053
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,295
Thank you, sir.

1054
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:16,797
Thank you.

1055
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,301
Thank you.

1056
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:38,485
As you were!

1057
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:42,990
Now, listen up!

1058
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:46,493
I just came directly
from the pentagon,

1059
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,495
And you better believe

1060
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:51,999
There's a damn
good reason I did.

1061
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:54,001
Because god's given us

1062
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:59,006
One of the greatest gifts
in the world--

1063
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:01,008
Chemicals!

1064
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:07,014
You like to sit in church
on Sunday, don't you?

1065
01:04:07,014 --> 01:04:11,018
You like to sit
and watch the super bowl.

1066
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:12,519
Sit on what?

1067
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:18,525
You sit on
molded plastic seats--

1068
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:23,530
Molded to your
well-fed behinds!

1069
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:27,534
I don't have
to tell you

1070
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:30,537
That America leads
the world in plastics.

1071
01:04:30,537 --> 01:04:35,542
We cannot afford
a chemical plastics gap!

1072
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:37,544
Now, listen to me.

1073
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:40,047
Do you want

1074
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:43,050
Our president
of the united states

1075
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:47,554
Sitting down
to write a peace treaty

1076
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:51,058
And have his
ballpoint pen bust open

1077
01:04:51,058 --> 01:04:54,561
And ink run
all over his pants

1078
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:56,063
In front
of world leaders?

1079
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:00,067
Now we all know

1080
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:02,069
That last week,

1081
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:04,571
Half of this
great nation

1082
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:06,573
Almost bit the bullet,

1083
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:10,077
If it wasn't
for this man here.

1084
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:11,078
Yay!
Yay!

1085
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:13,080
All I can say

1086
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,083
Is thank the lord
for Superman.

1087
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:19,586
Yay!
Yay! Yay!

1088
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:24,591
Superman,
you saved our bacon,

1089
01:05:24,591 --> 01:05:28,095
And I'd like to
show our gratitude.

1090
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:34,101
This is a small token
of our appreciation

1091
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:38,605
For saving us from
a chemical plant disaster.

1092
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,112
Thank you.

1093
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:47,614
Thank you
very much, general.

1094
01:05:47,614 --> 01:05:50,117
It's very nice.
Thank you.

1095
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:02,129
It's very nice.

1096
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:13,140
How do I know
what "unknown" means?

1097
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,643
Unknown means nobody
knows what it is.

1098
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:18,145
Hello, boss?

1099
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:19,646
Gus Gorman here.

1100
01:06:19,646 --> 01:06:21,148
I know that.

1101
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:23,150
How did it go?

1102
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:26,653
You know how they're
trying to find the recipe

1103
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:28,155
In that chicken
in the bucket,

1104
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:29,656
And nobody knows
the ingredient

1105
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:33,660
Because it's unknown?

1106
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,164
Well, in Kryptonite,
there's an unknown element,

1107
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:38,165
And Superman didn't die.

1108
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:40,667
He didn't die.

1109
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:43,670
I asked you
to kill Superman,

1110
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,672
And you're
telling me

1111
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:49,176
You couldn't do that
one simple thing?

1112
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:53,180
Uh...

1113
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,681
Hello?

1114
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:56,683
Hello.

1115
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:10,531
He hasn't had
a nap for years.

1116
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:14,034
This was a big day. 
Thank you.

1117
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:16,537
Thank you for that
wonderful lunch.

1118
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:19,540
I do like to cook.

1119
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,542
You'll take coffee,
won't you?

1120
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:23,043
Yes, please.

1121
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:24,545
Decaffeinated,
of course.

1122
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:25,546
Right.

1123
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,552
Hello?

1124
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:33,053
Yes.

1125
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:35,556
What?

1126
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:37,057
Really?

1127
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:39,560
Yeah, yeah.
He's here.

1128
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,062
I'll tell him.
Bye-bye.

1129
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:44,064
That was my
friend betty.

1130
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:46,066
There's been an accident.

1131
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:48,569
A truck crashed
through the river bridge.

1132
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:50,070
It's hanging off
the side of the bridge,

1133
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,573
And the driver's
still in the cab.

1134
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:55,075
I hate to rush you.

1135
01:07:55,576 --> 01:07:56,577
There's no rush.

1136
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:58,579
But the bridge.

1137
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,081
I always get
there on time.

1138
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:02,583
Let's relax.

1139
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:18,599
It's unusual finding
a good-looking girl

1140
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,602
Like you
alone like this.

1141
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,612
Listen, um...

1142
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:34,114
Shouldn't you
do something

1143
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:35,616
About the bridge?

1144
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:37,618
What bridge?

1145
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,124
You're right.

1146
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:49,630
I have to
get going.

1147
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:00,641
Get him
out of there!

1148
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:02,643
Get him out, quick!

1149
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:05,145
That thing's
going to go.

1150
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:22,162
Everybody OK?

1151
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:24,665
What can I do?

1152
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:26,166
Nothing, now.

1153
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,669
If only you'd
gotten here sooner.

1154
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,950
Stronzo, Superman!

1155
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:47,456
"At a special session
of the general assembly,

1156
01:10:47,456 --> 01:10:49,958
"178 Countries voted
to censure Superman

1157
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:52,461
With only
Colombia abstaining."

1158
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:55,464
I can tell you
one thing.

1159
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:57,966
He wasn't so
mean and nasty

1160
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,468
In Smallville.

1161
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:00,969
He was so nice,

1162
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:04,973
I hated laying that
big chunk of...

1163
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:05,974
Kryptonite!

1164
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:07,476
Don't you see?

1165
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:11,480
That stuff wasn't
a complete failure after all.

1166
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,483
After gus
gave it to him,

1167
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:16,985
He became
an evil, selfish--

1168
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:17,986
A normal person.

1169
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:19,488
Now that Superman

1170
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:22,491
Is out of the nice guy
business...

1171
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:23,992
We can work 
on that oil.

1172
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:27,496
Ha ha ha...

1173
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:50,519
Announcer: and now,
the supreme moment

1174
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:52,521
As the last runner,

1175
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:54,022
The one
given the great honor

1176
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:56,525
Of lighting
the ceremonial flame

1177
01:11:56,525 --> 01:12:00,028
Runs the last leg
of a marathon

1178
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:02,030
That began 7 days ago,

1179
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,032
As this torch
was passed

1180
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:06,034
From athlete to athlete

1181
01:12:06,034 --> 01:12:08,537
For 970 miles

1182
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,038
Across the country.

1183
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:54,041
How can he say
pure categories

1184
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:56,543
Have no meaning
in transcendental logic?

1185
01:12:56,543 --> 01:12:58,045
What about
synthetic unity?

1186
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:02,049
Hi, honey.
Am I in your way?

1187
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:03,050
Stick around.

1188
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,051
You might
learn something.

1189
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:06,053
Hi, Lorelei.

1190
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:09,056
Oil tankers are
controlled by computers.

1191
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:12,059
Computers tell them
where to go

1192
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:14,561
And where
to deliver oil.

1193
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:16,563
Don't they
have captains?

1194
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:19,566
Yes, but they
don't need them.

1195
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:21,568
It's sentimental
seafaring baloney.

1196
01:13:21,568 --> 01:13:23,570
You'll command
the tankers

1197
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:26,573
To sail toward
a 50-mile area

1198
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:27,574
In the Atlantic.

1199
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:29,076
And do what?

1200
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:32,079
And do nothing.

1201
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:34,081
Just sit there.

1202
01:13:34,581 --> 01:13:38,085
How will the people
get their oil?

1203
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:42,089
You catch on fast,
old buddy.

1204
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,093
Every oil pump
in America

1205
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:47,594
Is run by--

1206
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:49,096
Computers,
I know!

1207
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:50,597
Stop interrupting!

1208
01:13:50,597 --> 01:13:52,099
I'm sorry.

1209
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:54,601
You will command
the pumps

1210
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:56,103
To stop pumping.

1211
01:13:56,103 --> 01:14:00,607
Then I want you to program
one special command

1212
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,609
Into all these systems.

1213
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:05,612
Tell them these orders
are irreversible

1214
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:07,614
So it will be
impossible for anyone

1215
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:09,616
To switch them back.

1216
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,618
Can you do
this for me, old buddy?

1217
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:14,121
Old pal?

1218
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:24,131
You get your way
all the time.

1219
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:26,633
And it's not right.

1220
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:31,638
When do I
get a taste?

1221
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:38,145
I think you've already

1222
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:41,148
Had a taste of freedom,
haven't you?

1223
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:44,651
Or would you
prefer jail?

1224
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:46,653
You can't run
that jail number anymore.

1225
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:50,157
I mean more
to you out here

1226
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:52,159
Doing things for you

1227
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,162
Than sitting in jail
doing nothing for nobody.

1228
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:58,665
I see.
What do you want?

1229
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:06,673
A wastebasket?

1230
01:15:06,673 --> 01:15:08,175
No.

1231
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:09,676
These are plans.

1232
01:15:09,676 --> 01:15:12,179
Blueprints.

1233
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:13,180
For what?

1234
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,681
A computer.

1235
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:17,684
You've already
got computers.

1236
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:21,188
There's not a computer
like this anyplace.

1237
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:23,690
It doesn't exist.

1238
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:25,192
We have to build it.

1239
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:27,194
What will it do?

1240
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:29,196
Anything I tell it.

1241
01:15:29,696 --> 01:15:31,698
What will it do for me?

1242
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:37,204
Anything you tell me
to tell it to do for you.

1243
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:43,710
Tell me.

1244
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:45,712
First of all,

1245
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:48,215
If anyone attacks
this machine,

1246
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:50,717
The computer
counter-attacks them.

1247
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:54,721
It finds their weaknesses
and wipes them out.

1248
01:15:55,222 --> 01:15:57,724
Right. You deal
with my oil,

1249
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:01,228
And I'll build you
your machine.

1250
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:05,732
OK, I'll do it,

1251
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:10,237
But I'm not sure about
this irreversible business.

1252
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:29,756
All kinds of--
what the hell?

1253
01:16:32,759 --> 01:16:35,762
That's it.
The last tanker.

1254
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:38,765
They're all mine now.
All mine.

1255
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:40,267
Yay!

1256
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:41,768
Not quite.

1257
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:43,270
Hmm?

1258
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:46,773
What's that in the upper
middle quadrant?

1259
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:48,275
It's a tanker.

1260
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:52,946
And it's going
the wrong way.

1261
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:04,958
Skipper, there it is again.

1262
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:07,961
"Proceed immediately
to latitude 30 north

1263
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:10,464
"Longitude 45 west.

1264
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:12,466
There await
further orders."

1265
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:15,469
That's the middle
of the Atlantic.

1266
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:16,970
I'm not going there

1267
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:19,973
Just to await 
further orders!

1268
01:17:20,474 --> 01:17:22,976
We're supposed
to go to Metropolis,

1269
01:17:23,477 --> 01:17:26,480
And we're going
to Metropolis.

1270
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:39,993
That's where she is.

1271
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:42,996
Get it up there!

1272
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:44,498
Miss!

1273
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:47,000
Miss, can you
hear me?

1274
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,505
We're here
to help you!

1275
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:52,506
Do not jump!

1276
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:55,509
I repeat,
do not jump!

1277
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:57,511
Thought you'd
never get here.

1278
01:17:57,511 --> 01:18:00,514
Don't expect
me to save you.

1279
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:02,516
I don't
do that anymore.

1280
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:05,519
I'm long past saving.

1281
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:14,027
Well...don't let me
keep you from anything.

1282
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,530
I'm in no rush.

1283
01:18:21,535 --> 01:18:24,538
What did you
have in mind?

1284
01:18:24,538 --> 01:18:26,039
Lots of things.

1285
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,541
Oh, yeah?

1286
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,042
Ah!

1287
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:30,043
Ooh!

1288
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:32,546
Do me one
favor first.

1289
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:35,549
What's that?

1290
01:18:35,549 --> 01:18:37,551
Well...

1291
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:39,553
There's this
little boat,

1292
01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:41,054
And it's
not going

1293
01:18:41,054 --> 01:18:44,057
Where it's
supposed to go.

1294
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:22,095
Man: stop all engines!

1295
01:19:23,597 --> 01:19:26,099
Stop all engines!

1296
01:19:31,605 --> 01:19:35,609
The third
and fourth tank!

1297
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:19,653
Hi.

1298
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:38,672
How about a little
aprs ski?

1299
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:50,184
Champagne?

1300
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:13,207
Aah!

1301
01:21:13,207 --> 01:21:16,210
Take your turn
like anybody else!

1302
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,711
Fred! Stop it!

1303
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:22,716
He's coming
over here, Martha!

1304
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:26,720
Ooh! Ooh!

1305
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,222
Don't you do that!

1306
01:21:29,723 --> 01:21:31,225
Oh!

1307
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:32,726
Please!

1308
01:21:37,731 --> 01:21:40,234
Hit him with
your handbag!

1309
01:21:43,237 --> 01:21:44,738
Please help me!

1310
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:47,741
Somebody's beating up
my husband!

1311
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,743
Jack,
go with her.

1312
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:51,245
Third one today.

1313
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:53,247
At night,
it's worse.

1314
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:54,748
Somebody's
behind this.

1315
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:57,751
You can't tell me
there's no oil

1316
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,753
And that someone's
not getting rich off this.

1317
01:21:59,753 --> 01:22:01,255
Someone's always
getting rich.

1318
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:02,756
And you know who suffers?

1319
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:04,258
The small guy.

1320
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:08,262
Radio: the east coast gets
the brunt of the spill.

1321
01:22:42,296 --> 01:22:44,798
Guys,
take that in here.

1322
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:53,807
No, I cannot go out
with you tonight.

1323
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:55,309
I'm busy
tomorrow night, too.

1324
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:57,311
Doing what?

1325
01:22:57,811 --> 01:22:59,313
I'll think
of something.

1326
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:01,315
I got to go.

1327
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:02,816
Ricky needs me.

1328
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:06,320
Brad, please
stop calling!

1329
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,821
Listen to me.

1330
01:23:07,821 --> 01:23:10,824
You better
appreciate brad.

1331
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:12,826
What else you
got in Smallville?

1332
01:23:18,332 --> 01:23:21,835
What else have I got
in Smallville?

1333
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:25,339
I think I got
the right answer.

1334
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:27,341
So do I.

1335
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,350
Smallville airport.

1336
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:39,853
What flights do you
have to Metropolis?

1337
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,021
Mmm.

1338
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,523
Mmm.

1339
01:23:44,525 --> 01:23:47,027
Where do I put this?

1340
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:48,529
Over there. 
There.

1341
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:51,031
Where do
you want this?

1342
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:53,033
Put it up there!

1343
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:56,537
Are you kidding?

1344
01:23:56,537 --> 01:23:59,039
I'm not
going in there.

1345
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,562
Hey! Hey!

1346
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:32,072
Just leave
him alone.

1347
01:24:53,594 --> 01:24:55,095
I can't get through.

1348
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:56,597
There's something
happening.

1349
01:24:56,597 --> 01:24:58,098
Look!
Superman's drunk!

1350
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:00,100
I want to see
what's happening.

1351
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,101
Ricky! Ricky!

1352
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:02,603
Ricky!

1353
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:06,106
Thank you.

1354
01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:07,608
It's a disgrace.

1355
01:25:07,608 --> 01:25:09,610
Nobody'll trust
that creep again.

1356
01:25:14,615 --> 01:25:17,618
What are you
looking at? Huh?

1357
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:19,620
Excuse me, Superman,

1358
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:21,622
It's me, ricky.

1359
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:23,624
Ricky from Smallville.

1360
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:25,626
Say you won't
hurt anybody!

1361
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:27,127
Ricky, he's changed!

1362
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:29,630
Maybe he's
just sick.

1363
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,632
Superman, please
get better!

1364
01:25:31,632 --> 01:25:34,134
He's not listening
to you.

1365
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:35,636
Yes, he is.

1366
01:25:35,636 --> 01:25:37,638
He's got
super hearing.

1367
01:25:37,638 --> 01:25:40,140
Superman, you're
just in a slump!

1368
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,643
You'll be
great again!

1369
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:44,144
Do it, Superman!

1370
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:46,146
Superman, you
can hear me,

1371
01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:47,648
Can't you?

1372
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,651
Superman, you're
just in a slump!

1373
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:52,653
You'll be
great again!

1374
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:55,155
You can do it,
Superman!

1375
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:58,158
Superman, you
can hear me.

1376
01:25:58,325 --> 01:25:58,825
You're just
in a slump.

1377
01:25:59,326 --> 01:26:00,827
I know
you can...

1378
01:26:01,328 --> 01:26:03,830
You can do it,
Superman.

1379
01:26:10,838 --> 01:26:13,340
Aaaaaahhh!

1380
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:16,343
Aaaaaahhh!

1381
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:18,345
He's gone nuts!

1382
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:20,848
Come on!

1383
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:45,432
Ha ha ha ha!

1384
01:27:45,933 --> 01:27:49,937
I can give
as good as I get.

1385
01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:53,440
Yeah? All right.

1386
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,442
Come on! Come on!

1387
01:28:21,468 --> 01:28:23,971
Too warm for you, huh?

1388
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:25,472
Huh?

1389
01:28:26,473 --> 01:28:27,975
Come on, chicken!

1390
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:29,977
Come and get me.

1391
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:31,478
Get up!

1392
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:44,992
Aah!

1393
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:46,493
Aah!

1394
01:28:52,499 --> 01:28:55,502
You always wanted
to fly, Kent.

1395
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:57,004
Now's your chance.

1396
01:33:50,672 --> 01:33:52,674
Skipper!

1397
01:34:06,688 --> 01:34:09,691
Would you
look at that?

1398
01:34:55,904 --> 01:34:58,407
Ross: Lorelei ambrosia
isn't at home,

1399
01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:02,411
But if you care
to leave a message,

1400
01:35:02,411 --> 01:35:05,414
Why not deliver it
to her in person?

1401
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:09,918
So you've finally
shown your true colors.

1402
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:12,421
If you're
looking for us,

1403
01:35:12,421 --> 01:35:14,923
Here's where
you'll find us.

1404
01:35:14,923 --> 01:35:16,425
Do drop in.

1405
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:23,932
These are fun!

1406
01:35:23,932 --> 01:35:25,934
Fun? The fun's
just starting.

1407
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:28,437
Wait till
Superman finds us.

1408
01:35:28,937 --> 01:35:30,439
Then you'll see fun.

1409
01:35:30,939 --> 01:35:32,441
You're going to
mess with Superman?

1410
01:35:32,941 --> 01:35:34,443
I want to be ready

1411
01:35:34,943 --> 01:35:36,445
When he
falls into our trap.

1412
01:35:36,445 --> 01:35:40,949
Why can't you
balloon down like us?

1413
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:41,950
Oh...

1414
01:35:42,451 --> 01:35:43,952
No way.

1415
01:35:43,952 --> 01:35:47,956
I don't believe
a man can fly.

1416
01:36:04,973 --> 01:36:06,975
Gee! Watch out,
horsie!

1417
01:36:16,485 --> 01:36:17,986
No! Don't, don't!

1418
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:20,489
Just don't
try to fly.

1419
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:22,991
Don't try to fly.

1420
01:36:34,503 --> 01:36:36,004
Hey there!

1421
01:36:36,505 --> 01:36:39,007
Get out of my way.

1422
01:36:57,025 --> 01:36:58,527
Hurry!
Here we are!

1423
01:36:59,027 --> 01:37:00,529
I am hurrying.

1424
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:06,535
I can't
see anything!

1425
01:37:07,035 --> 01:37:08,537
Turn on the light.

1426
01:37:09,037 --> 01:37:10,539
Where's
the light switch?

1427
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:13,542
Where do you
usually find it?

1428
01:37:14,042 --> 01:37:15,043
Oh! It's
pitch black!

1429
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:17,045
Ooh,
that's better.

1430
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:22,551
Wow! What
a jukebox!

1431
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:25,554
I told you,
didn't I?

1432
01:37:25,554 --> 01:37:28,056
There!
The ultimate computer.

1433
01:37:35,063 --> 01:37:37,065
It does everything
a normal computer can do

1434
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:39,568
And a thousand things
none of them can do.

1435
01:37:39,568 --> 01:37:41,570
Let's give it
a dry run.

1436
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:42,571
We've got to
wait for gus.

1437
01:37:42,571 --> 01:37:44,072
Who needs gus?

1438
01:37:44,072 --> 01:37:48,076
He's the only one
who can operate it.

1439
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:50,579
I know enough
about computers

1440
01:37:50,579 --> 01:37:52,581
To put a ph.d.
To shame.

1441
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:57,085
You didn't think
I'd let him run the show.

1442
01:37:57,085 --> 01:38:01,089
Peons never tidy up
when they're done working.

1443
01:38:01,089 --> 01:38:02,591
Come on, Bubba,
it's showtime.

1444
01:38:05,093 --> 01:38:06,595
Engage those buttons

1445
01:38:07,095 --> 01:38:09,097
To activate
the alpha circuit

1446
01:38:09,598 --> 01:38:10,599
And unlock
the modular grid.

1447
01:38:11,099 --> 01:38:12,601
You!
Activate circuits

1448
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:15,604
29 Through W-7

1449
01:38:16,104 --> 01:38:18,106
And start full
power coordinates

1450
01:38:18,106 --> 01:38:19,608
On exterior
defensive systems.

1451
01:38:20,108 --> 01:38:22,611
In other words,
push this red button.

1452
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:26,114
How did you
know about that?

1453
01:38:42,589 --> 01:38:44,091
He's here!

1454
01:38:44,091 --> 01:38:46,593
Let's give him
something to worry about!

1455
01:38:48,095 --> 01:38:50,097
Now let's see...

1456
01:38:50,097 --> 01:38:52,599
Tracking systems locked.

1457
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:20,627
Let the games begin!

1458
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:23,130
Don't tense up,
honey.

1459
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:53,160
Nearly!

1460
01:39:55,162 --> 01:39:58,165
Come on, Bubba,
you're wasting rockets!

1461
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:07,174
Come on,
Superman!

1462
01:40:08,175 --> 01:40:11,178
Let him have
it, ross!

1463
01:40:16,683 --> 01:40:19,186
Bubba,
keep firing.

1464
01:40:19,686 --> 01:40:22,189
I'll get
the M-X ready.

1465
01:40:48,715 --> 01:40:51,718
What the hell
is going on?

1466
01:40:52,219 --> 01:40:54,221
Yo! Hyah! Whoa!

1467
01:40:59,726 --> 01:41:01,228
Keep your rockets coming!

1468
01:41:01,228 --> 01:41:03,730
He won't notice the missile
until it's too late.

1469
01:41:11,238 --> 01:41:13,740
So much for your
catlike reflexes.

1470
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:25,252
God!

1471
01:41:27,254 --> 01:41:28,255
Aha!

1472
01:41:33,468 --> 01:41:34,970
Oh! Oh!

1473
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:36,972
No! No more!

1474
01:41:36,972 --> 01:41:38,974
Look! You sit!

1475
01:41:38,974 --> 01:41:39,975
Sit!

1476
01:41:39,975 --> 01:41:40,976
Sit!

1477
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:45,981
Help!

1478
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:46,982
Hello!

1479
01:41:47,482 --> 01:41:48,483
Git, you jackass!

1480
01:41:48,984 --> 01:41:50,986
That's him out of the way!

1481
01:41:51,486 --> 01:41:53,488
Now, sister,

1482
01:41:53,488 --> 01:41:54,990
Would you
like to control

1483
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:56,491
All the world's
weapons systems?

1484
01:41:56,491 --> 01:41:59,995
Baby! It's daddy!

1485
01:41:59,995 --> 01:42:03,498
What are you doing
with my baby?

1486
01:42:03,498 --> 01:42:05,000
Gus, old buddy genius!

1487
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,002
Come join the fun!

1488
01:42:18,514 --> 01:42:20,015
He's still coming!

1489
01:42:20,015 --> 01:42:22,518
Arm the inner defenses!

1490
01:42:26,522 --> 01:42:28,524
Webster,
the game's over.

1491
01:42:28,524 --> 01:42:30,025
Hi, honey.

1492
01:42:30,025 --> 01:42:32,027
I don't know you.

1493
01:42:33,028 --> 01:42:35,030
But the other night...

1494
01:42:37,533 --> 01:42:39,535
I'm sorry.
That wasn't me.

1495
01:42:39,535 --> 01:42:41,537
That guy's gone.

1496
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:44,540
You're next, webster!

1497
01:42:46,041 --> 01:42:48,544
Never underestimate
the power of computers.

1498
01:42:48,544 --> 01:42:51,046
How do you like it?

1499
01:42:51,046 --> 01:42:53,549
It's typical of you.

1500
01:42:53,549 --> 01:42:57,052
All you four want
is to help yourselves.

1501
01:42:57,052 --> 01:42:59,054
"Four...of you"?

1502
01:42:59,555 --> 01:43:00,556
You mean us...
Four?

1503
01:43:00,556 --> 01:43:01,557
Wait!

1504
01:43:01,557 --> 01:43:03,559
Oh, hey, man!

1505
01:43:03,559 --> 01:43:06,562
That's only
his last name.

1506
01:43:07,062 --> 01:43:07,563
Call him
Superman.

1507
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:11,066
See, I'm not
with them, Superman.

1508
01:43:11,066 --> 01:43:13,068
You could
have fooled me.

1509
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,078
That's very good.

1510
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:29,084
Let's see how long
he can carry on without air.

1511
01:43:50,564 --> 01:43:53,066
He's going to get me!

1512
01:43:53,066 --> 01:43:54,568
Don't bet on it!

1513
01:44:04,077 --> 01:44:06,079
No! No...
Ahhh...

1514
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:08,582
You're hurting him.

1515
01:44:08,582 --> 01:44:09,583
Ah!

1516
01:44:12,085 --> 01:44:13,587
That's Kryptonite!

1517
01:44:13,587 --> 01:44:16,089
This time
we got it right!

1518
01:44:16,089 --> 01:44:17,090
You're a genius.

1519
01:44:17,591 --> 01:44:18,091
You've invented
a machine

1520
01:44:18,592 --> 01:44:21,595
That finds
anybody's weak spot.

1521
01:44:21,595 --> 01:44:24,097
You'll go down
in history

1522
01:44:24,598 --> 01:44:27,100
As the man
who killed Superman.

1523
01:44:27,601 --> 01:44:28,101
I'm--no.

1524
01:44:28,602 --> 01:44:30,103
Superman!

1525
01:44:30,604 --> 01:44:31,104
No!

1526
01:44:31,605 --> 01:44:34,608
Wait a minute!

1527
01:44:35,108 --> 01:44:35,609
Turn the power up!

1528
01:44:36,109 --> 01:44:38,111
He's had
enough power.

1529
01:44:41,615 --> 01:44:43,116
Turn it up!

1530
01:44:43,116 --> 01:44:45,118
Power! More power!

1531
01:44:56,129 --> 01:44:58,131
Ah! Oww!

1532
01:45:06,139 --> 01:45:07,140
OK...75.

1533
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:09,643
37, Then 75.

1534
01:45:10,644 --> 01:45:12,646
Please...

1535
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:16,149
There's a current
level of 7.

1536
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:18,151
It's not
supposed to be...

1537
01:45:18,652 --> 01:45:20,654
There it is!

1538
01:45:23,156 --> 01:45:25,158
Shh! Shh!

1539
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:47,681
What's going on?

1540
01:45:47,681 --> 01:45:50,684
I don't know.
The power's gone.

1541
01:45:50,684 --> 01:45:52,686
Gus pulled
the plug out!

1542
01:45:53,187 --> 01:45:55,689
It works.
It works!

1543
01:45:55,689 --> 01:45:57,191
I got it!

1544
01:45:57,691 --> 01:46:00,194
I got it!
I got the...

1545
01:46:00,194 --> 01:46:01,195
I...Ooohhh...

1546
01:46:01,195 --> 01:46:03,197
What have
you done?

1547
01:46:03,197 --> 01:46:04,198
Ohhhh...

1548
01:46:04,198 --> 01:46:05,699
Give me that.

1549
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:07,201
This screw?

1550
01:46:07,201 --> 01:46:08,702
That screw.

1551
01:46:08,702 --> 01:46:09,703
Never.

1552
01:46:13,707 --> 01:46:16,210
Hey! I can't see!

1553
01:46:42,444 --> 01:46:44,446
Holy...

1554
01:46:44,446 --> 01:46:47,449
No! Make it stop!

1555
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:50,452
It's out of control!

1556
01:46:50,452 --> 01:46:51,954
But how?

1557
01:46:51,954 --> 01:46:53,956
Where's the power
coming from?

1558
01:46:56,959 --> 01:46:58,460
It's feeding itself.

1559
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:00,963
It wants to live!

1560
01:47:23,485 --> 01:47:24,987
What's this here?

1561
01:47:24,987 --> 01:47:27,489
We'll go to the zoo.

1562
01:47:27,489 --> 01:47:28,991
Then we'll go--

1563
01:47:29,992 --> 01:47:31,493
What's happening?

1564
01:47:31,493 --> 01:47:32,995
It's OK, ricky!

1565
01:47:32,995 --> 01:47:34,496
Turn the lights on!

1566
01:47:54,016 --> 01:47:57,019
Stop it!
You're killing him!

1567
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:00,022
Don't! Stop!

1568
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:09,531
Yeah!

1569
01:48:12,034 --> 01:48:13,535
Put me down!

1570
01:48:30,552 --> 01:48:33,555
Don't leave us
alone, Superman!

1571
01:48:37,059 --> 01:48:38,352
I get it.

1572
01:48:38,352 --> 01:48:39,853
The coaxial shaft

1573
01:48:39,853 --> 01:48:42,856
Is endangering
the grid source factor.

1574
01:48:42,856 --> 01:48:45,359
We're through, frogface.
I'm splitting!

1575
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:46,860
Wait a minute!

1576
01:48:48,862 --> 01:48:50,364
Hey, girls!

1577
01:48:50,364 --> 01:48:51,865
Girls! Come on!

1578
01:48:57,371 --> 01:48:57,871
Sis!

1579
01:48:58,372 --> 01:48:59,873
Oh! Help me!

1580
01:49:02,876 --> 01:49:04,878
Sis!

1581
01:49:10,384 --> 01:49:11,885
Sis?

1582
01:49:14,888 --> 01:49:16,890
Oh, my god!

1583
01:49:23,897 --> 01:49:25,899
What is that?

1584
01:49:37,411 --> 01:49:38,412
Lorelei!

1585
01:49:39,913 --> 01:49:41,415
She got me!

1586
01:49:41,415 --> 01:49:43,417
It's your Bubba!

1587
01:50:21,455 --> 01:50:22,956
Help me! Help!

1588
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,960
Superman!

1589
01:50:29,963 --> 01:50:30,464
Honey!

1590
01:50:30,964 --> 01:50:32,466
Honey, I'm
stuck here!

1591
01:50:32,966 --> 01:50:34,468
What about me?

1592
01:50:45,479 --> 01:50:46,980
Look out!

1593
01:52:34,922 --> 01:52:36,924
Aah!

1594
01:52:55,943 --> 01:52:57,945
Bubba?

1595
01:53:43,156 --> 01:53:45,158
Thank you,
brother.

1596
01:53:52,165 --> 01:53:53,166
Regular
or premium?

1597
01:53:53,166 --> 01:53:54,668
What the hell?

1598
01:53:54,668 --> 01:53:58,672
Give her
the good stuff.

1599
01:53:58,672 --> 01:54:01,175
How you doing
there, gus?

1600
01:54:01,175 --> 01:54:02,676
Please don't talk!

1601
01:54:02,676 --> 01:54:05,179
I'm having enough
trouble hanging on.

1602
01:54:05,179 --> 01:54:08,182
I'll go slow.
You're perfectly safe.

1603
01:54:08,182 --> 01:54:11,185
Any man who can
trick my machine

1604
01:54:11,185 --> 01:54:12,686
Can do anything.

1605
01:54:12,686 --> 01:54:15,689
How did you beat
my defenses?

1606
01:54:15,689 --> 01:54:18,692
The machine didn't know
it was in trouble.

1607
01:54:18,692 --> 01:54:22,196
I went in there
with plain acid.

1608
01:54:22,196 --> 01:54:25,199
When that stuff
gets hot enough,

1609
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:26,200
It'll eat
through anything.

1610
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,702
Watch the trees.

1611
01:54:28,702 --> 01:54:32,206
I guess it died
of...acid indigestion.

1612
01:54:32,706 --> 01:54:34,208
What will happen
to webster

1613
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:36,210
And the ladies?

1614
01:54:36,210 --> 01:54:39,713
They'll have to
see the police now.

1615
01:54:39,713 --> 01:54:42,716
Whoa! Are we in 
Metropolis yet?

1616
01:54:42,716 --> 01:54:46,720
No. We're going to
make a little stop.

1617
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:51,725
Whooooaaa!

1618
01:54:53,227 --> 01:54:55,729
We're on
the ground, gus.

1619
01:54:55,729 --> 01:54:57,231
You OK, supe?

1620
01:54:57,231 --> 01:54:59,733
I'm fine.
Excuse me.

1621
01:55:03,237 --> 01:55:06,740
Can you guys
spare one of these?

1622
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:08,242
Sure, Superman.

1623
01:55:08,242 --> 01:55:10,744
It is Superman,
ain't it?

1624
01:55:10,744 --> 01:55:12,246
Are you kidding?

1625
01:55:12,246 --> 01:55:13,747
Didn't you see us

1626
01:55:13,747 --> 01:55:16,750
Fly out of the sky?

1627
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:20,254
We're the only
2 men who can fly.

1628
01:55:20,254 --> 01:55:21,255
Just right.

1629
01:55:21,255 --> 01:55:23,757
OK, gus. Let's go.

1630
01:55:23,757 --> 01:55:27,261
I was thinking
about taking the bus.

1631
01:55:27,261 --> 01:55:28,262
Suit yourself.

1632
01:55:28,262 --> 01:55:30,764
Does your boss
have a computer?

1633
01:55:31,265 --> 01:55:34,268
Yeah, he's got
a little bitty one.

1634
01:55:34,268 --> 01:55:38,272
Tell him to give
gus Gorman a job.

1635
01:55:39,773 --> 01:55:41,775
Well, thank you, supe.

1636
01:55:41,775 --> 01:55:43,277
Take care.

1637
01:55:44,778 --> 01:55:46,780
I'll see you
around.

1638
01:55:52,286 --> 01:55:54,288
So long!

1639
01:55:56,290 --> 01:55:58,292
Take it easy, man.

1640
01:55:59,293 --> 01:56:01,795
Well, you got
good references.

1641
01:56:01,795 --> 01:56:04,298
If you want
that job...

1642
01:56:04,298 --> 01:56:05,799
Uh...

1643
01:56:07,301 --> 01:56:10,804
Well, nah.
This is not for me.

1644
01:56:10,804 --> 01:56:13,307
Where is
the bus station?

1645
01:56:13,307 --> 01:56:15,809
9 Or 10 miles
over there.

1646
01:56:15,809 --> 01:56:18,812
9 Or 10 miles?

1647
01:56:18,812 --> 01:56:20,314
OK.

1648
01:56:20,314 --> 01:56:22,816
You really
flew with him?

1649
01:56:22,816 --> 01:56:24,318
Superman?

1650
01:56:24,318 --> 01:56:27,821
Have you ever seen
Superman before?

1651
01:56:27,821 --> 01:56:28,822
No.

1652
01:56:29,323 --> 01:56:32,826
You don't know
about me and him?

1653
01:56:32,826 --> 01:56:34,328
Me and Superman?

1654
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:39,333
Yeah, we go
way back together.

1655
01:56:39,333 --> 01:56:43,337
We always--usually--
sometimes--we...

1656
01:56:44,338 --> 01:56:46,840
9 Or 10 miles?

1657
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:49,343
I think I'll walk.

1658
01:56:49,343 --> 01:56:51,345
Yeah, I'll walk.

1659
01:56:51,345 --> 01:56:52,846
Yeah.

1660
01:56:57,684 --> 01:56:58,685
Clark!

1661
01:56:59,186 --> 01:57:00,187
What a surprise!

1662
01:57:00,187 --> 01:57:02,189
Come in.

1663
01:57:02,189 --> 01:57:03,190
Hi, Mr. Kent.

1664
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:04,691
Hi.

1665
01:57:04,691 --> 01:57:07,694
Mom's having dinner
with Superman tonight!

1666
01:57:07,694 --> 01:57:11,198
That's what
I came to tell you.

1667
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:12,199
Superman's sorry,

1668
01:57:12,199 --> 01:57:14,701
But he's had
a problem.

1669
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:17,204
He can't
have dinner tonight.

1670
01:57:17,204 --> 01:57:20,207
I guess he misses
a lot of dinners.

1671
01:57:20,207 --> 01:57:22,709
Would you
settle for me?

1672
01:57:22,709 --> 01:57:24,211
Any day!

1673
01:57:24,211 --> 01:57:25,712
I'll get my things.

1674
01:57:26,213 --> 01:57:27,714
OK.

1675
01:57:27,714 --> 01:57:31,218
Lana, I was talking
to Superman.

1676
01:57:31,218 --> 01:57:34,221
He and I talk a lot.

1677
01:57:34,221 --> 01:57:35,722
He felt badly

1678
01:57:35,722 --> 01:57:39,726
About you having
to pawn your ring.

1679
01:57:39,726 --> 01:57:40,727
And...

1680
01:57:42,229 --> 01:57:43,730
Well, he found...

1681
01:57:44,731 --> 01:57:48,235
He found this one
just lying around...

1682
01:57:48,235 --> 01:57:51,238
He wanted you
to have this.

1683
01:57:58,745 --> 01:58:00,747
A ring from Superman!

1684
01:58:00,747 --> 01:58:02,749
I'll get it.

1685
01:58:02,749 --> 01:58:05,752
Look at that!

1686
01:58:06,253 --> 01:58:07,254
Oh, Clark!

1687
01:58:07,254 --> 01:58:08,255
It's OK.

1688
01:58:08,255 --> 01:58:09,756
It fits!

1689
01:58:09,756 --> 01:58:11,758
Looks really pretty.

1690
01:58:14,261 --> 01:58:16,263
Well!

1691
01:58:16,263 --> 01:58:17,264
Brad!
Brad!

1692
01:58:17,264 --> 01:58:19,266
Son of a bitch!

1693
01:58:19,766 --> 01:58:23,270
Kent, I hate you.

1694
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:25,272
I've always hated you.

1695
01:58:25,272 --> 01:58:26,773
You know why?

1696
01:58:26,773 --> 01:58:27,774
No.

1697
01:58:27,774 --> 01:58:29,276
'Cause you're nice.

1698
01:58:29,276 --> 01:58:31,778
And nice guys
finish last!

1699
01:58:34,781 --> 01:58:35,782
Arrgggh!

1700
01:58:42,289 --> 01:58:44,124
Lois, I've got to
hand it to you.

1701
01:58:44,124 --> 01:58:46,126
Who else
turns a vacation

1702
01:58:46,126 --> 01:58:47,628
Into a story

1703
01:58:47,628 --> 01:58:50,130
About corruption
in the Caribbean?

1704
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:54,635
I knew I was onto something
when I was kidnapped.

1705
01:58:54,635 --> 01:58:56,136
Lois, you're terrific!

1706
01:58:56,136 --> 01:58:58,138
I have to be.

1707
01:58:58,138 --> 01:59:00,140
Seems I've
got competition.

1708
01:59:00,140 --> 01:59:03,644
That story you wrote
on the class reunion?

1709
01:59:03,644 --> 01:59:05,145
I thought
it was terrific.

1710
01:59:05,145 --> 01:59:06,146
Thanks.

1711
01:59:06,146 --> 01:59:10,150
I liked the little
girl back home.

1712
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:12,152
Tell me about it
at lunch.

1713
01:59:12,653 --> 01:59:14,655
I'm having lunch

1714
01:59:15,155 --> 01:59:16,657
With Mr. White's
new secretary.

1715
01:59:16,657 --> 01:59:18,158
Hi, Lana.

1716
01:59:18,158 --> 01:59:19,660
Lois, this is Lana,

1717
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:22,162
Smallville's newest
gift to Metropolis.

1718
01:59:22,162 --> 01:59:24,665
I like your
writing a lot.

1719
01:59:24,665 --> 01:59:26,667
Thank you.

1720
01:59:26,667 --> 01:59:29,169
I like your
sparkler a lot.

1721
01:59:29,169 --> 01:59:30,671
I was surprised

1722
01:59:30,671 --> 01:59:33,173
When Clark
gave it to me.

1723
01:59:33,173 --> 01:59:34,174
Clark?

1724
01:59:34,174 --> 01:59:36,176
Yes.

1725
01:59:38,178 --> 01:59:40,180
Mr. White!
Mr. White!

1726
01:59:40,681 --> 01:59:43,183
Look what
I've got!

1727
01:59:43,183 --> 01:59:46,186
I'm in love with
this machine!

1728
01:59:46,186 --> 01:59:50,691
I have errands
to run before lunch.

1729
01:59:50,691 --> 01:59:52,693
Go ahead,
Mr. White.

1730
01:59:52,693 --> 01:59:54,194
Where's the handle?

1731
01:59:54,194 --> 01:59:56,697
Just push
the button!

1732
02:00:52,753 --> 02:00:54,254
Giorgio, por favore?

1733
02:00:55,255 --> 02:00:56,757
Grazie.
