2
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,541
Help!

3
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,958
Help! Help!

4
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,083
My husband’s going to kill me.

5
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,958
Please, please help me.
My husband wants to kill me. Please.

6
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:12,791
TWO MONTHS EARLIER

7
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,708
Today's breaking news,
only on Visphotak News.

8
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:21,625
Hathni Kund Barrage on the Yamuna river
in Haryana has been destroyed completely

9
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,083
due to heavy rains.

10
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:27,000
As a result of this,
a lot of crocodiles have been washed away

11
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,625
with the flowing water,
to low-lying areas such as Agra.

12
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,041
Will you help me get down?

13
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,416
My legs are hurting. Come. Help me.

14
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:45,458
Auntyji, come on.
It’s time for your shot of insulin.

15
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,125
You're here? With so many tomatoes?

16
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,541
They’re quite cheap today.

17
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,125
So I was thinking…

18
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,708
-She looked so pretty.
-…just buy some.

19
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,833
Sona,
please help me out this one time.

20
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,291
I promise you
the next time you need me…

21
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,625
I’ll be there for you.

22
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,958
I helped you yesterday, didn’t I?

23
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:24,791
What!

24
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,791
She cancelled
a 5-hour bridal makeup session!

25
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,458
I could’ve dolled up
five clients in that time.

26
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,791
-Sorry, they fell down.
-No problem.

27
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,875
She gave it to Seema?

28
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:41,500
You know what? When Rani does her thing,
girls look like brides for a whole month.

29
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,041
And Seema’s clients,
by the time they get to the altar,

30
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,250
they start looking as scary as Monjulika.

31
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,375
She’ll come back to me.

32
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,750
I’m not going to give her
a rupee's discount.

33
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,208
She hasn’t even returned
the lipstick she had borrowed.

34
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, no! Rani was so upset that she forgot
her Kamla-Bimla here. Look.

35
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,708
Shall I go give it?

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,875
Go ahead.

37
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,916
I'll be right back.

38
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,708
Just a minute.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,833
Let's go.

40
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,250
Raniji! Raniji!

41
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,000
-Belanganj.
-Raniji!

42
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,458
Raniji, you forgot your… Raniji.

43
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,875
Just a second.

44
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,583
No, that’s not the point.

45
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,250
Stick to the bookings.
You need to value other people's time.

46
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,875
Yeah, but…

47
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,708
Raniji

48
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,583
Raniji, wait!

49
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,791
Yeah, just,
just a bit further. Pull over.

-Here.

52
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,041
Raniji.

53
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,791
You forgot these.

54
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,958
Thank you,
thank you, thank you so much.

55
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,750
Um, you ran all the way to give me these?

56
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,750
Oh, no, no.

57
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,500
I had some work here.

59
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,166
-Hmm.
-Actually, it’s for a patient.

60
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,666
-Looks like you take good care of them.
-Yeah, yeah.

61
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,125
Thank you!

62
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,500
-Actually, Raniji.
-Yes?

63
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,916
-I, uh--
-Rani!

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,333
-Rani, come here quickly.
-Yeah.

65
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,791
I’ll be back in two minutes.

66
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,250
-No problem.
-Just two minutes. Okay? Hmm.

67
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,541
Listen, Rani, I goofed up.

68
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,916
Mrs. Sahay asked for Dirty Blonde,
but I applied Slutty Red by mistake.

69
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,041
It's okay, we'll see.

70
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,125
I’ve told you a thousand times
not to start without me.

71
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,333
-Hi, Mrs. Sahay.
-Arey, Rani?

72
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,208
Ah, keep it on, keep it on.

73
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,916
This enhances the color, you know?
How have you been?

74
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,500
-One chai, please.
-Yes, sir.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,083
-We’re applying an extra layer.
-Okay.

76
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,750
You have time, right?

77
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,291
Dirty Blonde,
the best color in town. Trust me.

78
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,208
-Really?
-Takes a little time to apply.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,958
We'll wash it off in ten minutes.

80
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,416
-Raniji.
-Come on…

81
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,375
-I was thinking that would you--
-What?

82
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,541
Would you like to watch a movie with me?

83
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,708
-What?
-Friday?

84
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,583
Ah…

85
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,083

For the sake of love,
Rishu and I had gone too far.

111
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,416
Rishu had now become Ravi.

112
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,916
Our love was like a flowing river,
but we were on the opposite banks.

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,083
And what stopped us from crossing over?

114
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,833
The Uttar Pradesh Police.

115
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:10,791
And to this day, we are giving it our all
for that elusive happily ever after.

116
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:16,416
If love doesn't push you to the brink
of insanity, it's not true love.

117
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,916
Only the meek seek refuge
in a passionless relationship.

118
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,833
Jaipur! Jaipur!

119
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,375
Hurry up, Jaipur!

120
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,500
Enter inside.
Hey, uncle, look here, here.

121
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,666
Gudduji, here, uh, the 25
that you had asked for.

122
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:53,250
Okay, don’t worry,
I’ll take care of everything.

123
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,916
Within two months,
you’ll be off to Thailand.

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,916
-Two months?
-Yes, two months

125
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,291
I’ll let you know the exact date.

126
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,625
So that proves the fact that,
in every condition,

127
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,083
the velocity remains cons--

128
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,708
What’s going on over there?

129
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,333
-Pay attention here.
-Yes, sir.

130
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,625
So the velocity of--

131
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,250
Note this down, I’ll be back.

132
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,958
When are you giving it, Raviji?

133
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,666
Rent? I’ve given it already.

134
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,791
When will you give the answers
to my questions?

135
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,041
What was the song?

136

138
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,208
Poonamji,
after my wife passed--

139
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:36,333
Raviji, your wife is gone
but not your life, right?

140
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,583
And I’m not talking about love
that lasts a lifetime.

141
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,500
Hmm?

142
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,541
Just… a night or two will do.

143
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I am sorry.

144
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,541
-I’m not feeling well today.
-No problem.

145
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,583
You’ll surely feel better someday.

146
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,125
I’ll come back then.

147
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,125
Hmm!

Hello.

151
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,041
Uncle &amp; aunty have gone
to the Agra Masala Convention.

152
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,333
Masala Convention?

153
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,625
Now don’t be a clueless cat, okay?

154
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,791
The point is, there is nobody home.
So are you coming?

155
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,458
Looks a bit difficult today.

156
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,708
Alright then, meet me with a gift
on Raksha Bandhan, okay?

157
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,708
When will we get out of here, Rishu?

158
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,333
-How much longer?
-Plan is in place.

159
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,458
The agent has sourced
new passports as well.

160
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:29,333
Just one more month to go, then it’ll be
just you and me going wild in Thailand.

161
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:34,000
Meanwhile, just see to it that
you don’t fall for the love of your fans.

162
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,291
And what about
that compounder lover of yours?

163
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,458
He doesn't desire my body.
He desires my love.

164
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,000
He’s a decent man.

165
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,916
But you're not that decent.

166
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,083
Panditji says,
“Character nor behavior reveals,

167
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,083
to judge a person in love,
realize what their heart feels."

168
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,708
Uff!

169
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,208
-Bhai Sahab!
-Hmm?

170
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,208
-Tickets for the 6 o’clock show.
-How many?

171
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,958
All of them, please.

172
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,208
Rani. Hmm!

173
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,541
Sorry, sorry! Did you get hurt?

174
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,000
-Ah!
-Huh?

175
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,416
Arey, yaar!

176
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,250
Come on.

177
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,416
Hey, come on, move aside.

178
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,000
Tamatar le lo.
15 rupees, half kg.

179
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,041
The city of Taj is under threat.

180
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,416
A crocodile was seen
crawling around Aslam Tailor’s shop.

181
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So, I’m just doing a root touch up.

182
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,916
We’ll keep it for half an hour.
Then we will wash it off.

183
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,666
-Okay?
-As you say, beta.

184
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,791
Arey, Abhimanyu? At this hour?

185
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,916
Again with
so many tomatoes? Huh?

186
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,041
They were really cheap
outside Royal Cinema.

187
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,791
So I thought might as well.

188
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,125
Shit!

189
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,250
I am sorry.

190
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,416
Abhimanyu, I am so sorry!

191
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,958
Don’t worry, Raniji. I'm sure you must’ve
been busy with something important.

192
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:11,958
I… wait…

193
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,458
-So sorry. Take this--
-Shall we try again next Friday?

194
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,708
I’ll be waiting for you.

195
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,541
Again?

196
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,000
Waiting doesn’t scare me.
Because that can be done alone.

197
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,166
I'm scared of the conversations.

198
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,750
For those I’ll need you as well, right?

199
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,125
Right.

200
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,125
Stop laughing.

201
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,208
I feel really bad for him.

202
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:51,666
Raniji, you have quite the history
of killing your lovers and admirers.

203
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,208
The police never found their bodies.

204
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,750
Don’t try to act over smart--

205
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,333
Help, help, help!

206
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,541
Oh no!

207
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,083
Catch him!

208
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,000
I said stop!

209
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,416
Stop.

210
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,625
Oh no, oh no.

211
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,375
Yes, sir?

212
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,916
Does a girl
named Rani Kashyap live here?

213
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,333
-Uh…
-Locals gave us this address.

214
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,125
Yes, she lives here.

215
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,291
Uh, she’s a really nice girl.
Poor girl is a widow.

216
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,416
She's got no family.
She lives here as a tenant.

217
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,916
We found her purse.

218
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,333
I’ll call her.
Uh, Rani beta!

219
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,333
Yes?

220
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,416
Coming.

221
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,708
So you managed to find me.
Who stole my purse?

222
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,583
And we’ve crossed paths again, Raniji.

223
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,208
Fate.

224
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,291
It looks like
divine justice is on its way.

225
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,333
Your favorite Dinesh Pandit,

226
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,291
says something along those lines
in that novel, right?

227
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,541
Wrath of Kasauli?

228
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,416
I've read the novel.

229
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,833
The climax was to die for.

230
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,833
Faked his own death and cut off his hand
and placed it near the dead body

231
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,083
to save his damsel in distress.

232
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,875
-Thank you.
-By the way,

233
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,708
I’ve heard someone’s been
looking for you for a long time.

234
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,500
Who?

235
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,791
The ghosts of your past.

236
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That officer has read Wrath of Kasauli.

237
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,583
He said he loved the climax
and someone is on the hunt for us.

238
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,875
He knows what we did.

239
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,500
He only has a fictional story,
no evidence.

240
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,375
He’s trying to scare you.

241
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,833
I told you
to go back, right? Why did you come back?

242
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,083
I was missing you.

243
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,333
We met in the morning.
Did you forget?

244
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,458
I was busy in the morning
laying my traps.

245
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,333
I thought two Indians could share
their happiness and sorrow.

246
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,375
The number
you're trying to call is out of coverage.

247
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,958
Please call again later.

248
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,291
The number
you have called is out of coverage area.

249
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,416
Bhaiya, Husanpura?

250
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,625
-Bhaisaab, what's wrong with you?
-The stench is really bad, bhaiya.

251
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,416
All customers are complaining.
Please move your truck.

252
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,291
I’m leaving, madam. I’m leaving.

253
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,625
You’ve already picked up the garbage,
so just leave.

254
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,500
I told you I'm leaving.

255
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,875
"Strengths of the heart
once intertwined,

256
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,416
love can endure attacks of every kind."

257
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,083
One minute. One minute. One…

258
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,333
This… Are you a fan of Dinesh Pandit?

259
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,250
This?

260
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,583
Some mad fellow wrote this on my truck

261
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,875
and paid me
to simply wait here for an hour or so.

262
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,291
Why? Is there any problem?

263
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,041
DINESH PANDIT

264
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,250
ATTACK ON LOVE

265
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,125
"Though I didn't want
to talk to you,

266
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,000
my will lost and vulnerability took over.

267
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:44,666
Archana knew the place
where her lover would be waiting for her."

268
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,666
-Uncle, uh, uncle?
-Hmm?

269
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,750
-The phone?
-Time to close.

270
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,083
-Rishu! Rishu!
-Rani!

271
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,500
Rishu, are you okay?

272
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,041
Yeah, yeah, I am fine.

273
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:20,208
Okay, listen, I just met the agent
and we’re leaving for Thailand next week.

274
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:24,375
Rishu, Rishu, Rishu, I think
the police is up to something, Rishu.

275
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,166
They’re following me wherever I go.

276
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,166
Rani, listen.

277
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,416
The only thing standing between
prison and freedom is your fear.

278
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,208
Kishore doesn’t have evidence.

279
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,250
They just want to see you worried,
that’s exactly what they want.

280
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,041
And they might call you
to the police station

281
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,125
to ask a few questions.

282
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,333
Just be strong.

283
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,416
Hmm.

284
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:49,958
Uh, Rishu? Hello? Rishu! Rishu!

285
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:03,916
Hello?

286
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:10,333
Okay.

287
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:21,666
POLICE STATION DISTRICT - AGRA

288
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:29,250
Come on!
Come on, chindi chor! Go, sit in the van.

289
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,500
"Naitik Verma?"

290
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,708
New lover? Or a friend?

291
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,083
Why?

292
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:01,000
Because you talk to him for hours on end.

293
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:07,041
I thought we could be friends.
He told me his name was Rahul.

294
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:10,916
Then one day, a woman called me
and said that he’s her husband.

295
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,125
So the friendship ended.

296
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:18,000
You know, the thing is,
inspector sahab, especially nowadays,

297
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,958
can anyone be a 100% certain
if they know a person?

298
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:25,458
There's a difference between knowing
and recognizing, but you know that.

299
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,583
Hmm.

300
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:30,458
But this time you can't spin your stories
in the police station, Raniji.

301
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:33,958
Panditji says--

302
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,541
You couldn’t resist getting Panditji
into the mix, could you?

303
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,625
I had to.

304
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:47,125
Because in a police station like this
about 30 years ago,

305
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,875
he was framed,
tarnished and fired from his job.

306
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:55,208
Since that day, he has been trying
to get his revenge through his books.

307
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,583
Look at any of his stories.

308
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,625
-The police will always be the losers.
-Jai Hind, sahab.

309
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:05,333
So, the pen really is mightier
than the sword, quite a revenge.

310
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,458
I’ve heard Dinesh Pandit bhaisahab
left the world a long time ago.

311
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,416
But his books are
being published even today.

312
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:17,291
My name is Mrutyunjay Paswan.

313
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,416
I don’t think you recognize me.

314
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,125
I’m your relative, actually.

315
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,708
I think your memory
seems to be a little weak, hmm?

316
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,541
If I had to tell you exactly who I am…

317
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:45,208
I’m Rishu’s mom’s sister’s husband’s
sister’s husband’s brother.

318
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,458
Which means…

319
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,250
I’m Neel’s favorite chacha.

320
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,791
For you, Neel might be
Rishu’s distant cousin.

321
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,166
But you need to know something.

322
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:17,166
Neel meant the world to me.

323
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:22,083
My favorite, my darling nephew.

324
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:34,583
You know, I danced like crazy
at your wedding functions.

325
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,000
Showered money.

326
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:54,375
You know Kishoreji, right?
He’s a close friend of mine.

327
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:59,541
And he has offered me a chance
to take the lead in this case of yours.

328
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:02,958
So from now on…

329
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,291
I’ll be asking all the questions.

330
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:09,375
Because

331
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,291
it’s personal.

332
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:19,875
Tell me one thing, this friend of yours,
a special friend maybe, Naitikji,

333
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,125
Rahulji…

334
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:27,416
What makes him
call the travel agent every single week?

335
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,500
-He--
-Hmm?

336
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,458
He likes to travel maybe,
how would I know?

337
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:33,958
And you?

338
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,125
Why are you roaming
around Agra all by yourself?

339
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,208
Isn't it so strange, Raniji?

340
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,000
It’s been such a long time
since Rishu’s gone.

341
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,833
You broke all ties
and are not talking to your family either.

342
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,500
You didn’t even get married again.

343
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:57,625
So you mean to say,
it’s a crime for a widow to not remarry?

344
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:02,208
Are you planning
on reporting me or arresting me?

345
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,708
-What are you trying to imply?
-I’m telling you

346
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:08,083
that I know Rishu is here with you
in this city, here in Agra.

347
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:09,875
Otherwise, you living here

348
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,250
without any relative, without any friends
simply doesn’t make sense.

349
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:18,916
Sorry.

350
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,250
What I’m also trying to say is…

351
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,041
I’ve known Rishu
since the time he was just in his nappies.

352
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,041
He’s like an iceberg.
What you see is harmless.

353
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,666
But we’ll never know
the secret it hides underneath.

354
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,125
I…I’m a modern independent woman
and I…I can manage on my own.

355
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:50,125
Raniji, people from the department
call me by a number of names.

356
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:55,833
But my most favorite one
is The Woodpecker.

357
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,666
The Woodpecker.

358
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:01,875
Do you know why?

359
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:07,000
It's because a woodpecker keeps pecking
the trunk of a tree continuously

360
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,708
and relentlessly
till he bores a hole in it.

361
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:11,791
He just doesn’t give up.

362
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,625
The thing is that…

363
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:21,625
the law doesn’t dare to intervene
between me and all my cases.

364
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:27,625
Okay.

365
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:30,541
You may leave.

366
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,458
And Raniji…

367
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,041
if you run into Rishu, do tell him…

368
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,875
…his Montu chacha is back now.

369
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,041
You said that a team
was keeping an eye on her, right?

370
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,083
Any news from them?

371
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,250
No, sir, nothing yet.

372
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,833
The force is searching
the whole city, sir.

373
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:21,625
Where all does our beautiful madam
take her lovely self in the city?

374
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,333
Uh, sir, home, beauty parlor,
she's usually in a 2-kilometer radius.

375
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:33,541
Then deploy your force
in the same 2-kilometre radius right away.

376
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,708
We’ll nab Rishu in a week's time.

377
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,541
Okay, sir.

378
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,125
Have you seen this person?

379
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,500
POLICE STATION BELANGANJ

380
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,333
No.

381
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,041
-Seen him?
-No.

382
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,708
-Seen him?
-Don't know him.

383
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,958
Look closely.
Must have seen him somewhere.

384
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,125
-Seen him?
-No idea, sir.

385
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,041
Let’s ask him.

386
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,208
-Don't recognize?
-No, sir.

387
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,208
Good to go.

388
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,541
Please, listen to me!

389
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,083
Sir, I haven't done anything.

390
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,750
Listen to me.

391
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,333
I’ve two small kids at home.

392
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:49,416
I have not done anything wrong, sir.

393
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,666
Aunty, how can you say that?

394
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:16,375
Your son Sonu told me,
"Mummy doesn’t teach me anything at home.

395
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:18,541
She’s on her phone,
watching Anupama all day."

396
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,708
I’ll call back in some time.

397
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,041
Have you seen this man anywhere?

398
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,458
I’ll be back in just a moment.

399
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:42,000
Want some chai?

400
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,250
-No.
-Yes.

401
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:47,666
Uh, sugar, three teaspoons.

402
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,875
Three teaspoons.

403
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,500
Ever heard about diabetes?

404
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,916
That’s why I said, sir,
only three teaspoons.

405
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,500
Raviji.

406
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,791
The police have come here.

407
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:34,750
They asked me, "Have you seen him?"

408
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:40,916
No, right?

409
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:45,375
I’ll tell them.

410
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,833
Sorry, sir, I haven’t seen him.

411
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:16,208
Uh, arey, madam,
I thought you’re getting us chai.

412
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,375
It’s not ready yet?

413
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,541
Aren’t you ashamed?

414
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:24,000
Asking a woman on crutches
to make chai for you?

415
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,625
Get lost from here!

416
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,458
If you want chai, come
with a warrant next time. Get out!

417
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Rani!

418
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,583
-Rani--
-Not today. People are around.

419
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,416
-Listen to me.
-You listen to me.

420
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,416
Who is that new DSP at the police station?

421
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Montu chacha, I know.
Get in, I’ll tell you.

422
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,458
Montu?

423
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,375
One minute.

424
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,458
It's all over, Rani.

425
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,083
-Everything.
-Why?

426
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,791
He has arrested our travel agent, Guddu.

427
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:30,000
All the money we paid,
everything, it's all ruined.

428
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,708
Today, the cops came
to the coaching center as well.

429
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,833
That Poonam is also suspecting me.

430
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,916
I just don’t know what to do now.

431
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,750
-Let’s run away.
-Huh?

432
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,166
Come on, let's run away.

433
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,791
Rani, I’ve known
Montu chacha since I was a kid.

434
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:55,291
If we both run away,
he’ll have even more fun.

435
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,750
We’ll run to every nook and cranny,
but he’ll follow us and kill us.

436
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:03,166
Montu chacha! Neel! What kind of a…

437
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:07,541
-What kind of a family do you have?
-We are left with no other option.

438
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:10,541
I’ll surrender myself.

439
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,708
I’ll tell the police
you had nothing to do with Neel’s death.

440
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,416
Have you gone crazy? Hmm?

441
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,208
Have you really lost your mind?

442
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:20,375
We ran away from Jwalapur
and came here, why?

443
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,458
To surrender ourselves?

444
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:23,416
Rishu, you had to cut your hand.

445
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,333
-Try to understand what I’m saying.
-Auntyji?

446
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,708
Oh, you're here!

447
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:31,250
Wait a second.

448
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,875
Is Raniji home?

449
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,208
Rani beta.

450
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:00,541
Rani!

451
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,833
Rani…

452
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,125
I’ll just go to another city.

453
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:12,166
In a couple of days, the police will
track me and arrest me then and there.

454
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:14,125
-You will be--
-Ssh! Shut up!

455
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:18,291
You’re afraid because Montu chacha thinks
we’re here together, right?

456
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,000
I think I have a better idea.

457
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,708
But you have to trust me.

458
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,208
I thought I’d have
to wait for you tonight as well.

459
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,250
I'll have to come home again
for an appointment.

460
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,750
I guess all good things
come to those who wait.

461
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,625
So will you marry me?

462
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:03,958
What?

463
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,291
I asked, will you marry me?

464
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,375
Are you serious?

465
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,791
What about love?

466
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,500
I don’t have the heart
to fall in love again.

467
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:28,458
I wait for you for hours at a stretch,
but you never seem to notice me.

468
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,083
Why me?

469
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,625
If he can wait hours for me,

470
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:38,125
I think he could hold my hand
and walk a few miles too.

471
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,083
And who knows?

472
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:44,125
Maybe love finds me after we get married.

473
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:47,083
Or maybe it won't.

474
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,583
Wow, Raniji…

475
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:04,875
It took you just a moment
to make me the happiest man in the world

476
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,208
and the loneliest too.

477
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:10,000
Love has the same effect, Abhimanyuji.

478
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:13,833
It makes you strong and breaks you too.

479
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,875
If I had known love was this merciless,
I would’ve stayed away.

480
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:28,458
But now there's no turning back.

481
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,708
"My sins have been
washed away since I fell in love.

482
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:45,666
Saying your name feels like
I'm chanting Bajrang Bali's name somehow."

483
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:24,708
Don’t do it, Rani.
This is not the right plan for us.

484
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,208
Neither will Rani and Rishu be together,
nor will Montu chacha come after us.

485
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,708
The chapter ends there.

486
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:41,166
One of Panditji's lines
came to my mind.

487
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:47,166
“I’ll accept all your demands.
Just make sure

488
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,458
our fights don’t involve a third person.”

489
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:54,041
We aren’t even fighting.
Yet there is a third one.

490
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,541
We’re spoiling our lives so badly, Rani.

491
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,500
Do you think our love will last forever?

492
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,625
The wedding is in three days.

493
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:11,541

00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,333
will Romeo come here
for his Juliet’s wedding?

508
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,375
I know the kind of person Rishu has been.

509
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,666
The only thing
that can destroy him is his love.

510
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:26,250
After all, we are legally obliged
to screw him. Hmm?

You… You drink rum?

529
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,708
Sorry? Uh, yeah, sometimes

530
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:45,958
Hm, uh, you have whiskey?

531
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,750
When I used to look at you
from a distance,

532
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:55,000
I had a thousand things to say to you.

533
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,583
Now you’re in front of me,
I don’t know what to say or do.

534
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:00,000
I’m stressing out thinking about

535
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,583
what I can say to make you laugh.

536
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:07,708
Have you heard of Dinesh Pandit?

537
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,333
Even Rishu didn’t know
about him before he met me.

538
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,708
You had to bring Rishuji into this.

539
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,166
He is always here.

540
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:46,958
[In that case…

541
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:55,875
you, me and Rishuji
could play snakes and ladders.

542
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:01,000
Love plays out between two people, Raniji.

543
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,375
If it’s three, we’re better off
playing snakes and ladders.

544
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,125
Tell me one thing.

545
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,041
Hmm?

546
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,000
Didn’t you feel bad

547
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:20,291
when I said I’m getting married to you
just for my convenience?

548
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,875
Didn’t it break your heart?

549
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:26,000
You must have made
some plans for yourself.

550
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:34,083
Love, lover, romance,
intimacy, passion, etc. etc.

551
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:36,625
I was seven when my parents passed away.

552
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,833
What remained of my family
was my chacha, chachi and their two kids.

553
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,500
They passed away when I was about 20.

554
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,291
I was the only one left.

555
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:56,125
The house, these windows,
the roof and the walls.

556
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:01,208
I had a job,
but that could barely get me out of bed.

557
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,291
When I couldn’t see a light
at the end of the tunnel,

558
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:08,750
I tried to end my life too.

559
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,750
And that’s the day
I saw you at the clinic.

560
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:18,541
Sky-blue dupatta
rose-pink kameez.

561
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,416
I had never before seen
such colors in my life.

562
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:25,958
My whole world changed completely.

563
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:32,458
Such beautiful colors,
made my clinic, my house,

564
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:34,458
my neighborhood, all turn rosy pink.

565
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:39,333
The whole city, in fact the Taj Mahal
I saw from my house, turned pink as well.

566
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:44,333
If I have to play snakes and ladders
with you for the rest of my life,

567
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:45,625
I’ll do it with a smile.

568
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:49,791

Pizza.

585
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,291
I didn’t order it.

00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:57,916
Hmm…

598
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:03,083
I’m only focused
on winning the real game, Raniji.

599
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:05,375
Game of Life, just with you.

600
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:17,666
If you tell me to jump from the roof,
I’ll do it. Just for you.

601
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,500
But I don’t have the permission to love.

602
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,875
But that’s what Dinesh Pandit’s character
Surekha said just a second ago.

603
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:34,791
Show me.

604
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:39,541
Hmm.

605
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,458
Proceed with caution.

606
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:46,000
Who knows what the pages
of this book contain?

607
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,125
Surekha might get permission
to fall in love.

608
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:55,125
You keep waiting for the big twist.
I’m off to sleep now.

609
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,000
Good night.

610
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:06,083
Yeah, I’m soon going to get
my PhD in waiting anyway.

611
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:11,750
Raviji.

612
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,166
I got a little carried away.

613
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:22,875
The thing is that seeing the police
my heart goes dhak dhak

614
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:24,250
dhak dhak.

615
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:27,166
It starts pounding really hard.

616
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,375
Why do you play so hard to get, Raviji?

617
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:52,208
You don’t have a hand
and I practically don't have a leg.

618
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:56,125
But together we could walk
miles on end. Perfect.

619
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:03,250
Do you know what happened to my leg?

620
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,458
For my ex-boyfriend, I was
on the second floor, and I jumped off.

621
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,208
"I gave him my heart
thinking he's my own,

622
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:35,208
but he butchered it
leaving me broken and torn."

623
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:42,791
From the day we got married until now,
we’re just playing snakes and ladders.

624
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,500
The actual board game.

625
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:46,833
But your tongue is stuck
way down Poonam’s throat.

626
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:49,375
She keeps blackmailing me,
harassing me, what do I do?

627
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:52,125
And I pushed her away.
You saw that too, right?

628
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:55,708
I told you to stay away,
stay away from that… that wicked bitch.

629
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,000
-Who knows? Maybe you led her on.
-Seriously?

630
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,541
That’s how much you trust me and my love?

631
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,458
Didn’t I trust you when you told me
you were going to marry Abhimanyu?

632
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:08,000
Correct. It’s all my fault.

633
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:12,875
I made a plan, so I was wrong.
Abhimanyu is trapped and that’s my fault.

634
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:16,041
And Montu chacha?
That also must be my fault.

635
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:19,500
I told you, I was ready to surrender,
but you didn't listen to me.

636
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,416
-He’s not going to leave us alone.
-Go to hell!

637
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,333
And take your Montu chacha with you.

638
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,041
At first, we didn’t love each other.

639
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,791
Then we fell in love
but the timing was off.

640
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:31,791
When the timing was right, we couldn’t
be together 'cause there were issues.

641
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,250
Finally, when we sorted everything,
we were about to leave,

642
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,583
your Montu chacha comes out of nowhere.

643
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:41,833
The timing of our love story is bad.
I don’t think this is going to work out.

644
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:47,083
Last time you thought our relationship
won’t work out, I cut off my hand.

645
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,833
But I didn’t let go of your hand.

646
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:54,791
This time if I have to cut off my head,
I’ll happily do that as well.

647
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:57,541
My love for you
has made me a criminal anyway.

648
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,500
Oh! That’s not fair, Raniji.

649
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:22,416
You’ve already started
drinking without me?

650
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,791
You are crying? Is everything all right?

651
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:28,708
L…

652
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:30,833
-What?
-L…

653
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:35,041
L… S… D.

654
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:36,708
LSD!

655
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:38,041
Are you high on drugs?

656
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:44,791
Love. Sex. Deceit. LSD.

657
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,625
You’ll find it all over Agra.

658
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:51,458
There is LSD everywhere around us.

659
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,583
Look, all I need is love.

660
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:58,875
Poonam just wants sex.

661
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,208
And Abhimanyu is a victim of deceit.

662
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:04,375
He’s trapped for no reason.

663
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,708
He shouldn’t have got married.

664
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:09,500
It’s all my fault.

665
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,833
It’s Montu chacha’s fault.

666
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:17,750
Montu… whatever he’s doing,
he shouldn’t be doing it.

667
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,250
I don’t want to be here.

668
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:23,208
Please take me away
from here, Rishu.

669
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:26,208
Please take me away.

670
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,500
Please take me away.

671
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:06,166
Please call Rishuji right away.

672
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,666
See, I’m not much of a preacher.

673
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:35,208
But you need to leave the city soon.
I can help you make arrangements.

674
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:37,041
Passport, police…

675
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,791
-I’ll take care of everything.
-But how?

676
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,833
I’m a compounder.

677
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:45,333
Be it the judge or the DIG,
I know all their dirty secrets.

678
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:47,000
Everyone gets sick.

679
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,166
I’ve given shots to the biggest of shots,
I’ll manage everything.

680
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,083
But, Abhimanyuji…

681
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,083
why are you trying to help us?

682
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:09,166
Mom, Dad, childhood, teenage years…
Couldn’t save any of it.

683
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,208
But the least I can do is save my love.

684
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:15,166
So what if
I can’t spend my life with Raniji?

685
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:17,791
It's her happiness that matters.

686
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:21,375
If I live in some corner of her heart
because of the things I say and do,

687
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:24,458
then maybe some day
she'll grow tired of Rishuji

688
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,333
and think about me instead. So…

689
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,375
She’ll need a couple of lifetimes
to get tired of me.

690
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:38,083
But I’ve heard
that you are an expert at waiting.

691
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,500
Don’t be so egoistic, Rishuji.

692
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,083
Today, the love of your life is with you
and I am the victim of love.

693
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:49,500
Fate can be really evil sometimes.

694
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:54,000
If it’s not meant to be,
even eternal lovers would never meet.

695
01:02:54,583 --> 01:02:55,583
And if it's destined,

696
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,791
two strangers
who’ve only just met on a train,

697
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,000
can journey together
till eternity and beyond.

698
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,958
Destiny is etched
on the palm of our hands, my friend.

699
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:13,416
In the name of love, I didn’t think twice
before cutting my hand off.

700
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,958
SAHNI CLINIC

701
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,166
Just a second.

702
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:17,291
So you’ll leave for Thailand from here
in a couple of days, alright?

703
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:18,958
Until then, be my guest.

704
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:22,291
This is the bed,
the bathroom is over there.

705
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:26,375
It’s Sunday, so no one's coming.
I’ll be coming through that door itself.

706
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:38,625
-I’ll lock this one from outside.
-Thank you.

707
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:14,416
Should I come along?

708
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,083
It’s risky.

709
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,875
-Abhimanyu…
-Hmm?

710
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:30,916
Sorry.

711
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:35,666
I mean it.

712
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:40,625
If you’re sorry,
come with me for one last movie tonight.

713
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:51,958
Okay then, uh…

714
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:55,416
I’ll go give your husband his tiffin.

715
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:59,708
And then I have to take
my lovely wife for a movie.

716
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:27,500
Poonamji, um…

717
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,083
How did you find out I am here?

718
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,583
I followed you here.

719
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:48,375
You thought a resignation is enough?
You will need much more--

720
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:03,083
Give me a month to sort everything.
I’ll come back to you soon.

721
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:20,000
And if you don’t come back…

722
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,291
then…

723
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,416
I told you, Poonamji…

724
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:12,583
Matar pulao.

725
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:16,291
Raniji told me
it's your favorite, so…

726
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,041
Yeah,
keep it on the table.

727
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:39,958
Jasmine… Wow!

728
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:43,916
Was a lady in this room?

729
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,416
Yes, uh, Poonam was here.

730
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,458
Who Poonam?

731
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,875
-She was my landlady, actually.
-How did she come here?

732
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:56,208
Now what do I say, Abhimanyuji.

733
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,583
She keeps following me.

734
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,375
Blackmailing me as well.

735
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:06,083
-Blackmail?
-Yes.

736
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,666
Why? What does she want? Money?

737
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:13,000
-She must be after something.
-Me.

738
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:15,833
-You?
-Yes.

739
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:26,791
Arey, baap re!

740
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,666
What's her full name?

741
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:37,833
Why do you want to know?

742
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:41,166
I was thinking
I’ll send her a friend request.

743
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:45,041
Don’t worry,
she won't tell anyone about all this.

744
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,166
She loves me. That’s what she says.

745
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:51,583
Hmm.

746
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:56,250
Love?

747
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:03,250
So, the thing is, Poonam likes you,
and you like Raniji,

748
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:06,208
but then even I like Raniji,
but Raniji likes you.

749
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:11,416
We’re all wasting our lives chasing
something way beyond our reach.

750
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,166
Just simplify it, professor.

751
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:16,875
Take a U-turn and go back to Poonam.

752
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:19,166
Raniji stays with me. End of story.

753
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,916
Arey, I was just kidding around.

754
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:28,666
Why did you get so serious?

755
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:31,666
-Enjoy your food, I’ll get going.
-Thank you. Okay.

756
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:38,875
Something wrong?

757
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,250
Did someone else come, too?

758
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:47,166
Uh…

759
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,250
No one.

760
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:15,166
Does Raniji know
you’re such a big fat liar?

761
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,958
I would’ve preferred
the movie plan.

762
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:23,291
There are crocodiles in this area.

763
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:26,375
But I guess, they’re mostly
near the railway bridge, right?

764
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:32,166
And anyway, the police have cordoned off
the area with tapes and stuff.

765
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:35,791
So the…
the plan must be safe.

766
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,250
No?

767
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:43,250
You think the police and their flimsy tape
can stop the crocodiles?

768
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,875
-No.
-This river is their home.

769
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:50,666
If someone tries to invade your home,
your life, that too on the basis of a lie…

770
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,291
nobody will tolerate it.

771
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,708
I’ve told Lallan
so many times,

772
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:00,208
"Take off your slippers before coming in."

773
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:05,291
This soil is from the jungles of Rajgir.

774
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,375
The same place
from where I sourced that snake long ago.

775
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:12,500
The one that bit my whole family
and killed everyone.

776
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,583
Lallan must’ve told you about it, right?

777
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,000
Did you know, Raniji?

778
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:26,250
My chacha betrayed my father
when they were business partners.

779
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,875
He stole his entire business.

780
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:32,875
So you know what?
I finished off his entire family.

781
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,041
I cannot stand betrayals,
I’m a bit fragile.

782
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:43,083
I loved you with devotion
and all the right intentions

783
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,125
with all my heart.

784
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,791
And how did you
treat me?

785
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,916
I did not feed the snake
for four whole days.

786
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:59,791
So, hungry and angry,
when the snake eventually bites,

787
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,875
the fangs go that much deeper.

788
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,500
Chances of survival next to zero.

789
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:12,416
If we are able to control a human
or a beast by their nature,

790
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:15,958
they end up turning into a puppet.

791
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:22,041
Ah!

792
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,583
Abhimanyu!

793
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:38,458
Abhimanyu!

794
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:40,958
Abhimanyu!

795
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,291
Don’t you dare touch Rani!

796
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:00,375
Okay, come on,
tell me one last thing, Raniji.

797
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:07,250
Did you ever, for even a single moment,
think that we could be together?

798
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:14,541
Yes.

799
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:17,791
I did.

800
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:21,875
Maybe some other time…

801
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,666
Maybe some other place…

802
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:29,291
If Rishu wasn’t a part of my life, then…

803
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:32,750
maybe it could've been us.

804
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,750
Okay then.

805
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:49,625
You, me
and my rosy pink Taj Mahal, that’s enough.

806
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:54,916
Life is great,
but the love of my life has another date.

807
01:14:57,666 --> 01:15:00,750
But that’s okay, Raniji.
This color also suits you very well.

808
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:05,083
I mean, if a couple of your lovers
aren’t six feet under,

809
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:07,791
can you even really call this place
the City of Love?

810
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:54,333
Do you know, Raniji?
There is one more thing that connects us.

811
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,125
Panditji’s words.

812
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:06,833
Your life is an adaptation
of Wrath of Kasauli,

813
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:10,791
while mine is inspired
by The Revenge of the Cobra.

814
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:15,541
Both of us used Panditji's pen
to write our destinies, Raniji.

815
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:20,000
You really seem to have met your match.

816
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:25,166
All that remains to be seen
is who is the bigger fan of Panditji.

817
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:31,958
The day I saw you at the clinic,

818
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,250
the first thing that caught my eye was,

819
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,375
in these soft, silky hands,
was Panditji’s book.

820
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:42,958
Then came the sky-blue dupatta,

821
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:44,916
the rose-pink kameez,

822
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:46,958
then these eyes,

823
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:52,541
and by the time I reached your lips,
I was already in love.

824
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,083
Help! Help! Help!

825
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:19,291
Help!

826
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,375
Help! My husband’s going to kill me.

827
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:28,541
Please, please help me.
My husband wants to kill me. Please.

828
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:37,458
Sir, I'm trying to tell them
since a long time

829
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:39,125
that my husband wants to kill me.

830
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:41,458
Trust me, Abhimanyu is
a really dangerous man.

831
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:45,166
He killed his whole family
using a plot from Panditji's book.

832
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:47,458
He’s a real psycho.
He’ll going to kill me--

833
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:49,708
Looks like this phrase
suits you right now,

834
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,541
“birds of a feather flock together.”

835
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,416
Are you even listening to what I’m saying?

836
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:57,833
-If you don’t catch him, if it’s too--
-So what?

837
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:01,416
He's out for blood, sir.

838
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:05,541
You’re safe here,
listening to philosophies of life.

839
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:07,041
Who is he going to kill?

840
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:12,666
Rishu.

841
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:18,458
Who?

842
01:18:21,916 --> 01:18:22,833
Rishu.

843
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:38,208
Pranaam, Elder Brother.

844
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:43,916
Didn’t I tell you that
whoever killed our Neel…

845
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:48,041
I will drag them
and throw them at your feet?

846
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:54,750
I’ll call you back in some time.

847
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:01,916
Wow!

848
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:09,708
I must admit.

849
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:16,333
The lover is extraordinary,
the madam is such a cutie.

850
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,666
They are a thing of ultimate beauty.

851
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,333
Gajab!

852
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:32,375
Come on then,
let's go and grab both of madam’s…

853
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:34,458
husbands.

854
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:35,375
Okay, sir.

855
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:37,791
What, sir?

856
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:40,041
Come on.

857
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:04,083
Chriraunji!

858
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:29,625
DINESH PANDIT

859
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:30,875
Great!

860
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:33,958
Finally, even Panditji makes his entry.

861
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:36,000
Hmm…

862
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:37,708
Okay, sir.

863
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:42,875
Hmm!

864
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:45,041
Hello?

865
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:46,875
Mm-hmm.

866
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,166
Sir, we have new information.

867
01:20:49,666 --> 01:20:50,500
Hmm.

868
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:51,041
You remember how your lover looks, right?

869
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,750
See him one last time. Come on.
Hurry up!

870
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:16,333
A patrol party is arriving in ten minutes.

871
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,791
Contact Chandni Chawk
police storeroom. Over.

872
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,500
Whom does this belong to, Raniji?

873
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,000
SAHNI CLINIC -
NAME: ABHIMANYU

874
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,833
Ab… Ab… Abhimanyu.

875
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,000
Rani Kashyap.

876
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,875
We have reasonable suspicion on you

877
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:10,250
for the double murder of Poonam Prajapati
and Abhimanyu Bharadwaj.

878
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:14,416
But I didn’t kill them.

879
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,875
And I’ll have to ask her again…

880
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,000
Where is Rishu Saxena?

881
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:32,375
Come on.

882
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:36,958
Ah!

883
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:50,500
I can’t find one husband,
and lovers are queuing up for her.

884
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:52,583
Snow White and the not so better halves.

885
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:03,208
Meenaji.

886
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:11,708
So, as per law, for how many hours
can we hold her up in custody?

887
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:16,083
Law says within 24 hours, we have
to present her in front of the magistrate.

888
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:22,708
Meenaji, you were
on your way to the court with Raniji,

889
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:24,375
but, unfortunately…

890
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:27,875
you sprained your ankle, you were in pain.

891
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:32,291
Then you sat in the car,
but the tire was flat. Hmm?

892
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:35,375
You reached the court,
but it was too late.

893
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:38,791
The court was adjourned. Then came Sunday.

894
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:43,083
-So, when will you take her to court now?
-On Monday, sir.

895
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:44,458
On Monday.

896
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:45,916
Sir!

897
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,166
And, listen,

898
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,125
don't forget
to take Mr. Discipline with you.

899
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,541
And do make very good use of him.

900
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:53,458
Hmm?

901
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:55,583
Sir.

902
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,291
You like to spit a lot of lies, don’t you?

903
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:14,791
But today, you’ll only spit blood.

904
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:22,458
Panditji says, “Bury me,
drown me, burn me alive,

905
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:25,958
but don’t let oppressors break my spirit.

906
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:29,083
This single belief can help love survive."

907
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:39,625
There's one more thing I need to share.
Go, tell this to Montu chacha as well.

908
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:43,958
If Rishu finds out
that you ever laid a hand on me,

909
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:47,583
then the man who didn’t hesitate
to cut his hand off for me

910
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:49,625
will cut your throat--

911
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:56,708
Wow! I love this passion.

912
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,416
Divine lovers!

913
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:16,625
-Hey, listen.
-Yes, sir.

914
01:26:18,916 --> 01:26:19,750
Sir.

915
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:24,750
Speak to your media friends and tell them
that Madam is being thrashed in custody.

916
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:27,333
Thrashed real bad.

917
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:29,000
But be careful.

918
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:31,708
-Nothing official or on the record.
-Sir.

919
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:34,375
Sir, thrashing in custody
doesn’t seem right.

920
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:37,250
If the media finds out about it,
they’d blow it out of proportion.

921
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:39,208
That's exactly what I want.

922
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:41,875
Agra Police
have broken all possible limits,

923
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:44,208
protocols and boundaries.

924
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:46,833
We have confirmed news.

925
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:51,041
Agra police, in an attempt
to cover up their own incompetence,

926
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:54,041
have arrested
double murder-accused Rani Kashyap,

927
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,250
who was the prime suspect
few months ago in another case.

928
01:26:57,333 --> 01:27:00,375
She is being beaten up inside the lockup
before being presented in court.

929
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:05,125
If something happens to Rani Kashyap,
who will be held responsible for that?

930
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,166
Chriraunji! Chriraunji!

931
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:26,041
I, Rishabh Saxena, willingly surrender
to the police for the crimes I committed.

932
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,750
I have one condition.

933
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:31,458
I want Rani to be present at the time
and at the place of my surrender.

934
01:27:31,541 --> 01:27:33,666
She should be able to walk
on her own two feet

935
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,958
and come to me alone so that I am assured
Rani is safe and sound.

936
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:39,250
Only then
will I surrender myself to the police,

937
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:44,125
three days from today at 8 in the evening,
on the railway bridge.

938
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:06,083
-Jai Hind, sir.
-Hmm.

939
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:14,458
I want a detailed recce
of the entire area.

940
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:16,208
-Yes, sir.
-Hmm.

941
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:21,666
And tell these forest department officials
to get out of here.

942
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:24,708
There are
crocodiles under the bridge--

943
01:28:24,791 --> 01:28:27,333
Nobody except the police
should be allowed on this spot.

944
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:28,375
Yes, sir.

945
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:32,291
Sir.

946
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:37,458
Tomorrow night at 8,
a train will cross the railway bridge.

947
01:28:37,541 --> 01:28:39,125
We’re gonna stop it.

948
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:42,583
Our force will be divided into two units.

949
01:28:42,666 --> 01:28:45,625
As soon as we see Rishu
on the railway bridge,

950
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,708
we’ll start forming a perimeter.

951
01:29:03,166 --> 01:29:06,333
Doesn't all this seem a bit too easy?

952
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,958
I don’t think it’s a good idea
to give in to Rishu’s demands

953
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:12,125
and let Rani go on the bridge by herself.

954
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:19,750
Rishu wants to play the game of chess,
but he’s up against a grand master.

955
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:24,458
According to his plan,
when Rani will walk alone on the bridge

956
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:27,500
a small police unit
will surround them from all sides.

957
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:30,541
They’ll be at our gunpoint from above

958
01:29:32,291 --> 01:29:34,208
and death swims in the water below.

959
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:37,666
They’ll flap their wings,
they’ll poke their beaks,

960
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,500
but finally…

961
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:45,291
those lovebirds will end up
exactly where they belong.

962
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:47,708
Gajab!

963
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:52,125
Move it.

964
01:30:57,666 --> 01:30:58,583
Meena!

965
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,916
Team B standby.

966
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:25,291
Wait for my command, alright?

967
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,875
Rishu! Rishu! Rishu!

968
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:51,791
You can't surrender. I won’t let you.

969
01:31:51,875 --> 01:31:54,000
We’ll run away. We’ll run away.

970
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:55,791
Move in. I repeat, move in.

971
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:57,583
-Seal the bridge
-Yes, sir.

972
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:05,708
Rani…

973
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:16,000
-Arey, where is he going?
-Who is he?

974
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,916
Someone
is breaking the siege and moving ahead.

975
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,500
Who is this idiot? He’ll spoil our plans.

976
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:46,708
The one who learned how to break
the chakravyuh in his mother's womb.

977
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:51,916
We have the DNA report, sir.
Sample does not match with the body.

978
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:01,333
Nobody move an inch.

979
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:05,291
I repeat, nobody move an inch.

980
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:08,791
Get everyone ready.
But wait for my orders.

981
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:21,250
Sir, ask everyone there to stay put.

982
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:23,791
It won’t take me more than a second
to blow their brains out.

983
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,916
Abhimanyu, you cannot escape.

984
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,625
You have been surrounded by the police.
Come on, put the gun down,

985
01:33:31,291 --> 01:33:32,833
and we’ll talk, okay?

986
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:36,583
I haven't come here to chat with you, sir.

987
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:39,375
I stand here for myself

988
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:43,666
and all those who are always left behind,
the betrayed ones.

989
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,583
The ones who've been scorched
and burned by love.

990
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,083
Love doesn’t leave anyone behind.

991
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,125
Love gives you wings and sets you free.

992
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:00,416
I’m not interested in your poetry.

993
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:10,583
I loved you with all my heart,
didn't I, Raniji?

994
01:34:11,166 --> 01:34:13,125
I told you the tragic story of my life.

995
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:17,250
I even showed you the beautiful, pink
Taj Mahal that we could see from my roof.

996
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:19,458
I laid my beating heart
out in front of you.

997
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:22,958
You could have told me the truth.
I never stopped you.

998
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:29,291
On top of that, you had the guts
to go ahead and report me to the police.

999
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,916
I warned you
before as well, Raniji,

1000
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,083
I simply can't deal with betrayal.

1001
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:44,875
Aah!

1002
01:34:45,916 --> 01:34:47,916
Ah!
Rishu!

1003
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:00,958
Rani.

1004
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:02,958
Rani, no.

1005
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,125
Drop the gun.

1006
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:07,250
-Ah!
-Rani!

1007
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:09,625
Rani, give me your hand.

1008
01:35:36,541 --> 01:35:40,666
Difficult times seem to be
a never-ending story for the Agra Police.

1009
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,875
This accident took place
as Rishu Saxena was about to surrender.

1010
01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:47,875
And Rishu and Rani
have drowned in the Yamuna river

1011
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:49,500
which is plagued with crocodiles.

1012
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:53,833
As per reports, a third unidentified man
fell into the river as well.

1013
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:56,375
It remains to be seen if this case,

1014
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:58,916
which has become
a festering wound for the UP police,

1015
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,500
would rip the system apart.

1016
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,625
Sir, this is the end of their chapter?

1017
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:06,833
A new chapter has just begun, my friend.

1018
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:10,416
-Initiate the search operation.
-Yes, sir.

1019
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:16,416

Kishoreji, would you like me
to tell you a story?

1055
01:38:22,958 --> 01:38:25,250
POLICE STATION DISTRICT - AGRA

1056
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:33,166
This indigestion
is a really dangerous thing, sir.

1057
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:38,958
People think it’s a petty little illness,
and we binge on digestives to cure it.

1058
01:38:40,541 --> 01:38:41,916
But sometimes…

1059
01:38:43,791 --> 01:38:49,125
This could be a symptom of a much larger,
underlying issue like cancer.

1060
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:52,666
This case is just like indigestion, sir.

1061
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:55,541
We look for something,
find something else,

1062
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:57,083
and the reality is totally different.

1063
01:38:57,791 --> 01:38:59,333
What are you trying to say?

1064
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:07,916
Sir, if Rani, Rishu
and Abhimanyu are actually dead,

1065
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,541
who is the one
benefiting the most from this?

1066
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:15,958
Rani.

1067
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:20,000
Rishu.

1068
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:23,541
And Abhimanyu, right?

1069
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:28,458
What do you mean?

1070
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:30,875
Because the thing is, sir,
if they were alive,

1071
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:33,250
they would have been
behind bars right now.

1072
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:36,041
Rani was in there all along.

1073
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,916
Rishu would be sentenced
for the murder of Neel.

1074
01:39:39,916 --> 01:39:41,166
And Abhimanyu?

1075
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:43,958
For the murder of his family.

1076
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:45,083
SNAKE KILLS FAMILY

1077
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:50,125
So Abhimanyu was actually
being blackmailed by a man named Lallan.

1078
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:55,333
Lallan is the same snake catcher
who helped Abhimanyu kill

1079
01:39:55,416 --> 01:39:56,583
all his family members.

1080
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:00,250
When the double murder happened,

1081
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:04,833
the same morning, Lallan went
to the clinic to meet Abhimanyu.

1082
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:08,083
We got this footage from an ATM
across the street from the clinic.

1083
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:13,208
Dead.

1084
01:40:15,708 --> 01:40:18,625
The second dead body was Poonam’s.

1085
01:40:21,041 --> 01:40:23,791
Poonam went to the clinic
that day to meet Rishu.

1086
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:27,916
She knew what he had been hiding.

1087
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,625
She too was killed.

1088
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:35,916
Perfect victims.

1089
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:40,750
And our dear compounder Abhimanyuji

1090
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:43,791
topped his class in biology.

1091
01:40:45,291 --> 01:40:49,458
So he knew how to burn those bodies,
how to fake their identities,

1092
01:40:49,541 --> 01:40:52,750
place items in such a way that
they could not be identified easily.

1093
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,708
But the plot thickens a lot more, sir.

1094
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:16,625
Thanks to an unnoticed camera
at Bobby's garage,

1095
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:18,166
we found some more footage.

1096
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:22,250
According to the footage,
Rani and Abhimanyu came back home

1097
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:24,041
at around 7 in the evening.

1098
01:41:24,708 --> 01:41:26,875
And then, exactly 15 minutes later,

1099
01:41:27,375 --> 01:41:30,291
someone was seen entering
Abhimanyu’s house that day.

1100
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:31,875
Rishu.

1101
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:37,458
And maybe that evening
among the three of them,

1102
01:41:38,541 --> 01:41:39,625
a plan was discussed.

1103
01:41:40,958 --> 01:41:42,166
Because after that,

1104
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:43,958
at 10 in the night,

1105
01:41:44,041 --> 01:41:46,708
Raniji, portraying herself
as a damsel in distress,

1106
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:48,208
was seen running in the rain.

1107
01:41:51,833 --> 01:41:53,333
Help! Help!

1108
01:41:53,916 --> 01:41:56,750
Please, please help me,
my husband wants to kill me.

1109
01:41:58,041 --> 01:42:01,333
And the interesting thing is that, sir,
after Rani left the house,

1110
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:04,166
two more people were seen leaving
from Abhimanyu’s house.

1111
01:42:05,416 --> 01:42:07,958
Rishu and Abhimanyu.

1112
01:42:13,958 --> 01:42:15,625
That's why I’m convinced, sir…

1113
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:20,000
on that night…

1114
01:42:21,416 --> 01:42:23,000
a conspiracy was surely hatched.

1115
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:29,333
So you're saying their plan was
to jump from the bridge

1116
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:32,958
into the river
while everyone was watching them?

1117
01:42:34,666 --> 01:42:36,166
But there were crocodiles below.

1118
01:42:37,041 --> 01:42:38,041
They would’ve died.

1119
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,166
What kind of a plan is this?

1120
01:42:42,375 --> 01:42:43,750
That is the mystery, sir.

1121
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:47,791
One question still haunts me today,

1122
01:42:49,208 --> 01:42:53,083
why did Rishu
specifically choose the railway bridge?

1123
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:55,583
That’s not the mystery.
That’s the whole case.

1124
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:58,416
Montu…

1125
01:43:00,458 --> 01:43:01,291
Sir.

1126
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:05,041
I know you were
personally invested in this.

1127
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:09,250
But let it go now.
Media is pressurizing us a lot.

1128
01:43:09,333 --> 01:43:11,208
Close this case file without any delay.

1129
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:15,208
Because, the more you try to dig,

1130
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:18,250
the more this department
will be scrutinized.

1131
01:43:21,458 --> 01:43:24,125
Sir, sir, we can't close
this case yet again.

1132
01:43:24,208 --> 01:43:27,250
Please, all I’m asking is
for is a little more time, sir. Sir!

1133
01:43:31,166 --> 01:43:32,208
Arey, yaar!

1134
01:43:45,416 --> 01:43:48,125
Closing the case file
doesn’t mean the case is closed.

1135
01:43:48,208 --> 01:43:49,125
We both know that.

1136
01:43:51,708 --> 01:43:56,833
No matter how deep you bury the truth,
the truth will come back to haunt you.

1137
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:00,875
And don’t forget…

1138
01:44:02,666 --> 01:44:04,333
after all, you’re The Woodpecker.

1139
01:44:05,083 --> 01:44:06,000
Hmm?

1140
01:44:29,416 --> 01:44:35,125
SIX MONTHS LATER

1141
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,916
Rishu! Rishu!

1142
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Rishu!

1143
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:45,666
-Raniji!
-Rishu!

1144
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:49,166
Raniji! Raniji! Raniji!

1145
01:45:09,791 --> 01:45:11,083
Good evening.

1146
01:45:16,708 --> 01:45:19,625
No. This isn't how you spell it.

1147
01:45:24,208 --> 01:45:25,916
What happened? Everything all right?

1148
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:28,416
Yes, I'm fine.

1149
01:45:29,708 --> 01:45:31,375
Just a little tired, that’s all.

1150
01:45:35,375 --> 01:45:38,500
-Alright, you finish these, I’ll be back.
-Okay, ma'am.

1151
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,708
-You want some water?
-No, thanks.

1152
01:45:45,916 --> 01:45:48,541
We’re late.
Hope class hasn't started.

1153
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:51,375
SHARDA PRIMARY SCHOOL, DEOSAR

1154
01:45:51,458 --> 01:45:52,333
Okay,

1155
01:45:52,416 --> 01:45:55,833
so now I want all of you to submit
your homework notebooks here on my desk.

1156
01:45:55,916 --> 01:45:57,625
-Okay?
-Okay, ma'am.

1157
01:46:00,916 --> 01:46:02,166
-Ma'am.
-Very good.

1158
01:46:02,791 --> 01:46:03,625
Ma'am.

1159
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:08,208
-Have you completed your homework?
-Yes, ma'am.

1160
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:33,875
CHAKIA, BIHAR

1161
01:46:33,958 --> 01:46:37,250
Listen,
did you order something?

1162
01:46:37,333 --> 01:46:39,333
A book was delivered just now.

1163
01:46:39,958 --> 01:46:42,291
There's a photo
of a crocodile on the front cover.

1164
01:46:48,916 --> 01:46:51,166
THE CROCODILE'S TRAP
DINESH PANDIT

1165
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:03,875
"Only three copies
of this book have been printed.

1166
01:47:03,958 --> 01:47:05,500
And you are reading one of them."

1167
01:47:11,666 --> 01:47:13,291
"Suraj and Arjun made a decision.

1168
01:47:13,375 --> 01:47:16,000
If they had to escape
from the clutches of the police,

1169
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:19,375
they would have to jump
right into the jaws of the crocodiles.

1170
01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:21,500
They finally managed to find a place

1171
01:47:21,583 --> 01:47:24,291
which was full of
blood-thirsty crocodiles.

1172
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:27,083
And the plan to protect themselves
from these crocodiles

1173
01:47:27,166 --> 01:47:29,166
began three days before the incident."

1174
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:31,541
FIRST NIGHT

1175
01:47:33,458 --> 01:47:37,208
Rishuji, do you know why
in Panditji’s book

1176
01:47:37,291 --> 01:47:39,666
Suraj and Arjun
gradually increased the amount of meat

1177
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:42,125
that they fed to the crocodiles
on a daily basis?

1178
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:45,583
So that they remain a little hungry
and force the crocodiles to think

1179
01:47:45,666 --> 01:47:48,166
the farther away they go…

1180
01:47:49,416 --> 01:47:51,250
the more meat they can eat.

1181
01:47:51,333 --> 01:47:53,500
We need to distract them
from the railway bridge.

1182
01:47:54,083 --> 01:47:56,958
That is why we will drop the meat
two kilometers away from here.

1183
01:48:25,375 --> 01:48:29,458
SECOND NIGHT

1184
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:47,458
THIRD NIGHT

1185
01:48:57,958 --> 01:49:01,500
A 12-kilometre area
all around the bridge is clear.

1186
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:05,250
And the place where we decide to get out
of the water is completely up to us.

1187
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:10,750
Tomorrow, when you tell Raniji
to jump, will she agree?

1188
01:49:10,833 --> 01:49:11,791
Definitely.

1189
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,375
Is your trust in your love that deep?

1190
01:49:16,625 --> 01:49:18,125
I’m trusting you as well.

1191
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:21,583
I know you love my Rani so much

1192
01:49:21,666 --> 01:49:24,125
that you wouldn’t hesitate
for a second to get rid of me.

1193
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:28,000
But the real question is,
why haven’t you done it yet?

1194
01:49:29,375 --> 01:49:32,791
It's because I'd rather have Raniji
come willingly into my arms someday.

1195
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:52,125
-Now. Okay? Hmm?
-Yes.

1196
01:50:00,375 --> 01:50:02,250
"If you found
the story interesting,

1197
01:50:02,333 --> 01:50:04,250
wait until you reach the climax.

1198
01:50:04,333 --> 01:50:06,416
Come to Tota-Maina Lovers Point.

1199
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:10,541
Deosar, Himachal Pradesh,
on 20th March, 6 in the evening."

1200
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:14,708
Remember, you need to walk
at least 30 minutes every day, okay?

1201
01:50:14,791 --> 01:50:16,000
Thank you, Doctor sahab.

1202
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:35,958
"Tota-Maina
Lovers Point, at 6."

1203
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,666
Baap re!

1204
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,750
That’s a long way down,
right?

1205
01:50:53,833 --> 01:50:55,208
Just be careful.

1206
01:51:03,916 --> 01:51:08,458
Panditji says,
“Red signifies jealousy and anger,

1207
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:10,791
blood too is red.

1208
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,750
Perhaps it's apt that red signifies love.“

1209
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,333
Panditji.

1210
01:51:18,208 --> 01:51:21,625
Isn't it a bloody unfaithful color?

1211
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:25,666
But just one thing
brings red into my life now.

1212
01:51:26,541 --> 01:51:28,125
The rose adorning your hair.

1213
01:51:29,625 --> 01:51:32,791
-The thing is, it’s turned black now.
-What?

1214
01:51:33,833 --> 01:51:36,875
Your red rose, it’s turned black now.

1215
01:51:43,625 --> 01:51:45,625
Raniji, come here first
and then we’ll talk.

1216
01:51:46,791 --> 01:51:48,125
One more step…

1217
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:51,458
and I’ll jump off the cliff.

1218
01:51:52,625 --> 01:51:53,583
Raniji…

1219
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:57,875
Rishu was right all along,
I didn’t believe him.

1220
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,875
Killing someone
has become a game for you, isn't it?

1221
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:07,458
Lallan, Poonam, huh?
They were never a part of our plan, right?

1222
01:52:08,041 --> 01:52:10,041
Raniji, Lallan and Poonam
were risky for us.

1223
01:52:10,125 --> 01:52:13,416
Life gave me a golden opportunity
to forget the mistakes of the past

1224
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:16,208
and start a new life with you
and I grabbed it with both hands.

1225
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:19,666
Just for you.

1226
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:23,833
Tell me one thing honestly.
We are… Were you ever happy with me?

1227
01:52:24,583 --> 01:52:27,083
I was. I was really happy.

1228
01:52:27,166 --> 01:52:31,791
Then, Raniji, because of a few mistakes,
ple… please don’t do this.

1229
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:35,875
I’ll pay the price for all my sins,
but, Raniji, please…

1230
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:38,416
Please don’t jump off,
what are you doing?

1231
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,541
-Come back here.
-Arey, just stop this drama.

1232
01:52:47,541 --> 01:52:50,958
If she was really going to jump off,
she wouldn’t have sent me an invite.

1233
01:52:52,541 --> 01:52:55,125
Tell me, Raniji,
why have you called me here?

1234
01:52:55,708 --> 01:52:59,041
So that both of us
end this chase once and for all.

1235
01:53:08,916 --> 01:53:10,708
Both of us have used Panditji’s pen

1236
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:12,750
to write the pages of our destiny, Raniji.

1237
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,208
Rishu! Ah!

1238
01:53:20,291 --> 01:53:21,916
-Rani! Rani!
-Raniji!

1239
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,500
-Rani!
-Raniji!

1240
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,833
Rani!

1241
01:53:25,625 --> 01:53:26,458
Raniji!

1242
01:53:27,458 --> 01:53:29,083
-Rani!
-Raniji!

1243
01:53:32,458 --> 01:53:33,416
Raniji!

1244
01:53:34,791 --> 01:53:38,666
Now if we want to live,
the world needs to see us die.

1245
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:40,333
"The Crocodile's Trap."

1246
01:53:41,458 --> 01:53:42,416
Dinesh Pandit?

1247
01:53:45,625 --> 01:53:46,458
Rani…

1248
01:53:49,125 --> 01:53:52,708
That's impossible.
We are not going to repeat this madness.

1249
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:54,916
Rani, please try to understand
what I’m saying.

1250
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,750
I’ve known Montu chacha
since I was a kid.

1251
01:53:57,333 --> 01:54:01,083
If he finds out we're alive, he'll drag us
from the depths of hell and lock us up.

1252
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:03,416
And your plan is
to take a shortcut straight to hell

1253
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:06,583
by following a ridiculous plan
from this book. No way, Rishu. No.

1254
01:54:06,666 --> 01:54:08,291
And the things we’ve already done?

1255
01:54:09,166 --> 01:54:11,416
The Revenge of the Cobra,
Wrath of Kasauli.

1256
01:54:12,416 --> 01:54:16,416
The three of us lost our senses long ago
when we became Panditji’s disciples.

1257
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,208
There is a difference, sir.

1258
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:22,416
Panditji’s books taught us how to live,

1259
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,416
but you ended up learning
how to take lives.

1260
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:26,250
That’s the difference.

1261
01:54:31,083 --> 01:54:31,916
Yes.

1262
01:54:55,541 --> 01:54:58,333
Over there.

1263
01:56:18,458 --> 01:56:21,916
Rishu! Rishu! Rishu!

1264
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,708
-Rishu!
-Raniji!

1265
01:56:24,333 --> 01:56:25,458
Rishu!

1266
01:56:25,541 --> 01:56:27,125
-Raniji!
-Rishu!

1267
01:56:27,208 --> 01:56:29,625
Rishu! Rishu!

1268
01:56:31,791 --> 01:56:33,750
-Rishu!
-Raniji!

1269
01:56:33,833 --> 01:56:35,166
Rishu!

1270
01:56:36,166 --> 01:56:37,833
-Rishu!
-Raniji!

1271
01:56:37,916 --> 01:56:39,083
-Rishu!
-Raniji!

1272
01:56:43,708 --> 01:56:45,750
Raniji! Raniji! Raniji!

1273
01:56:45,833 --> 01:56:47,083
Rishu!

1274
01:56:49,041 --> 01:56:50,750
Rishu.

1275
01:56:51,666 --> 01:56:52,500
Ri…

1276
01:57:03,541 --> 01:57:04,625
Raniji.

1277
01:57:15,916 --> 01:57:18,375
Was killing Rishu
the only choice you had?

1278
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:24,125
You killed someone as well
for the sake of love.

1279
01:57:25,083 --> 01:57:26,750
What did I do that is so wrong?

1280
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:29,416
I did the same thing
you and Rishu once did.

1281
01:57:31,083 --> 01:57:33,041
Is it fair to say
the murder you committed was love

1282
01:57:33,125 --> 01:57:34,625
and the one I committed was wrong?

1283
01:57:34,708 --> 01:57:37,083
You don’t even know the meaning of love.

1284
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:39,416
You never really loved me, you know that?

1285
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:40,708
-No, please--
-All you did

1286
01:57:40,791 --> 01:57:43,416
was play a game
of snakes and ladders with our lives.

1287
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,333
You…

1288
01:57:45,208 --> 01:57:47,458
I made a huge mistake.

1289
01:57:49,041 --> 01:57:50,833
Okay.

1290
01:57:51,916 --> 01:57:53,958
Let me tell you one more truth, Abhimanyu.

1291
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:58,333
I never thought I could be happy living
my life with anyone else other than Rishu.

1292
01:58:00,208 --> 01:58:01,583
But after that incident…

1293
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:05,375
I thought you are the one.

1294
01:58:07,208 --> 01:58:09,833
I could feel there was
something special between us.

1295
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:10,791
Something.

1296
01:58:14,083 --> 01:58:16,333
I never thought you'd betray me.

1297
01:58:19,166 --> 01:58:22,750
And this betrayal is something
even I won’t be able to live with.

1298
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:28,666
I made a mistake, Raniji.

1299
01:58:31,375 --> 01:58:32,916
So, now your punishment is…

1300
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,208
that you can never have me.

1301
01:58:37,541 --> 01:58:39,375
You might have won me over…

1302
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:43,791
but you can never win against me.

1303
01:58:48,708 --> 01:58:50,666
-Raniji, no, wait!
-Raniji.

1304
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:51,708
Raniji!

1305
01:58:54,875 --> 01:58:56,041
Raniji!

1306
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:58,750
Raniji! Raniji!

1307
01:59:03,958 --> 01:59:06,083
Send the search
and rescue team right away.

1308
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:12,500
Abhimanyuji, let's go.

1309
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,750
There is a lot of red
accounted for in your ledger.

1310
01:59:17,125 --> 01:59:19,958
Poonam Prajapati, Lallan Barua,

1311
01:59:20,041 --> 01:59:23,291
Ashok Bharadwaj and family,
Rishabh Saxena.

1312
01:59:24,916 --> 01:59:25,958
And maybe…

1313
01:59:28,041 --> 01:59:29,333
Rani Kashyap, too.

1314
01:59:32,083 --> 01:59:33,125
Take him away.

1315
01:59:48,041 --> 01:59:50,916
…are requested to board
the aircraft from gate number two.

1316
01:59:52,916 --> 01:59:55,750
Sir, we searched everywhere
but could not find the body.

1317
02:00:09,375 --> 02:00:12,708
What happened, sir?
Couldn’t find the body?

1318
02:01:18,166 --> 02:01:19,833
"Compared to the glow
on your face,

1319
02:01:19,916 --> 02:01:21,458
everything else just seems dull.

1320
02:01:21,541 --> 02:01:24,625
You’ve now become an idol
in my heart’s sacred temple."

Panditji says,

1334
02:02:51,291 --> 02:02:55,000
"Relations are maintained
within the boundaries of right and wrong.

1335
02:02:55,083 --> 02:02:59,000
But true love can blossom
only beyond these constructs."

1336
02:03:10,541 --> 02:03:12,500
I was the one who taught them that.

1337
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:15,958
To live peacefully
one needs to die in the eyes of the world,

1338
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:17,208
but they used it on me.

1339
02:03:18,583 --> 02:03:20,541
It wasn’t you, it was your father.

1340
02:03:21,875 --> 02:03:25,458
The Crocodile's Trap,
Dinesh Pandit.

1341
02:03:28,958 --> 02:03:30,916
Arey, sir,
how did you figure out…

1342
02:03:32,458 --> 02:03:33,708
that Panditji is my father?

1343
02:03:43,333 --> 02:03:45,125
Gajab!
