1
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
Brother!

2
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,720
Get up.

3
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,240
-Come on.
-Hello, sister-in-law.

4
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,240
...and keep them in control.

5
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,640
Hey! Don't interrupt me! Get lost!

6
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,120
<i>Sources have revealed that</i>

7
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,560
<i>30 bodies have been found 12 days
after the Anantpur Massacre.</i>

8
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,560
<i>It is being estimated that the massacre</i>

9
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,440
<i>is the result of an internal conflict
between local groups.</i>

10
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,640
<i>However, if the sources are to believed,</i>

11
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,240
<i>the issue seems to be
way more complicated.</i>

12
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,480
{\an8}<i>The CEO of Sunshine Group,
Suresh Krishnamoorthy</i>

13
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,760
<i>was arrested on Wednesday</i>

14
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,840
<i>for possession of close
to 120 kilograms of narcotics</i>

15
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,080
<i>found at multiple construction
sites listed with the company.</i>

16
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,680
<i>Further investigations reveal
that this is the third such arrest</i>

17
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
<i>in a span of a month</i>

18
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,800
<i>linked to the increasing
narcotics trade in the country,</i>

19
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
<i>leaving the police department baffled.</i>

20
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
Nayakudu!

21
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Nayakudu!

22
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,800
Nayakudu, forgive me!

23
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,360
Nayakudu!
Forgive me!

24
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
<i>The police think that Nayak
is just a figment of the imagination.</i>

25
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,840
<i>A story.</i>

26
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,400
<i>But I'm telling you...</i>

27
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,000
<i>Nayak...</i>

28
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,880
<i>Is...</i>

29
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,920
<i>Coming.</i>

30
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
I fell asleep...

31
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,560
in someone's presence...

32
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,080
for the first time.

33
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,680
Feels nice.

34
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,480
Bhumi!

35
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,120
Hey! Are you alright?

36
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,880
Here's your stuff.

37
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,440
It was in the hotel room.

38
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,040
How many men did you
see at Nayak's hideout?

39
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,320
Seven or eight.

40
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Give me the exact number.
Seven or eight?

41
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,720
Sir, how can I give you the exact number?

42
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Why?

43
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,000
You were an undercover agent.

44
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,160
You were trained, no?

45
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,920
Sir, I was locked up in a room.

46
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,600
Chained to the bed.

47
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,560
So, there could be more?

48
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,480
It's possible, sir.

49
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,000
Then what is the point of saying,
"Seven or eight"?

50
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,440
-Sir!
-Is she in there?

51
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,360
Yes, sir.

52
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,120
And what were they talking about?

53
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
Are you hurt?

54
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,240
Medical examiner has
done a full-body check-up.

55
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,400
No sign of any injuries.

56
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
Sir, the DCP wants to
meet you in his office.

57
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,800
Bhumi, are you alright?

58
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,680
Yes, yes, she is totally fine!

59
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
We haven't done the
psychological evaluation yet.

60
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,600
We'll do it at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

61
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,720
And who the hell are you?

62
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,680
Dilip Nambiar.

63
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,120
Head of Intelligence Unit.

64
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,880
Why are you questioning her?

65
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
I am her commanding officer!

66
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,080
She works for me.

67
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,640
Bhumi works for Crime Branch, sir.

68
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,160
And I have instructions from
DCP Alam to record her statement.

69
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,360
Sir, please, sir!

70
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,640
Bhumi...

71
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,200
don't worry. I'm here.

72
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,120
Yes, sir.

73
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,160
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,160
ACP Jason Fernandez, sir.

75
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
Khurshid Alam.

76
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,520
Sir, why are we questioning Bhumi?

77
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,680
She's just come back
after seven days, sir.

78
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,720
She has managed to survive alone
in the midst of those criminals!

79
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,560
And now some joker is interrogating her
like she's a criminal?

80
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,480
We can't do this to her, sir!
We can't put her in that position.

81
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,920
We did not put her there, Fernandez.
You did.

82
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
You were handling this case.

83
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,280
Bhumi went missing.
DCP Mathur had to be replaced by me.

84
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
These are your failures.

85
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,400
Because you think you are
smarter than everybody else,

86
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,480
so you don't have to follow procedures.

87
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,560
This case has been assigned to
Officer Nambiar and his Intelligence Unit.

88
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
And you will not interfere.

89
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,920
Sir, she has just come back.

90
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,920
-I'll have to at least...
-Are we clear?

91
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,040
Jaya Shinde.

92
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,880
The department issued
you a phone for that identity.

93
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
<i>-Did you have it with you?
-Yes, sir.</i>

94
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
Was the number
of the officer in charge on it?

95
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
Yes, as the pimp.

96
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,320
Did you try calling it?

97
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,960
Sir, Nayak had hacked into that phone.

98
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,520
He would've found out about all the calls
and messages I'd received.

99
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,280
Coming to the agreement
between you and Nayak.

100
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,160
When you made him the offer...

101
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,440
what was your location?

102
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,440
In the... room.

103
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,280
I was on the bed.

104
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,640
And Nayak?
Was he on the bed as well?

105
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
No.

106
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,560
He was sitting on a chair.

107
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,360
And what did he say?

108
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,280
He said he didn't believe
I was a call girl.

109
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,960
I thought it was all over.
I thought he was gonna kill me.

110
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,760
That was when you made the offer?

111
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,400
Yes.
And the next day, when I woke up...

112
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,400
No, no. That day, that time.
The agreement?

113
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,280
Didn't I just tell you?

114
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,280
Detail. Detail. This is most important.

115
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,080
I told him I was a cop.

116
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm sure he already knew.
But I said it anyway.

117
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,240
I told him I'd work for him.

118
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,560
Be his mole in the police department.
Give him all the inside information.

119
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,320
And?

120
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,640
That's it. He left.

121
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
-And the next day, when I woke up...
-That is today?

122
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,080
Yes, sir.
There was no one there.

123
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,440
What?

124
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
That's very simple.

125
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,360
You just said it and he left you alone?

126
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,640
Just like that?

127
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,760
Nayak, the criminal mastermind...

128
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,560
fell for your trap?

129
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,160
Are you that smart?

130
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
My life was in danger, sir.

131
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,760
I said what I could.

132
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,160
And he just...

133
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,160
lapped it up?

134
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,320
Really?

135
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
What are you trying to say, Fernandez?

136
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,440
It doesn't add up, sir.

137
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,080
Nayak is a very smart man, sir.

138
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,320
Why would he confide in her?

139
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,240
Who's she?

140
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
She's just a constable.

141
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,720
She's also our undercover agent

142
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,200
and the centerpiece of the
police's Anti-Nayak operation.

143
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,120
Nayak must've thought...

144
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,280
that he could get information
on this operation through Bhumi.

145
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,200
I agree with you.

146
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,720
But do you think he'd trust her

147
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,240
to come here and not tell us
everything she just did?

148
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,080
You don't trust me, sir?

149
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,400
Your statement isn't convincing, Bhumi.

150
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,320
Alright.

151
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,440
Why don't you answer
one question as well, sir?

152
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,960
Where's Sasya?

153
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,400
What do you mean?

154
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,400
How is he connected to any of this?

155
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,240
No, you had said Sasya's
one of your guys, right?

156
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,080
You let him out to get more
information on Nayak, right?

157
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,880
Why has he joined hands with Nayak again?

158
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,640
You saw Sasya?

159
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,520
I saw Sasya there, sir.

160
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,960
I met him.

161
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,360
He's working with Nayak again.

162
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,840
And you told me Sasya's in Hyderabad?

163
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,480
Sir, he's been missing
for the last 36 hours.

164
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,840
My team has been trying to track him.

165
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,240
We're... we're on it, sir.

166
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,760
When did you see Sasya?

167
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,920
Yesterday.

168
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,360
He was there last night.

169
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,760
This is really unexpected, sir.

170
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,520
Please step out of the room, ACP.

171
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Right away.

172
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,720
Did you find anything?

173
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,680
Then what the fuck are you doing?

174
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,640
Carry on, Nambiar.

175
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,640
Yes, sir.

176
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
Did you see Sasya again?

177
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,240
No, sir.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Sir...

179
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,600
I think she might be
hiding something, sir.

180
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,560
She isn't telling us the whole truth.

181
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,440
And I have a feeling she
might be compromised.

182
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,640
That's why we are evaluating her.

183
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,880
And now, we'll also have to check...

184
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,760
if you're compromised or not.

185
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,400
So...

186
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,560
I'm ordering an inquiry on you.

187
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,320
Sir, Nayak's sketch is ready.

188
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,960
-Send Bhumi in.
-Yes, sir

189
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Please wait here.

190
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,400
Sir, this is the first time we have
some visual representation of Nayak.

191
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,400
Well done, Bhumi.

192
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,600
Well done!

193
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,920
Let's not try to fix something
that isn't broken.

194
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,080
We'll continue what we're doing.

195
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,080
You will continue...

196
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,840
making appearances
on that very street.

197
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
And let's hope that
Nayak picks you up again.

198
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,080
And when he does...

199
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,880
you must ensure that he doesn't find out

200
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,880
that the police know about your deal.

201
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,720
Yes, sir.

202
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,760
"The lion will ride the rat!"

203
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,960
Dumbass! Won't the
rat die if the lion rides it?

204
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,320
Bloody writers!

205
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,280
Hey!

206
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,560
-Why the hell are you still here?
-What?

207
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,040
-So?
-Does your father own this road?

208
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,040
Yes!

209
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,640
I'll put you behind bars!

210
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,000
You?

211
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,240
Did you forget who I am?

212
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,640
I don't know who you are!

213
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,200
And you don't know who I am either!

214
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
I'm a big shot with big contacts!

215
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,080
Idiot.

216
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,640
You really forgot who I am, eh?

217
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,800
Buzz off!

218
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,160
-Ruined my mood!
-Get lost!

219
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,840
<i>Bhumi is on the street.</i>

220
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,000
Watch her closely.

221
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,520
Hey, hottie! Wanna join me?

222
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,760
<i>How much?</i>

223
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,040
<i>How much do you think?</i>

224
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,440
One grand.

225
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,880
Look closely.

226
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,280
2,500 for the whole night.

227
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
It'll just be me.

228
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,760
No sharing.

229
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,640
You really think you can last all night?

230
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,600
Two grand.

231
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,960
Buzz off!

232
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,360
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

233
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,840
<i>No sign of Nayak, sir.</i>

234
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,840
<i>Oh, my Pardesi, don't take my heart away.</i>

235
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,200
<i>If you do, never come back!</i>

236
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,440
<i>And if you leave, never come back!</i>

237
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,560
Three cups of tea.

238
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,680
Hi!

239
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,240
You work for Ismail <i>Seth</i>?

240
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,760
Who's Ismail <i>Seth</i>?

241
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,120
Who's your handler?

242
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,520
I handle myself.

243
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,440
Hey!

244
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,240
Stop fooling around.

245
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
Come on, tell us!

246
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,400
How's that possible?

247
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,600
It's possible.

248
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,400
You handle the work yourself?

249
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,440
The money as well?

250
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,440
You take all the money?

251
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,080
I'm the one who does all the work.

252
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,760
Why would I pay any commission?

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,160
Hey!

254
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,640
Who the hell are you?

255
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,680
Bloody hell!

256
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,200
Why the hell are we paying commission?

257
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,680
Did you record all your calls with Sasya?

258
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,800
Yes.

259
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,280
Has the Intelligence team
analyzed these calls?

260
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,200
No.

261
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,400
But why?
This is standard procedure.

262
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,680
I know the goddamn standard procedure.

263
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,560
But why would we involve the Intelligence
team if there was nothing suspicious?

264
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,560
But you're not in Intelligence.

265
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,200
How can you say if it
was suspicious or not?

266
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,280
So, people outside the
Intelligence team are not intelligent?

267
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
Please cooperate, sir.

268
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,200
Please fix your goddamn questions.

269
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Okay.

270
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
Did you purposely hide the recordings
of the call from the Intelligence team?

271
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,880
What?

272
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,320
No, I did not!

273
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,200
Can you prove that?

274
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,000
How am I supposed to prove that, Nambiar?
Why don't you enlighten me?

275
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,840
Come on!

276
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,840
Next question.

277
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,360
Listen!

278
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,920
Are you working for a gangster<i>?</i>

279
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,480
Gangster?

280
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,640
Yeah, keep up the act.

281
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,840
I know how cops work.

282
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,760
If you really are working for a gangster<i>,</i>
tell him to get you your house back.

283
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,320
The one your ex-husband has latched on to.

284
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,680
Do it.

285
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,880
I don't need a gangster to get it back.

286
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,520
Right, you just need your sister.

287
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,240
Look!
It's your apartment and your husband.

288
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,040
Don't you dare try to
pimp me out for it!

289
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,480
Tell me something, Rupa.

290
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,840
If I really were to pimp you out...

291
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,320
do you really think you could do well?

292
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,080
What are you saying?

293
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,800
Is that what you want me to do?

294
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,480
You wouldn't be able to do it.

295
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,240
It's not your cup of tea.

296
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,200
Hey!

297
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,640
You...

298
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,360
Watch your tongue, Bhumi!

299
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,760
-Bhumi!
-Bye!

300
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,560
What's wrong?

301
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,080
You don't like me?

302
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,560
You don't like me touching you?

303
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,080
You really don't like it, do you?
Bloody whore!

304
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,720
Hey! Stop!

305
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,240
Hey! Why are you following me?

306
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,440
Who sent you?

307
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,480
I know every single detail
about who's touched you!

308
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,400
Get lost!

309
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,080
Hey!

310
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,400
You can run, but you can't hide!

311
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
That's her.

312
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,520
Hey, why are you running away? Stop!

313
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,280
-Hey!
<i>-Stop!</i>

314
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,240
<i>Stop!</i>

315
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,840
Where do you think you're going?

316
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,000
<i>What did you say to my girls?</i>

317
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
If you're the one who
does all the work...

318
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,560
why would you pay the pim...

319
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,480
What did you say?

320
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,480
Look, I'm not talking to you.

321
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,480
You're gonna talk?

322
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,080
I'm the one who does the talking!

323
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,440
I'm the controller... of this area.

324
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:03,577
If I see you again,
I'll thrash you so hard,

325
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:05,600
no one will ever take
you for a ride again.

326
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,680
Get lost!

327
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,760
Oh, you're gonna...

328
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,640
stare?

329
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,040
You fucking whore!

330
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,120
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

331
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:19,520
Looks like Bhumi is in trouble, guys.

332
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,480
Okay, copy that.

333
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,640
But why isn't Bhumi giving us a signal?

334
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,920
-Mhatre...
-Yes, sir?

335
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Go, have a look.

336
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,920
Fucking slut!

337
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,520
Didn't you hear him?

338
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,960
Go on!
Fuck off!

339
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,200
Look, I'm...

340
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,040
-warning...
-Just shut up and listen.

341
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,200
I will work on this street.

342
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,760
I've made my decision.

343
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,840
You can do whatever you want.

344
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,040
Hey!

345
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,800
Come on!
Give it another shot!

346
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,840
Come on!

347
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,560
Come on!

348
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,960
Bhumi! Bhumi!

349
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,280
What the hell was going on?

350
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,480
-Nothing!
-Why didn't you give us a signal?

351
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,440
I don't need cops to
deal with scummy fucking pimps!

352
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:13,360
I can handle them.

353
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,640
<i>Nothing has changed.</i>

354
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,440
But I won't be commanding
the operation anymore.

355
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,080
ACP Jadhav will do it.

356
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,280
All the best.

357
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,800
Thank you.

358
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
I need to talk to you
for a couple of minutes.

359
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,120
Why can't you say it here
in front of everyone... sir?

360
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,440
Okay.

361
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,800
I don't think I trust you.

362
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,600
I think you're hiding something.

363
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,360
Alright.

364
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,680
You can file an official complaint
if that's what you feel.

365
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,400
This is a really dangerous
operation, Bhumi.

366
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,360
You have no idea.

367
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,360
You make one small mistake...

368
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,960
and you could end up in deep shit.

369
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,320
I can handle myself, sir.

370
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,120
But I can't help you with your jealousy.

371
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,600
You're my greatest achievement, Bhumi.

372
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,120
Do your best.

373
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,080
-This is my corner, you leave!
-Shut up, you old woman!

374
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,280
-How dare you say that to me!
-Both of you shut up!

375
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,960
-She started it!
-I didn't, you bitch!

376
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,760
Hey!

377
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,960
Hello!

378
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,920
Hey, darling!

379
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,920
Excuse me?

380
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,720
How much for the night?

381
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,280
Seven grand.

382
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,240
What?

383
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,480
Alright. Okay.

384
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,480
-Alright.
-What "Alright"?

385
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,480
Nothing's alright.

386
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,400
Darling, please tell us
if you're not in the mood.

387
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,320
It's about one night, man.
What does it matter?

388
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,720
She's being a bitch, man.

389
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Listen.

390
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,280
It's a friend's bachelor party.

391
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,080
The groom's the only one who'll do it...

392
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,480
if, and that's a big "if",
he's interested in you.

393
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,880
But I think I'm interested
in this other friend of yours.

394
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,960
I'll come if he's coming.

395
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,360
What the hell are you talking about?

396
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,680
Will you?

397
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,440
Sorry.

398
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,680
Actually, I don't pay for sex.

399
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,440
It's my rule.

400
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,920
Hey, madam!

401
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,680
Sure?

402
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Yeah.

403
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,040
Sure.

404
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,520
Give me your phone.

405
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,680
What the...

406
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,800
If you ever feel like
breaking your rule...

407
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,800
call me.

408
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
She's ruined my bloody mood!

409
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,200
Why the hell are you grinning?

410
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,800
Leena...

411
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,360
What's happening? Any update?

412
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,280
Nothing on Nayak or his men, sir.

413
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,760
Hey, let me go!

414
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,960
Stop!

415
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,520
Look at me!

416
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,840
Pick her up!

417
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,600
Move.

418
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Next time...

419
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,480
I'll mess up your cherry so bad...

420
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,560
you won't be able to work on any street.

421
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,160
An insect eats grass.

422
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,680
A small animal eats the insect.

423
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,720
The large animal devours the smaller one.

424
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,920
Which one are you?

425
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,440
You tell me.

426
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,200
Did you bring any money?

427
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,760
No, right?

428
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,080
You're the one who must answer.

429
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,520
<i>Seth</i>, they're here to see you.

430
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,280
Ismail <i>Seth</i>.

431
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,800
What's wrong?

432
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,960
Nothing, sir. The Inspector requests that
you meet him at the police station.

433
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,920
He says he has a special message for you.

434
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,040
Hello, Mr. Shinde. What is it?

435
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,080
Ismail <i>Seth</i>!

436
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,840
One of your controllers,
I have a message for him.

437
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,520
Please, let's talk inside.

438
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,960
Salaam, Ismail <i>Seth</i>!

439
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,800
Are...

440
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,000
Are you all right, sir?

441
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,240
I have a special message for you, Tipu.

442
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,600
-Tell me, sir.
-Give me your hand.

443
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,880
Hand?

444
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,880
Hey! Stop! Stop!

445
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,480
Don't move your hand.

446
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,280
No!

447
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,640
Please, forgive me! Please!

448
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,440
Please!

449
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,080
Forgive me.

450
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,960
I think you got my message.

451
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,400
Yes, I did.

452
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,560
But...

453
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,120
after...

454
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,480
that...

455
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,720
Hey!

456
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,280
Five days!

457
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,920
They kept me there...

458
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,360
for five days!

459
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,000
And I can only bow down
to the mind that can be so...

460
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,000
cruel!

461
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,920
Please...

462
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,040
Please forgive me!

463
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,080
Please accept my apology.

464
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,400
Are you watching me, Nayak?

465
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,200
<i>Can you see me?</i>

466
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,280
<i>Why don't you reach out
to me if you're watching?</i>

467
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,920
<i>Okay!</i>

468
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,120
Let's do this.

469
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,880
We'll give it another week.

470
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,240
If Nayak picks Bhumi up
again in the next week, great.

471
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,120
Otherwise...

472
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,480
this undercover operation is closed.

473
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,440
But, sir...

474
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,040
We'll find another way.

475
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,000
Has he sent you?

476
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
Has he called me?

477
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,040
Let's go.

478
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,200
Come on.

479
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,200
Get out!

480
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,480
Hey!

481
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,480
-Where have you brought me?
-I'll tell you.

482
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,400
Come on.

483
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,440
Why are you pushing me?

484
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,040
-Tell me what's going on.
-I'll tell you.

485
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,920
-Huh?
-I'll tell you. Come on.

486
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,400
Come on.

487
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,320
What?

488
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,800
Sit.

489
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,480
Sit!

490
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,200
Look...

491
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
me...

492
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,640
and you.

493
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,520
Let's kill Nayak together.

494
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,120
That fucking asshole!

495
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,560
He killed my husband!

496
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,880
I've vowed to kill him!

497
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,400
Hey!

498
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,240
You know where he is, right?

499
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
What he looks like?

500
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,640
Please tell me.

501
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,360
I...

502
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,800
I...

503
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,240
I'll make you rich!

504
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,920
I'll give you anything you want.

505
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,360
Promise!

506
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,400
This is a test, right?

507
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,520
Right?

508
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,280
Alright.

509
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,680
Go ahead.

510
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,800
Hey!

511
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,880
Hey!

512
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,720
What the hell is going on?!

513
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,680
Please stop!

514
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,080
You love fucking Nayak, right?

515
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,200
Why don't you try me?

516
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,080
I'm gonna make another vow right now.

517
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,840
If you don't help me kill Nayak...

518
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,680
I'm gonna kill you.

519
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,840
Right now.

520
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,040
Right here.

521
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,000
Who's Nayak?

522
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,240
Hey! Hey!

523
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,680
You loved fucking Nayak, you bitch!

524
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,800
You're going to give me attitude?

525
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,560
Come on!

526
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,320
Say yes or I'll kill you right now!

527
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,920
I'll have to do it!
I've told you my secret.

528
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,480
Do you understand me, you whore?

529
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
Fucki...

530
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,840
Hey, stop! Stay away!
Stay away from me!

531
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,360
Go on. Do it.

532
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,800
Shoot me, you fucking whore!

533
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,920
Have you never held a gun before?

534
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,840
-Shoot me right here!
-Hey! Stay away!

535
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm warning you, I'll shoot you!

536
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,920
Go on!

537
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,440
End my wretched life!

538
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,200
Go away! I'll shoot you!

539
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,160
"I'll shoot you. I'll shoot you!" Do it!

540
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,520
Hello?

541
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,560
Hello, Fernandez, sir?

542
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,440
Get me out of here, sir.

543
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,440
I'm in trouble, sir.
Get me out of here.
