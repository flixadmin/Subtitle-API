I gave you the opportunity
to be somebody.

And instead of

of a hero.

Mm-mm.

01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,740
I know what it means
to feel self-doubt.

1746
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,310
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1747
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,580
[Deadpool] Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1748
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:51,150
It's like you're holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1749
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,520
[Deadpool] You guys
may not have been able

1750
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:54,290
to save your universes.

1751
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,490
But you can avenge them.

1752
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,820
It's what Johnny
would have wanted.

1753
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,890
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1754
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,930
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

1755
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,930
Dickhead here talked him
into a team-up,

1756
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,570
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1757
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,900
[Deadpool] No, no, no.
We don't know that.

1758
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:11,140
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1759
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,940
If he survived that,
he is prayin' for death.

1760
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,610
[Deadpool] Thank you,
Doctor Wolverine!

1761
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,810
- Spill it!
- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1762
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,010
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1763
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,710
[Deadpool] Okay. Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

1764
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,010
Look.

1765
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,480
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1766
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,280
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1767
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,450
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1768
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:31,420
while the soil greedily drank
his blood. It was horrible.

1769
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,220
He was like a brother to me.

1770
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,390
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1771
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,460
- [laughs]
- Look, maybe you couldn't

1772
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,930
save your worlds, but...

1773
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,700
but Jesus Christ,
you can save mine!

1774
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:44,200
I don't give a shit
about your world, but

1775
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:47,170
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1776
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,110
we can get back in
and take her down.

1777
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,110
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, Chere.

1778
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,110
[Deadpool] If we can block
her psychic powers,

1779
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,010
we can get a leg up.
I know it.

1780
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,080
Now, I know Magneto's dead.

1781
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,710
But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1782
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,780
- around here somewhere...
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1783
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,990
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1784
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,990
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- She don't play.

1785
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:07,450
She knows that helmet
was the only way

1786
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,120
to protect anyone
from her powers.

1787
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,030
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut's,

1788
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,290
but he works for Cassandra.

1789
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:13,830
[Deadpool] Juggernaut's
helmet. That's it.

1790
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,530
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off

1791
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,960
without that dome
gonna come off wit'it.

1792
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,270
[Deadpool] I'm so sorry,
beautiful.

1793
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,170
I want this to be gentle.

1794
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,470
Who is your dialect coach?
The Minions?

1795
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,770
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1796
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,940
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1797
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:32,010
Let's face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

1798
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:33,850
Or never learned about us.

1799
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,320
The heroes we were.

1800
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,650
Lives we saved.

1801
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,050
Or wanted to save.

1802
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,120
Maybe these two are our chance.

1803
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,450
[gurgling]

1804
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,220
To be remembered.

1805
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,320
The way we deserve.

1806
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,530
[Deadpool] Yes.

1807
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,360
An ending.

1808
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:49,600
- Legacy.
- [Deadpool] Yes!

1809
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,100
Yes! Let this man cook.

1810
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:52,630
This is what I'm talking about.

1811
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,630
Big slow-motion fights,
sad music.

1812
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,870
Everybody working together.

1813
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,740
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1814
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:59,910
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1815
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,210
[Deadpool] Yes!
Gambit?

1816
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,180
I ain't know my daddy,

1817
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,180
but I'm sure I shot out
of his dick ready.

1818
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,110
[Deadpool] Jesus Christ,
that is graphic.

1819
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,080
Yeah. He was layin' them
buttery nuts all up in my mama

1820
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:10,120
and I shot out there
and I said, "What's up, Doc?"

1821
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:12,580
[Deadpool laughs]
Johnny must have loved you.

1822
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:14,890
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1823
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,150
The name's Laura.

1824
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,990
- Let's fucking go.
- [Deadpool] Let's fucking go!

1825
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,260
It's on like chicken and corn.

1826
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:21,790
- [Deadpool] Yeah!
- We're doing this.

1827
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:22,890
You're all fuckin' dead.

1828
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,260
[Deadpool] My God!
Read the room.

1829
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,400
[crickets chirping]

1830
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,070
[exhales]

1831
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:39,240
Hey, hey. I'm not lookin'
for company. Get out of here.

1832
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:42,910
You remind me of him.

1833
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:44,780
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1834
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:46,980
- Sounds like a great guy...
- Wasn't finished.

1835
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,390
Showed up when
it mattered the most.

1836
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:54,290
Couldn't help it.

1837
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,960
[sighs]

1838
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:58,960
You might not know it, but...

1839
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,300
you're a good man, Logan.

1840
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:02,330
[chuckles]

1841
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:05,000
You might not know it,
but apparently,

1842
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,440
I'm the worst Logan.

1843
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:10,170
I got to have a life
because of you.

1844
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,810
I got to grow up because of you.

1845
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:18,380
A lot of kids did.

1846
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,550
A lot of kids didn't grow up
because of me.

1847
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,350
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1848
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:27,760
That suit says different.

1849
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:29,920
- Yeah. Do you like it?
- Mm.

1850
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:33,490
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1851
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,370
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1852
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:42,470
All of them.

1853
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,240
They wanted me to be part
of the team, but I wouldn't.

1854
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:49,580
Told 'em they all look
fucking ridiculous. I mean...

1855
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:54,180
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1856
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,890
And then one day,
while I was off on my own,

1857
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,190
the humans came...

1858
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,190
and went mutant hunting.

1859
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,630
I can guess the rest.

1860
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,860
No, no, let me...

1861
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,300
Let me say it. I...

1862
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,100
I need to say it.

1863
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:20,240
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar,

1864
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:21,570
it was too late.

1865
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,080
They were dead. Every...
[stifling sob]

1866
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:31,550
[♪ mournful music playing]

1867
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:36,320
This suit's all I got to
remind me of who they were.

1868
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,360
And what I did.

1869
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,200
[sniffles]

1870
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,140
We're headed to Cassandra's
at sunup.

1871
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,970
Have fun. Not my fight.

1872
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:01,940
We won't pull this off
without you.

1873
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:12,220
Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

1874
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:16,660
You were always the wrong guy.

1875
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:25,330
[♪ mournful music continues]

1876
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,380
[cell phone ringing]

1877
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,250
What?

1878
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:45,590
Alioth didn't get them.
[sniffs]

1879
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,290
Cassandra wanted to
play with them herself first.

1880
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,160
They got away.

1881
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:50,830
- Did they find the others?
- No.

1882
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,230
Good. All right. Phew.

1883
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,330
- The others found them.
- Oh, very cute.

1884
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,230
Well done, Pyro.
Classic bait and switch.

1885
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,770
- You really got me there.
- Relax.

1886
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,140
If they come after Nova,
she'll handle it.

1887
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:03,300
Cassandra is
a lunatic wild card.

1888
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,470
Why do you think we put her
there in the first place?

1889
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:07,610
Thank God she's never chosen
to leave The Void.

1890
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,540
The Time Ripper is hours away
from completion.

1891
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,680
I cannot take any chances.

1892
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,850
Well, maybe not.

1893
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,320
But I can.

1894
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:15,420
For a price.

1895
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:16,850
Why do you have to
say it in that silly voice?

1896
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,190
It's so icky.

1897
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:20,050
- You want it done or not?
- All right. Your price.

1898
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:21,590
Take her out.

1899
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,260

02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:07,280
It's always the suit's fault.
Never the actor.

And there's the lights.

2855
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:34,910
For medical research.

- Bye-bye, video. [smooches]

02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:53,720
[Deadpool] I'm tired of
these absolutely vile rumors

2860
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:55,050
that I got Johnny killed.

2861
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,160
Let's look at the tape.

2862
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:59,590
In The Void,

2863
02:06:59,630 --> 02:07:01,560
you're either food for Alioth

2864
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:02,890
or you work for her.

2865
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:07,170
[Deadpool] Go on, Johnny.

2866
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:08,830
And I'll tell you who "her" is.

2867
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:09,900
Cassandra Nova.

2868
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:12,170
A megalomaniacal,
psychotic asshole.

2869
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,240
A finger licking
dead-inside pixie slab

2871
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:17,840
- what she can do.
- [Deadpool] I'm listening.

2872
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:19,750
She can lick my goddamn
cinnamon ring clean

2873
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:21,410
and kick rocks
all the way to bald hell.

2874
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:23,910
In fact, I don't give a shit
if she removes all my skin

2875
02:07:23,950 --> 02:07:25,950
and pops me like some
nightmarish blood balloon.

is light that fuck-box on fire,

2879
02:07:30,790 --> 02:07:31,960
I still won't die happy.

[Deadpool laughs]
Holy shit, girl. You crazy.

2881
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:36,260
That's right, Wade. I won't
be happy until I've urinated

on her freshly barbecued corpse

the charred remains

Juggernaut's juggernuts.
