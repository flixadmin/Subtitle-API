1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,040
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,760
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,560
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,200
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,000
<i>Unfortunately, my plan is opposed</i>

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,760
<i>by the body I'd sworn my allegiance
to the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,000
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,920
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,840
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,920
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,520
We're in the Temporal Zone.
I don't understand.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,920
No one should be able to...

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,800
<i>A scan of the vessel
suggests that it is</i>

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
<i>the bounty hunter, Kronos.</i>

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,480
A crash landing...

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,320
in both place and time.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,240
Gideon, camouflage the ship.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,120
This doesn't look like
the type of place

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,560
we want to linger out in the open.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,920
That looks a lot like
a Palmer Tech building,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but why does it have
a Smoak logo on it?

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,880
Wait, this is Star City.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,800
I thought you said
the timeline was safe.

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,160
Yes, Star City was intact in 2016.

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
This... this is 2046.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Don't move!

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,640
- Thank God.
- I said don't move.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,440
It's me.

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,960
It's Sara.

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,280
Hey, Oliver, look.

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,960
I know it's been a long time.

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,920
But don't you remember
that Rip Hunter

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,480
recruited us to become legends?

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,800
I never heard of any Legends.

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Get back!

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,320
This guy a friend of yours?

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
I don't like him.

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
What are you doing?

39
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,840
It's called shooting back.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,320
Can't be the Green Arrow.

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,840
That's not Oliver Queen.

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,000
Sure dresses like him.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
Shoots arrows like him.

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
Well, whoever he is,
I don't plan on sticking around

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,760
to shish kebabbed by this dude.

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Kid's right.

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,600
Let's stay behind and kill him.

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,000
We need you in charge of the ship.

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,520
All right, Rip. Tell us the truth.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,800
You've all seen how
the timeline is malleable...

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,440
in flux until it is set.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,800
Well, this future is not set.

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,320
{\an5}Remember when I told you
it was dangerous

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,600
{\an5}for any of you to know too much
about your own futures?

55
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,600
Well, the events that you dread
could very well come to be

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,360
due to your actions to prevent them.

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
You know what I think?

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,680
I think you think too much.

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,640
Believe me when I tell you
that the best thing

60
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,040
for yourselves and for this mission

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,160
is to make the repairs
to the Waverider here in 2046

62
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,040
then head back to your own time

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,720
{\an5}and make that none of this
ever comes to be.

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,360
{\an5}Looks like the whole
propulsion system's jacked.

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,360
{\an5}How do you even know
what we're looking at here?

66
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,800
{\an5}Doesn't matter if it takes you
down the road or through time.

67
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,120
An engine's still an engine.

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,960
{\an5}How long will it take you
to make repairs?

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
{\an5}I'm not too sure,
but it would go a lot faster

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
if I had some help.

71
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,680
Maybe Kendra
could lend me a hand?

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,000
Enlist whoever is free to help,

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,680
I have this to contend with.

74
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,560
This is the Neuromorphic Interface

75
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,080
for Gideon's logic
and navigation matrix.

76
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,680
Without it, Gideon cannot function.

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,640
Well, that explains how we got
stranded here in the future.

78
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,400
Palmer Tech was working on
a self-learning, Neuromorphic Cortex.

79
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,360
{\an5}They surely would have gone
to prototype by 2046.

80
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,160
{\an5}We are going to need that prototype.

81
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,720
Palmer Tech is now
Smoak Technologies,

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,200
but I'm sure I can still get us in.

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,560
{\an5}As I said, we must keep
you and Ms. Lance

84
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
separate from your future homes.

85
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,320
In any case, there's a reason

86
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,920
why I recruited individuals

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,360
{\an5}adept at misappropriating
others' property.

88
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,440
It's not money. It's not jewels.

89
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,480
It's not a valuable artifact.

90
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,680
{\an5}You're just lucky I'll steal
anything right about now.

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
As I suspected.

92
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,280
We'll get your gizmo.

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,640
{\an5}You just get
this bucket flying again.

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,960
- I'm coming with.
- No, no you are not.

95
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,920
You're too emotionally
connected to the city.

96
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
- We've been over this.
- I'm over you.

97
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,960
You got us on a mission

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,800
to change the timeline for yourself.

99
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,200
{\an5}And you won't even let us
look at our futures?

100
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,880
{\an5}Now, I know this city
better than anyone else,

101
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,520
and you're gonna need me out there.

102
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,000
So, either I'm coming with,

103
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,880
or we can find out
if the Time Masters

104
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,600
{\an5}are as good at teaching
people to fight

105
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,960
as the League of Assassins.

106
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,920
{\an5}So the rest of the team's
on a field trip to Palmer Tech,

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
now Smoak Technologies.

108
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
Palmer Tech sounds better, right?

109
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Be honest.

110
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,080
Honestly, they sound about the same.

111
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,800
Even assuming our compatriots return

112
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,440
with a Neuromorphic prototype,

113
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,760
we'll still need to prepare Gideon

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,080
for the new device.

115
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,440
And the engines could
definitely use some loving.

116
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,920
Actually, I could use
an extra pair of hands.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
Well, Raymond, why don't
you and Ms. Saunders

118
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,920
continue repairing Gideon,

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,160
and I'll assist Jefferson
with the engines?

120
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,680
This is just a potential future.

121
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,000
{\an5}It doesn't matter
if we kill anyone here, right?

122
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,720
Well, to avoid the risk of a paradox,

123
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,320
{\an5}it's probably best to refrain
from killing anyone.

124
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,920
I'm not gonna promise anything.

125
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,280
{\an5}My sister's apartment
used to be over here.

126
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I seem to remember something

127
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,840
{\an5}about your father
being a police captain.

128
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
{\an5}- Your point?
- Did one hell of a job.

129
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
My father and everyone else

130
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,160
would never have let this happen...

131
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
unless they were all dead.

132
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,960
You really are pretty good at this.

133
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,200
Yeah, I was a shipyard welder
in 1944.

134
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
No way.

135
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,640
A real life Rosie the Riveter?

136
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,960
<i>Is there anything you can't manage</i>

137
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,200
<i>to put a positive spin on?</i>

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,320
<i>No, I got it, the DMV.</i>

139
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
<i>So you do have a dark side.</i>

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,320
You making fun of me?

141
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Little bit.

142
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,400
Doesn't mean I don't find
your unwavering optimism...

143
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
enjoyable.

144
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,840
<i>I find watching you weld enjoyable.</i>

145
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,240
Dr. Palmer,
in case you weren't aware,

146
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,720
you are on an open channel,

147
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,520
and we can hear
everything you're saying.

148
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,120
Is it too much to ask for some

149
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,880
professionalism around here, and...

150
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,120
why am I getting so upset?

151
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,880
One moment, please.

152
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,440
I'm not upset. You're upset.

153
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,560
No, I'm not.

154
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,000
My elevated blood pressure
confirms that you are.

155
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm just...

156
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
I'm just getting annoyed
that those two

157
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,440
are talking instead of working.
I mean...

158
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,040
- You like her.
- Dude, you're being crazy.

159
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,840
You do remember that we share

160
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,280
a psychic connection.

161
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,920
I can sense what you're feeling.

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
If that were true,
then you would shut up.

163
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,720
Hey, it's no day at the beach
for me, either.

164
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
Believe me.

165
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,600
Well, it doesn't matter,

166
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,880
'cause I don't stand
a chance with her anyway.

167
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,080
Now, why would you say that?

168
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,920
Because right now, my competition

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,440
is a billionaire genius
who built his own super-suit

170
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,720
and some other dude she's known
for 4,000 years

171
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,200
who she is destined to be with.

172
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,280
If I may offer one word of advice...

173
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
I really wish you wouldn't.

174
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,760
That word would be "confidence."

175
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,600
You met my younger self.

176
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,680
I was quite the ladies' man.

177
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,120
Put yourself out there.

178
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,800
Good things will happen.

179
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,440
Palmer Tech's
just two blocks up this way.

180
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,480
Or at least it used to be.

181
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,600
Take cover in there!

182
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,920
It's like World War III out there.

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's beautiful.

184
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
We need to find another route.

185
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,040
Ms. Lance, don't.

186
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Sara!

187
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Damn it!

188
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,440
You two... don't move.
We'll be right back.

189
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,760
Right.

190
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
We're not gonna sit here, right?

191
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,880
Imagine all the looting
we can do in this chaos.

192
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,160
Why don't we stretch our legs
at that bank we passed

193
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,400
three blocks back?

194
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Drop your weapons,
and hand over your wallets.

195
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,440
Wait, are you actually
trying to mug us?

196
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,680
What is this, amateur hour?

197
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
If you don't do what my man says,

198
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,360
we're gonna crush you
into the pavement

199
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,760
like a couple of ants.

200
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,360
Really?

201
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,080
What do you say we teach
these fellas a lesson?

202
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Yeah.

203
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,520
That's what you get
when you don't follow directions.

204
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Interesting.

205
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,120
Hold this.

206
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Second thoughts...

207
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,720
Where did you get that?

208
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
eBay.

209
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,000
Now, your boss
will not be needing this.

210
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,240
Well, this has been fun,
but I think it's time to leave.

211
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Leave?

212
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
Why would we leave?

213
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,720
Come on, sweetheart.

214
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Don't move.

215
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
You...

216
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,080
you are persistent.

217
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,880
I saw you get shot point-blank.

218
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,440
It's high-density Kevlar, now...

219
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
who the hell are you?

220
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
- Who are you?
- I'm the Green Arrow.

221
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,600
Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

222
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,480
No, he's not.

223
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,080
Oliver Queen is dead.

224
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,560
How did Oliver die?

225
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,320
I don't know. No one does.

226
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,440
No one's seen him since...

227
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,360
Well, since the Uprising.

228
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,680
Uprising?

229
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Is just what people called it when

230
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,720
Well, when all this happened.

231
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,400
15 years ago, he brought
an army with him.

232
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,960
- Who brought an army?
- I did.

233
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960
No, it's not possible.

234
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
How did you get off Lian Yu?

235
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,040
Say something, damn it!

236
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Ms. Lance?

237
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Who is this?

238
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,760
Somebody very dangerous.

239
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,520
Then now is not the right
time for me to say it

240
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,040
but please, remind me later
to tell you that I told you so.

241
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,800
How are you still alive, Slade?

242
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Slade.

243
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,520
That's a name I haven't heard
in a long time.

244
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,160
How do you know my father?

245
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
He called you Ms. Lance.

246
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,480
Any relation to the late
Captain Lance?

247
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,960
If so, you must have heard
stories about my father.

248
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,880
I knew your father.

249
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,400
He was insane.

250
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,960
Seems to run in the family.

251
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm going to enjoy killing you...

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
or we will.

253
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,280
Okay, bad idea.

254
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Come on.

255
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,160
All right.

256
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,440
Grey and I have got
the mains back online.

257
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Great.

258
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
Ray's working on something
called the quantum manifold.

259
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,640
But I can't seem
to get this to cooperate.

260
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,800
Let me give it a try.

261
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,080
Hey, you actually seem
to know what you're doing here.

262
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,480
Oh, yeah, machines
are kind of my thing.

263
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,360
Plus, I've been looking
at the instruction manual

264
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
in my downtime, so...

265
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Most people can't follow

266
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,520
the instructions to build
their new bookcase,

267
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
and here you are working
on a spaceship.

268
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,000
A time- traveling spaceship
from the future, no less.

269
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,680
Well, when you put it like that,

270
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,200
I am kind of amazing.

271
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,600
And humble.

272
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,960
Hey, if you ever
have any bookcases

273
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
need putting together...

274
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
I'll know who to call.

275
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,160
So, Raymond,

276
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,720
you were working with Kendra earlier.

277
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,640
I couldn't help but notice

278
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,520
there might've been a little...

279
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
spark.

280
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Really?

281
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Oh, yes.

282
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,720
It was quite apparent
and if I'm not mistaken,

283
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,920
I've noticed her throwing
one or two glances your way.

284
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,840
Wow, that's... that's surprising.

285
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,880
- Is it?
- Well, yeah.

286
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,080
I don't know, I hadn't really
considered her in that way.

287
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,760
Why are you bringing this up?

288
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,640
Jeez, I feel like
I'm back in high school.

289
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,160
I honestly wouldn't know.
I skipped 10th grade.

290
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,920
And 11th.

291
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
I haven't really spent
that much time with Kendra.

292
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,680
You know, other than time
that we shared with her

293
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,320
and her reincarnated soulmate,

294
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,520
or people trying to kill us.

295
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,680
All the more reason to avoid

296
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,880
personal attachments.

297
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,520
This ship may be large,
but our group is small.

298
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
Yeah.

299
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
Preaching to the choir, Professor.

300
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,320
We're onboard the Waverider
to save the world...

301
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,560
not hook up.

302
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,600
Yes, quite right.

303
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,880
Hey, you, I'm terrible with names.

304
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,840
- I'm gonna call you Fonzie.
- Yeah!

305
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,000
- I'm gonna call you Kenickie.
- Yeah!

306
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,760
Anyone else here need a name?

307
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,400
Your highness, can I get
a moment of your time, please?

308
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Sure.

309
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,960
Isn't the future great?

310
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,400
We really should be
getting back to Rip and Sara.

311
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,000
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm not looking

312
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,280
to put down roots here.

313
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,960
Why not? It's everything
we've ever wanted.

314
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,920
I got a gang that does
everything I tell them to.

315
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,200
I got a fur coat.

316
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,480
I got a chalice.

317
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,680
Speaking of.

318
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,680
- What about stopping Savage?
- What about it?

319
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,240
You're the one who said we're in this
for the score, remember?

320
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,440
We could live like kings here.

321
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,320
No cops, no heroes...

322
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,480
just some fool in a green hoodie.

323
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,960
It's Christmas every day.

324
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
My sweet.

325
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,760
Slade had a son?

326
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,760
Look, Oliver tried.

327
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,840
He tried to raise an army
to fight Deathstroke, but...

328
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,560
everyone just wanted to evacuate.

329
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
How can you save a city
that doesn't want to be saved?

330
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,480
A moment. Sara, I know
what you must be thinking,

331
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,960
but none of what has transpired here

332
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,520
is your fault,
nor do you have the means

333
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,320
to change it,
but Vandal Savage's future

334
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
is preventable.

335
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,680
I implore you,

336
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,960
please stay focused on our mission.

337
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,680
We're very grateful
for your assistance,

338
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,040
but we really must be moving along

339
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,320
- to Smoak Technologies.
- What for?

340
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,120
That place has been
cleared out for years,

341
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,320
but a lot of Felicity Smoak's
projects got relocated.

342
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Where?

343
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Come on.

344
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,200
You didn't say that Felicity's
equipment would be here.

345
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,680
Well, where else would
you think it'd be?

346
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,920
Mr. Queen's base of operations

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,760
appears to have seen better days.

348
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, well...

349
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,880
the place got attacked
after Grant Wilson

350
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,280
outed Queen as the Green Arrow.

351
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,600
Let's just find what we're looking
for and get out of here.

352
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,440
Whoever's there, get out.

353
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,680
I said get out!

354
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,280
Whoever you are, get out.

355
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Oliver?

356
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Hello, Sara.

357
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,840
Long time, no see.

358
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Is that...

359
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Oliver Queen.

360
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,120
Everyone thinks that you're dead.

361
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,240
They're not wrong.

362
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,040
Put the arrow down, John.

363
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,320
You're embarrassing yourself.

364
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,920
- John?
- John Diggle Junior.

365
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,200
My dad is dead

366
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,520
because I couldn't save him.

367
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,280
I don't deserve his name.

368
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,720
I'm Connor Hawke.

369
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,480
So you won't take his name,

370
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,120
but it's all right to parade around

371
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,760
in someone else's outfit?

372
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,960
Well, someone has to,

373
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,200
because last time
that I checked, you were dead.

374
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,240
Everyone thought you were dead.

375
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,640
I've been trying to hold
this city by myself

376
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,880
because I thought you were gone.

377
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,720
What happened to you?

378
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,960
To Laurel, to my dad...

379
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,120
- Felicity...
- They're gone.

380
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,280
- All of them.
- What do you mean?

381
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,000
- Ollie...
- Gone.

382
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,120
What do you want me to say, Sara?

383
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,120
30 years ago, you and Ray
hopped on a spaceship,

384
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,760
- and you never came back.
- We will.

385
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,240
I don't want to say that...

386
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,240
things would have ended differently

387
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,600
if you and Ray had been here, but...

388
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,600
But if we were,
it could've made the difference.

389
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,840
You thought I was dead.
What are you doing here?

390
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,080
We were looking
for a Neuromorphic Prototype

391
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,040
that Felicity Smoak was working on.

392
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,680
Felicity left
after everything that happened.

393
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,360
Everything her company
was working on

394
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,160
is being kept in a warehouse
at Adams and O'Neil.

395
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,520
- Entry code is 4-5-8-7.
- Thank you, Mr.

396
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
You found your way in...

397
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
find your way out.

398
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,520
I got to admit,
that wasn't bad advice, Grey.

399
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,520
So things went well
with Ms. Saunders?

400
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Oh, yeah.

401
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Well, I have more good news.

402
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,840
I was able to very subtly confirm

403
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,400
that Raymond
has no romantic inclinations

404
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,920
towards your crush object.

405
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,520
Okay, well, once we've
sorted out my love life,

406
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,480
we need to update your vocabulary.

407
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Can't wait.

408
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
I'm gonna go check on Kendra.

409
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,880
- Hey... confidence.
- Yeah.

410
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Hey.

411
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,000
I got the initial dampeners
back online.

412
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,120
Once the rest
of the team returns with

413
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,400
the Neuromorphic Prototype,

414
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
- Gideon will be good to go.
- Excellent.

415
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,080
Sooner we get out of here,
the better.

416
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,520
- And thank you, by the way.
- Whatever for?

417
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,920
Well, till you mentioned it,

418
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,120
I hadn't really thought
about Kendra in that way,

419
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,840
because, you know, she and Carter

420
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,200
were destined to be together
in this lifetime,

421
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,080
but it's all changed

422
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,840
and you know, she's quirky

423
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,640
and funny and beautiful

424
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
- and a pretty good welder.
- So... you know,

425
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,480
what about all those things
we were talking about?

426
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,960
The mission and so forth?

427
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,320
Oh, well,
we're all adults here, right?

428
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,720
Getting to know each other
a little bit better,

429
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,160
it's not gonna stop us
from saving the world.

430
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Oh, boy.

431
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,280
Who invited them?

432
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,760
Word on the street is Deathstroke
is pissed about something.

433
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,200
Deathstroke...
what kind of name's that?

434
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,680
Party's over.
Everyone hit the streets.

435
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,000
Hit everybody on them.

436
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,040
I want Green Arrow dead by morning.

437
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,240
Listen, pal, this is my gang.

438
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
The only orders
they take are from me.

439
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,760
Might be your gang, but it's my city.

440
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,840
Green Arrow is running
with a female assassin in white

441
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,480
and a Brit in a brown coat.

442
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Kill them all.

443
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,280
Heard the man. Let's go.

444
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,400
Looks like your new minions

445
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,320
are about to go on
a citywide manhunt

446
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,560
- for Rip and Sara.
- So what?

447
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,480
They're gonna kill our friends.

448
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,120
Since when did they
become our friends?

449
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
You tell me.

450
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,640
You and Raymond seemed
to get pretty tight back in Russia.

451
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,000
I've never been tight with anyone.

452
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,680
Mick, it's time to go.

453
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,200
- You're not the boss of me.
- Actually, I am.

454
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,000
Okay, let's both take a deep breath.

455
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,640
And we'll make ourselves a deal.

456
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,360
You help me get to Rip and Sara.

457
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,920
Once they're safe,
we can have this conversation.

458
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Fair?

459
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,080
Thank you for agreeing
to accompany us, Mr. Diggle.

460
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
It's Connor.

461
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
It's not like I needed

462
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,520
to stick around Oliver Queen
for anything.

463
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,000
- Did you know?
- Know what?

464
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,880
That this is what
would happen in my city?

465
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,920
Oliver said that the only reason

466
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
that things got so bad

467
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,760
is because Ray and I
weren't there to help.

468
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,400
I suspected that might be the case,

469
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,360
but that's actually a good thing.

470
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,440
Now, once our mission is complete

471
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,680
and you and Dr. Palmer are
returned to Star City in 2016,

472
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,760
you will both be present
to stop Grant Wilson's Uprising.

473
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,960
This future
is only a potential timeline.

474
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,240
So this...

475
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,560
this version of Star City...

476
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,840
this doesn't have to happen?

477
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,040
Correct.
The future is always in flux.

478
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,440
Hopefully,
this will never come to pass.

479
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,880
This world isn't real.

480
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,360
Let's split up.
We'll cover more ground.

481
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,960
Hello, beautiful.

482
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,920
There's too many of them!

483
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,040
Gentlemen, your timing is exemplary.

484
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Where's Connor?

485
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,520
He's been taken.

486
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,040
These are Grant Wilson's men.

487
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,280
The guy with the half face
and the body armor

488
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,240
has a real mad-on
for the kid in the hoodie.

489
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Can I have a word?

490
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,040
- Rip...
- I know what you're going to say.

491
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,040
- We have to get him back.
- Yes, that.

492
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
You're forgetting this future

493
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,520
is only a potential timeline.

494
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,400
Yeah, where Grant Wilson
kills Connor.

495
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,840
Wilson's not going to murder Connor,

496
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,480
because once you're returned to 2016,

497
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,520
there won't be a Wilson or a Connor,

498
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,360
at least not as we know them
both right now.

499
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,280
Now that we rescued them,

500
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,520
let's have that chat.

501
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,040
You want to stay here.

502
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,000
Thought I made that pretty clear.

503
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,160
What I'm less clear
on is why you don't.

504
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
A city of thieves and criminals

505
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,480
Sounds like a lot of competition.

506
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,000
Then we wipe them out.

507
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,480
What I did to that other guy,

508
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,800
we do the same thing
to this Grant Wilson

509
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,040
and anyone else stupid enough
to get in our way.

510
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,800
Take a look around, Snart.

511
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,720
We're living the dream.

512
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,760
Yeah. Speaking of which...

513
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,160
Sleep tight, buddy.

514
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,560
What happened to him?

515
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,040
Difference of opinion.

516
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Right.

517
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,040
We need to get this and Mr. Rory

518
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,280
back to the Waverider.

519
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,080
Oh, Jefferson, perfect timing.

520
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm in need of your
mechanical acumen.

521
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Okay, let's do it.

522
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,680
- What?
- What did you do?

523
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,880
I don't know
what you're talking about.

524
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,200
You did something.
What did you do?

525
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,520
Nothing, nothing.

526
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,120
You know, this psychic
connection thing,

527
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,520
it goes both ways

528
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,920
and the moment that I walked in here,

529
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,320
I started feeling
really anxious and guilty.

530
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,920
You feel guilty, so what did you do?

531
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,880
In my defense, I was only
acting in your best interests.

532
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
What did you do?

533
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,760
It's possible
in my attempt to discern

534
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,560
whether Dr. Palmer had competing
feelings for Ms. Saunders...

535
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Oh, you didn't...

536
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,080
I may have inadvertently
prompted him

537
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,520
to think of her in ways in which...

538
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,720
he hadn't.

539
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,040
- Grey!
- I'm sorry.

540
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,760
My intentions were honorable.

541
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,800
Oh, it's cool.

542
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,000
- Is it?
- Yeah.

543
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,160
I mean, nothing's really changed

544
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,560
apart from the fact
that now I got competition

545
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,800
I didn't have before,

546
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,520
but I should still
have confidence in myself.

547
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Right?

548
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Right.

549
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Oh, they're back.

550
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Where's Mr. Rory?

551
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,960
Sleeping it off.

552
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,720
We have the Neuromorphic Prototype.

553
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,000
Any luck with the ship's engines?

554
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,240
Yeah, it's all good.

555
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,360
Is there something wrong, Ms. Lance?

556
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,640
Well, all my friends and family
are dead,

557
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,640
except for Oliver Queen,
who happens to be dead inside

558
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,920
and missing his left arm.

559
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Sara, I have told you...

560
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,440
That this is just a potential future

561
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,920
and that it's all gonna go back

562
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,240
when we return to 2016...

563
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,360
if we return.

564
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,840
But what if we don't?

565
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,040
We all know Carter's
not coming back.

566
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,000
It's not like we have
the safest line of work.

567
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,480
I think if Sara wants
to stay and help

568
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
that then we should.

569
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,120
I mean, that's what we signed up
for to be heroes.

570
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I agree with Jefferson.

571
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,400
Yes, of course you both do,

572
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,040
because neither of you
understand the pitfalls

573
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,600
of changing the timeline.

574
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,200
Meddling with the future
is arguably more dangerous

575
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,760
than changing the past,
because it is still in flux.

576
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,360
Your wife and son's death
are in the future.

577
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,320
- You want us to change that.
- Don't play that card with me.

578
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,440
So what?

579
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,040
Are you only willing
to risk the timeline

580
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,160
if it's your own family?

581
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
I am not just trying
to save my family

582
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,360
and I'm not just trying
to save one city,

583
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,640
but the entire world!

584
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,480
I'm not being selfish, Sara.

585
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Go to hell.

586
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,880
Most likely.

587
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,920
If you want to go
and save Mr. Hawke,

588
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,520
then be my guest.

589
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
I'll keep the ship here for one hour,

590
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
then we're leaving.

591
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,760
With you on board or without.

592
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Hello, Mick.

593
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,680
You son of a bitch.

594
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,280
Just calm down.

595
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,560
You lied to me!

596
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,240
Wouldn't be the first time.

597
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,160
Remember the Del Ray
Currency Exchange?

598
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,320
The Blackhawk Armored Car job?

599
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,560
If I hadn't lied to you
on those scores,

600
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,680
we'd both be in prison or dead.

601
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,480
I'm the brains. You're the muscle.

602
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,800
That's how it's always been.

603
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,800
And on occasion,
I've had to call some audible.

604
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,880
You have a habit of getting
in your own way, Mick.

605
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
You're right.

606
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,320
You've lied to me about jobs before,

607
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,760
but then again, you lied to me
about this being a job.

608
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,240
It's not about the score
anymore for you.

609
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,640
You'd rather save the world
than be my partner.

610
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,760
A real team player.

611
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,200
'Cause that's what it's
gonna take to defeat Savage.

612
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,680
Then what? More money?
More power?

613
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,600
A life of leisure and sin?

614
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,360
Don't you get it, Mick?

615
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,480
If we take out Savage,
this immortal monster,

616
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,760
can't you see what that gets us?

617
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,760
No, tell me.

618
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,200
We'd be the two baddest
sons of bitches of all time.

619
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,320
I don't want a ticker tape parade.

620
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
You know what I want from this world.

621
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Yes...

622
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,080
to see it burn.

623
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,880
You lay a hand on me again,

624
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,120
you'll burn too.

625
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Oliver.

626
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Oliver!

627
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,520
Thought I told you to go.

628
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,760
Grant Wilson has Connor.

629
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
They're gonna kill him.

630
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,520
He knew what he was signing up for

631
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,080
and you there's nothing
I can do to help him.

632
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,760
That's not the Oliver Queen
that I know.

633
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,760
Maybe I'm not that person anymore.

634
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,240
Look at me, Sara.

635
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm literally half
the man I used to be.

636
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,520
Then that's the half this city needs.

637
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,960
He's got too many men, Ollie.

638
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,440
I can't do this by myself.

639
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
What about your friends?

640
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
I'm on my own...

641
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
unless I'm not.

642
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,520
Come on, Sara.

643
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,120
I never got the chance to ask Connor

644
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,720
why he wears the hood,
but I know why.

645
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,640
It's because this city
will always need a Green Arrow.

646
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,000
Is the ship ready for departure?

647
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,920
No, Ms. Lance is not yet onboard.

648
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I gave her an hour.

649
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,600
- Hardly enough time for...
- And she's been 90 minutes.

650
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,280
How much longer
are we supposed to wait?

651
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,120
It doesn't matter
that this is a potential future.

652
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
It doesn't matter that this

653
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,040
may never come to pass...

654
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,480
may never be real.

655
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,000
For Sara, this is very real.

656
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,480
I know, which is why I gave her
an extra 30 minutes.

657
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,720
Gideon, what's our status?

658
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,520
<i>The Waverider is operational,
Captain,</i>

659
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,920
<i>but I can't guarantee for how long.</i>

660
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,480
- Explain.
<i>- We are cloaked,</i>

661
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,040
<i>but positioned dangerously close</i>

662
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
<i>to where the city's criminal
element is gathering</i>

663
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,040
<i>to witness the execution
of Connor Hawke.</i>

664
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,680
<i>The longer we wait,
the greater the risk</i>

665
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,800
<i>of detection and further damage
to the ship.</i>

666
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,760
Do you really want to risk

667
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,080
being marooned in this version
of 2046 forever?

668
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,880
Certainly more than I
want to maroon Sara here.

669
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,920
She's our friend. Our teammate.

670
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,840
What's the point of stopping Savage

671
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,120
if we only become as immoral
as he is in the process?

672
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
You should be honored.

673
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,000
This is hallowed ground.

674
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,480
I took Oliver Queen's arm
in this very spot.

675
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Well, then let me go,

676
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,360
and we'll see
which one of us is tougher

677
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
me or Queen.

678
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,680
I already know the answer to that.

679
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,720
Ready the prisoner.

680
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Sir.

681
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,800
We saw her trying to
sneak past the perimeter.

682
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Sloppy.

683
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,040
The League of Assassins
would be embarrassed.

684
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,960
What was your strategy here?

685
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
You really think you could
just turn up tonight...

686
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
kill me?

687
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
No.

688
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,040
It was just my job to distract you.

689
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,560
You're not Green Arrow.

690
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,760
You're just a punk
in a Halloween costume.

691
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,560
Funny, I was gonna say
the same thing about you.

692
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,240
You want to fight the Green Arrow?

693
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,240
I'm right here.

694
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,400
How do you convinced Rip to stay?

695
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Actually, sending in
the cavalry was his idea.

696
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,400
Where's Mr. Queen?

697
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
Connor!

698
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,080
Cowards, all!

699
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Oliver?

700
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,880
It's good to see you again, Ray.
Kendra.

701
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,480
Thanks for the assist.

702
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,400
So who's that?

703
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,080
His name is Grant Wilson.

704
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,480
Once upon a time, his father, Slade,

705
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,280
tried to ruin my life.

706
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,680
That's not a nice family.

707
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,000
That's good shooting, John.

708
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
It's Connor.

709
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,000
Either way,

710
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
it's Green Arrow.

711
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,200
We have a lot of work to do.

712
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,600
Grant Wilson did a good job

713
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,200
of keeping the criminal element
in the city together.

714
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,240
Now, there will be plenty of people
to fill the vacuum.

715
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,600
I feel like I should stay.

716
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,680
Before Ray left,

717
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
he told me why Rip
brought all of you together.

718
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,080
It's important, Sara.

719
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,320
I just hate the idea

720
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,600
of leaving you here to fix it alone.

721
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
I'm not alone.

722
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,320
Just... just be careful, all right?

723
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,280
Well, you should know
better than most

724
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
I rarely ever am.

725
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,000
You watch his back.

726
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
Copy that.

727
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,720
Let's get to work.

728
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
All right, confidence.

729
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,480
Confidence. Okay.

730
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,120
So, I think Rip might have

731
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,640
some of that vodka left
in his cabinet.

732
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
And?

733
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
And...

734
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,800
maybe we could get a drink?

735
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,640
Are you asking me out?

736
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,560
Yes? No.

737
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
I think so.

738
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Is that okay?

739
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Yeah, that... that's totally okay,

740
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,360
except that three months ago,

741
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,880
I was a completely normal person

742
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,560
and now I'm a hawk goddess

743
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,200
traveling through time,

744
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,960
trying to avoid being killed
by an immortal psychopath

745
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,640
who murdered the man
I was destined to be with.

746
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
So...

747
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,080
I'm sorry, Ray. I...

748
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,000
I think my life's complicated enough

749
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,000
without throwing whatever
this is into the mix.

750
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,600
Yeah, totally understand.

751
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,960
If I was a reincarnated
Egyptian priestess,

752
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,720
I'd probably feel the same way.

753
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,840
I'm gonna go check
on Professor Stein.

754
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
Yup.

755
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,480
All good here.

756
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,280
Absolutely no problems.

757
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Everything okay here?

758
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,920
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, fine. You?

759
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,920
Oh, yeah, good. Good. It's good.

760
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,400
How much of that did you hear?

761
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,480
Oh, enough.

762
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
I'm sorry.

763
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Sorry too.

764
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,320
Wait, you knew that I...

765
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Yeah.

766
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,640
Yeah. You're not that subtle.

767
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,480
She would've picked me, by the way.

768
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,320
Keep telling yourself that.

769
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
She would've.

770
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,160
I'm just working on determining
our next destination.

771
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,840
I've considered your
suggesting of hell,

772
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,720
but I think I'll give it
a miss for the time being.

773
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,200
I just wanted to say thank you

774
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,560
for sending the team to back me up.

775
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,160
As it turns out, you were right.

776
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,640
That must've been hard to say.

777
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,520
Of late I've discovered that
I still have a lot to learn, I admit.

778
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,920
Including the fact that every future
is worth fighting for.

779
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
That said...

780
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,280
this mission is going to continue

781
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,040
to present us with difficult choices,

782
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,960
and I need to know that
you are a member of this team.

783
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,440
I guess so.

784
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,400
All right, Gideon,
let's see if these repairs

785
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,440
that Martin, Ray, and Jax made
are up to scratch.

786
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,280
<i>As far as I can tell, Ms. Saunders</i>

787
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,160
<i>did most of the work,
while the two gentlemen</i>

788
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,440
<i>- competed for...</i>
- Just get us out of here.

789
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Please, Gideon.

790
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,360
I'm gonna miss this place.

791
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,920
Yeah, they really seemed
like your kind of people.

792
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,840
I don't know
who my people are anymore.

793
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,800
So where to next, Captain?

794
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,280
Well, the beauty
of this mission is that

795
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,920
the real question
is not where, but when.

796
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,280
In which case,
I suggest that we next hit

797
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,320
Savage when he least expects it.
