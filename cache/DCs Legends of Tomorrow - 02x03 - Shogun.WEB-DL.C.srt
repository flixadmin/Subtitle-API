1
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:02,757
<i>Time travel is real.</i>

2
00:00:02,782 --> 00:00:04,220
<i>And all of history is vulnerable</i>

3
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:06,349
<i>to the attack of rogue time travelers.</i>

4
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,073
<i>But one group travels throughout time</i>

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,910
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called Time Aberrations</i>

6
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:12,795
<i>and erase their damage to history.</i>

7
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:14,660
<i>A group of outcasts and misfits.</i>

8
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:16,436
<i>These individuals aren't heroes,</i>

9
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:19,047
<i>they're something else, they're Legends.</i>

10
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,263
<i>Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

11
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,655
Heywood, Dr. Nate Heywood.
I'm a historian.

12
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,291
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

13
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,994
In layman's terms, I'm a time detective.

14
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,696
Ingestible translator.

15
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,864
You'll be able to speak and understand

16
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,265
any language spoken to you.

17
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,601
You know how fragile
we historians can be.

18
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,069
I know my cuts and bruises.

19
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,204
You're a hemophiliac.
You can bleed to death.

20
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,106
So your superpower is wearing the suit.

21
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,775
<i>Without that fancy suit,</i>

22
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,343
you're nothing but a
self-righteous rich guy.

23
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,847
Mr. Heywood's vitals are dropping.

24
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,249
I think I can save him.

25
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,584
<i>I did a little tinkering to the formula.</i>

26
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,521
Hello, Rex.

27
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,555
Rex!

28
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,191
- Time traveler.
- Rex!

29
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:12,603
- So how's our patient?
- Still stable.

30
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,173
Gideon has him under sedation.

31
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,542
Any side effects from
the Nazi super-serum

32
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,943
you injected him with?

33
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,812
No, but that may have a
little something to do

34
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,346
with the work I did altering the serum

35
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,548
to remove the Nazi parts.

36
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,249
Yes, it would be a tad inconvenient

37
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,285
to have a monster roaming the ship.

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,961
Gideon, can you pilot for a little bit?

39
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,629
I need a break.

40
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:09,961
Where are all the knives?

41
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:14,799
Oh, there's one.

42
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,902
Look, if this is about me
taking all the mayonnaise,

43
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,704
you might be slightly overreacting.

44
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,572
You killed him!

45
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,909
Killed him? I've killed lots of people.

46
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,478
You're gonna have to be
a bit more specific.

47
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:02,547
What the hell happened to you?

48
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,484
I really don't know.

49

<i>You injected me with Nazi serum?</i>

51
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,997
Which I'd redesigned to
quintuple my own strength

52
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,066
and transform my skin into an alloy

53
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,167
a hundred times stronger than steel.

54
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,903
Steel, that's a cool name.

55
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,039
Yeah, especially since my grandfather

56
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,740
was called Commander Steel.

57
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,309
But what does that make me?

58
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,010
Corporal Steel? Mr. Steel?

59
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,278
Citizen Steel?

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,747
Who cares? You got
superpowers now, dude.

61
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,050
Except I don't know
how I turned to steel

62
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,285
- in the first place.
- Ray'll teach you.

63
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,387
- He will?
- You said it yourself,

64
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,591
- you redesigned the serum.
- Which I did beautifully,

65
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,393
but it's not like I have some
sort of instruction manual.

66
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,895
Guess you'll have to wing it.

67
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,730
Now, I'm gonna go have a chat

68
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,800
with our stowaway.

69
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,268
This is gonna be so much fun!

70
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,569
Hm.

71
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:10,147
You stowed away before we
time-jumped from 1942.

72
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,415
I'm gonna get out of here,

73
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,851
and I'm gonna finish what I started.

74
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,287
You mean, killing Mick?

75
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,890
Not that I haven't thought
of it myself, but why?

76
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:22,214
He killed Rex.

77
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,139
What?

78
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:25,659
Rex Tyler?

79
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,877
As in Hourman?

80
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:30,817
His killer stole the Askaran Amulet.

81
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,186
Look, I'm sorry. I am.

82
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:38,012
But Mick didn't do it.

83
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,467
He is a thief and a murderer.

84
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:42,592
He's also a Legend,

85
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,284
and Mick hasn't been off the ship

86
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:46,642
since we dropped your
team off at the JSA.

87
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:48,096
With his last words,

88
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,554
he told me his killer
was a time traveler.

89
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,225
You know, we've been tracking someone

90
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,960
who's been trying to alter history.

91
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,328
We think it's the same person

92
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,863
that gave Krieger the super-serum.

93
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,465
This might be your time traveler.

94
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,368
Look, if I let you out of here,

95
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,505
you promise not to hurt Mick
unless he really deserves it?

96
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,515
Sorry for knocking you out.

97
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,717
Sorry for locking you up.

98
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,087
Call it even?

99
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,655
When I was a kid, I used to play

100
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,557
JSA versus Nazis with my dolls.

101
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,426
Well, they were action figures, really.

102
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,561
But it doesn't matter 'cause
I got superpowers now

103
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,896
and it's awesome.

104
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,331
Your powers manifested

105
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,199
as a result of a heightened
adrenal response.

106
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,502
Basically, Amaya threatened
you and you reacted.

107
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,804
So now

108
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,605
what we need to do is
duplicate the conditions

109
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,542
which caused you to, you know, steel on?

110
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,177
Wait, so you want to threaten me?

111
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,679
- Not exactly.
- Wait, let's discuss this.

112
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,782
I thought this was a time machine.

113
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,552
You saved the Justice Society.
Why can't you save Rex?

114
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,887
Because we're dealing with
another time traveler.

115
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,290
If we go back and save Rex,
the time traveler will just

116
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,958
go back before then and kill Rex again,

117
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,393
so instead of chasing our own tails,

118
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,961
we need to identify
who we're up against.

119
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,262
I don't understand any of this.

120
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,465
Look, I just need you to trust us.

121
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,467
We're gonna find who do this.
I promise you.

122
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,535
In the meantime, Gideon
will fly you home.

123
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,771
I'm not going back until Rex's killer

124
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,873
is brought to justice.

125
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,342
We don't know how long that will take.

126
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,745
Don't worry, we're professionals.

127
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,846
We know what we're doing.

128
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,223
Yeah, come on!

129
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,992
If Grandpa Heywood could see me now.

130
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:39,063
- Professional?
- Ish.

131
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,598
I know you not

132
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,200
gonna take that, Ray.
Go crush this Tin Man.

133
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,939
- Nice try.
- Come on.

134
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,678
Hold on, I'll close it!

135
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,050
Ah!

136
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,389
Nate!

137
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,092
Ray, get inside! We
have to close the door.

138
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,161
No, I got to go after him.

139
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,430
Gideon, shut the cargo door.

140
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,643
What's happening to the ship?

141
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,778
Jax, what's our status?

142
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,347
<i>I've rerouted power from
the secondary manifolds.</i>

143
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,349
Where are Dr. Palmer and Dr. Heywood?

144
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,686
- Did you check out the window?
- What?

145
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,255
How is it you people haven't
managed to kill yourselves yet?

146
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,791
The day is still young.

147
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,928
- Jax?
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

148
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,502
Gideon, I need you
to track down Ray and Nate

149
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,071
<i>- and take us to their position.
- The explosive decompression</i>

150
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,773
<i>caused us to lose corrective altitude,</i>

151
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,342
<i>which put too much strain on
the station-keeping thrusters.</i>

152
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,544
For God's sake, say it how it is.

153
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,745
We're screwed.

154
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,048
<i>We're screwed.</i>

155
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:34,945
Edo Period.

156
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:39,583
Mid-17th century Japan.

157
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:43,854
That's cool.

158
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,820
Well...

159
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,922
I'm still alive.

160
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:03,326
So far, so good.

161
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,066
Whoa, Samurais.

162
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,569
_

163
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,046
_

164
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:16,673
Oh right, almost forgot.

165
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,683
Can you understand me now?

166
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:28,084
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

167
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:29,452
Okay, he fell from the sky.

168
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:32,255
He's about yea tall.

169
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:33,790
Made out of metal.

170
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,658
No?

171
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:47,804
You're alive.

172
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:51,407
Um, hi. How did I get here?

173
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:54,277
I found you lying at
the bottom of a crater

174
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,981
like you had been dropped from the sky.

175
00:09:57,983 --> 00:10:00,583
Dropped from the sky?

176
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:03,152
That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

177
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:06,089
Yeah, I sailed here,

178
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,091
you know, across the ocean

179
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:09,559
with some friends.

180
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:12,829
Who hopefully are gonna find me.

181
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,397
By the looks of it, I'm gonna say

182
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,699
we're on the island of...

183
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:20,436
Honshu, in the vicinity of Kyoto?

184
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:22,672
Yes.

185
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:24,874
How did you learn to speak my language?

186
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:28,344
I studied it for many years.

187
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:32,315
You know, so I could trade
with your countrymen.

188
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:35,818
Yep, feudal Japan is my jam.

189
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:41,391
Masako,

190
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:43,192
what are you doing

191
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:45,128
<i>talking to this gaijin?</i>

192
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,930
He was hurt, Father.

193
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:49,098
I brought him home so
you could care for him.

194
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,235
And who would care for us
when the Shogun finds out

195
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:55,705
- we're aiding a foreigner?
- Please, Father.

196
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:57,707
You know what they would do to him.

197
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,446
Very well.

198
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:06,449
Get him inside quickly.

199
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:11,854
My name is Nate, by the way.

200
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:16,025
- My name is Masako.
- Masako.

201
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:19,062
That's a pretty name.

202
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:31,441
The Shogun asked you a question.

203
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:34,310
Where did you find your armor?

204
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:36,479
I made it.

205
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:48,057
Your armor is mine now.

206
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,427
You don't understand.

207
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:55,198
I designed the suit
specifically for my body.

208
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,567
Take the armor away.

209
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:01,571
You're making a big mistake.

210
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,072
It could kill you!

211
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,343
Too hot?

212
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:10,380
Are you, um, sure your old man's cool

213
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:13,182
with you giving me a bath?

214
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:16,319
- Mm.
- My father is not home.

215
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:19,389
I'm only giving you a bath

216
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,424
because you are dirty and injured.

217
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:22,725
About that. I'm, uh...

218
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:26,095
I'm more durable than it looks.

219
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:28,531
You still have not told
where you are from.

220
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,300
The United States,

221
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:32,802
which you've never heard of

222
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:36,105
because it doesn't exist
for another 200 years.

223
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:37,607
You are a strange man.

224
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:40,910
You have no idea.

225
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,011
Enough about me,

226
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:45,481
I overheard your father
talk about the Shogun.

227
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:48,117
Is that Tokugawa Iemitsu, by any chance?

228
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:52,722
Historians view him as a
particularly brutal warlord

229
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:55,224
and...

230
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:00,963
Did I say something?

231
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:06,402
Tomorrow I'm to be married
to Tokugawa Iemitsu.

232
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:09,872
Then my life is over.

233
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:17,714
How can you bring a thug
on a rescue mission?

234
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:19,615
I've known men like you.

235
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:21,150
Men who take and prey on the weak.

236
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:22,518
Listen, girly,

237
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,554
I'm risking my neck for two morons

238
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:26,456
who fell out of a ship. Why?

239
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,024
'Cause they'd do the same for me.

240
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:29,792
Why are you on the ship?

241
00:13:29,794 --> 00:13:31,894
'Cause I'm a member of the
Justice Society of America.

242
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:34,630
- It's my job to protect everyone.
- Except for me.

243
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:37,934
You snuck up behind me and
sliced my throat like a ninja.

244
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:39,936
There's no such thing
as ninjas, you idiot.

245
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,871
- Tell that to Chuck Norris.
- Who's that?

246
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:43,172
- And I'm the idiot.
- And by the way,

247
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:44,707
- I'm not your girly.
- All right,

248
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,075
if you two don't quit your squabbling,

249
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:47,310
I am going to maroon you

250
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:49,679
in a time period of my choosing.

251
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:52,548
Together.

252
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,191
Not to brag, but...

253
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:03,659
Between the
docking stabilizers

254
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:04,761
and the blast doors,

255
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,696
I think this might be
my best patchwork ever.

256
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:08,264
Well, charming as your confidence is,

257
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,866
I think we better consult the expert.

258
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:13,669
Gideon, would you be so kind
as to run a diagnostic report?

259
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:15,972
<i>Mr. Jackson's work has done the trick.</i>

260
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:17,173
<i>A scan has revealed that</i>

261
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:18,975
<i>all 36 compartments of the ship</i>

262
00:14:18,977 --> 00:14:20,877
<i>are in optimal condition.</i>

263
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,445
That's weird.

264
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:24,380
Actually, I think it's astonishing given

265
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:26,115
the considerable abuse
we've been under...

266
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,351
No, no, not... not that.

267
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:31,521
Gideon, did you say 36 compartments?

268
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:34,457
<i>Correct. The entirety of the ship.</i>

269
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,560
Before Rip, you know, disappeared,

270
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:40,062
he made me learn every
inch of the Waverider,

271
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:41,798
and of those inches,

272
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,066
35 compartments.

273
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:45,701
So either I miscalculated or...

274
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:48,371
Captain Hunter had a secret compartment

275
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:50,439
he failed to tell you about.

276
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:53,142
Gideon, please pull up the
schematics of the ship.

277
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:55,711
No, we still have to fix the time drive.

278
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:57,547
And we will.

279
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,383
After.

280
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:03,619
Please, don't tell me
you're not intrigued.

281
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:05,621
<i>Masako san,</i>

282
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:06,756
a word please.

283
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:09,158
What's wrong?

284
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,827
The Shogun's men are here.

285
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:12,762
Please come outside.

286
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,610
<i>Konnichiwa. How can I help you?</i>

287
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:30,479
<i>We found a gaijin in the forest.</i>

288
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:31,914
The Shogun wants to make sure

289
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,183
there are not any other
foreigners around

290
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:38,221
- to bother you.
- Oh, that is very kind of him,

291
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:40,523
but you are the only
visitor we've had today.

292
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,158
Good.

293
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,026
The last thing the Shogun wants

294
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,429
before his wedding is surprises.

295
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,899
Too late!

296
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:51,000
What are you doing?

297
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:52,702
Relax, I got this.

298
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:55,271
- Who are you?
- I'm the guy telling you

299
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:57,573
that your Shogun's wedding
has been canceled

300
00:15:57,575 --> 00:15:59,842
on account that he's an asshat.

301
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:05,715
But seriously.

302
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:08,918
Why don't you boys mosey on
back to your big bad boss

303
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,753
and tell him the news?

304
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:13,356
Or what?

305
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:14,891
Or it's gonna get ugly.

306
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:17,693
I am wearing a Samurai's armor.

307
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,028
You are not.

308
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,397
I wear my armor on the inside.

309
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,901
Nate, stop insulting him. I beg of you.

310
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:27,937
Relax, I got this.

311
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:34,510
He caught me off guard.

312
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:36,379
Ah, he caught me off guard.

313
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:38,414
He caught me off guard.

314
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:43,319
Come at me now.

315
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:46,289
It's not turning on.

316
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,324
Stop! Stop! Please!

317
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:49,659
You're going to kill him.

318
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:53,095
That is entirely up to him.

319
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:54,897
<i>Stay down, gaijin.</i>

320
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,866
She doesn't want to marry him.

321
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:08,244
We will return tomorrow to
take you to the castle.

322
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:11,180
I trust there will be no more...

323
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:13,049
surprises.

324
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:30,316
The sword did not cut any vital organs

325
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:32,118
but the blood loss...

326
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,153
Tell me about it.

327
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:35,822
What were you thinking?

328
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:38,157
I didn't mean to cause
you any more trouble.

329
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:40,426
I was just trying to help.

330
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:43,129
No one can help me.

331
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:45,698
We have that in common.

332
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,601
Nate? Nate!

333
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:52,338
The Signal from Ray's ATOM
suit is getting stronger.

334
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,407
Doesn't exactly look inviting, does it?

335
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:57,076
It's like "Ninja III: The Domination."

336
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:58,611
Never took you for a cinephile.

337
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:01,647
All I know is ninjas
like to hide in trees.

338
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:04,851
- I don't see anything.
- Exactly.

339
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:07,019
You don't find them, they find you.

340
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,088
Just because you saw ninjas in a movie,

341
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,890
that doesn't make them real.

342
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,592
I have to side with Mick on this one.

343
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:14,127
They're real.

344
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,828
You think there's a
secret brotherhood of men

345
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,764
trained in the art of assassination?

346
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,098
I hate to break it to you, Amaya,

347
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,434
but I'm basically a ninja.

348
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:27,807
I miss the JSA.

349
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,910
Compartment 36 should
be right about here.

350
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,346
What are you doing, Grey?

351
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:35,047
I'm looking for any hidden doors.

352
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,783
We don't
have time for this.

353
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:39,018
Nate and Ray are lost in Feudal Japan.

354
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,554
Let's just fix the ship and go.

355
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,359
Shh, did you hear that, Jefferson?

356
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:48,227
Move.

357
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,505
- Oh my god.
- Secret hatch.

358
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,207
With a sequencing lock.

359
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:04,510
Clearly, Captain Hunter didn't
want anyone getting in.

360
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:07,847
Or maybe he was trying to keep
something from getting out.

361
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,949
If I've learned one thing from "Lost,"

362
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,718
it's you don't go
opening secret hatches.

363
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,357
Ray's close. Look sharp.

364
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,798
Haircut, let's get out of here.

365
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,468
We're saving your ass, again.

366
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:33,139
It is you who need rescuing.

367
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,914
Fellas, getting a little cold
in here without my suit.

368
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:55,094
You are already defeated
before you have even begun.

369
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:58,931
I have been trained in the art
of war by Shimura himself.

370
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:02,902
League of Assassins, class of '09.

371
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:04,904
Don't take it easy on me.

372
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,274
We got to go.

373
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,480
Oh, hey, guys!

374
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:50,917
- Wrong way, Haircut.
- What about my suit?

375
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:56,889
We can get it later.

376
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:09,029
My friend's serum,

377
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:12,199
it's cured my hemophilia.

378
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:14,701
Uh, long story.

379
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:16,003
Short version,

380
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:18,639
my blood didn't clot like normal people,

381
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,974
so if I were to cut myself shaving

382
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:22,042
or get a paper cut,

383
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:25,178
I could... die.

384
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:29,844
So every day, you were afraid to live?

385
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:31,946
Pretty much.

386
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:36,584
In the Samurai tradition,

387
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,720
a warrior is always prepared for death.

388
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:43,224
A woman celebrates when her
husband dies with honor.

389
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,561
Wow. That's hardcore.

390
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:51,532
A Samurai who fights without armor,

391
00:21:51,534 --> 00:21:54,435
that is hardcore.

392
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:01,609
Nate, you're alive.

393
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,377
Oh, hey, guys! You found me.

394
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:05,579
- Bad timing?
- Nope.

395
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,414
Nope.

396
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,416
Masako, these are,

397
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:12,186
uh, my friends I was telling you about.

398
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,821
<i>Hajimemashite.</i>

399
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:15,222
Can I get you something to drink?

400
00:22:15,224 --> 00:22:16,791
Sake, lots of it.

401
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,260
What he meant to say is
thanks for your hospitality,

402
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:20,728
but we must be going.

403
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,463
- No, I didn't.
- Amaya's right.

404
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:23,964
Nate, let's go.

405
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:26,767
I can't.

406
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:28,803
We can't leave.

407
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,173
Masako's supposed to marry
the Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu.

408
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:33,741
Yeah, met him. Not a fan.

409
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:35,810
Well, the reason he sticks
out in the history books is

410
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,511
because he likes to murder his wives,

411
00:22:37,513 --> 00:22:39,547
and I can't leave Masako to his mercy.

412
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:41,615
Especially since he stole my ATOM suit.

413
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:43,517
Exactly. Wait, what?

414
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,920
You let the Shogun steal a
21st century super-suit?

415
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:48,656
After I crash-landed
trying to rescue you.

416
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,559
How does the Shogun even know
how to operate your ATOM suit?

417
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,794
I designed it so an idiot could use it.

418
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:55,563
An idiot does.

419
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:58,599
Guys, bottom line is, if the
Shogun has the ATOM suit,

420
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,035
it's not just Masako and the
village we have to protect.

421
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:02,903
He can use it to conquer
the whole region.

422
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:05,706
You said the Shogun's coming
for your new girlfriend.

423
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,474
- Uh-huh.
- Easier to defend a village

424
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:09,543
- than to attack a castle.
- But anyone who tries

425
00:23:09,545 --> 00:23:11,378
to fight the Shogun will be cut down.

426
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,914
Except if that person

427
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,650
- is made of steel.
- About that,

428
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:19,954
I'm having a little problem
accessing my powers.

429
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:22,456
Sounds like you're having
performance issues,

430
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,758
and it looks like you're
not done training him yet.

431
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,594
Now the rest of us need to figure out

432
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:28,829
how we can defend a village.

433
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:30,130
Not me.

434
00:23:30,132 --> 00:23:32,132
Wake me up when the action starts.

435
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:47,715
Whoa, what is this place?

436
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,718
It appears to be some sort of armory.

437
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,120
There's a reason why Rip
didn't want us in here.

438
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:55,289
Some things you can't un-see.

439
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,391
But why the big secret?

440
00:23:57,393 --> 00:23:58,726
Rip didn't trust us to know that

441
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,028
there were heavy-duty weapons on board?

442
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,697
Well, would you?

443
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:10,704
Look, Jefferson,

444
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:15,042
our old friend has hailed the Waverider.

445
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:17,745
Let's play it.

446
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,581
<i>Sorry to contact you like
this, Captain Hunter.</i>

447
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,549
<i>But I can't risk putting
any more lives in danger.</i>

448
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:23,784
Thought this was from Barry Allen?

449
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:24,785
It is.

450
00:24:24,787 --> 00:24:26,220
Only from 40 years in the future.

451
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:28,122
<i>- And neither can this.
- Fascinating.</i>

452
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:30,991
<i>Which is why you'll keep what
I'm about to tell you a secret.</i>

453
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:34,328
<i>Even from the rest of your team.</i>

454
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:39,033
The ATOM suit is made of and
powered by dwarf star alloy.

455
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:42,870
It's strong enough to withstand
bullets, arrows, and explosives.

456
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:46,140
- So it's impenetrable?
- Not quite.

457
00:24:46,142 --> 00:24:48,742
Underneath the left thruster
is the alpha-stabilizer.

458
00:24:48,744 --> 00:24:51,779
- Alpha-stabilizer, got it.
- If you destroy it,

459
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,381
the photons that stream
from suit's weapons systems

460
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:55,883
will overheat,

461
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:58,352
theoretically causing somatic overload.

462
00:24:58,354 --> 00:25:00,854
Theoretically, that's...
that's comforting.

463
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:02,756
You have to get close to the Shogun,

464
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:04,792
and in order to do that, you
have to be able to harden.

465
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:08,195
Well, when you're putting it in
those terms it isn't helping.

466
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:09,630
Ow! Neither is that.

467
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,398
It worked the last time.

468
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,733
Ow.

469
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:15,469
Come on. My serum is flawless.

470
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:17,237
Your lack of focus is the problem.

471
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,806
You think I'm not focusing?

472
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,708
Like... enough!

473
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,643
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

474
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:24,211
You don't think I don't
want to save the girl,

475
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:27,514
spare the village, and be a
hero for once in my damn life?

476
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:29,984
I spent half of my
childhood in the hospital

477
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,285
where it didn't even occur to me

478
00:25:31,287 --> 00:25:32,920
to dream about having superpowers.

479
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:35,856
But guess what? I got 'em, I lost 'em,

480
00:25:35,858 --> 00:25:38,359
now I really, really need 'em,
and I can't get 'em back.

481
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:40,828
This isn't all about you.

482
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,163
I worked for years, spent
billions of dollars

483
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:44,631
to develop the ATOM suit.

484
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:46,767
I nearly died learning to shrink,

485
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:50,738
and now, I have to teach you
to destroy the very thing,

486
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,775
the only thing, that makes me a hero.

487
00:25:54,777 --> 00:25:56,543
Wait?

488
00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:59,246
"Somatic overload" means
destroy the suit?

489
00:25:59,248 --> 00:26:02,950
Yeah, Nate.

490
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:05,686
We can't beat the Shogun
while he's wearing the suit,

491
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:07,888
so we have to blow the suit up.

492
00:26:09,892 --> 00:26:12,359
Your powers are within you.

493
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:14,328
After today,

494
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,898
I'll have nothing left.

495
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,000
Ray...

496
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:34,748
You should all be safe here.

497
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:43,023
They've never seen foreigners before.

498
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:44,358
I was once just like them.

499
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,227
My village was also small and isolated.

500
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:49,930
Some would say that my
people were superstitious,

501
00:26:49,932 --> 00:26:51,899
but in truth,

502
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,333
we were protected.

503
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:56,937
Protected by that?

504
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:59,540
Legend has it that this
totem was one of five

505
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:00,874
created by the gods

506
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:04,511
and given to the five
great tribes of Zambesi.

507
00:27:04,513 --> 00:27:06,580
This totem harnesses the ashe,

508
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:08,282
or the... the life force,

509
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:10,284
of the animal kingdom.

510
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:12,086
It was passed down to me from my mother

511
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,221
and from hers before that.

512
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:16,523
And why did you leave?

513
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:19,126
I was recruited by the JSA,

514
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:20,861
and I realized that

515
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:23,697
the world was much larger
than just my village,

516
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:26,066
and that there were
people beyond its borders

517
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:28,735
who also needed protection.

518
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:32,039
Sometimes I can't help but worry

519
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,041
that with me gone,

520
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:37,578
there's no one left to guard my home.

521
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,180
From people like Mr. Rory.

522
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:41,582
At the end of the day,

523
00:27:41,584 --> 00:27:44,651
Mick does the right thing.

524
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:46,453
Usually.

525
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:58,165
You remind me of my son.

526
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,533
Why?

527
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:01,568
Was he a terrible teacher, too?

528
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:08,197
He was a great Samurai.

529
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:15,306
I built him the strongest
and most formidable armor

530
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:17,441
in all of Japan.

531
00:28:17,443 --> 00:28:19,710
Forged him a sword

532
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:22,980
fit for an Emperor.

533
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:26,083
What happened to him?

534
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:29,287
My son was popular

535
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:32,790
with the men who served under him,

536
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:35,760
and the Shogun resented him for it.

537
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:38,629
So he ordered Oda

538
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:41,032
<i>to commit seppuku.</i>

539
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:43,334
We will make sure that the Shogun pays

540
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:45,636
for what he's done to your family.

541
00:28:45,638 --> 00:28:47,538
Maybe.

542
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,540
Maybe not.

543
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,275
But I ask you,

544
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:54,846
would I rather hold my son again

545
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:57,882
or his armor?

546
00:28:57,884 --> 00:28:59,684
Your son, obviously.

547
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:03,754
An armor is nothing but
iron, leather, and silk.

548
00:29:03,756 --> 00:29:05,790
It can be replaced,

549
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:08,559
but the man

550
00:29:08,561 --> 00:29:11,329
who wears the armor is...

551
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:13,030
I get it.

552
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:14,632
You're saying I don't
need a suit of armor

553
00:29:14,634 --> 00:29:15,967
to defeat the Shogun.

554
00:29:15,969 --> 00:29:18,069
Don't be ridiculous.

555
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:21,706
He'll kill you in seconds.

556
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,641
Follow me.

557
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:27,845
I'm gonna die.

558
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:30,114
Yeah, probably.

559
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:33,284
That was actually your
cue to cheer me up.

560
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:34,986
Oh, if you accept death

561
00:29:34,988 --> 00:29:37,655
you have nothing to fear.

562
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:41,325
I'm more afraid of what's
gonna happen to you if I die.

563
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:45,496
I know I have these powers inside me.

564
00:29:45,498 --> 00:29:47,865
I just can't figure out how to use them.

565
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:49,934
Does a child learn to laugh?

566
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:52,737
Does he sit and practice laughing?

567
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:53,971
No.

568
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:55,678
He just laughs.

569
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:57,235
Hmm.

570
00:29:57,443 --> 00:30:00,711
"Do or do not, there is no try."

571
00:30:00,713 --> 00:30:02,046
Exactly.

572
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:04,548
Where did you learn that?

573
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,119
From a great sensei

574
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,288
from where I'm from.

575
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,123
Yoda.

576
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:15,493
Ah, this Master Yoda is very wise.

577
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,199
The Shogun approaches.

578
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:24,168
Get to the temple.

579
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:53,082
Where is my bride?

580
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,065
She's not leaving.

581
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:56,691
Not with you.

582
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,301
I'm just gonna need a second.

583
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,158
_

584
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:20,642
_

585
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:29,690
Find the villagers. Kill them.

586
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:38,065
Your form is all wrong.

587
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:48,347
I ordered Ichiro to destroy that blade

588
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:51,085
after the death of his son.

589
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,279
Very well.

590
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:56,917
I will destroy it myself.

591
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:03,417
<i>Konnichiwa, scumbag.</i>

592
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,188
Go get him.

593
00:32:10,692 --> 00:32:12,625
I will kill you

594
00:32:12,627 --> 00:32:16,129
with your own armor.

595
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,201
Check the temple.

596
00:32:20,202 --> 00:32:22,235
Rematch?

597
00:32:24,405 --> 00:32:27,474
- Who is your master?
- I have no master.

598
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:30,911
A ronin. You're not
worthy of the effort.

599
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:56,814
You have fought with honor.

600
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,672
Now you will die with it.

601
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:00,607
About that.

602
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:12,018
This village is under our protection.

603
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,954
Leave now and we'll spare your lives.

604
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:39,245
A sword is only as deadly
as the man who wields it.

605
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:51,324
And armor is only as strong
as the man who wears it.

606
00:34:14,115 --> 00:34:15,748
I don't want to shoot you guys.

607
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,650
I love ninjas.

608
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,610
That was the armature relay.

609
00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:45,845
It enhances the limbs' reaction time.

610
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:05,298
Where the hell is Mick?

611
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,967
Probably ransacking the village himself.

612
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,778
Told you ninjas were real.

613
00:35:20,948 --> 00:35:22,215
That's the cooling system.

614
00:35:22,217 --> 00:35:23,883
Trust me, it gets hot in there. I know.

615
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:25,785
You think you are clever.

616
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,366
You dishonor my family
and torture my village.

617
00:35:40,368 --> 00:35:42,969
I will enjoy killing you.

618
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,679
Your family will be
extinguished from history.

619
00:35:58,987 --> 00:36:00,720
We haven't been introduced.

620
00:36:00,722 --> 00:36:02,622
Name's Steel.

621
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:29,515
- Remember, you got to hit...
- I remember!

622
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:39,859
Do it!

623
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:02,081
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

624
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,385
- You did it.
- I did it.

625
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:07,220
Yeah...

626
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:09,088
you blew up the ATOM suit.

627
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:18,631
I am so sorry.

628
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:20,667
It's okay.

629
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:22,835
You steeled on.

630
00:37:22,837 --> 00:37:25,738
Kind of proud of you.

631
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:38,172
Master Yoda taught you well.

632
00:37:39,575 --> 00:37:42,643
Right, uh, Yoda. Well, thank you.

633
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:44,545
Um...

634
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:46,780
I was thinking now that,

635
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:49,283
uh, your wedding is canceled...

636
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:55,722
You come from the sky.

637
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:59,093
Something tells me you have to return.

638
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,769
I, um...

639
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:12,306
I'm glad the katana sword
found a worthy owner.

640
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:14,241
Me too.

641
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:18,545
You.

642
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:21,715
Don't think I didn't see how
you stood up to the Shogun.

643
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:22,883
Even though he's gone,

644
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:25,719
your village still needs a protector.

645
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:31,825
That sword,

646
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:34,628
what did you say your family name was?

647
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,029
Yamashiro.

648
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:44,171
Thank you for loaning
me your son's armor.

649
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:47,508
I'm sorry it got a bit
dinged up in the battle.

650
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:50,477
Then it served its purpose.

651
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:52,679
Haircut. Steel.

652
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:56,683
Sara says we got to clear out.

653
00:38:56,685 --> 00:39:00,120
- Good-bye, Masako.
- Good-bye, Nate.

654
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,325
What an amazing time period.

655
00:39:05,327 --> 00:39:08,662
Definitely my favorite,
besides the Old West.

656
00:39:08,664 --> 00:39:11,265
Why are you two goofy bastards so happy?

657
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,600
You lost your damn suit, the food sucks,

658
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:17,070
and I've got no proof ninjas exist.

659
00:39:31,252 --> 00:39:32,886
What are you staring at?

660
00:39:32,888 --> 00:39:34,788
I've figured you out.

661
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,823
Congratulations.

662
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:40,194
You act like this selfish meathead,

663
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:43,764
but secretly, you're not so bad.

664
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:46,900
You know, you might even
have the makings of a hero.

665
00:39:46,902 --> 00:39:49,570
Well, that proves one thing.

666
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:52,606
You don't know me.

667
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:54,708
Perhaps not.

668
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:58,412
Trying to kill me again?

669
00:39:58,414 --> 00:40:00,147
Trying to give you a present.

670
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:03,750
In case you ever need proof
you met an actual ninja.

671
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:21,568
All right. What's your secret?

672
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:24,271
What on earth do you mean?

673
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:26,073
Well, you two must be magicians

674
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:28,175
considering how badly
damaged the Waverider was

675
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:30,244
- before we left.
- Oh, that.

676
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:33,580
Well, Jefferson and I went
over the ship top to bottom.

677
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:37,317
And safe to say there are no
surprises left on the Waverider.

678
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,855
Great. I'll go prep for takeoff.

679
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,661
So are we gonna say something

680
00:40:47,663 --> 00:40:49,363
about future-Barry's message or not?

681
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:50,764
Barry was very clear

682
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:52,799
about the team not knowing
what he told Captain Hunter.

683
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:55,502
Except now we know.

684
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:57,371
Indeed.

685
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,539
You were right, Jefferson.

686
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,343
Some things you just can't un-see.

687
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:09,883
I think it's time we said sayonara

688
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,452
to Feudal Japan. Now, where to next?

689
00:41:12,454 --> 00:41:16,089
I could always open the hatch,
jump out, and see where I land.

690
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:18,625
I say we just sit back and see
where the timestream takes us.

691
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:21,461
Aren't you forgetting that Rex's
killer is still at-large?

692
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:24,965
Not my problem.

693
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:28,001
I mean, we should find the
bastard and kill him.

694
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:31,038
Perhaps we can enjoy a
little takeoff music.

695
00:41:32,508 --> 00:41:34,441
Ah, nice one, Gideon.

696
00:41:34,443 --> 00:41:37,844
<i>Captain Hunter always enjoyed this song.</i>

697
00:41:37,846 --> 00:41:40,047
<i>- ♪ Time...
- Speaking of problems.</i>

698
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:41,815
Don't worry. We're gonna find Rip

699
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:43,250
and Hourman's killer.

700
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:45,452
In the meantime, everyone just shut up

701
00:41:45,454 --> 00:41:47,254
and let me do the flying.

702
00:41:52,528 --> 00:41:55,239
