1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,579
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,152
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:08,156
by something impossible.

4
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:09,597
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,472
(Barry) My father went to
prison for her murder.

6
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:16,415
Then an accident made me the impossible.

7
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,960
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:18,962 --> 00:00:22,139
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,843
and find others like me.

10
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:26,183
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:27,419
Mom!

12
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:28,724
(Barry) And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:31,329
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,836
<i>(Cisco) Previously on The Flash...</i>

15
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:34,340
(Iris) If you love me,

16
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:35,977
you'll tell me what is going on with you.

17
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:38,783
Keeping her in the dark keeps her safe.

18
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:40,019
I don't agree.

19
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:42,389
Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

20
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:45,060
15 years ago, Harrison and I
were thick as thieves.

21
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:46,729
We were promising young scientists,

22
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,904
and then everything changed
after Tess died.

23
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,152
- Who are you?
- My name is Eobard Thawne.

24
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:56,595
In the year 2020, you and your wife

25
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,401
successfully launched
a particle accelerator

26
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:00,841
that changed the course of history.

27
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,312
I need it to happen a bit sooner

28
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:03,349
if I'm going to get back.

29
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,989
(Tina) After that day,

30
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:08,496
Harrison Wells became
a completely different person.

31
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:14,447
(Barry) I'm getting faster,
faster than I've ever been,

32
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,420
and I wonder if it's because
lately something's chasing me.

33
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:20,261
I know what it is that's stalking me.

34
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:22,067
It's my past.

35
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:23,840
It's getting closer, and as fast as I am,

36
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:25,911
I can't help but feel like my past

37
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:29,383
has almost caught up with me.

38
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:31,087
- Where's Barry?
- He should be here any second.

39
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:32,958
I sent him out for...

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,926
Pizza!

41
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,399
- What?
- From Coast City?

42
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:38,804
Supposedly the best in the west.

43
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:40,772
Why did I not think of this before?

44
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:42,307
Come to papa.

45
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:43,509
Caitlin?

46
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:45,378
I'm not hungry.

47
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,520
Okay, six months
of investigating Harrison Wells

48
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:50,659
has led us nowhere, so we're going back

49
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:53,063
to the beginning to see
what we can find out.

50
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:54,165
What does that mean?

51
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,534
Road trip, baby.

52
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:57,406
Joe and Cisco are going
to go to Starling City.

53
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,507
Starling City? What for?

54
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,142
To investigate the car accident

55
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:02,614
that Dr. Wells was in
with Tess Morgan 15 years ago.

56
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:04,219
I... I don't understand. Why?

57
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:06,658
Dr. McGee said that after Wells's accident,

58
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,928
he became like a complete stranger.

59
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,699
Just a different person entirely.

60
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:13,002
Because the love of his life died?

61
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:15,273
You of all people can understand how grief

62
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:16,542
can change a person.

63
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:19,111
Caitlin, we believe that Dr. Wells

64
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:21,214
is the Reverse-Flash
and killed Barry's mother,

65
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:23,218
and he may have done
the same thing to Tess Morgan.

66
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,621
We have to learn everything
we can about that night.

67
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:27,722
See where it leads us.

68
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:29,893
Oh, um, can you cover for me

69
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:31,629
with Dr. Wells?

70
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:34,565
You mean lie?

71
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,669
Yeah.

72
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:37,937
I need some air.

73
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,505
Whoa... hey, Caitlin...

74
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:44,944
Doesn't look like Caitlin's with us.

75
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:47,213
No, she's with us. I'll talk to her.

76
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:48,580
What do you want us to do here?

77
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:50,715
Business as usual while we're gone.

78
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:53,419
Copy that.

79
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:56,856
Well, I want to wish you
good luck over there,

80
00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:58,558
but I'm also scared of what you might find.

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,161
Scared is a good thing.

82
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,598
Scared keeps us alive.

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,532
Can you get the door, Nina?

84
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,767
- Nina?
- Oh.

85
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,635
Sorry.

86
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:13,338
Wrapped up in my own little world.

87
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,072
Late night?

88
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:20,241
Just one more thing to do
before I make my escape.

89
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:23,474
- See you tomorrow.
- Night.

90
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,243
[suspenseful music]

91
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:47,790
(Thawne) So let's go over this again.

92
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:51,490
This is you on the
surveillance footage, correct?

93
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:54,289
It looks like me.

94
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:58,060
But it's not me.

95
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:00,028
I left work early yesterday.

96
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,429
Ask my husband.

97
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:05,028
Footage doesn't lie. Your husband might.

98
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,995
(Nina) That's not me.

99
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:11,597
No priors, no arrests,
not even a speeding ticket.

100
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,798
And everyone who knows this woman,

101
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,232
coworkers, neighbors,

102
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:16,166
say she's the kindest, nicest,

103
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,167
most honest woman they've ever met.

104
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:20,635
So, unless she woke up this morning

105
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:23,003
and out of nowhere
decided to become a criminal...

106
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,339
Maybe we should be
looking for a meta-human.

107
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,641
Yeah.

108
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:27,342
One that can control people's minds.

109
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:29,344
Coerce them into becoming thieves.

110
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,811
Is that possible?

111
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,044
Is that a real question?

112
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:33,045
Hi, Barry.

113
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:34,647
Hey.

114
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,817
Have you, um, seen my dad?

115
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,418
Captain Singh says he took a
couple of days off,

116
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,086
and he hasn't been home.

117
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,554
I didn't ask.

118
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:44,125
Apparently he's taking
a couple of personal days.

119
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:47,759
Like father, like daughter I guess.

120
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:53,196
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:54,831
When are you coming home?

122
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,100
When it starts to feel like a home again.

123
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:03,202
You better pray Joe and Cisco
find something on Wells

124
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:04,569
at that accident site, Barry,

125
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:08,374
because I am just about done lying to Iris.

126
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,977
About all of this.

127
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,811
Yeah.

128
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:21,982
I recently inherited the entire collection.

Beautiful.

This is Dominic over at Abbott Jewelers.

134

I've got a guy in here
trying to sell stolen diamonds.

135
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,242
- Good morning.
- Hey.

136
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,708
Hey, look, uh...
can we talk about last night?

137
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,109
There's nothing to talk about.

138
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,109
Yeah, there is actually. Caitlin, look,

139
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:54,778
I know after everything Dr. Wells has done

140
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,979
for all of us, it's hard to wrap
your head around this,

141
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,780
but I need you to see the truth.

142
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:00,382
The truth?

143
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:03,584
The truth is that he saved
your life multiple times.

144
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:05,520
Look, I know. But if I'm right about this...

145
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:06,789
If, Barry, if.

146
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,325
And before I can believe any of this,

147
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,060
I'm gonna need to see some proof.

148
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:11,529
Proof?

149
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:13,799
Proof of what?

meta-human case on our hands.

Ah. We are always happy
to help, Barry, as you know.

Have you heard from Cisco?
He hasn't arrived yet.

153
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:26,582
Uh, he has to help Dante, his brother.

154
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:28,884
He might need a few days off.

155
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:30,018
Ah, well.

selling some of the jewelry

stolen from the bank last night.

Could be the teller's partner.

I think he's made me.

I could use The Flash's help.

[both grunting]

168
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,197
Oh!

169
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,800
[grunting]

170
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:19,945
You can't outrun me.

171
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:22,079
I won't have to.

172
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:38,163
Well, that was new.

173
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,181
A shape-shifter?

174
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:50,483
Yeah, I literally saw a grown man, like,

175
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:53,383
m... morph into a teenage girl.

176
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:54,816
That's fascinating.

177
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:56,985
Today's physicists have always regarded

178
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:59,621
programmable matter
as nothing more than a theory,

179
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:02,523
but I guess your shape-shifter
proves it can be done.

180
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,324
Wait, so he, or she, or I... whatever.

181
00:08:05,326 --> 00:08:08,259
This person can actually transform

182
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:09,428
into anyone they touch?

183
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,530
Yes, it appears so.

184
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,229
That includes you, Mr. Allen.

185
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,297
Dr. Wells is right.
If you are touched while

186
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:17,529
you're the Flash,
and he transforms into you,

187
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,195
we run the risk of him exposing

188
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,295
that Barry Allen
is the man behind the mask.

189
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:22,697
Because at this point we don't know

190
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,733
if the shape-shifter
is capable of absorbing more

191
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:26,435
that just your physical characteristics.

192
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,071
Like he might be able to copy my speed?

193
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:29,305
That would be bad.

194
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,507
Got it. Hands off the meta-human.

195
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:33,076
Hands off the meta-human.

196
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,778
So how do we find someone
who can transform into anyone?

197
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,378
(Wells) We, I guess like any problem,

198
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,010
you just go back to the beginning.

199
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:40,876
In this case, that would mean
finding the first person

200
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:42,176
the shape-shifter morphed into

201
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:43,508
when they discovered their powers.

202
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,343
Yeah, can you pull up the CCPD records

203
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:47,212
of cases where the perpetrator
plead innocent,

204
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,146
even thought they were caught
on camera committing the crime?

205
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:50,879
You're good, Barry Allen.

206
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,279
You're very good.

207
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,313
[tense music]

208
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:57,381
Look at this.
Multiple crimes of this manner

209
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:58,714
all dating back to a month

210
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:01,282
after the particle accelerator explosion.

211
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:05,587
And the first one was?

212
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,621
Jacob Fisher. A teller at the
Federal Credit Union.

213
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:11,089
Claims he was innocent, and was
framed by his best friend,

214
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:13,058
a Hannibal Bates.

215
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,593
I'll pass this along to the CCPD,

216
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,728
see if they can track him down.

217
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,464
- Good.
- Thank you, Dr. Wells.

218
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:20,300
Always here to help, Barry.

219
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:28,742
[dramatic music]

220
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:36,050
There it is.

221
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,618
This is all you have?

222
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,252
Well, it's a pretty
cut and dry case, Detective.

223
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:41,623
Harrison Wells, Tess Morgan
are out on a Sunday drive,

224
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,092
the tires blow, Wells loses control,

225
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:46,627
and, uh... sadly Tess dies on the scene.

226
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,063
Couldn't imagine carrying
that kind of guilt around.

227
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:53,335
So, uh... what are you two hoping to find?

228
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:55,536
We're not exactly sure yet.

229
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:57,735
You come all the way from Central City,
you don't know what you're looking for?

230
00:09:58,135 --> 00:09:59,035
Just following a hunch.

231
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:00,938
Uh, can you take us to the accident site?

232
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,674
It's been 15 years.
I think the pictures will

233
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:03,875
serve you better.

234
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:06,510
Still, we'd appreciate a look.

235
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:09,245
Whatever you need.

236
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:11,579
Captain, I need those witness statements

237
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,947
for the Joshua Brown trial.

238
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:18,253
Um, yeah, well,
like I told you, end of day.

239
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:20,456
Sorry, uh, Detective West, Cisco Ramon,

240
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,823
this is A.D.A. Laurel Lance.

241
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:23,823
Related?

Daughter.

243
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:29,163
- Hi. Hi.
- Hey there.

244
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:31,464
You work at S.T.A.R. Labs
with Barry Allen, right?

245
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:32,966
Uh, yeah.

246
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:36,004
Can I talk to you privately for a minute?

247
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:37,807
Sure.

248
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:40,778
[playful music]

249
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,946
So, uh... how is Allen?

250
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:46,848
Not too messed up from getting
hit by that lightning, I hope.

251
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,818
No, no.

252
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,218
How do you know Barry?

253
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,717
Are you guys, like, friends or something?

254
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,986
Not really.

255
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,022
We met last time he was in Starling City

256
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,593
visiting my friends.

257
00:10:56,595 --> 00:11:00,296
John Diggle, Felicity Smoak,
and Oliver Queen.

258
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:03,771
Three people who have
absolutely nothing in common.

259
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:05,039
As far as I know.

260
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,440
Cisco, I know Barry's The Flash,

261
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:08,573
and Oliver's The Arrow.

[chuckles]

263
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:14,215
How do you know that?

264
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:17,885
Because I'm the Black Canary.

265
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,254
- Stop playing.
- It's true.

266
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:21,056
You stop it right now.

267
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:23,960
No. [laughing]

268
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:26,899
Okay, okay. Calm down.

269
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:30,873
I love you.

270
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:35,412
I mean, I love the way
that you beat up criminals.

272
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,247
Wait.

273
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:42,419
Why are you telling me this?

274
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:45,553
Because I need some technical expertise.

275
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,557
I've been using my sister's sonic device.

276
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:53,496
I was hoping you could help... modify it.

277
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:58,398
Yeah. I think I've got some ideas.

278
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,134
Great.

What... are you spying on me now?

00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:29,231
Caitlin, what were you doing
at Wells's house?

287
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:32,301
I was gonna talk to him
and get some answers of my own.

288
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:35,172
You can't. You cannot talk to him.

289
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:36,874
Oh, so I'm just supposed to stand by

290
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:39,609
and watch all of you ruin this man's life?

291
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,478
Ruin my life?

292
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,716
What are you talking about "your life?"

293
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:49,158
Those nine months that you were in a coma

294
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,459
were the worst of my life.

295
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:54,965
I lost my reputation, my fiancé,

296
00:13:54,967 --> 00:14:00,305
and through all of that,
Harrison Wells stood by my side.

297
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:03,440
He told me everything was going to be okay.

298
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,944
If Dr. Wells is who you say he is,

299
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,978
everything I've done since the minute

300
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,915
I stepped foot in S.T.A.R. Labs

301
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,619
has been a lie.

302
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,986
Caitlin.

303
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:21,725
If I am right about all of this,

304
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:25,696
and you tell him what's been going on,

305
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,835
I'll never be able to get
my dad out of prison.

306
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,435
Barry.

307

If not for me, just do it for him.

I can't believe
you're pulling the dad card.

313

Turns out Hannibal Bates hasn't
been seen in well over a year.

314
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:07,713
Only remaining relative is his grandmother.

315
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:09,715
She took out a missing person's report

316
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:12,552
a couple of days after
the Jacob Fisher arrest.

317
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:14,587
Figure we could ask her a few questions.

318
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:16,056
Like why anyone in their family

319
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:17,757
thought that naming a kid Hannibal

320
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,392
wouldn't mean he'd grow up
to become a criminal?

321
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:21,929
[chuckles]

322
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:24,264
Have you heard from your
grandson, Hannibal, recently,

323
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,230
Mrs. Bates?

324
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:26,564
- Recently?
- Uh-huh.

325
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:29,168
No. Why do you ask?

326
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,002
Oh, please.

327
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:33,704
Um...

328
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:37,209
because you filed a missing person's report

329
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:38,610
over a year ago.

330
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:41,411
Oh, yes, I certainly did.

331
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:44,479
You'll have to forgive me, Detective.

332
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:47,379
My memory is not quite as it used to be.

333
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:48,913
Of course.

334
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:52,316
Uh, neither apparently are my manners.

335
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,818
May I get you two something?

336
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,354
Coffee, tea?

337
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,989
Uh, no thank you, ma'am. We're fine.

338
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,259
Oh, please.

339
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,730
It'll only take a minute.

340
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:04,900
It's nice to have visitors.

341
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,102
Coffee'd be nice.

342
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:10,705
(Thawne) Thanks.

343
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:16,813
[clock ticking]

344
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,488
Ma'am, would you happen
to have a recent photograph

345
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,588
of Hannibal?

346
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,860
[clock chiming]

347
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,395
Ma'am?

348
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,835
[dramatic music]

349
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:35,437
She's gone.

350
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,973
I'll take the front.

351
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:40,911
[suspenseful music]

352
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,287
Hey, we located Bates.

353
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,754
He was impersonating his grandma.

354
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,222
Barry, do not let him touch you.

355
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,324
Or let him see you use your super speed.

356
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:52,792
Well, how am I supposed to catch him?

357
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:53,860
(Wells) The old-fashioned way.

358
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:55,961
Run like a normal person.

359
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,961
Okay, all right.

360
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,095
Oh, man.

361
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,775
[crashing]

362
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:38,429
[siren wailing]

363
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,068
What do you want us to do, Thawne?

364
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,769
Die.

365
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:48,337
[both screaming]

366
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,084
Barry, call 911.

367
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:07,255
[siren wailing]

368
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,558
What do you want us to do, Thawne?

369
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,729
- Die.
- [gunfire]

370
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,694
I know what this looks like, Cecile.

371
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:21,329
It looks like one of your detectives

372
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:22,297
shot two of your cops,

373
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,466
both of whom are now
fighting for their lives.

374
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:25,668
That's not what happened.

375
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,270
David, I am the district attorney.

376
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,439
I can't ignore what I just watched

377
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,740
because you want me to.

378
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,208
We both know there are things going on

379
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,908
in this city that can't be explained.

380
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,309
Come on, David. Until you show me something

381
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,808
incontrovertible, the best that I can do

382
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,243
is promise to keep him out of
gen pop at Iron Heights.

383
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:45,444
[indistinct chatter]

384
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:52,455
Do you have any way to explain this, Allen?

385
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:54,594
I'm working on it.

386
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:57,564
[dramatic music]

387
00:18:57,566 --> 00:18:59,200
- Barry.
- Iris.

388
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:00,903
What is going on?
Everyone at CCPN is saying

389
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:01,870
that Eddie shot two cops.

390
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:02,939
How is that even possible?

391
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,207
We're not sure yet.

392
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,542
You don't think he did this, do you?

393
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,411
- No, of course not.
- I need to see him.

394
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,113
You can't... you can't see him, all right?

395
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,948
They're not gonna let you. Look...

396
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,951
I'm gonna do everything I can to help him.

397
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:15,186
- Okay.
- Okay?

398
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,220
Okay, I'm so sorry.

399
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,257
[crying]

400
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,190
It's gonna be okay.

401
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,924
- Okay.
- I promise.

402
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,060
All right?

403
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,831
[panting]

404
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,033
(West) This is definitely the place.

405
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:34,340
Cisco, let's see what we can find.

406
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:36,477
What is that? A, uh, metal detector?

407
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,912
Uh, essentially.

408
00:19:37,914 --> 00:19:39,614
Only instead of listening
for metal objects,

409
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:40,749
I'm listening for anything

410
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:42,518
that emits a abnormal sound wave.

411
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,021
- [clicks tongue]
- Right.

412
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:45,822
- [chuckles]
- Where'd you find this kid?

413
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:47,288
It's a long story.

414
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,856
So, it must be interesting
having a daughter

415
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:50,289
who is also the D.A.

416
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,324
[chuckles] Yeah, interesting's the word.

417
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,193
- I have a daughter of my own.
- Same line of work?

418
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,163
No, I wouldn't let her
anywhere near this nonsense.

419
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:57,499
[chuckles] Smart guy.

420
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:58,801
Overprotective.

421
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:00,437
You two get along?

422
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,638
We don't always see eye to eye,

423
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,275
but no matter how mad she gets at me

424
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:05,511
or how mad I get at her,

425
00:20:05,513 --> 00:20:07,346
there's a strong bond.

426
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:08,614
Why?

427
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:10,117
You two have a bit of a rough patch?

428
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,819
Yeah, she, uh...

429
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:12,921
she kept something from me,

430
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:14,122
you know, something important.

431
00:20:14,124 --> 00:20:16,926
Lied to me about it for months.

432
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:18,495
Hard to come back from something like that.

433
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:20,632
Mm. She give a reason?

434
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,434
Not one I could accept.

435
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:25,937
Ah. Well, sometimes we lie for love.

436
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:27,472
Especially when it comes to family, right?

437
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:28,575
[beeping]

438
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:29,610
- Joe!
- Yeah?

439
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,548
I think we got something.

440
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,816
Tachyons. Little bits of time travel.

441
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,385
You sure?

442
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:40,823
Pretty sure, yeah.

443
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,393
I didn't shoot those officers.

444
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:46,795
Yeah, the Captain certainly
plead your case.

445
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,698
The results of the GSR swab.

446
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,499
(Barry) Detective Thawne's
hands are completely free

447
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,966
of lead, barium, and antimony.

448
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,467
Yet no one can seem to explain

449
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,669
how the surveillance video clearly shows

450
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,935
Thawne firing his weapon.

451
00:20:56,937 --> 00:20:58,902
It only looked like Detective Thawne.

452
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:00,505
Mr. Allen, no.

453
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:03,078
Aren't you supposed to be
the scientist around here?

454
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,714
It's hard to blame her.
That video is pretty damning.

455
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:11,249
No. No, we just have to convince her.

456
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:13,554
Seeing is believing, Barry.

457
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:15,388
They're gonna put me away.

458
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,200
Okay, look, you get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

459
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:25,267
They'll set you up with a burner phone.

460
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:26,535
- I'll contact...
- No.

461
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:27,970
I run now, that surveillance video

462
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:29,272
is the least of my problems.

463
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:30,740
No way I don't smell guilty.

464
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:31,908
No way they'll let me stay on the force.

465
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,243
Look, you said it yourself,

466
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,378
if we don't find Hannibal Bates,

467
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,579
you go to prison.

468
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:36,880
For a crime you didn't commit.

469
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:38,315
I'm not gonna let that happen. Not again.

470
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:40,150
This isn't like your dad, Barry.

471
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:41,118
Eddie, look.

472
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,720
When you dad was put away,

473
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:43,954
you were a kid.

474
00:21:43,956 --> 00:21:45,456
There wasn't anything you could do.

475
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,624
But you're not a kid anymore.

476
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:47,989
You're a scientist.

477
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:51,560
Hell, you're The Flash.

478
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:53,064
You are going to find Bates,

479
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:55,000
and you are going to clear me.

480
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:56,933
So go do it.

481
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:58,301
[rousing music]

482
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:00,002
All right.

483
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:07,201
Get me out of here the right way.

484
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:08,737
(Barry) I promise, Iris.

485
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:10,406
Now, I'm just here to shower and change,

486
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:12,007
and then I'm going right back to my lab.

487
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:13,975
I swear I'm going to get
Eddie out of this, okay?

488
00:22:13,977 --> 00:22:15,777
[knocking]

489
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:17,744
I'll call you later, all right?

490
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,416
Eddie? What in the world?
How did you get out?

491
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:25,518
Captain Singh called in a favor.

492
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,952
Got a judge to sign my release.

493
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:28,519
I was just on the phone with Iris.

494
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,422
Why haven't you called her? Hold on.

495
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:32,124
[grunting]

496
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:34,328
I have no idea who she is.

497
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,234
[dramatic music]

498
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:01,591
[chuckles]

499
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:06,091
[doorbell ringing]

500
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:08,826
Barry, it's me.

501
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:11,699
Hello... you.

502
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:14,069
I think I figured out
a way to stop our shapeshifter

503
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:15,469
from morphing into other people.

504
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:16,402
Oh, really?

505
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:18,004
What if I create a serum

506
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:20,442
that will terminate
the polymerization reaction,

507
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:23,780
essentially forcing the bonds
to revert to their original form

508
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:25,849
stopping him from being able
to control his power.

509
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:27,451
You can do that?

510
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:31,287
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay.

511
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:32,991
What's wrong with you?

512
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:34,561
Nothing.

513
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:36,463
Look, about last night,

514
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:39,032
I can't imagine
how hard this must be for you.

515
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,866
I mean, I know how desperate you are

516
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:42,498
to solve your mom's murder.

517
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,669
But let's just bury the hatchet,

518
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:48,271
and we'll go back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

519
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:51,037
Figure out how to catch this everyman.

520
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,972
"Everyman?"

521
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,209
Bad nickname?

522
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:55,512
No.

523
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:57,946
No, I kinda like it.

524
00:23:57,948 --> 00:23:59,682
Okay, good. Me, too.

525
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:11,498
Wait, hold up, Cisco.

526
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,235
Please tell me that's not
what I think it is.

527
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:16,506
Okay, that is definitely a hand.

528
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:18,143
Okay, see, I thought it was a foot,

529
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:20,347
but a hand is just as bad.

530
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:26,724
That is freaky.

531
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,527
That is proof, Cisco.

532
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:29,660
I'll need to test it to be certain.

533
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:31,191
I'm gonna grab my kit.

534
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:32,359
Okay, I'm gonna have to call this one in.

535
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:34,728
I can't let you do that.

536
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,631
Now I'm asking you, cop to cop,

537
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:38,732
keep this under wraps.

538
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:40,067
Forget you ever saw it.

539
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:42,001
- West, I can't do that.
- Listen, Lance,

540
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:43,703
if this is who I think it is,

541
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:45,105
anybody that knows about this

542
00:24:45,107 --> 00:24:46,240
is in a hell of a lot of danger,

543
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:48,074
including my daughter.

544
00:24:48,076 --> 00:24:49,641
As mad as you are at Laurel,

545
00:24:49,643 --> 00:24:51,243
I can't imagine you wouldn't do anything

546
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:53,346
to protect her.

547
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:55,682
[suspenseful music]

548
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:57,283
[sighs]

549
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:02,251
[sprightly music]

550
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:04,517
Hey. Good to go.

551
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,753
Just need to give it a little spin.

552
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,955
Oh.

553
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,725
Right. Yes.

554
00:25:13,727 --> 00:25:15,891
A spin.

555
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:20,496
So this, uh...

556
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:21,831
serum that you're making,

557
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,599
is it a temporary fix,

558
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:26,402
or will it take away his power permanently?

559
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:27,571
Not permanently.

560
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:31,978
Just long enough so we can stop him.

561
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,516
And how long is it going to take?

562
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:39,089
Not long.

563
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:42,727
We just need...

564
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:44,930
What are you doing?

565
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:58,038
Something I think I should have done...

566
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:01,879
a long time ago.

567
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:07,318
Mm.

568
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,989
Barry, uh...

569
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:17,624
[beeping]

570
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:19,293
Oh, my God.

571
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:20,629
Look who's here.

572
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:23,198
Yes. Her.

573
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:29,868
Hi, I have been looking for you everywhere.

574
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,172
Here I am. What's up?

575
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,538
Look, whoever is framing Eddie,
I got to thinking.

576
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,237
What if they've done
something like this before?

577
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,205
I went through CCPN's crime archives,

578
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:41,606
and in the last 11 months,
there have been six crimes

579
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:43,005
committed by people who later swore

580
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:44,039
that they were innocent.

581
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,474
None of them had priors,

582
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:47,442
all of them had rock-solid alibis.

583
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:50,673
- All right.
- So...

584
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,041
I hacked into my dad's CCPD account,

585
00:26:53,043 --> 00:26:55,777
and went through the footage
of Eddie shooting those cops.

586
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,011
[computer beeping] Look.

587
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:58,046
What do you want us to do, Thawne?

588
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:01,250
- Die
- [gunfire]

589
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:07,054
What's wrong with you?

590
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:08,888
Huh? Nothing.

591
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,923
I didn't do anything.

592
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:15,394
I don't know.
Seems pretty convincing to me.

593
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:18,133
- Look again.
- [computer beeping]

594
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:19,699
Eddie is not left-handed.

595
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:21,899
Look, Eddie is being framed,
and we need to figure out

596
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,700
who is behind this.

597
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:25,737
And believe me,
when I get my hands on them,

598
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:26,638
they are going to be...

599
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,143
[buzzing] [grunting]

600
00:27:30,145 --> 00:27:32,312
Oh, my God. What did you do?

601
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:35,516
Your observations about the
shooter were spot on, Miss West.

602
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:37,552
He was indeed left-handed.

603
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:39,088
As is this man.

604
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,595
Our Barry... is right-handed.

605
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:45,597
Oh, I knew it.

606
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,068
- Never mind.
- Then this is him.

607
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,369
It is indeed.

608
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:51,071
I need to take him in to the police.

609
00:27:51,073 --> 00:27:52,337
(Iris) If they can see what he can do,

610
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,873
then maybe they'll let Eddie go.

611
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,345
Perhaps it might be best
if Dr. Snow and I handle this.

612
00:27:56,347 --> 00:27:57,347
Mm.

613
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,948
What are you two going to do?

614
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,454
No. No, no, no. I'm taking him in.

615
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:07,325
Of course.

616
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:09,561
Well, at least let me help you.

617
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:17,634
There is a reporter at work who kept a file

618
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:20,069
of these sorts of things.

619
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:23,707
You know, all of the unexplained
events in the city.

620
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:26,577
This guy...

621
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,981
definitely belongs in that file.

622
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:31,283
That's gonna be a pretty big file.

623
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:34,485
[construction clattering]

624

[indistinct chatter]

625
00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:40,689
You know who else is in that file?

626
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:42,459
The Burning Man.

627
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:43,893
Oh, really? What about him?

628
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:47,429
I thought he was just some urban legend.

629
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:50,166
Help me! Help me, help me, help me!

630
00:28:50,168 --> 00:28:52,766
- Oh, no.
- Someone, please, help me!

631
00:28:52,768 --> 00:28:55,670
Help! Help! These bad ladies
have kidnapped me!

632
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:57,438
- What's going on here?
- I need help!

633
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,978
I need help! These bad ladies kidnapped me!

634
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,914
We did not kidnap her.

635
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,216
- No.
- Iris, drive.

636
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,853
- I can't.
- Call the police.

637
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:07,691
No. No, no, no. She's dangerous.

638
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:08,692
Hey!

639
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:09,693
She's dangerous. No!

640
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:11,695
Hey! Where are you going?

641
00:29:11,697 --> 00:29:14,632
[suspenseful music]

642
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,139
Oh, Barry.

643
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:42,243
[muffled groan]

644
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:43,478
Aah!

645
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,345
For real?

646
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,979
- Why did you slap me?
- Because you were unconscious.

647
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:49,084
Smelling salts work just as well.

648
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:50,787
Sorry. You okay?

649
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,323
I think so, yeah.

650
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:54,159
Wait, Caitlin. Bates, he was here.

651
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:58,224
- Uh, yes, I know.
- Okay, let's go.

652
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:00,227
You sure there's nothing else
I can do for you, Detective?

653
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:01,727
You have done more than enough.

654
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:03,461
Thank you for everything, Captain.

655
00:30:03,463 --> 00:30:05,595
Listen, I should be thanking you

656
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:06,866
for getting me out of the office for a day.

657
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:08,600
Pushing papers, reviewing budgets

658
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:10,368
public all over my ass.
It's been a nice change.

659
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,637
I'd still be detective
if I could, but, you know,

660
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:14,877
body just can't take it anymore.

661
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,346
What you gonna do when you got a bad heart?

662
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:22,186
I can think of something
that might make things better.

663
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:35,303
Cisco.

664
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,203
Laurel, hey. Uh...

665
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:39,174
We're just about
to head back to Central City.

666
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:42,045
Were you able to make that item?

667
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:48,656
I think this will do the trick.

668
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:53,864
[lively music]

669
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:55,466
I bumped up the specs.

670
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:58,636
Quadrupled the range,
tripled the resonance.

671
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:01,274
You should be able to do some
serious damage with this thing.

672
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,544
I can't believe you were able
to make it so quickly.

673
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:08,916
Eh. I've had some practice
with sound waves recently.

674
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:11,853
I think you should call it
"The Canary Cry."

675
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:16,190
I like it. Thank you.

676
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:18,359
As promised.

677
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:23,602
Hey, you show this to anyone,
I'll kill you.

678
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:25,705
[chuckles] That's just an expression,

679
00:31:25,707 --> 00:31:26,774
right?

680
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:28,110
Nope.

681
00:31:28,112 --> 00:31:30,711
[indistinct chatter]

682
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:33,611
[playful music]

683
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:45,428
Cisco? You good?

684
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,995
Oh, I'm good.

685
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,464
So this Hannibal Bates has turned into
quite the meta-human. Take a look.

686
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:55,767
His cells have the ability to transmogrify

687
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:57,035
at quite the rate.

688
00:31:57,037 --> 00:32:00,239
- Which is how he can become anyone.
- Which is how he can look like anyone.

689
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:02,909
Because he cannot appropriate
your memory or your powers.

690
00:32:02,911 --> 00:32:05,210
Got it. Hands on the meta-human.

691
00:32:05,212 --> 00:32:07,143
Hands on the meta-human.
And to help you do that,

692
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:10,484
Dr. Snow has concocted a
solution we believe will stop him.

693
00:32:10,486 --> 00:32:12,188
Yes. I've made a serum that will create

694
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,423
a cortical reaction around his cells.

695
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:16,793
Deprive those cells
of their electrical charge,

696
00:32:16,795 --> 00:32:19,430
his shape-shifting days are over.

697
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:20,331
Wow, that's great work.

698
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,699
[gasps] Thank you.

699
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:24,402
Um... no need for a hug

700
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:28,105
or anything like that.

701
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:29,072
Okay.

702
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,072
[beeping]

703
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:31,473
Oh, Barry.

704
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:32,975
We got a ping from your cell phone.

705
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:35,145
Looks like Hannibal Bates
is at the airport.

706
00:32:35,147 --> 00:32:37,148
Payback time.

707
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,354
[heroic music]

708
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:46,964
Guys, are we sure he's at the airport?

709
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:50,000
According to the GPS
on your phone, he's there.

710
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,500
Yeah, but...

711
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:55,369
he could be any of these people.

712
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:56,804
I'm not seeing him.

713
00:32:56,806 --> 00:33:00,006
[beeping]

714
00:33:08,978 --> 00:33:10,277
Gotcha.

715
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,179
[people exclaiming]

716
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:16,117
[suspenseful music]

717
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,852
Hannibal Bates.

718
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:22,723
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

719
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,429
Wait. It's me.

720
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:30,161
Please don't hurt me.

721
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:33,364
[grunting]

722
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:49,511
[grunting]

723
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,281
Not so hero-like.

724
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:55,486
Treat all your women like that?

725
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:58,689
[grunting]

726
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:07,263
Well, look at that.

727
00:34:07,265 --> 00:34:11,065
I'm The Flash.

728
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,964
[rousing music]

729
00:34:17,236 --> 00:34:21,709
You may look like me...

730
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:25,477
but you're not as fast.

731
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:28,684
[grunting]

732
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:32,923
You're done imitating innocent people.

733
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,891
[grunting]

734
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,041
Aah!

735
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:56,114
- Barry?
- Yeah.

736
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:57,515
The one and only.

737
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:06,916
Detective Thawne has been released.

738
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:09,553
(Cecile) I have to admit this
is new territory for me.

739
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:12,323
This is new territory for all of us.

740
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:13,656
I certainly don't think the law is prepared

741
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:16,324
to deal with this kind of criminal.

742
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:20,663
Hopefully we can catch up fast.

743
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:21,962
It's hard to believe we live in a world

744
00:35:21,964 --> 00:35:24,063
where this kind of impossible even exists.

745
00:35:24,065 --> 00:35:27,533
Luckily it's also a world
where The Flash exists.

746
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:29,434
Uh, speaking of...

747
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:32,037
he left this list of all the robberies

748
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,106
that Hannibal Bates was involved in.

749
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:35,273
That's a long list.

750
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:36,774
With just as many innocent people

751
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:40,512
whose names need to be cleared.

752
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:41,945
You know, I saw The Flash once.

753
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:43,379
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

754
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:44,413
I was on my way to the courthouse.

755
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:46,182
He blew past me. It was...

756
00:35:46,184 --> 00:35:50,057
it was just a blur of red
and a gust of wind.

757
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:52,059
But it was pretty damn cool.

758
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:53,527
[chuckles]

Oh.

762
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:04,804
(Thawne) All charges have been dropped.

763
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:05,903
I'm clear to go.

764
00:36:05,905 --> 00:36:08,340
Oh, thank God.

765
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:12,042
Iris...

766
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,642
I need to tell you something.

767
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:16,914
You know what?
It can wait until we get home.

768
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,283
You were right.

769
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:21,752
(Thawne) I was hiding something from you,

770
00:36:21,754 --> 00:36:23,619
and you deserve to know the truth.

771
00:36:25,118 --> 00:36:27,050
The reason I've been so distant lately...

772
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,119
I've been working with The Flash.

773

[poignant music]

774
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:46,162
Let me out of here!

775
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:49,465
Hey, cutie. Want to let me out of here?

776
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:53,104
Like anyone would be
dumb enough to fall for that.

Seen a lot of things that you can become,

779
00:36:56,576 --> 00:37:00,847
but who are you, Hannibal Bates?

780
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,532
I, uh... [chuckles]

781
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,135
I can't remember.

782
00:37:17,174 --> 00:37:20,310
I can't remember.

783
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:23,149
Well, let's lock up shop.
Good night, everyone.

784
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:36,496
What about Dr. Wells?

785
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:38,432
Come here.

786
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:42,303
I need to show you something.

787
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,876
This isn't possible.

788
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:49,145
Caitlin, I ran the DNA test twice.

789
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:50,313
It's a perfect match.

790
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,650
This body is the real Harrison Wells.

791
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:54,318
If this is Dr. Wells,

792
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,421
then who have we been
working for this whole time?

793
00:37:57,423 --> 00:37:59,524
(Barry) Dr. McGee said
that after the accident,

794
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:03,762
Wells became a completely different person.

795
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,897
It's because he is a different person.

796
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:09,834
[suspenseful music]

797
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,921
Dr. Wells.

798
00:38:26,724 --> 00:38:28,093
You here on business?

799
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:30,397
Business, no. I came to give my regards

800
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:32,267
to Detective Thawne.

801
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,602
Glad it all worked out.

802
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:36,005
Yeah. Crazy day for him.

803
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:37,375
Yeah.

804
00:38:37,377 --> 00:38:40,847
Crazy day for us all.

805
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:42,482
Oh.

806
00:38:42,484 --> 00:38:46,952
Detective, did you enjoy
your time in Starling City?

807
00:38:46,954 --> 00:38:48,720
Not much time for sightseeing.

808
00:38:48,722 --> 00:38:49,855
I was working on a case.

809
00:38:49,857 --> 00:38:52,426
- Oh.
- You used to live there.

810
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:54,129
I did.

811
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,696
You ever go back?

812
00:38:55,698 --> 00:38:58,929
No.

813
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:00,764
Too many memories of Tess.

814
00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:03,200
That's right. Sorry.

815
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:06,802
You, Detective, are one of
the few people I know

816
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:10,904
that truly understands that kind of loss.

817
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:13,609
[poignant music]

818
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:16,977
Iris's mother, you never
talk about her, do you?

819
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:21,217
No.

820
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:23,151
I don't.

821
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:26,922
No?

822
00:39:26,924 --> 00:39:28,891
You and I, Detective,

823
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:33,524
are members of a rather
exclusive club, I suppose.

824
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:39,964
One whose membership is too expensive.

825
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:42,468
Maybe we should have
another drink sometime.

826
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,836
Talk about it.

827
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:45,606
Yeah.

828
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:46,871
Yeah, we should do that.

829
00:39:46,873 --> 00:39:49,038
[elevator dings]

830
00:40:16,528 --> 00:40:17,794
What are you doing?

831
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:19,328
After the accelerator exploded,

832
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,130
I built a 3-D model of S.T.A.R. Labs

833
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:23,971
so that I could pinpoint exactly
what caused the malfunction.

834
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:26,008
(Barry) And you never ran this test?

835
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,110
Of course I did.
I just never had any reason

836
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:31,116
to look at any areas outside
of the pipeline or the cortex.

837
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:32,385
It's a big building. Lots of places

838
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:34,053
for Wells to hide something.

839
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:36,019
[beeping]

840
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:38,254
What is that?

841
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:42,494
That shouldn't be there.

842
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,834
I'm picking up more activity around here.

843
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:48,535
[beeping]

844
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:49,871
Tachyons.

845
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:50,973
[beeping intensifies]

846
00:40:50,975 --> 00:40:52,007
[silences]

847
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:53,774
There.

848
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,818
[dramatic music]

849
00:41:18,035 --> 00:41:20,337
Oh, my God.

850
00:41:45,627 --> 00:41:46,963
(Barry) Guys.

851
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,268
What the frak?
