a resync

33
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:30,156
Hey, yo, Reggie! Re-up.

34
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,768
I thought you were too sick to practice.

35
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,395
Done with all that, Coach.

36
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,107
When's the last time you had
a decent meal?

37
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,359
Come on.

38
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,570
Mary's always happy
to have you at the table.

39
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,865
- Nothing you say is gonna change my mind.
- Damn it, Reggie.

40
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,869
You're the most talented
superhero I've ever seen.

41
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,538
Yet you're... you're throwing it all away

42
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,582
slinging yayo for gangbangers?

43
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,709
You don't know me, Coach.
You don't know nothin'.

44
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,295
I know you've got heart.

45
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,005
I know you want more than this.

46
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,423
You've got a choice, son.

47
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,384
Either outrun this life,

48
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,304
or you can run yourself
into an early grave.

49
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,724
Now, please. It's me, Coach Brink.

50
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,477
Come back with me.

51
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,562
To the suburbs.

52
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,483
Yeah, what I want doesn't matter.

53
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,778
I'll never be free of these streets.

54
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,030
Cut! Holy fuck.

55
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,241
Holy fuck, we're not gonna beat that.

56
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,868
That was fucking perfect.
We're going again.

57
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,329
- I don't...
- Ferrell fucking Streep.

58
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,331
There are tears.

59
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,124
Literal tears.

60
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,210
Who's happy they spent two weekends

61
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,962
at the Compton Youth Center now, huh?

62
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,214
I'm not giving off too much
of a <i>Blind Side</i> vibe, am I?

63
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,550
As if that's a bad thing?

64
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,777
Are you... Wait, what is that smell?

65
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,511
Will everyone stop?

66
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,179
What is that smell?!

67
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,473
Is it... Is that you?

68
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:20,975
I had falafel for lunch.

69
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,643
What?

70
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,312
I smell an Oscar nomination.

71
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,647
Shut up, man.

72
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,400
- No, I won't.
- Don't jinx it.

73
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,860
You can't jinx gold. Look at me.

74
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,988
You better make some shelf space,
De Niro. Do you hear me?

75
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,781
All right, let's get you back to one, huh?

76
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,175
- I'm gonna watch playbacks, okay?
- Absolutely.

77
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,910
Yeah, let's get him some cans, please?
Thank you.

78
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,704
One more quick thing.

79
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,067
Let's sidebar here a little bit.

80
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,766
It feels like you're having
a little bit of trouble

81
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,292
getting out of the starters' block.

82
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,003
Maybe it's the scene.

83
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,480
Baby, this scene sings.
All right, look at me.

84
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,133
In the arc of your character,
this is your low point, right?

85
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,343
Everybody's given up on you,
you're all alone,

86
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,469
until the coach...

87
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,097
Swoops in and saves me from the ghetto?

88
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,408
No, no, no, you actually save each other.

89
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,225
It's a very balanced narrative.

90
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,812
All the sensitivity readers
that we hired, they all agreed.

91
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,939
- My brother was the only coach I ever had.
- Right.

92
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,025
He was a waiter at Buster Beaver,

93
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,610
not a fucking crack dealer.

94
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,738
And he must be so proud of you right now.

95
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,824
Let's get this train back on the tracks.

96
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,161
- Just give me a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

97
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,539
Wait, wait, you know what?
One more tiny little thing.

98
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,293
You said what I want "doesn't matter."

99
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,753
But as scripted, it's actually

100
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,923
what I want "don't matter," okay?

101
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,007
All right, good stuff.

102
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,301
All right, everybody,
let's get back to one!

103
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,261
I want to make this fucking day!

104
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,224
Hey, can we talk?

105
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,602
You don't talk. It's like your one thing.

106
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,371
Look, playing Noir has been
a meaningful challenge,

107
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,623
but yesterday was wack as fuck.

108
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,816
I've never actually
murdered anyone before.

109
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,711
Does Homelander make us
kill people, like, a lot?

110
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,196
And when does, do we just... do it?

111
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,741
Look, don't get me wrong,
I am stoked to be here

112
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,078
and I am down to ride the wave.
I'm just having trouble

113
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,430
with Noir's motivation, you feel me?

114
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,248
His motivation is being
a braindead maniac.

115
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,042
Just keep your mouth shut

116
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,835
and do as you're fucking told.

117
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,198
<i>Violence
in our blood-splattered streets</i>

118
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,510
<i>against decent, hardworking Americans.</i>

119

121
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,890

00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,600

<i>Benny Long and Ian Rashford,</i>

{\an8}<i>The Starlighters have shown

00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:38,404
{\an8}<i>rioting at multiple quote-unquote

131

<i>But apparently the Starlighters
feel differently.</i>

132
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,081
Let's see. Soy for pH,

133
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,500
hyaluronic acid for deep moisturizing

134
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,128
- and arginine for circulation.
- What is all that?

135
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,046
Um, I'm a Voughtality consultant.

136
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,382
5K away from
the red, white and blue Caddy.

137
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,967
I thought it might be helpful.

138
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,053
You... You work for Vought?

139
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,055
Voughtality. "For a Super You."

140
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,559
You know Vought killed
my girlfriend, right?

141
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,270
I'm literally fighting them right now.

142
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,232
I think I have rosemary oil,

143
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,942
it's really good for the joints.

144
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,278
Can you just...
Can you stop please? Just for...

145
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,740
- Please stop. Mom, stop. Just stop.
- Okay, I'm sor...

146
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,534
Okay, sorry, sorry. Just, um...

147
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,412
I'm sorry.

148
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,373
You look good.

149
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,916
Got tall.

150
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,477
Yeah, that adds up, since
the last time you saw me

151
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,919
I was six fucking years old!

152
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,713
Please don't yell at me.

153
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,090
- What are you doing here?
- The hospital called.

154
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,842
Yeah, when they couldn't reach me.

155
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,969
And I'm here now, so...

156
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,597
He doesn't need you. Neither of us do.

157
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,974
Your dad didn't tell you.

158
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,225
Shit.

159
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,853
About what?

160
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:57,524
He gave me power of attorney,
including medical decisions.

161
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,526
And he signed a DNR.

162
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,695
H-He didn't update his will?

163
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,238
He did.

164
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,410
Why the fuck would he give you
power of attorney over me?

165
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:11,622
Well, I mean, we've been talking,

166
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,291
the last year or two, now and then.

167
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,710
Besides that, you'd have to ask him.

168
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:17,878
But Hughie, don't worry,

169
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,671
- I am really good in a crisis.
- Don't.

170
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,633
And I-I-I can handle this.

171
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,259
I promise.

172
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,639
You promise.

173
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,767
Hughie...

174
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,227
Wait.

175
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,452
You leave the money on the dresser?

176
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,126
I didn't want to wake you up.

177
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,045
Hey.

178
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,800
Yeah, maybe you should
stay in bed today, no?

179
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,552
Yeah...

180
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,347
Could've been a lot worse.

181
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,392
I mean, it would've been
a lot worse if you weren't there.

182
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,481
Thank you.

183
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,655
Oh.

184
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,824
Starlight.

185
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,451
Work.

186
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,548
Your speech therapist Gloria

187
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,276
has filled me in on the work
you've been doing.

188
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,634
How's that been going?

189
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,856
You know, psychological mutism

190
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,318
is often a symptom of trauma
in one's past.

191
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,777
What do you think about that?

192
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,243
I couldn't agree more.

193
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,162
But sometimes you have
to confront your past

194
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,830
in order to be free of it.

195
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:19,875
Okay.

196
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,710
Why don't we start with something simple?

197
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,464
Tell me about your parents.

198
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,639
<i>Jesus.</i>

199
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,973
You're just telling us now?

200
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,809
Have you seen any specialists,
have you, um...

201
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,102
So how long you got?

202
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,313
It's none of your fucking business.

203
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,832
- I'm not sure why I'm telling you at all.
- What's going on?

204
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,234
Let's just say I got
an angel on my shoulder.

205
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,194
And she's a right bloody nag.

206
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,905
Butcher, I tried to warn you
that that shit was poison.

207
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,406
You ain't one of us.

208
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,408
- Hey!
- All right!

209
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,453
A word.

210
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,591
You're done.

211
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,926
- What?
- Fired.

212
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,636
Grab your shit and get the fuck out.

213
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,680
I level with you lot
and this is the thanks I get.

214
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,181
Fuck me.

215
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,100
- See what being honest gets you?
- Honest?

216
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,623
Motherfucker, you've been lying to us
for the last six months.

217
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,104
Not telling ain't lying.

218
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,564
Look, you need all the help
you can get, mate.

219
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,192
Not from you. You're a liability, Butcher.

220
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,070
I ain't gonna let this stand, then.

221
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,780
The Boys is mine.

222
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,032
Says a dying man with one last bluff.

223
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,579
Now grab your shit and get the fuck out.

224
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,206
Or I'll throw you out.

225
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,961
- Just...
- I don't want to hear it.

226
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,130
He's out.

227
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,632
You can join him if you don't like it.

228
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,310
Small-town kid grows up on
a Montana ranch with his mom.

229
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:05,564
On the surface, he's an everyday
all-American boy.

230
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,233
But deep in his heart, he knows
he's different, special.

231
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,027
He's always asking himself, "Who am I?"

232
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,695
Then one day that question is answered

233
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,406
when Homelander flies down from the sky

234
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,408
and says with tears in his eyes...

235
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,659
No tears.

236
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,454
...and says, proudly,
"Son, it's time for you

237
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,122
to take your place by my side."

238
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,708
And for Ryan it feels surprising,
yet inevitable.

239
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,378
He always knew he
was destined for greatness.

240
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,547
Because he came from greatness.

241
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,342
- Oh.
- Wow.

242
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,553
Oh, buddy, can you believe that?

243
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,555
W-What do you think?

244
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,142
It's cool, I guess.

245
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,394
You guess?

246
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,105
I think it looks amazing.

247
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,776
- Oh, so amazing. Really marketable.
- So marketable.

248
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,028
The whole pitch blows.

249
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,822
It... does not blow.

250
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,575
It blows, harder than Nancy Reagan
on the MGM backlot.

251
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,786
I'm sorry, why are you here?

252
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,288
Vought got rid of most of the sidekicks
after Gunpowder.

253
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,599
The settlements exceeded profitability.

254
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,767
Yeah, but I don't think Ryan

255
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,044
is gonna file an HR complaint
against me.

256
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,505
A what?

257
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,590
Ryan is the first natural-born superhero.

258
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,901
And his brand needs to reflect that.

259
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,636
He's not one of Vought's lab rat freaks.

260
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,139
He was chosen... by fate, God, whatever...

261
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,058
to be the one who saves the world.

262
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,309
Yes.

263
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,436
But let's not forget

264
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,146
why he is special.

265
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,398
Shall we?

266
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,857
He's my son.

267
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,444
Chosen by God, sure, but, uh...

268
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,238
made by me.

269
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,616
The chosen one narrative
only works if he stands alone.

270
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,828
Harry Potter. Neo. Luke Skywalker.

271
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,621
Hollywood's trained people to fall in love

272
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,331
with white boy lone saviors.

273
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,751
So, America will want
to fall in love with Ryan.

274
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,755
What is this?

275
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,090
Uh, it's a crime itinerary.

276
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,634
Your first save. Congratulations, son.

277
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,428
I'm not on the call sheet.

278
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,556
You wanted a kingdom for your son.

279
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,143
I'm helping you get it.

280
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,150
- Excellent.
- Mm.

281
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,609
Just as we discussed.

282
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,154
Feel free to move forward.

283
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,239
Thanks.

284
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,408
Ah, if you don't mind?

285
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,368
Hmm.

286
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,455
I'm here because Homelander wants me here.

287
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,081
Because he trusts me.

288
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,237
Listen.

289
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,990
I know you're the smartest
woman on earth...

290
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,742
Smartest person.

291
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,953
Let me give you some advice.

292
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,872
You know, girls supporting girls.

293
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,334
You cannot talk to Homelander like that.

294
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm telling him the truth.

295
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,213
You're so afraid of him,
you've plucked yourself bald.

296
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,423
If I were you, I'd make myself useful.

297
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,175
You know, get some lactation going,

298
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,760
let him suck on those titties.

299
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,637
Before you end up like Madelyn Stillwell.

300
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,726
Oh, Ashley, hey, what's up?

301
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,770
Just the girl boss I wanted to see.

302
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,939
I've been looking everywhere for you.

303
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,359
Hey, so I heard that Ryan's
doing his first solo save.

304
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,503
I want to talk to you about something.

305
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,861
I have this idea.

306
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,156
Okay, so, what if...

307
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,866
and just hear me out on this,

308
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,994
what if I was there?

309
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,582
That's it. That's the pitch.

310
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,169
Hmm. You want to join
a family-friendly PG save?

311
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:02,717
While PETA still has you
on their bestiality watchlist?

312
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,178
I swear to God.

313
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,390
Stupid people who think they're smart

314
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,393
make me want to eat my own shit.

315
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,229
Why do you let her talk to you like that?

316
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,982
She's just a bitch.

317
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,608
It's probably that time of the month.

318
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,777
It's like a full moon thing, isn't it?

319
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,362
You're a genetically superior being,

320
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,198
and she's the evolutionary
equivalent of a capybara.

321
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,034
- Cappuccino...?
- It's a giant rodent from South America.

322
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,829
- Oh.
- You're better than her.

323
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,831
Act like it.

324
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,958
And you should be at the save.

325
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,752
It's a good idea.

326
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,255
Thank you.

327
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,776
1:16,
Todd and the other Hometeamers

328
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,027
are seen going into Planet Vought.

329
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,511
And not seen again until...

330
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:51,182
2:09, when their dead bodies
magically appear at the rally.

331
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,286
Now, how do you think they got
there without anybody seeing?

332
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,187
A-Train. It had to be A-Train.

333
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,040
You promise? Like you promised Dad
for better or worse?

334
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,149
We boring you, Hughie?

335
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,402
Sorry. Sorry. I'm, um...
I'm here.

336
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,739
But the Hometeamers died
of blunt force trauma.

337
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,049
Nothing said anything
about super strength.

338
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,510
Because they're getting
a lot better at covering their ass,

339
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,453
probably because of her.

340
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,623
Sister Sage. 32 years old,
from Detroit, Michigan.

341
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,791
She cut ties with Vought a while back,

342
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,977
when they kicked her off of Teenage Kix.

343
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,586
What are her powers?

344
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,504
Smartest person on the planet.

345
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,757
I've already tapped Sage's cell phones.

346
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,884
She made a reservation
at the Vought Garden

347
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,927
Suites & Courtyard Express
in Harrisburg tonight.

348
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,280
Who's down for a little road trip?

349
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,931
You know what? I'm gonna stay here.

350
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,100
If A-Train framed those two Starlighters,

351
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,518
I'm gonna take a run at him.

352
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,145
I-I'm gonna go with you.

353
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,522
I got to stay close to my dad.

354
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,485
Understood. All right.
You two are with me.

355
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,946
Aw, look, she made a cute little...

356
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,740
penis and balls.

357
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,913
Hurry up, get the money.

358
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,671
Lights out, you fucking muff taco.

359
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,714
Get back!

360
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,799
Noir.

361
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,092
Back off.

362
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,219
Hey, whoa, be cool, man.

363
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,179
Noir, what are we supposed to do?

364
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,021
- Let her go.
- Out of my way, kid.

365
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,273
It's gonna be okay.

366
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,234
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

367
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,196
Who are you?

368
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,116
My name is Ryan. And I don't like bullies.

369
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,870
It's good. Pretty good.

370
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,205
It's getting better.

371
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,582
Solid work, guys. Noir, your entrance,

372
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,376
you're doing too much. Just walk in.

373
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,437
Okay, but would Noir just
enter stage right like that?

374
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,272
I feel like it's more in character
if I come in through the skylight.

375
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,423
You don't fucking talk.

376
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,383
- Sorry.
- Still talking.

377
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,902
Let's just stick to the blocking
for now, okay?

378
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,553
Deep, drop the "fucking muff taco,"

379
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,221
this is for families.

380
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,556
- Okay.
- Ryan,

381
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,349
on the day,
you're gonna throw me for real.

382
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,767
- I can take it.
- Yeah.

383
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,477
Let's take five and we'll run it back.

384
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,604
- Great.
- Okay.

385
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,606
Thank you, Koy.

386
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,108
- Dad?
- Yeah.

387
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,819
Did I look dumb?

388
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,114
You really...
You got to put your back into it.

389
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,407
You know, like...

390
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,576
You really got to sell it.

391
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,703
You understand?

392
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,996
Are all saves like this?

393
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,999
Like, with stunt people
and rehearsals and stuff?

394
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,584
No, no, of course some of them are real.

395
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,210
I-I've saved a lot of people.

396
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,338
This is just to help you
get your sea legs, all right?

397
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,798
- Okay.
- Yeah.

398
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,526
Hey, Ryan. You want to rehearse
the throw a few times?

399
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,178
- Great idea. Yes!
- Yeah. Sure.

400
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,096
Yes. Excellent.

401
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,433
Hey, so, um, just to be clear,

402
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,411
we're not actually killing people
on the day, am I right?

403
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,145
Just shut the fuck up.

404
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,823
Just be real precise
with your steps, you understand?

405
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,951
You can't talk to me that way.

406
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,495
I didn't say anything.

407
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,455
I mean from before.

408
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,876
Because I am the...

409
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,228
I'm the peak of human evolution.

410
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,855
And you're just, you're just a capabarnia.

411
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,673
- It's a rodent from South America.
- Oh.

412
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,509
So you're fucking land mammals now?

413
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,263
I am the lord of the seven seas.

414
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,140
You talk to me like that again

415
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,910
and I will drown you
in your fucking toilet,

416
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,060
you stupid bitch.

417
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,437
After I've used it.

418
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,065
Is that what you want?

419
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,067
- No.
- "Sir"!

420
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,318
No, sir.

421
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,986
That's right.

422
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,458
- Let her go.
- Out of my way, kid.

423
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,685
That kid's face
is made for the big screen.

424
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,546
A complexion like butter.
He's practically glowing.

425
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,315
Well, thank God.
Air-brushing the wrinkles out

426
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,008
of <i>The Dawn of the Seven</i>
put VFX nine mil over the budget.

427
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,637
We were neck fold to neck fold
with <i>Sex and the City 2.</i>

428
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,591
Motherfucker.

429
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,347
Oi, oi.

430
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,391
Fancy some steam tray eggs?

431
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,102
- How the fuck did you find us?
- Come off it, mate.

432
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,730
Your password's Janine2012.

433
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,499
I want you
to put that shit down

434
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,567
and get the fuck out of my operation.

435
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,194
Well, it's lucky for me that
you ain't my boss no more.

436
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:59,324
And as a private and concerned citizen,

437
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,327
I'm allowed to say fuck you
to any deep state cunts

438
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,370
that try and keep me from the truth.

439
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,672
Welcome to the monkey house.

440
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,047
Bunch of tinfoil-hat-wearing
Nazi motherfuckers.

441
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,008
Why is the world's smartest person
in a place such as this?

442
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,657
Oi. There's our girl.

443
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,161
Where's Kimiko?

444
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,349
Splinter.

445
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,726
Splinter, come here.

446
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:33,978
Am I too shiny?

447
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,646
You're good.

448
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,648
You look perfect.

449
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:41,861
Best get a move on.

450
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,380
The Flat-Earthers get the space at 4:30.

451
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,031
Yes. Okay.

452
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,619
H-Hey, everybody.

453
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,164
Um, so, our next speaker

454
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,291
is not only a true visionary,

455
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,877
she's also my close friend.

456
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,217
So please join me in welcoming

457
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,595
author, filmmaker, political activist,

458
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,597
commentator and a leading voice

459
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,016
of the alt-Supe movement on YouTube,

460
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,267
Firecracker!

461
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,566
Well, howdy there, Truth Seekers.

462
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,527
Hey!

463
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,155
Hey there! Aw, well, thank you, thank you.

464
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,658
Whoo!

465
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,744
- Tell us some truth, Firecracker!
- Okay.

466
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,079
I ain't gonna sugarcoat this.

467
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,706
We got ourselves a national crisis.

468
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:40,878
Homelander himself said
Starlight traffics kids

469
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,464
and her Starlighters just murdered
three of our brothers

470
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,258
yesterday to cover it up.

471
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,093
They're killing us. Wake up.

472
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,428
Over the next two hours,

473
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:54,267
I will prove that Starlighter
works with Oprah and Tom Hanks

474
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,727
to set up a Satanic home delivery service.

475
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,063
An order of a hot dog gets you a boy.

476
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,941
A taco, a girl.

477
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:06,320
A combo gets you a child they
forced to have trans surgery.

478
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,657
And a soda gets you
a shot of adrenochrome.

479
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,036
- We all know that Oprah has been under house arrest
- People actually believe this shit?

480
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,931
- ever since she sat down with Harry
- People will believe anything.

481
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,725
- and that monarchy-fucker Meghan Markle.
- Even something as ludicrous as

482
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,627
- For those who say that the evidence against Tom Hanks
- the moon landing.

483
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,963
is less clear-cut, well,

484
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:27,300
that's because the brave
whistleblower who was gonna blow

485
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,720
Forrest Gump's pedo ring wide open

486
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,347
fell off a bridge
before he got the chance.

487
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:36,475
Frenchie. See what he's up to.

488
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,412
- Coincidence?
- But do not engage.

489
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,437
Right.

490
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,397
Ah, ah, ah.

491
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,691
You're ain't leaving my sight.

492

493
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,905

494
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,948
the police code for child porn.

495
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,658

Or maybe both?

502
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,240
But go get it!

503
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,242
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

Are you drunk?

505
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,746
I just had a beer.

506
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,376
Four beers.

507
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,461
What is wrong with you?

508
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,088
Six beers.

509
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,509
- You're holding back with Colin because of me!
- What?

510
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,843
No, it's...

511
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,680
It's nothing to do with you.

512
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,015
Well I fucked someone.

513
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:58,933
Really?

514
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,977
The barista at Jitter Bean.

515
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,315
He stuck his penis right in my vagina.

516
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,942
Okay.

517
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:13,614
You should stick your penis somewhere!

522
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,594
Eight beers.

It's okay.

527
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:47,844
Maybe your source at the Tower
is fucking with you?

528
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:50,036
No, no, no, if she says
A-Train shows up here

529
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,788
every Sunday at 3:00 p.m.,

530
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,248
he will.

531
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:57,419
Yeah, you promise?
Your promise is as worthless as you are.

533
00:27:59,754 --> 00:28:01,047
Sorry.

You can go to the hospital, you should.

No. No.

No, nothing to do there except, uh...

Uh, has Kiara woken up yet?

546

Mm-mm.

No, and I have about a thousand messages

00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:41,171
No, they look up to Starlight.

552
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:43,006
They look up to the suit.

553
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,174
You're the one who wore it.

554
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:45,675
I get why you ditched it, I do.

555
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,720
It's just, I can also see the value in it.

556
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,513
In superheroes?

557
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:53,892
You're defending
superheroes right now? Really?

558
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:57,938
As cheesy as it sounds,
people need a symbol.

559
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,315
You know, someone they can rally behind,

560
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:01,983
a little fucking hope.

561
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:03,193
That can be you.

562
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:06,279
I don't want to lead anybody. I don't.

563
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:09,074
And I cannot go back to her.

564
00:29:09,157 --> 00:29:11,743
To me...

565
00:29:11,826 --> 00:29:14,120
she's just, she's a symbol

566
00:29:14,204 --> 00:29:17,374
of so much bad shit, and I-I can't.

567
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:18,959
I can't. I won't. It's just, it's...

Oh, God. He's here, he's here.

570
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,507
So I'm at the Tower, right?

571
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,384
And we get a call from Boise, Idaho.

572
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,427
There's a terrorist who's got,

573
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:32,013
like, the whole movie theater
held hostage.

574
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:33,431
- And...
- A-Train?

575
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:35,266
I love you. Can I get a selfie?

576
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,434
Yeah, of course.

577
00:29:36,518 --> 00:29:38,311
Hang on.

578
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,779
I ran across the Rockies,

579
00:29:47,862 --> 00:29:49,382
took out the terrorist, disarmed the bomb.

580
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:50,448
Then what?

581
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:51,926
What you mean, man?
Then I got some popcorn,

582
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,785
I watched the rest
of <i>Pacific Rim: Uprising.</i>

583
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:56,162

Nathan.

585
00:30:03,545 --> 00:30:05,130
Just...

586
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:06,631
just be chill, all right?

587
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:08,693
You're sneaking around
with my boys, behind my back,

588
00:30:08,717 --> 00:30:10,260
but I need to chill?

589
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:13,388
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

590
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:15,074
And don't think
y'all ain't in some deep shit.

591
00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:17,642
Sorry, Dad.

592
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:19,310
Come on, Dad.

593
00:30:19,394 --> 00:30:21,247
Uncle Reggie was just
telling us about his saves.

594
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:24,357
- You want to tell them or should I?
- Come on, man,

595
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:26,109
let's not make a big thing...

596
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,236
That movie theater in Idaho,

597
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,779
that was a soundstage in the Bronx.

598
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:32,866
That terrorist, that was a stuntman.

599
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:35,869
Those mountains, they added those in post.

600
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:38,872
I know because I was there.

601
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:42,876
Is that true?

602
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:47,213
It's complicated, you know?

603
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:48,965
No, it's simple.

604
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:51,718
Your saves were never real.

605
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:54,345
You never actually saved anyone.

606
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:57,474
Yet here you are,
lying to your own flesh and blood.

607
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:02,103
I told you.

608
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:04,773
Your uncle is no hero.

609
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,651
And I don't want you anywhere near him.

610
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:10,278
Come on.

611
00:31:19,537 --> 00:31:20,622
Nathan...

612
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:24,501
Nathan, I'm sorry.

613
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:28,129
Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait.
Give him a second.

614
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:46,481
Your videos got me
to see that my entire family

615

had been brainwashed
by clovergenders like Starlight.

616
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:50,985
I told them that I couldn't
speak to them again

617
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:52,487
until they did their own research.

618
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,280
It's been three years now.

619
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:57,826
Good for you. You keep up the fight.

620

621
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,538
Of course.

00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:17,238
or a kid to Oxy.

651
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:18,907
Politicians don't give a shit,

652
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,243
mainstream media tells them to
be ashamed of their skin color,

653
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:24,787
so, well, I bring 'em together,
tell them a story,

654
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:27,332
give them a purpose.

655
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,293
Which would you rather believe?

656
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,976
That you belong to a community of warriors
battling a secret evil,

657
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:35,924
or that you're a lonely,
inconsequential nobody

658
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:37,467
that no one will ever remember?

659
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,430
Deep's Blue Sea Room. 9:00 p.m.

660
00:33:52,774 --> 00:33:54,400
Sage has got no powers, right?

661
00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:57,028
Besides her brains? Nope.

662
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:58,672
So, why all
the sneaking around shite?

663
00:33:58,696 --> 00:34:00,031
Let's just grab her,

664
00:34:00,114 --> 00:34:01,634
work her over and rumble what we need.

665
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:02,992
Hey.

666
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,119
- This is surveillance only, okay?
- All right,

667
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:08,248
you sit tight and watch me do your job.

668
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:10,083
All right, enough.

669
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:14,170
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

670
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:15,672
Just go home, all right?

671
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:16,756
Or what?

672
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:18,007
We have a Barney?

673
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:19,926
Well, come on, then. Have a go.

674
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:22,249
- Butcher, for fuck's sake.
- You've been gagging for it.

675
00:34:22,303 --> 00:34:23,471
Ever since Soldier Boy.

676
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:27,267
Ten pounds of C4 with an inch fuse
pokin' out your arse, you are.

677
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,310
Well, come on, then. Have at it, son.

678
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:30,621
'Cause that's the only way
you feel any regret

679
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:32,605
is to get it beaten into you.

680
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:33,874
You're a shit skipper, you are.

681
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:35,650
Hughie's fucked off, Kimiko's hammered.

682
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:37,670
We've been here for hours
and still know fuck all.

683
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:39,862
You're gonna get this bloody lot killed.

684
00:34:39,946 --> 00:34:41,906
You can't eat, you can't sleep,

685
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,951
and you ain't willing to do
what it takes to run this mob

686
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:47,412
'cause you ain't got the bollocks, son.

687
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:50,832
Nice try, Butcher.

688
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:52,542
But it ain't gonna work.

689
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,086
Yeah, ain't that what your wife said?

690
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:08,641
All that bullshit you pulled,

691
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:10,160
and the mess you always leave behind

692
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:12,437
for me to clean up,
you know why I kept coming back?

693
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,024
'Cause I thought maybe this time,
it'll be a little different.

694
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:18,359
All the fucking shit
we've been through together, man.

695
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:21,279
I thought maybe this time,
maybe you and I could just...

696
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:23,906
just be fucking brothers again.

697
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,160
Just go home, man.

698
00:35:57,857 --> 00:36:00,318
Hey! Hey!

699
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:03,414
Oh, shit.

700
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:06,282
If you really cared about children...

701
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:08,284
you'd go after real traffickers...

702
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:10,995
instead of these fairy tales!

703
00:36:11,996 --> 00:36:13,790
<i>Non!</i>

704
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:16,376
If you must inflict pain,

705
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:19,587
perhaps I can endure
so others don't suffer.

706
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:23,508
Hey!

707
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:24,967
Come on.

708
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:33,935
Took y'all long enough to
get here from Trenton.

709
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:35,770
Traffic, am I right?

710
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:37,939
The fuck are you doing here?

711
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:40,108
The eyes? It's always the eyes.

712
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:41,609
Here.

713
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,530
What is this?

714
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:47,299
Security cam footage
of your two Starlighters.

715
00:36:47,323 --> 00:36:49,617
About a mile from the bodies
at time of death.

716
00:36:50,827 --> 00:36:53,079
It's hard to commit a murder
when you're 20 blocks away.

717
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:54,664
Why are you giving this to us?

718
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,051
You could have got in my face
in front of my family, but you didn't.

719
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,972
Let's call it a thank-you.

720
00:37:11,055 --> 00:37:12,223
Thank Hughie.

721
00:37:12,306 --> 00:37:14,392
I would've blasted the shit out of you,

722
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:16,102
and you would've deserved it.

723
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:19,689
Yeah, I agree.

724
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,368
Hey.

725
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:33,828
Back up.

726
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:35,705
Back off.

727
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:38,082
Noir, what the fuc...

728
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,606
What the heck are we supposed to do?

729
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:46,048
Ow. Ow!

730
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:49,177
- Let her go.
- Out of my way, kid.

731
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,887
You're gonna be okay.

732
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,805
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

733
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,353
Who are you?

734
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:01,022
My name is...

735
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:03,107
Ryan.

736
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:04,626
- It's Homelander!
- Dad?

737
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,027
It's okay, son.

738
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,279
I'm here.

739
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:11,282
We're going to save America together.

740
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:19,749
Go.

741
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:23,920
Go.

742
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:25,796
Throw him hard. Throw him. Now.

743
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:29,217
Holy shit.

744
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,932
It's okay, everyone.

745
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:38,309
It's okay. Everything's under control.

746
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:40,102
You saved me.

747
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:48,236
Good girl.

748
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:54,325
Smile. Smile.

749
00:38:54,408 --> 00:38:56,202
All right.

750
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:57,763
I thought we weren't
killing the guy today.

751
00:38:57,787 --> 00:39:00,289
I just feel like I'm not getting
clear direction for this role.

752
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:55,344
She said 9:00 p.m.
in the Deep Blue Sea Room, no?

753
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:57,096
I sure did.

754
00:40:02,685 --> 00:40:04,228
Toss your guns.

755
00:40:08,858 --> 00:40:12,320
Eh, your rifles are garish and vulgar.

756
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:14,905
They're American,
you fuckin' surrender monkey.

757
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:16,717
Marvin, did you really think
you could tail me

758
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:19,118
- without me knowing?
- So, what now?

759
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:21,912
These assholes are CIA.

760
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:23,748
Genuine deep state moles.

761
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:27,168
They've taken out more superheroes
than anyone in the world.

762
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:30,963
And Homelander would like it
if you killed them.

763
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:36,260
Consider it your final audition.

764
00:40:36,344 --> 00:40:37,678
Audition for what?

765
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:40,181
The sooner they're dead,
the sooner you'll find out.

766
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:45,436
Hmm.

767
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,396
You're not as impressive as I heard.

768
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,154
Oh, I'm gonna send your ass
back to China, bitch.

769
00:40:55,237 --> 00:40:57,740
She's Japanese.

770
00:40:57,823 --> 00:40:59,283
What are you doing?

771
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,454
Oh, pink eye. Too much salad tossing, huh?

772
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:04,872
No. No, no, no.

773
00:41:04,955 --> 00:41:06,791
It's allergies. It's allergies.

774
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,293
- Achoo.
- Shut the fuck up.

775
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:10,378
Now!

776
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:40,574
Oh, hell nah.

777
00:42:06,684 --> 00:42:08,811
Mazel tov.

778
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:41,177
- Damn. I'm out.
- Me too.

779
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:45,556
So are they.

780
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:05,576
Ow!

781
00:43:09,288 --> 00:43:10,289
No!

782
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:30,142
Get away from me, pink eye!

783
00:43:38,484 --> 00:43:39,485
No!

784
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:50,037
The storm has arrived.

785
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,457
Splinter and I are being attacked

786
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:56,085
by CIA agents

787
00:43:56,168 --> 00:43:59,255
after infiltrating a Zionist cabal.

788
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:01,715
The proof...

789
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:04,009
the proof is right here.

790
00:44:05,886 --> 00:44:07,555
Now I'm calling on all...

791
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:10,224
Firecracker!

792
00:44:10,307 --> 00:44:11,433
No!

793
00:44:11,517 --> 00:44:13,769
You gonna let me
smack your girl like that?

794
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:16,105
No wonder she put you
in the friend zone, mate.

795
00:44:24,363 --> 00:44:25,739
Ah!

796
00:44:41,255 --> 00:44:43,048
M!

797
00:44:43,132 --> 00:44:44,758
Get the boys out of here!

798
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,430
Fuck.

799
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:27,134
No. No, no, no! Not Prime!

800
00:45:27,217 --> 00:45:28,385
No!

801
00:45:31,388 --> 00:45:32,514
We loved you.

802
00:45:34,308 --> 00:45:36,268
From your first Holocaust hoax video.

803
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,771
You know, you...

804
00:46:23,899 --> 00:46:26,193
Who wants a creamy, delicious milkshake?

805
00:46:26,276 --> 00:46:28,153
Hmm?

806
00:46:29,697 --> 00:46:31,740
Oh, Ryan...

807
00:46:38,831 --> 00:46:40,499
Okay, come on.

808
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,377
Come on.

809
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,964
Come on. It's okay.

810
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:49,174
Don't worry.

811
00:46:49,258 --> 00:46:50,551
Okay? Don't worry.

812
00:46:50,634 --> 00:46:53,679
You'll get plenty of solo saves,
I promise.

813
00:46:54,888 --> 00:46:56,724
But I really do think that my being there

814
00:46:56,807 --> 00:46:58,225
is good for your numbers.

815
00:47:01,562 --> 00:47:02,813
What?

816
00:47:02,896 --> 00:47:04,648
- Yeah.
- No.

817
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:06,108
Yes.

818
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:08,277
- No, no...
- Yes.

819
00:47:09,737 --> 00:47:11,113
I killed Koy.

820
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,036
That's what you're upset about?

821
00:47:18,162 --> 00:47:19,246
Koy?

822
00:47:25,169 --> 00:47:26,795
Hmm. Okay.

823
00:47:29,673 --> 00:47:33,052
Accidents happen all the time, okay?

824
00:47:33,135 --> 00:47:35,095
Humans are fragile.

825
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:36,889
You can't save them all.

826
00:47:36,972 --> 00:47:39,224
But isn't that our job?

827
00:47:39,308 --> 00:47:41,935
Look, Koy died doing what he loved.

828
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:43,312
Okay?

829
00:47:44,396 --> 00:47:45,606
It'll be better next time.

830
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:47,399
- No.
- Yes.

831
00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:48,776
No, I'm never doing that again.

832
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:50,069
Jesus Chr...

833
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:52,529
How many times do I have to tell you?

834
00:47:52,613 --> 00:47:55,532
They're only human, Ryan.

835
00:47:55,616 --> 00:47:57,326
Toys.

836
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:05,876
You can't go around feeling bad

837
00:48:05,959 --> 00:48:08,170
about what you are
'cause a few things break.

838
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:10,339
Who cares?

839
00:48:10,422 --> 00:48:12,633
You are destined for so much more.

840
00:48:12,716 --> 00:48:16,428
You understand? You're chosen, young man.

841
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:18,889
Sooner or later,

842
00:48:18,972 --> 00:48:20,516
you got to accept it.

843
00:48:41,745 --> 00:48:44,164
Not guilty!
Not guilty! Not guilty!

844
00:48:44,248 --> 00:48:48,127
Not guilty! Not guilty!
Not guilty! Not guilty!

845
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,545
Not guilty! Not guilty!

846
00:48:49,628 --> 00:48:53,298
Not guilty! Not guilty!
Not guilty! Not guilty!

847
00:48:54,716 --> 00:48:56,343
Are you sure about this?

848
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:04,351
I'm gonna let a shitbag like A-Train
step up, but I won't?

849
00:49:09,064 --> 00:49:10,691
I got this.

850
00:49:10,774 --> 00:49:12,734
We love you, Starlight!

851
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:21,785
Starlight! Starlight!

852
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:24,621
Starlight! Starlight! Starlight!

853
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:27,457
Starlight! Starlight!
Starlight! Starlight!

854
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:30,794
Starlight! Starlight! Starlight!
Starlight! Starlight! Starlight!

855
00:50:14,922 --> 00:50:16,673
<i>You look like shit.</i>

856
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:18,842
Where are you?

857
00:50:18,926 --> 00:50:20,427
<i>Plausible deniability, pumpkin.</i>

858
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,389
<i>Let's just say
I'm a Contessa from Luxembourg</i>

859
00:50:24,473 --> 00:50:26,558
<i>on permanent holiday.</i>

860
00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:29,645
Cherie... you, uh,

861
00:50:29,728 --> 00:50:31,855
you remember Colin Hauser?

862
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,983
<i>- The judge's son?</i>
- I saw him

863
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:37,361
at, uh...

864
00:50:37,444 --> 00:50:38,820
Narcotics Anonymous.

865
00:50:40,155 --> 00:50:41,907
<i>Did he recognize you?</i>

866
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,202
We started talking.

867
00:50:45,285 --> 00:50:46,870
He was having a hard time,

868
00:50:46,954 --> 00:50:49,623
so I helped him get a job
at Starlight's House and...

869
00:50:49,706 --> 00:50:50,786
<i>You're fucking him, right?</i>

870
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:53,669
<i>For fuck's sake, Serge,</i>

871
00:50:53,752 --> 00:50:56,046
<i>what is it with you
and taking in strays all the time?</i>

872
00:50:56,129 --> 00:50:57,464
I didn't mean for it to happen.

873
00:50:57,547 --> 00:50:59,466
I was just seeing him day after day,

874
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:01,260
one thing led to another, and...

875
00:51:01,343 --> 00:51:04,721
<i>So what happens when he finds out
you murdered his family?</i>

876
00:51:19,736 --> 00:51:22,155
Your promise isn't worth
the piece of paper it's printed on!

877
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,367
I don't understand that.

878
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,371
Just, earlier...

879
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,623
Earlier, you said that you... you said that

880
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:34,334
you promised to handle Dad,
but you're not handling shit!

881
00:51:34,418 --> 00:51:35,618
Can you just lower your voice?

882
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:37,355
No, no, no.
You don't get to tell me what to do, okay?

883
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:38,797
Okay.

884
00:51:44,428 --> 00:51:46,179
The day you left, it was a Friday.

885
00:51:46,263 --> 00:51:48,598
You walked me to school,

886
00:51:48,682 --> 00:51:52,436
and you promised to
buy us tickets to Billy Joel.

887
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:54,938
I was vibrating with excitement.

888
00:51:56,023 --> 00:51:57,482
That was the last I ever saw you.

889
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:02,446
I spent a week standing by the front door,

890
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:04,906
telling Dad you'd be back,

891
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,242
because why wouldn't you be?
You promised.

892
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:12,914
But your promise didn't mean anything.

893
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:17,794
I'm so, so sorry, Hughie.

894
00:52:17,878 --> 00:52:20,922
This isn't about you and me.

895
00:52:21,006 --> 00:52:23,342
This is about what's best for your dad.

896
00:52:23,425 --> 00:52:24,569
You don't know what's best for him.

897
00:52:24,593 --> 00:52:26,553
You don't know
what's best for either of us.

898
00:52:26,636 --> 00:52:28,573
From now on, you don't
talk to a doctor without me,

899
00:52:28,597 --> 00:52:31,183
you don't make any medical decisions
without me signing off.

900
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:34,519
And if you don't like it,

901
00:52:34,603 --> 00:52:37,773
I'll take you to court.
I'll challenge you for power of attorney.

902
00:52:40,317 --> 00:52:42,444
And get rid of all your
fucking rosemary oil crap.

903
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:44,780
Dad would hate it and it smells like shit.

904
00:53:51,471 --> 00:53:53,306
Thanks.

905
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,725
What you did back there, you...

906
00:53:56,726 --> 00:53:58,270
...you saved our asses.

907
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,567
You should've left me.

908
00:54:13,827 --> 00:54:17,080
To be a good skipper,

909
00:54:17,164 --> 00:54:18,915
you gotta be a right asshole.

910
00:54:18,999 --> 00:54:21,918
Ain't no room for compassion.

911
00:54:22,002 --> 00:54:25,172
The right move to make
was to nab that cunt Sage.

912
00:54:26,673 --> 00:54:29,843
Instead, you walked the boys into a trap,

913
00:54:29,926 --> 00:54:32,095
and then risked their lives
to save some twat

914
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:33,972
who's gonna be dead in six months.

915
00:54:35,307 --> 00:54:36,725
We was lucky,

916
00:54:36,808 --> 00:54:39,102
but next time,

917
00:54:39,186 --> 00:54:41,229
someone's gonna die.

918
00:54:43,857 --> 00:54:46,776
I look back at my life,

919
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,571
and all I see

920
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:51,823
are the messes I've made.

921
00:54:53,992 --> 00:54:55,827
I've fucked it up.

922
00:54:57,204 --> 00:54:59,122
Every step.

923
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:03,376
And I ain't got time to fix it.

924
00:55:12,135 --> 00:55:13,386
But maybe...

925
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,181
maybe I can do one thing right

926
00:55:16,264 --> 00:55:19,100
with the time I got left.

927
00:55:20,477 --> 00:55:22,604
Get Ryan safe.

928
00:55:24,564 --> 00:55:26,191
I can't do that alone.

929
00:55:27,275 --> 00:55:29,319
I can't do it without you.

930
00:55:31,863 --> 00:55:33,073
Please.

931
00:55:39,746 --> 00:55:41,998
Too fucking little, Butcher.

932
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,294
Too fucking late.
