1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:02,236
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,073
You paid off the mayor to
make Jim Gordon captain.

3
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:07,108
Don't ever betray me again. Never.

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,143
I need to know what Sofia's planning,

5
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,511
and who she is planning it with.

6
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,746
Plain, dumb Ed.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,482
I would like you to go to the Narrows

8
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,484
and bundle him up, bring him back to me.

9
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,551
They're the ones that are the problem.

10
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,354
They work for Penguin.

11
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,223
I would like to announce

12
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,758
that we just quit working for Penguin.

13
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:25,726
This is your turf, now.

14
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,396
What is he doing to them?

15
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:29,497
He's cooking them.

16
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,664
They're people pies.

17
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,033
Eat the pies, or the boy dies.

18
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:37,571
No!

19
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,407
Jim!

20
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,515
The suspect known as
the Pyg is in custody.

21
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,783
The GCPD kept its promise.

22
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,152
I'm not your enemy, Jim.

23
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,786
I never will be.

24
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,689
Did you find anything out?

25
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,426
"I saw Sofia kissing the policeman."

26
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,728
She will answer for what she's done.

27
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,139
Thursday.

28
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:14,208
Thursday is my day. Thursday's my day.

29
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,546
You can't, you can't be here.

30
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,150
Thursday's my day.

31
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,678
Ooh, yeah.

32
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,185
I don't like that song.

33
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,389
My ma used to beat me to it.

34
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:04,258
It was playing when I killed her.

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,797
So, now, you turn it off.

36
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,800
Or I do the same to you.

37
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,569
Why did your mother beat you?

38
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,774
Were you a naughty boy?

39
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,611
Did you soil your trousers?

40
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,249
Was it...

41
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,417
a stutter?

42
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,852
Perhaps?

43
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,592
Open the gate, open the
gate, open the gate now.

44
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,428
Try it.

45
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,430
Everybody calm down.

46
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,836
Back off. Back off of the gate.

47
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,640
I really wish you hadn't done that.

48
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:03,717
I paid a fortune to look this good.

49
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,735
The gate is locked!

50
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,472
Everybody, just stay where you are.

51
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,240
All right, open the gate. That's enough.

52
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,475
Okay, it's over.

53
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,243
Just open the gate and let us in.

54
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,363
The doctors at Arkham took
these after the fight.

55
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,031
The Pyg had titanium
plates surgically grafted

56
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,866
onto the bones of his face.

57
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,003
The result of which radically
changed his appearance.

58
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,038
When we booked him, his
fingerprints were burnt off.

59
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,640
I've seen it before on criminals

60
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,008
that want to hide their identity.

61
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,376
But never anything like this.

62
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,644
And that's not all.

63
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:04,912
The doctors also noted scar tissue

64
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,647
behind his ears and along his neckline,

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,782
indicating he's had multiple surgeries.

66
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,051
That explains why we couldn't
I.D. him off his photo.

67
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,653
This doesn't make any sense.

68
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,021
The Pyg is a glory hound.

69
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,623
Everything he's done,

70
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,957
it's all been about
grabbing the spotlight.

71
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,692
Classic sociopath behavior.

72
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,061
So why doesn't he want us
to know who he really is?

73
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,065
Now is the time he should be
taking credit for his crimes.

74
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,901
Can you use this X-ray
to reconstruct his face?

75
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,438
See what he looked like
before he had any work done?

76
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,940
It's certainly possible,
but it will take some time.

77
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,542
Get started.

78
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:37,311
I want to know who the Pyg really is.

79
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,582
Morning, Cap.

80
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,317
Harper.

81
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,552
How's the shoulder?

82
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,854
This? Oh, just a scratch.

83
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,889
You got a visitor.

84
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,527
Thanks.

85
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,998
Sofia.

86
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,833
What are you doing here?

87
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,503
I haven't heard from you in a few days.

88
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:06,106
I didn't realize I was supposed to call.

89
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,576
I figured, after the other night,

90
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,978
we were gonna start
seeing each other again.

91
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,714
We're not.

92
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,583
I get it.

93
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,117
You're worried about Penguin
finding out about us,

94
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,487
that I made you captain.

95
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,888
You don't have to be.

96
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,390
I already told him.

97
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,359
I'm sorry, you did what?

98
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:26,594
I have it under control.

99
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,128
Is that what you think?

100
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,364
It's what I know.

101
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:33,501
I'm going to remove
Penguin from the picture,

102
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,370
and when I do, I want us to be together.

103
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,040
It's not gonna work, Sofia.

104
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,010
Even if Penguin is out of the picture,

105
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,379
I just don't see a way
forward for us. I'm sorry.

106
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:56,890
I run the dog races.

107
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,492
He runs the cock fights.

108
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,661
Now he's coming in,
muscling on my business.

109
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,795
I got mouths to feed.

110
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,030
You race those dogs again,

111
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,498
and I'll slit your damn throat.

112
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,934
All right. Enough.

113
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,537
If she stabs him, it solves the issue.

114
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,541
I started this court so we could
work out disputes peacefully.

115
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:17,077
This is how things are gonna be
done from now on, understood?

116
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,813
Now, you're both admitting
to having down months.

117
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,615
Seems the only solution
is for you to partner up.

118
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,118
Both of you work
together, you stay strong.

119
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,423
Okay. That's settled. Thank you.

120
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:30,824
Moving on. Next.

121
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,693
Wait.

122
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,894
How's your daughter?

123
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,932
Fever came down.

124
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,100
Thanks to you, Doc.

125
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,035
Good.

126
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,977
These bums are so lucky to have you.

127
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,546
You cure their children,
you solve their problems.

128
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,981
I haven't forgotten about you, Ed.

129
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,585
Yes, you say that and
yet, I remain a moron.

130
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,086
I said I would fix you.

131
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,454
And I will.

132
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:01,689
Make way.

133
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:02,956
Oh... out of my way!

134
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,626
Out of my way, I need to see the doc!

135
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:06,627
What happened?

136
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:11,865
Sampson sent his thugs to my
shop demanding protection money.

137
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,734
I told them no.

138
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,736
I said this is your neighborhood now.

139
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,237
I'm sorry, who's Sampson?

140
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,972
He controls the territory
just south of here.

141
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,241
All right, go to the clinic.

142
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,111
I'll stitch you up.

143
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,914
You know, this was bound to happen.

144
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,749
You're a new leader in the Narrows.

145
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,150
Sampson's just testing you.

146
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,587
But, you have to show
him and these people

147
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,022
that you can't be pushed around.

148
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,791
What, should I send Grundy
to rip his arms off?

149
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,059
Look at him.

150
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,194
It's what he lives for.

151
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,931
I'm asking these people
to settle things amicably.

152
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,499
I can't just be a hypocrite

153
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,535
and send Grundy every
time I have a problem.

154
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:49,970
Okay. What would you like to do?

155
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,014
Hello, Sofia.

156
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,688
Oswald, what a pleasant surprise.

157
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,790
Oh, I assure you,

158
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,092
dear,

159
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:16,096
there is nothing pleasant about it.

160
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,567
I have continually
been suspicious of you.

161
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,934
And yet,

162
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,803
at every turn,

163
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,806
you always had the perfect explanation

164
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,841
to put my mind at ease.

165
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,943
But now,

166
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:34,782
I finally have proof
that you are my enemy.

167
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,985
You lied to me.

168
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,588
You told me you hated Gordon.

169
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,692
You are his lover.

170
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,960
Martin saw you kissing
him after the party.

171
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,229
That's-that's ridiculous.

172
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,998
I'm not sure what Martin thought he saw,

173
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,133
but I can assure you, it was no kiss.

174
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,902
Enough of your lies.

175
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,272
Our entire friendship,

176
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,875
the intimacies we shared,

177
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,577
they were nothing more

178
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:04,612
than a pathetic charade.

179
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,879
Well, Oswald, I swear.

180
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,848
I swear, I care for you deeply.

181
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,150
Ha! Oh, I wish that were true.

182
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,885
Mm. But...

183
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,621
after Martin told me
about you and Gordon,

184
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,156
I did a little digging
into your boyfriend.

185
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,893
Interesting, he took a trip

186
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:23,631
down South shortly before
you arrived in Gotham.

187
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,298
Coincidence?

188
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,167
I think not.

189
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,603
So you see,

190
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:33,907
I know that the two of you have
been plotting to destroy me

191
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,976
from the very beginning.

192
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,349
Bravo, Oswald.

193
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,286
Do you know I was warned
you were a mastermind?

194
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,156
Turns out, you were an easy mark.

195
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,925
It is truly amazing
what you can accomplish

196
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,695
with goulash and a good foot rub.

197
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,703
Now I see the real you.

198
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,810
I was blind to your manipulations.

199
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,780
But today I'm going to
correct that mistake.

200
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,215
You will tell me the
full extent of your plan.

201
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,684
If your father was involved,

202
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,952
which of my captains you have turned,

203
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,655
and how you intend to
rid me from the city.

204
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:23,657
Bring him out.

205
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:26,259
Allow me to introduce
you to The Dentist.

206
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,663
And he is not the kind who gives out

207
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:32,365
lollipops after the visit.

208
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,278
Captain Gordon.

209
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,015
I wondered if my little
scuffle would bring you here.

210
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,182
I'm so glad it did.

211
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,451
I've missed our little chats.

212
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,888
Good. Then you can start by
telling me who you really are.

213
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:57,190
Don't you know?

214
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,362
Jim, I'm a reflection of you.

215
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,970
I don't see it.

216
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,712
James, you swine.

217
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,388
I want to know who's
hiding behind that mask.

218
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,792
What you see is what you get.

219
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,060
What I see

220
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:36,063
is someone who craves attention.

221
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,932
So why are you concealing
your true identity?

222
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,333
Don't you want to take the credit

223
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,069
for all your brilliant crimes?

224
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,071
Oh, I get all the credit.

225
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:48,075
The whole town has gone
hog wild for the Pyg.

226
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,377
Not since I caught you.

227
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,846
You're yesterday's news.

228
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,948
It's not true.

229
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,249
This is Gotham.

230
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,218
You're a second-class psychopath

231
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,353
compared to what we've got.

232
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,356
Jerome Valeska, Fish Mooney, Penguin...

233
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,392
they have staying power.

234
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,360
You don't. You're wrong.

235
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,832
I terrified this whole city for months.

236
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,901
People will remember that.

237
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,135
No, they won't.

238
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,238
In fact, they've already forgotten you.

239
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,408
But not you, Jim.

240
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,144
You're here. A final visit.

241
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:28,248
Now I'm gonna walk out that door
and never think about you again.

242
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,018
Mind games.

243
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:35,555
You really think that's
going to work on me?

244
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,258
Guard, we're done here.

245
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,895
James, we're not done here.

246
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,131
Have a nice life.

247
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,467
Don't you walk out on me.

248
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,405
You will never forget me.

249
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,141
I promise you that.

250
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,944
There you are.

251
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,606
So...

252
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,476
you're Doc.

253
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,578
I heard you had a giant.
I figured you might've

254
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,047
brought him along with you
rather than this, uh, has-been.

255
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,182
Excuse me.

256
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,488
Why would I bring Grundy along
for a friendly conversation?

257
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,591
Look, I understand you
had a deal with Cherry

258
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,960
where you left her people alone.

259
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,963
I expect you to honor the same with me.

260
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,265
Why would I do that?

261
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,367
You're not even from the Narrows.

262
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,237
You have no idea how
things work around here.

263
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,374
Maybe you're right, but I
do know that you love money.

264
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,244
I'm willing to offer you
ten percent of fight night.

265
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,979
You just don't get it, huh?

266
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,647
I'm not negotiating.

267
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,982
I'm taking.

268
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,284
I'm taking the clinic.

269
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,553
I'm taking the club.

270
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,323
I'm taking your whole damn neighborhood.

271
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,127
Okay, we tried this your way.

272
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,528
Let's use Grundy.

273
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,401
Well, that doesn't sound so good.

274
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,270
You cough up blood yet?

275
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,671
What's it to you?

276
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,007
Bad case of Narrows Lung going around.

277
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,309
What the hell is that?

278
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,011
It's a new virus.

279
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,546
I've seen it kill a few people already.

280
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,281
First you cough up blood

281
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,682
and within a few days you're dead,

282
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,017
unless you have treatment.

283
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,186
I'll sweeten the deal.

284
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,021
I will doctor your
people free of charge.

285
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,559
You're not gonna get a
better offer than that.

286
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,298
All right.

287
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,300
I'll be back in a few days

288
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,069
to negotiate with
whoever takes your place

289
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,371
after you drown in your own blood.

290
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,177
Tell you what, Doc.

291
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:15,448
Make it 30% of fight night,
you got yourself a deal.

292
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,950
That's too much. Don't take it.

293
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,191
Come by the clinic later.

294
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,194
We'll see about that cough.

295
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,601
Your teeth are quite lovely.

296
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,504
I look forward to putting
them in my trophy case.

297
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:41,108
You have no idea who I am, do you?

298
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,475
Of course I do.

299
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:47,080
You are Don Falcone's daughter.

300
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,349
He killed my brother.

301
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,354
I'm going to enjoy this.

302
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,089
It's true he killed your brother,

303
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,226
but not your wife, Elaine,
or your son, Joseph.

304
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,761
No, they're still alive,
probably having lunch

305
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,597
in your two bedroom on
Seventh Ave right now.

306
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,502
See?

307
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,371
I made it a point to learn every detail

308
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,006
of Penguin's organization.

309
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,108
For instance, I learned that

310
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,244
he only trusts one man
for this type of job.

311
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,511
You.

312
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,014
And in the event that
I am ever tortured,

313
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,782
my people have instructions

314
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,784
to kill your family.

315
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,121
Interesting threat.

316
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,791
But no one's going to know
that you were tortured

317
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,527
because no one is going
to find your body.

318
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,263
Oh, 'cause you don't think

319
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,265
I have spies inside
Penguin's organization.

320
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,267
He's right about me, though.

321
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,801
I have been conspiring
against him for months,

322
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,270
turning his captains

323
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,138
against him one by one

324
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:49,709
and today is the day that I
will finally take him down.

325
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:53,446
So, if my people don't
hear from me soon,

326
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,215
your family's dead.

327
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,320
But if you don't believe me...

328
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,056
drill away.

329
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,694
Excuse me, her restraints
need tightening.

330
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,377
Hmm, wise decision.

331
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,315
Now untie me.

332
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,200
Things are finally looking up.

333
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:54,641
Wakey-wakey.

334
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,209
Oh, hello.

335
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,610
I don't believe we've met.

336
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,146
I'm Barbara Kean.

337
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,280
This ferocious lady is

338
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,249
Tabitha Galavan, and that kitty-cat...

339
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,117
that's Selina Kyle.

340
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,653
I know who you are.

341
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,355
Penguin wants you dead for betraying him

342
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,556
down in the Narrows.

343
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,658
What do you want with me?

344
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,894
Well, we heard you and Ozzie are BFFs.

345
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,498
So you're going to try and leverage me

346
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,267
to get Penguin not to kill you.

347
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,135
We have some other demands,

348
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,770
but essentially, yeah.

349
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,272
That's a good plan.

350
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,806
Except for the fact that Penguin

351
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,408
just tried to kill me.

352
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,377
Why would he do that?

353
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,380
Because I am so close

354
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,248
to taking his underworld from him.

355
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,152
You're lying.

356
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,520
Am I?

357
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,790
I've been working Penguin for months.

358
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,694
Manipulating him into behaving
exactly how I want him to.

359
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,730
Every move he made
today, I orchestrated.

360
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,568
Now you three are screwing things up.

361
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,804
So... you want him out of your life,

362
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,606
let me go.

363
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,447
Maybe she's telling the truth.

364
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,815
She's a Falcone.

365
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,419
She learned to lie
before she could read.

366
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:15,288
But, whether you're friend or foe

367
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,723
makes no difference to me.

368
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,559
Because Penguin will
still make the deal.

369
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,728
Get him on the phone.

370
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,970
You'll grow into it.

371
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,475
Because of you,

372
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,711
I was able to vanquish my enemy.

373
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:42,315
And now that you've proven yourself...

374
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:46,319
I see a beautiful future ahead for you.

375
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:49,822
I have so much wisdom to impart.

376
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,494
And if you pay attention...

377
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,563
one day, all of this could be yours.

378
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,966
What's wrong?

379
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,683
What are you talking about?

380
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,653
You mean...

381
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,290
you did not see Sofia kissing Gordon?

382
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,903
"...they kissed."

383
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,674
Why would she do that?

384
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,577
Unless...

385
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,348
she knew exactly how I would respond.

386
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,950
She wanted me

387
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,420
to confront her.

388
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,854
Even torture her.

389
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,423
Boss.

390
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,557
We have a problem.

391
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,592
The Dentist is gone.

392
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,428
And what happened to Sofia?

393
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,463
To be honest, that's
still a little unclear.

394
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,964
Barbara Kean has her.

395
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,700
What?! How do you know this?!

396
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,969
She's on the phone.

397
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,037
Says she wants to make a deal.

398
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,607
Give me that.

399
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,044
Barbara.

400
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,846
Hello, Oswald.

401
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,714
I see you have crawled out from

402
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,351
whatever rock you were hiding under.

403
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,319
What are you doing with Sofia?

404
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,887
We scooped her up this morning.

405
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,489
And, of course, when we did,

406
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,858
we thought she was your
best friend. Turns out

407
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,893
she's your worst enemy.

408
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,362
I want her back.

409
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,729
Name your price.

410
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,466
We keep the gun shop,
we don't share profits,

411
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:43,436
and from this point forward, we
operate with complete autonomy.

412
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:45,872
Fine.

413
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,508
I will send Zsasz over to collect her.

414
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,511
She had better be there when he arrives.

415
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:52,679
She will be.

416
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:07,627
And as for you, young man,

417
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,730
our conversation is not over.

418
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:17,537
So this is what the Pyg used
to look like. That's him.

419
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,640
All right, send it out to police
stations across the country.

420
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,509
Start in the South. The South? Why?

421
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,676
When I pressed him,

422
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,077
he spoke in a Southern accent.

423
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,446
Could have done that

424
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,947
deliberately to throw you off? No.

425
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,817
He slipped up... I saw it in his eyes.

426
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,685
This is the best lead we've got.

427
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,454
Let's see where it goes.

428
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,659
I don't understand you.

429
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,695
If Sampson's cough will kill
him, why not let him die?

430
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,697
There's no such thing as Narrows Lung.

431
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,533
He probably just has bronchitis.

432
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:49,101
I give him some medicine, he
feels better, problem solved.

433
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,703
Okay, what about the 30%?

434
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,705
Once he has that, he's
just gonna want more.

435
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,774
Maybe.

436
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:13,626
Sampson, you son of a bitch.

437
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,629
Now do you see who you're dealing with?

438
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,901
I know you wanted to try this your way.

439
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:24,170
No more diplomacy, Lee.

440
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:27,406
Take Grundy and end this.

441
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,478
No.

442
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,013
I have a better idea.

443
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,181
That was easy.

444
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,484
Yeah. A little too easy.

445
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:40,487
Because he couldn't wait
to get you off the phone.

446
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,489
We need to get out of here.

447
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:44,056
And then what happens?

448
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,925
You take over

449
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,159
from Penguin?

450
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:48,795
We are not working

451
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:51,163
for anyone but ourselves.

452
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:54,534
I'm not asking you to.

453
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,536
I will give you everything you want

454
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:57,904
from Penguin.

455
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,171
You're not in a position

456
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,640
to offer us anything.

457
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:01,941
We're in charge here.

458
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:02,942
Uh, guys,

459
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,043
I think we should listen to her.

460
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,578
Why? Because Zsasz is

461
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,114
standing out front
holding a rocket launcher.

462
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,084
Ladies.

463
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:29,736
I'm gonna break his little beak in half.

464
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,543
Jim! Sorry, Cap, I tried to stop her.

465
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:37,577
I told her she had to wait.

466
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,745
It's okay, Detective.

467
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:39,846
I've got it.

468
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,981
Sofia, what happened to you?

469
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,283
I underestimated Oswald.

470
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,985
He found out we were
plotting against him,

471
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,787
and he-he just tried to kill me, Jim.

472
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,188
He can't hurt you here.

473
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,858
If he finds out I'm alive,
he will come after me,

474
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,293
and he won't stop until I'm dead.

475
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,895
You are the captain of the GCPD.

476
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,196
Your men would follow you anywhere.

477
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,599
Please, please, use the position

478
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,067
I gave you and end this.

479
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,903
What are you proposing I do?

480
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,706
You have an army... just
take the fight to Penguin.

481
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:10,977
So this was your plan.

482
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,979
To start a war.

483
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,315
You knew you didn't have the numbers

484
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,618
to fight Penguin on your
own, so you made me captain,

485
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,020
knowing it would come to this,
and I'd take him out for you.

486
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:24,156
Your job is to stop
criminals, Jim... here you go.

487
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,626
It is not that simple, and you know it.

488
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,295
We could bring law and order back

489
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,197
to Gotham.

490
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,299
This is exactly what you asked
for when you came down South,

491
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,635
and it is yours for the taking.

492
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,804
You know what has to be done, Jim.

493
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,139
Crush Penguin.

494
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,784
I trusted you, Martin...

495
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,753
and you betrayed me.

496
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:06,332
I think it's time for you
to go back to the orphanage.

497
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:08,935
Boss? Hold on!

498
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,772
Let the little spy step out

499
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,707
of the room.

500
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,317
So?

501
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:29,121
The place went up like
a great ball of fire.

502
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:31,390
Good. Alert the capos.

503
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,126
We are going to unleash
a crime wave on this city

504
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,095
like it has never seen.

505
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,397
That will teach Jim Gordon

506
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,132
to align himself with Sofia Falcone.

507
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,669
I wouldn't make that call if I were you.

508
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:44,637
I just spoke with Sofia.

509
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:49,742
She's alive, and she told
me you tried to kill her.

510
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,678
Hearsay, Jim.

511
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:54,046
Been here all day. I have witnesses.

512
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,182
I don't care.

513
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,718
I'm not here to arrest you.

514
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,688
I came to make a deal.

515
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:04,623
I think we've both put up
with Sofia long enough.

516
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:09,195
Victor, would you give us a moment?

517
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:15,301
Okay, Jim, you have my attention.

518
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,170
Since the moment she set foot in Gotham,

519
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:21,674
Sofia has put us on a path to war.

520
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,676
She's willing to let this
city burn to the ground

521
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,044
to prove herself to her father.

522
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,779
I can't allow that.

523
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,849
So what do you want from me?

524
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:32,118
I'm putting her on a train home tonight.

525
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,821
But I need assurances from
you you won't get involved.

526
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,823
Not good enough!

527
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,825
She needs to suffer
for what she has done.

528
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,192
That is not gonna happen.

529
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,128
And how do you think your girlfriend's

530
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,730
gonna react when she realizes

531
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,197
you betrayed her?

532
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:47,399
You think she's just
gonna run away quietly?

533
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,468
If she sets foot in Gotham again,

534
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,104
I'll put her behind bars.

535
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,775
And if I say no?

536
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,077
Then I'll have no choice

537
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,881
but to use the full force of the GCPD

538
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:04,083
to tear you apart, piece...

539
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:06,385
by... piece.

540
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,855
That does not sound very pleasant.

541
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,790
It won't be.

542
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,827
I guess I can put aside
my personal feelings

543
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:16,963
for the good of this city.

544
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:19,498
But I do have one question for you, Jim.

545
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,901
Once Sofia is gone...

546
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,103
where does that leave us?

547
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,773
No more licenses.

548
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,507
If you or any other
criminal in this city

549
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,509
break the law, my men will enforce it.

550
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,746
But at least you won't have
to worry about Sofia again.

551
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,915
So...

552
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,984
do we have a deal?

553
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,955
After all we have been
through together, Jim,

554
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:44,390
it is nice

555
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,425
that we can resolve this
matter with diplomacy.

556
00:28:58,037 --> 00:28:59,772
Ah, Doc.

557
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:02,174
I heard about what
happened to your clinic.

558
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,910
What a shame.

559
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:08,314
I was looking forward to you
curing my, uh, Narrows Lung.

560
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,785
I want you cleared out of the Narrows

561
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:13,953
by the end of the day.

562
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,322
What did you say to me?

563
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,290
I think she was pretty clear.

564
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,493
Then allow me to be clear.

565
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:24,130
This is my turf, and
I'm not going anywhere.

566
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:26,465
And you two have dug your own graves.

567
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,936
Oh, well, then I guess
you don't want this?

568
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,503
What's that?

569
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:34,040
The antidote to the poison
I had slipped in your drink

570
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,207
about 30 minutes ago.

571
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,945
Ironic, isn't it?

572
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,479
It's the only thing from the clinic

573
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,948
that wasn't destroyed.

574
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,850
Some vials of medicine I had mixed

575
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,484
into a deadly combination.

576
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,120
Should be kicking in,
uh, right about now.

577
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,822
You're bluffing.

578
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:52,091
I feel absolutely f...

579
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,359
I'm sorry, what was that?

580
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,494
Get 'em!

581
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,897
Come any closer and I'll destroy this.

582
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:09,408
Like I said...

583
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,844
you leave by the end of the day,

584
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:13,812
and you'll live.

585
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,248
Deal?

586
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,451
Okay.

587
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,887
Oh.

588
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,254
Catch.

589
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,998
I know you're disappointed, but
I am doing this to protect you.

590
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,133
Disappointment doesn't quite
cover it, Jim. If you stay

591
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,136
in Gotham, Penguin will kill
you. Don't put this on Penguin.

592
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,906
If you have something to say,
I think you should say it.

593
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:53,152
We're the same, Jim.

594
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,355
I saw it the first moment we met.

595
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,490
We both want power.

596
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,894
You want to deny it, but it's true.

597
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:04,863
And it is just easier to send me away.

598
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,304
Detective Harper,
please take Ms. Falcone

599
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,974
to the train station and
escort her back home.

600
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:16,976
Please don't do this.

601
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,377
Better get going.

602
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,611
You'll miss your train.

603
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,326
Gordon put her on the train.

604
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,695
Talk about a turn of events.

605
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,665
Did not see that coming.

606
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,467
What about the kid?

607
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,370
You want me to take him
back to the orphanage?

608
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:49,976
That won't be necessary.

609
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:55,547
Martin, I have been thinking.

610
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,349
I was angry.

611
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:59,518
I did not mean what I...

612
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,121
Martin?

613
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:19,038
Martin.

614
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,015
Oh, he's cute.

615
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,316
He doesn't talk.

616
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,387
The kid gives me the creeps.

617
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,525
Let's get this over with.

618
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,144
Nervous about something?

619
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,313
Well, we have a long way to go.

620
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,282
So get comfy.

621
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,257
Tickets, please.

622
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,224
What...?

623
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,798
Hello, Victor.

624
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,602
Where's the boy? Alive, for now.

625
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,537
If Oswald wants to keep it that way,

626
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,540
he will meet me under the
Crown Point Bridge in one hour.

627
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:30,676
Next stop, Stevenstown.

628
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,278
That's my stop.

629
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,680
Do you mind?

630
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,083
Not at all.

631
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,119
Thank you.

632
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,513
Glad you could make it, Oswald.

633
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:11,150
Everything will be all
right, Martin, I promise.

634
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,187
Well, that depends on you.

635
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:17,256
Turn over control of
the underworld to me,

636
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,826
and I'll let little Martin
here... keep his head.

637
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:26,465
The name Falcone used to
mean something in this town.

638
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:30,336
Wait until your father hears of this...

639
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,338
threatening the life of a child!

640
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,505
He will be disgusted!

641
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,474
Wrong.

642
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,843
My father will be proud.

643
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:43,749
Must be hard to live your whole life

644
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,485
trying to get Daddy's approval.

645
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,620
I, myself, can't relate,

646
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:51,657
seeing as my parents loved
me without condition.

647
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,363
Say one more word and I will kill him,

648
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,398
and then I will execute you.

649
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,300
I am choosing compassion,

650
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,870
but I am willing to change my position.

651
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,609
Don't hurt the boy.

652
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,379
He's innocent.

653
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:20,652
I submit.

654
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:23,389
Go ahead.

655
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:34,633
Martin, I want you to know...

656
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,402
I'm sorry for what I said.

657
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:40,606
I do care about you.

658
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,541
You know that's true, don't you?

659
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:48,547
Good.

660
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,819
Now, go wait in the car.

661
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,610
You were wise to use the boy.

662
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,913
As you know, my heart

663
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:24,883
is my greatest weakness,

664
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,818
but...

665
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,755
I will not allow him to be used

666
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:33,725
as a pawn in your game anymore.

667
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,378
You wanted a war,

668
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,246
you've got one!

669
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,728
Ed.

670
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,029
Why so blue?

671
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,498
We had a great day.

672
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,466
You had a great day.

673
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,335
I did nothing to help.

674
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:17,636
That's not true.

675
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,471
I couldn't have done it without you.

676
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:22,408
I'm not meant to be a sidekick, Lee.

677
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:29,247
Sampson was right, I'm a has-been.

678
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:34,420
No, you're not.

679
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,488
Look, I asked you to trust
me with something today,

680
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:37,689
and you did.

681
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:41,360
So I'm gonna trust you with something.

682
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:44,363
I haven't been looking for
a cure for your brain, Ed,

683
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:47,366
because there's nothing wrong with you.

684
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,034
But you... Sure.

685
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:51,770
At first there was an
effect from the ice,

686
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,039
but I ran all the tests; it checks out.

687
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,642
There's nothing wrong
with you, physically.

688
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:58,610
Your condition is psychological.

689
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:02,414
Think about it.

690
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:04,082
You knew every move that
Sampson was gonna make

691
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,451
before he made it.

692
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,020
You lied to me.

693
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,090
Why?

694
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,326
Because I was afraid that
if I told you the truth,

695
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,695
you would go back to
being who you were before,

696
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,564
The Riddler.

697
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:20,499
And I like who you've become.

698
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,402
Who's that?

699
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,606
Ed Nygma.

700
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,976
The Ed that you were before.

701
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:33,745
My friend.

702
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,753
Well, that backfired.

703
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,121
Penguin's gonna be coming for us.

704
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,456
What are we gonna do?

705
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,557
We hit him before he hits us.

706
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,494
Lady, you lost.

707
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,529
Penguin just blew up that kid.

708
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,364
I admit I didn't see that coming.

709
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:55,033
But Oswald still has to align
his capos before he moves on us.

710
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,868
We use that window of
time to make our play.

711
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:59,805
You didn't get told "no" a lot as a kid,

712
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,006
did you?

713
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,874
You took your shot and you missed.

714
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:05,377
We're going it alone
from here. You leave now,

715
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,514
and you will never have
a piece of this city.

716
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,051
Now, that sounded like a threat.

717
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,753
Your club is destroyed.

718
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,656
You have nowhere else to turn.

719
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:18,857
You need me.

720
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,761
Penguin may have won the battle,

721
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,996
but tomorrow we win the war.

722
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,568
Boss.

723
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,844
My boy.

724
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,681
You did a splendid job of dying.

725
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:54,593
Victor will take you to a safe location.

726
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:57,929
You can never return to Gotham.

727
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:00,899
This is good-bye, my friend.

728
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,680
There, there.

729
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:18,216
This is what I have
to do to protect you.

730
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,719
One day, when you are
older, you will understand.

731
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:34,466
Sofia's on her heels, boss.

732
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,967
Let's finish her off.

733
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,969
Have someone else take the kid.

734
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,237
No.

735
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,006
I want my top man on this.

736
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,974
Besides,

737
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,745
I have something much better
planned for Sofia Falcone.

738
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:52,718
You were right about the Pyg.

739
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,620
A precinct down South
recognized the picture

740
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,254
you had me send out.

741
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,856
His real name is Lazlo Valentine.

742
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,257
What do we know about him?

743
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,892
He was being held for a string

744
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:02,728
of murders down there ten years ago.

745
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,630
But here's the thing:
his previous victims

746
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:06,131
weren't police officers,

747
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,600
and there was no Pyg persona.

748
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:11,136
Serial killers don't
usually change their M.O.

749
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,604
This guy did.

750
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:15,641
You said he was being held.

751
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:18,176
Did they say why their case fell apart?

752
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,611
It didn't. He escaped.

753
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,181
Call Arkham.

754
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,783
Have them put a guard on his cell.

755
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,984
I'm on my way.

756
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:39,831
Pyg?

757
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,117
Pyg?

758
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,578
Hello, Ed.

759
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:27,613
No.

760
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29,715
No!

761
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:34,720
Miss me?

762
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,762
Open it, let's go.

763
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:48,867
Sound the alarm!
