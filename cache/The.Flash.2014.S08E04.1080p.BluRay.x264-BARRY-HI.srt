1
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,972
Why is it so complicated
deciding how to have a baby?

2
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,517
The Batsuit isn't exactly baby-proof,

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,935
but I can't force Sophie into

4
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,437
nine months of indigestion
and swollen ankles.

5
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,980
Sis, you are spiraling.

6
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,001
Do you remember what I told you
when I was your maid of honor?

7
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,985
No, I was busy getting married,
not taking notes.

8
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:29,030
I told you to stop thinking so much
and to listen to your heart.

9
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,199
If you want to have a baby,

10
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,054
your heart will figure out the "how."

11
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,078
[Cecile] And then that sweet little girl

12
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,455
is going to grow up
and decide that she hates you.

13
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:41,918
Jenna has been thinking
the worst insults at me tonight.

14
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,229
Let me tell you something.
Teenagers...

15
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:45,797
Do not use the bathroom,
it's occupied.

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,383
Really occupied.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,716
Thank you.

18
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,761
Allegra!

19
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:52,512
Hey.

20
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,473
[stammering] So, how's London?

21
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,562
You calling cookies "biscuits" yet?

22
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:06,025
Nope. But actually, I might be
moving back to the States.

23
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,979
I got a job offer in Gotham.

24
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,487
Oh, my gosh. Allegra, that's great.

25
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:12,091
Thanks. Yeah, I haven't decided
if I'm gonna take it or not yet.

26
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,031
So...

27
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,032
[glass clinking]

28
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,661
[Eobard] If I could have
everyone's attention for a minute.

29
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,123
When you find...

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,459
the love of your life,

31
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,352
you're part of something greater, you...

32
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:31,009
You're part of something wonderful,
magical, beautiful,

33
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:36,306
and, frankly, surprising,
because you never know

34
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:38,182
what face

35
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,518
fate will be wearing

36
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:43,896
when she knocks on your door
to change your life forever.

37
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,775
And my only wish for you
is that when that face shows up

38
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,362
to change your lives,
that that face is as beautiful

39
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:55,325
as the one standing next to me.
To Iris West.

40
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:57,702
The love of my life.

41
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,882
What the hell is he doing here?

42
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:16,929
You got a lot of nerve
showing up here, Allen.

43
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,307
It's been you this whole time.

44
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,308
Despero,

45
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:22,602
Armageddon, Joe...

46
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:25,021
Don't you dare say my father's name,
you murderer!

47
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,940
Guys, it's me, Barry.

48
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,525
Iris is my wife.

49

[scoffs]

50
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,613
We've all fought Thawne together.

51
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,241
My God, he actually believes
the things he's saying.

52
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,745
All right, I'll show you it's me.

53

[breathing heavily]

54
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,088
Thawne, what did you do?

55
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,926
You're not the Flash,

56
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,635
Allen.

57
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:04,685
I am.

58
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,839
Team Flash,

59
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,174

60
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,810
[device beeping]

61
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,195
Guys.

62
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:00,450
Thawne is tricking you.
I came here from 2021.

63
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:01,533
Save it, Allen.

64
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,919
I'm not falling
for your mind games this time.

65
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:07,874
Put him down.

66
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:27,643
It's a paralysis ray.
No speed for a couple seconds, Allen.

67
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,772
- Why are you doing this?
- So I can do this.

68
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:40,907
[grunting]

69

[groans]

72
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,554
That was for Ray and for Nate.

73
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:04,847
And that was for Sara.

74
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,725
And this...

75
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,186

...is for Cisco.

77
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,501
So sorry, Allegra.

78
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,419
But we did put a tie on the door.

79
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,421
What did we miss?

80
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,427
[gasping] Get away from me.

81
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,681
Iris, you have to believe me.
Thawne's not the Flash, I am.

82
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,416
He must have changed the timeline.

83
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,641
You're my wife.

84
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,854
This is our home, our loft.
We even have kids.

85
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,314
- Bart and Nora.
- Stop!

86
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,984
Please, you have to remember us.

87
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,070
Iris, you're my lightning rod.

88
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,491
You're psychotic.

89
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,542
[thunder cracks]

90
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:22,884
Iris West is my lightning rod now,
Reverse-Flash.

91
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,219
What the hell did you do?

92
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,722
Nothing you haven't done before.

93
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,809
You created a Flashpoint.

94
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:35,646
Wrong. I created a Reverse Flashpoint.

95
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:40,526
<i>I started by doing a little housekeeping
at S. T.A.R. Labs.</i>

96
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,780
<i>And then, I took care
of the one father you had left.</i>

97
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,323
Why?

98
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,367
Because after our last encounter,

99
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,578
it was clear to me
you're faster than I was.

100
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:55,041
And that the only way to defeat you...

101
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,628
was to become you.

102
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,841
So, I ran back
to the year 2013 and made sure

103
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,636
that I was the one struck by lightning.

104
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:12,058
I was the one that Iris West wrote about
as the Streak. I led Team Flash.

105
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:15,561
I was the one Iris West
fell in love with.

106
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,146
I stole your life!

107
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,191
And because every hero needs a villain,

108
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,611
I created that, too.

109
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:27,949
You wore my face.

110
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,076
<i>It was you
that attacked the city that day.</i>

111
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,721
That's why they don't trust me.

112
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,705
Made you think you were crazy,

113
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,709
crazy enough to beg,

114
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:43,214
literally beg Jefferson Pierce
to steal your speed.

115
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,297
What's it at now?

116
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:45,757
Five percent?

117
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:47,425
Maybe less.

118
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,262
Thawne, what you've done
destroys the world.

119
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,222
It creates Armageddon.

120
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,516
- No.
- No, it's true. Damn it!

121
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,435
I would not create a perfect world

122
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,021
just to watch it die.

123
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,439
As a matter of fact,

124
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,026
the only thing that is set to expire

125
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,736
is you.

126
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,489
Do you know why?

127
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,493
Because I finally did what I
set out to do all those years ago.

128
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,415
I killed you as a child.

129
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,293
You can do that all night long.

130
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:26,173
But the fact remains, at the stroke
of midnight, my timeline will solidify,

131
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,803
and you will cease to exist.

132
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,641
And your precious Speed Force
cannot help you now,

133
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:41,147
because in this timeline,
she chose me and Iris chose me.

134
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,230
I've won!

135
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,776
I finally won. Who's faster now?

he ran back in time,

165
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,725
changed things, so he had won.

166
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,936
He created an anachronism.

167
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,437
Only it wasn't just one event.

168
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,273
Thawne changed everything.

169
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,234
Trying to stop him cost me my speed.

170
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,321
Now we're living in a timeline
he constructed for his own benefit.

171
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:55,447
Really?

172
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,993
And that's downright villainous.

173
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
Mm.

174
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:02,997
We need to put him down.

175
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,540
Yeah, we will. We will.

176
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,168
Nobody gets to rig time except me.

177
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,712
But fixing this won't be easy.

178
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,756
If the Flash created
multiple anachronisms,

179
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:17,344
the only way to reset the timeline is to
turn everything back at the same time,

180
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,804
which is why we need the P.E.D.

181
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,182
- The P.E.D?
- The P.E.D.

182
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,521
The Particle Eradication Distributor.

183
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,608
The thing that erases
any type of matter.

184
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,652
You yanked it out
of Ray Palmer's cold dead hands.

185
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,197
Right.

186
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,743
When you've killed as many people
as I have, you start to lose track.

187
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,119
Huh.

188
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,998
I sometimes forget...

189
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,129
you're even darker than me.
Pun intended.

190
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,417
All right, old partner.
Here's what we're going to do.

191
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,178
If we combine the P.E.D.
and my Time Stone,

192
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,598
any anachronisms on that temporal plane
will be erased.

193
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:04,307
So this could work.

194
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,478
Oh, it gets so much better.

195
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,313
After my arrest,
they confiscated the P.E.D.

196
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,357
Guess where it ended up?

197
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,760
Frost, Chillblaine, and Batwoman
are searching the city,

198
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:24,703
- but no sign of Reverse-Flash.
- And I can't feel him anymore.

199
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,081
It's like he magically disappeared.

200
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,332
Then try harder.

201
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,254
Cecile, um, we know that
you're doing your best.

202
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,547
Yes, of course you are.

203
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,009
What's up with him, anyway?

204
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,511
Has he gone crazy?

205
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,680
I mean, the guy actually thought
he was the Flash.

206
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,307
He's a sociopath.
There's no explaining a mind like that.

207
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,951
Runk, where are we with the satellites?

208
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,938
Runk?

209
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,774
- What?
- Satellites?

210
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:54,858
Right.

211
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:59,238
Satellites are scanning
for his negative tachyons, sir.

212
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,658
But after analyzing samples
from Robern's,

213
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,911
looks like the Reverse-Flash
is running on limited speed.

214
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,080
Less speed means lower tachyon output.

215
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,623
Making him harder to track.

216
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:13,252
But not impossible if we sync
the Atom Bracelet's micro-sensors

217
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,838
to the satellite.
That'll isolate the smallest tachyons

218
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,107
that'll give us Allen's location.

219
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,590
Consider it done, Captain Eo.

220
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,343
Horton, use The Thinker's chair
to boost your empathic scan.

221
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,321
Snow, get the med lab ready
in case there's trouble.

222
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,014
Danvers, Garcia, weapons check.

223
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,399
What are you thinking?

224
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,656
Well, I'm thinking you should be at home
resting up for our big day tomorrow.

225
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,490
I will.

226
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
What?

227
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,539
[sighs] It's just that Allen seems off.

228
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,126
Baby, he called me his lightning rod.

229
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,920
Only you call me that.

230
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,671
I know.

231
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,049
But he's smart.

232
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,384
He's attacking our love.

233
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,888
We cannot let him pull us apart.

234
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,181
He won't.

235
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,475
I love you.

236
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,684
I love you.

237
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,369
[Alex] What's the deal
with you and Chester?

238
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,402
Nothing.

239
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,781
- Why?
- The stolen glances,

240
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,574
the nervous energy.

241
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,204
You either hooked up, you are
hooking up, or you really need to.

242
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,707
Okay, we did once, but it was
ten years ago and it went nowhere.

243
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,375
What happened?

244
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:40,589
We'd been flirting for months,
and one night we were playing <i>D&D</i>

245
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,257
and it just happened.

246
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,387
It was a really lusty quest.

247
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,139
Anyway, I thought
something would come of it.

248
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,727
But by the time I woke up
in the morning, Chester was gone.

249
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,479
Hold up, he just left?

250
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,522
Yep.

251
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,315
And by the time we talked about it,

252
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,859
we decided it was better
just to be friends.

253
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:02,944
[Damien] Bye-bye.

254
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,069
And you know how much longer
until my new look is ready?

255
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,712
I'm going to look so good
kicking bad guy butt.

256
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,961
Just making some last-minute tweaks.

257
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,588
- [device chirps]
- Okay.

258
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,967
Okay, good to go.
Now we can hunt some tachyons.

259
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:26,885
It's working.

260
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,096
According to these readings,

261
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,265
there's a pocket
of negative tachyons in this room.

262
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,560
You had to ruin the surprise,
didn't you?

263
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,729
You find the P.E.D.,
I'll take care of these two.

264
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Hello, boys.

265
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,442
- [groaning]
- [Damien] Ah-ah-ah.

266
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,652
[Damien chuckles]

267
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,781
[sighs] Of course.

268
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,328
Ooh! Tupac. What an artist!

269
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,496
[machine dings]

270
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,709
- I've got it.
- Already?

271
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,503
You and I, what a team!

272
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,674
[both groaning]

273
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:07,964
[Cecile] Hurts, doesn't it?

274
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,179
Well, so will this.

275
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,054
[screams]

276
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,643
[breathing heavily]

277
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,195
Let's go.

278
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,281
Oh, I've got a better idea.

279
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,992
Imagine how devastating
it would be to the Flash

280
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,912
to lose his friends
on the eve of his wedding.

281
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,166
Nothing destroys a man
like losing the ones he loves the most.

282
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,253
What the hell was that?

283
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,421
We got what we wanted.

284
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,603
Killing them
wouldn't have been efficient.

285
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,304
We can kill them later.

286
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,014
Huh.

287
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,642
[choking]

288
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,437
The Barry Allen I know wouldn't wait,

289
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,314
which means you're not
the Reverse-Flash.

290
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,733
So, who are you?

291
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,236
[choking]

292
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,577
Don't make me ask you again.

293
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:16,995
Who are you?

294
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,915
[straining]
Thawne's the Reverse-Flash...

295
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,545
Erased me from the timeline

296
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,088
at midnight.

297
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:31,676
[thuds]

298
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,348
Man, he is good!

299
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,184
I mean, that's like a work of evil art.

300
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,703
The question is now
what do I do with you?

301
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,438
[groans] You could still help me.

302
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,606
"Help me?"

303
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,066
Yeah, I'm the bad guy.

304
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,651
I don't help heroes.

305
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,946
But you're also a father.

306
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,448
Which means you know what it feels like

307
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,450
to love someone
with all your heart and soul,

308
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,578
like your daughter, Nora.

309
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:58,869
My Nora's dead.

310
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,289
I'm done listening to you.

311
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,619
She's supposed to be alive.

312
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,751
And she is, in the timeline
I'm trying to restore.

313
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,005
In my timeline,
a demon was going to take over her soul,

314
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,590
but you switched places with her.

315
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,385
You gave your own life
so she could live.

316
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,602
If you're lying to me,
I'll see you burn.

317
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,568
<i>Nora! Nora!</i>

318
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:33,030
- Dad, why?
- Because I love you.

319
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,618
And I couldn't watch you
become a monster like me.

320
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,085
It's true.

321
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,508
My Nora Doll's supposed to be alive.

322
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,472
I sacrificed myself to save her.

323
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,809
So honor that sacrifice.

324
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:08,148
Help me restore the timeline
and bring her back.

325
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,362
Let's go to work.

326
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,388
[Iris West] I guess you guys
haven't found Allen yet, huh?

327
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,412
Nope.

328
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,166
And Batwing called from Gotham.

329
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,169
- Two-Face turned up, which means...
- You have to go.

330
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,755
I will be at the ceremony tomorrow,
I promise.

331
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,508
Until then, take this.

332
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,719
It's a Velocity-Zero gun.

333
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,306
Luke designed it the last time a certain
lady-in-red tried to kill us all.

334
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,393
It will temporarily disrupt
Reverse-Flash's connection

335
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,187
to whatever speed force
he's connected to.

336
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,270
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:49,814
Now, uh...

338
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,372
you want to talk about
your other problem?

339
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,668
[Iris West] I don't know, I've been
working on it since I got home.

340
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:02,035
Every time I think about my future
with Eobard, my mind just...

341
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,497
It goes blanker than that page.

342
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:06,789
Any chance it's...

343
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,792
just cold feet?

344
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,960
I don't know.

345
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,171
I love Eobard, I do.

346
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,884
But when I think about what Allen said,
I mean, I just...

347
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
I can't...

348
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,472
I can't get it out of my head,
it's like it's haunting me.

349
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,726
Ryan, I've won two Pulitzers.

350
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,936
Why can't I write my own wedding vows?

351
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,190
Iris.

352
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,987
Tonight, you told me to stop thinking
so much and listen to my heart.

353
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,822
Yeah, okay, I get it.

354
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,159
- That's what I'm supposed to do now.
- 'Cause it works.

355
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:48,165
Look, tonight I saved a kid
living in their van near the waterfront.

356
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,625
Just like I was
before I found the Batsuit.

357
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:56,840
Some lowlifes were mugging her,
and as I was kicking their asses,

358
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,717
my heart told me what I want.

359
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,013
I wanna save a kid, like Cora saved me.

360
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:08,894
So after I dropped their sorry asses off
at the nearest precinct,

361
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:09,978
I called Sophie.

362
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,731
We're gonna adopt.

363
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:16,693
Ryan...

364
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,739
I'm so happy for you.

365
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,114
Take your own advice.

366
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,617
Trust me,

367
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:29,289
if Eobard's the one, the vows will come.

368
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:30,874
And what if he isn't?

369
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,543
Then I will get you
out of here in a hot minute.

370
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,796
My car drives really fast.

371
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,172
[both chuckle]

372
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,097
That's good work.

373
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,476
- Martini?
- Dude.

374
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,062
Right, you don't drink alcohol.

375
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,355
Hey, Chester.

376
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,774
Why did you ghost Allegra?

377
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,568
- [stammers] I never...
- Oh, here we go.

378
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,071
Ten years ago,
the morning after you two hooked up,

379
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,240
you snuck out while she was sleeping.

380
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,883
First of all, that's not ghosting,
that's called the French exit.

381
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:08,495
I never ghosted anyone, okay?

382
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,956
I went to get coffee
and blueberry muffins.

383
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,792
- Wait. What?
- [Chester] Yeah.

384
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:18,421
I wanted to have breakfast in bed,
watch the sun come up.

385
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,465
Had the whole day planned.

386
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,759
Because I knew even after one night,

387
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:25,262
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with her.

388
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:26,680
Dear God!

389
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,391
[Chester] When I got back,
she was gone, Alex, so...

390
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,475
Allegra ghosted me.

391
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,937
Which is why we always abide
by rule number one:

392
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,605
Never return to the scene of the crime.

393
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,147
[sighs]

394
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,859
Why didn't you ever tell her?

395
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,318
[sighs] I wanted to,

396
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,696
but we were attacked
by the Legion of Doom.

397
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,532
That week was seriously chaotic.

398
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:47,993
And when the dust settled,

399
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,121
I tried bringing it up again...

400
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:54,999
but she cut me off.

401
00:22:56,751 --> 00:23:01,047
Told me that night was a huge mistake
and that we were better off as friends.

402
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,095
I think I'm going to get some air.

403
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,721
Yeah.

404
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,016
Uh...

405
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,855
See, this is what happens
when you try and play Cupid.

406
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,733
What is your problem?

407
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,651
Why don't you love love?

408
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,986
[scoffs] Okay.

409
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,656
Love is just a chemical flood
of dopamine and oxytocin

410
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,659
giving people an addictive dependence
like a bad drug.

411
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:30,701
Science.

412
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:34,080
It's taken me years to help Chuck
feel happy without Allegra.

413
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,416
By telling him to hide his heart?

414
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,419
Okay, now you're going to give me
a whole greeting-card-inspired speech

415
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,547
about your perfect wife
and how she's the love of your life.

416
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:43,715
Okay, all right.

417
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,800
All right, fine.

418
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:51,222
But one day you're going to
wake up alone, and you're gonna realize

419
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,892
that you missed out
on the best part of being human.

420
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:12,035
[Barry] Look, um,
according to these equations,

421
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:16,373
I'd have to hit Mach 20
in order to open a time portal.

422
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:17,706
Really?

423
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:18,916
Yeah.

424
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,044
And is that a problem?

425
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,549
To reach that kind of speed,
I'd need 40,000 miles.

426
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,009
That kind of runway doesn't exist.

427
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,471
Yes, it does.

428
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,477
Is that big enough?

429
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,357
Yes, but the Earth
isn't just a solid rock.

430
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:43,941
It has a molten core.

431
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,045
The kind of pressure
I'd be exerting on its mantle

432
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,779
would cause cataclysmic damage.

433
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,992
We're talking volcanoes erupting,
ice caps melting, earthquake, tsunami...

434
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,910
It'd be Armageddon.

435
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,331
So in order to save the world
and bring my Nora back...

436
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,749
I'd have to risk destroying it.

437
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,128
Just like Despero predicted.

438
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:11,885
[Damien] Look, uh...

439
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,515
I hate to break up your pity party,
but we're running out of time.

440
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,143
Barry, you have to do this.

441
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:21,771
Trust me. I want my life
and Iris back more than anything.

442
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:22,938
But I've run the numbers.

443
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,941
I will have two minutes to accelerate

444
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,585
before my destruction
destroys the world.

445
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,153
Well, then you better run fast.

446
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:32,490
Damien, the odds of me hitting Mach 20
in two minutes is two percent.

447
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,658
It's better than nothing.

448
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,035
Look, you don't understand,

449
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:38,872
Despero says I cause Armageddon.
This is exactly what he described.

450
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:42,500
I won't be responsible for killing
every single person on the planet.

451
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,464
And what happens to those people
if you give up?

452
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:50,050
You're leaving eight billion souls
in a world where Thawne has everything

453
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,551
that he wants and nothing to lose.

454
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,446
- I'm still not fast enough.
- Fast enough?

455
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,470
[laughs]

456
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,097
How dense are you?

457
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,850
Speed isn't the only thing
that guides you through these things,

458
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,286
- it never is.
- What else is there?

459
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,228
Love, you idiot!

460
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,605
You're the paragon of it.

461
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,815
I saw what you did in the Time Stone.

462
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,985
You restarted
an entire universe with love.

463
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,111
This should be peanuts.

464
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,988
That's not gonna work, not this time.

465
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,405
Really?

466
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,367
Well, it's guiding
the both of us right now.

467
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,774
Why do you think I'm helping you?

468
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,125
You think I want to die?

469
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:26,627
I don't.

470
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,589
But if sacrificing my life means

471
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,175
that Nora gets to live the life
that Thawne stole from her,

472
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,927
then yeah, I'm going to do it because...

473
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:39,099
my love for her is what keeps me going
every damn day of my life.

474
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,066
Who do you think
I built this whole empire for?

475
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:44,853
And Iris?

476
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,981
Your family? Your friends?

477
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,818
They are what keep you going.

478
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,696
Iris doesn't remember what we had.

479
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,030
Well...

480
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,698
That doesn't matter.

481
00:26:58,868 --> 00:26:59,868
You do.

482
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,732
[Alex] You lied to me about Chester.

483
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,171
Chester loves you.

484
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,759
When he went to tell you,
you cut him off.

485
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,095
Why did you do that?

486
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:25,562
You want to know how every relationship
in my life has ended?

487
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,439
With me getting kicked to the curb.

488
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,069
Everyone I've ever loved has left.

489
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,614
When I woke up the next morning alone,

490
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,118
it was like a trigger.

491
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,956
Suddenly I was 12 years old again

492
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,960
and my mom was telling me

493
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:52,964
that my dad left us because of me.

494
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,261
Yep, she was a bag of crap, too.

495
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:03,558
The point is, I was crushed.

496
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:10,190
So, when I saw Chester walking
up the street with coffees and a bag,

497
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,234
I knew what that meant,

498
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,862
how he felt about me,

499
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,575
and I just freaked out,
and I pushed him away.

500
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:25,829
You know...

501
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,002
my wife is my rock.

502
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,839
But things were not always perfect.

503
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,758
Trust me,

504
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:41,471
putting yourself out there, it's scary.

505
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,099
But it's also so worth it.

506
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,730
But what if I lose him?

507
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,650
You'll never know unless you try.

508
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,401
Alex...

509
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:01,115
the reason why I don't love love...

510
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,703
is because nothing scares me more

511
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,956
than putting my heart out on the line.

512
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:10,792
So I make fun of romantics.

513
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,462
But this whole Don Juan thing,

514
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,339
it's just an act.

515
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,217
- Really?
- I knew it.

516
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,510
The truth is...

517
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,306
I don't want to wake up alone
for the rest of my life.

518
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:28,809
Look...

519
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:30,979
Chester's my boy,

520
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,274
and I know what my boy needs.

521
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:37,734
He needs you.

522
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,531
[alarm blaring]

523
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,451
[Chester] <i>Guys,
we got a hit on Reverse-Flash!</i>

524
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:47,995
[Alex] Let's go.

525
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,841
I was just thinking about...

526
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,262
I just want to talk, I swear.

527
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,227
You take one more step
and I'm gonna shoot you.

528
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:08,098
Okay.

529
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,292
What's wrong with you? Are you dying?

530
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:16,858
Something like that.

531
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,739
I came here because I'm about
to do something impossible.

532
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,782
And even though it might not work,

533
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,818
I couldn't leave this world
without telling you that...

534
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,289
[Eobard] Nice try, Allen.

535
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,499
But she doesn't love you.

536
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,336
She loves me.

537
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,714
Tell him, Iris. Or better yet...

538
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:44,593
shoot him.

539
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:57,190
- Iris.
- What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

540
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,442
I need you to know,
no matter what happens,

541
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:02,685
after everything Thawne's taken from me,
he can't take away my feelings for you.

542
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,573
I love you, Iris.

543
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,158
Enough.

544
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,381
Go... before I change my mind.

545
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,535
- How'd it go with the missus?
- [Barry] I don't know.

546
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,769
But she let me go.

547
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,436
Has to mean something.

548
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,437
Well...

549
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:38,939
Let's do this thing.

550
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,626
Now I'll stay here,
your point of origin,

551
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,193
just in case we get some visitors.

552
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,319
But I'll be in touch.

553
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:44,862
- How?
- Magic.

554
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,864
You'll hear my voice wherever you go.

555
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,617
Now remember,
you've got two minutes to reach Mach 20

556
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,860
and open the temporal portal.

557
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,412
Damien...

558
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,455
thank you.

559
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:02,921
Get outta here.

560
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,239
We tracked down the P.E.D.
and Reverse-Flash.

561
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,806
He's crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

562
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,850
What the hell is he doing?

563
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,119
[Frost over comms]
<i>He's destroying the city.</i>

564
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,853
<i>It's like the end of days out here.</i>

565
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,831
Holy crap. It's not just the city.

566
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:21,816
Allen's speed wake is causing the globe
to tear itself apart.

567
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,336
It's an extinction-level event
in progress.

568
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,696
He's right. I'm tracking
at least a hundred earthquakes.

569
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,072
A tsunami just hit Japan.

570
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,574
Allen really has lost his mind.

571
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,469
He realized he can't win,
so he's trying to kill us all.

572
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,493
[Cecile] I have to go.

573
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:34,661
I gotta go get Jenna.

574
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,664
[Frost] <i>Guys,
Mark and I could use backup.</i>

575
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,082
Go. I'll stay here.

576
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:39,791
Okay.

577
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,919
Hey, not to be that guy,

578
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,231
but since this could be the end
of the world as we know it,

579
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:46,132
if anyone has anything to say,

580
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,382
now would be the time.

581
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,637
[softly] Right.

582
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,142
The Reverse-Flash just hit Europe.

583
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:57,977
Where's Eobard?

584
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,062
[Eobard over comms]
<i>I'm right behind him.</i>

585
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,320
Hey, Flash, you've got company.

586
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,283
[grunts]

587
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:14,908
[Frost] Guess what, Darhk?

588
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,411
So do you.

589
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:26,339
Frosty, Chill-Lame.

590
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,840
Yeah, I'm a little bit busy.

591
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:31,594
But you do realize my abilities
give me the power

592
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,805
to draw and quarter
with a gesture, right?

593
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:36,724
- [grunts]
- [Chillblaine] Oh.

594
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:39,268
Not for the next 24 hours, you don't.

595
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:42,605
Our friend, John, gave us
a badass protection spell.

596
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:45,858
Constantine, I hate that guy.

597
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,235
Yeah, well, too bad.

598
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,735
Looks like we get to kick
this guy's ass all night.

599
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,322
Won't even take that long.

600
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:53,698
Really?

601
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,743
Let's see how that goes.

602
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:02,874
[grunts]

603
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:07,713
If Boss doesn't catch Allen
in the next 90 seconds...

- Chester...
- Eighty-five.

- Chester.
- Eighty-four.

- Chuck!
- What?

Yeah, well, I love you, too!

609
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,194
When did this happen?

610
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,244
This is not working!

611
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,288
I'm still not fast enough!

612
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,308
I'm trying to save
my daughter here, Allen.

00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,126
Yeah. I increased the molecular density
on that little toothpick of yours,

620
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,462
a thousand-fold at the sub-atomic level.

621

Good luck trying to lift two tons.

Then you are really gonna hate that.

625
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,523
- Thanks for the assist.
- Of course.

626
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,984
- [chuckles] Hey, nice threads.
- Thanks, man!

627
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,906
We're running out of time.

628

[Chester] Sixty seconds.

00:35:58,407 --> 00:35:59,408
Come on, Flash.

630
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,580
You're too late, Allen.

631
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,415
You're too late!

You are a monster!

638
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,085
I'm going to ask you one last time,
Miss Horton.

639
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:55,673
And if I don't like your answer, you'll
join your friends in the afterlife.

648
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
[screams]

649
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:35,754
What is this?

650
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:58,903
[panting]

651
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,200
Flash, what did you do?

652
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:08,829
I went to the future.

653
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:11,873
Iris was right.

654
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,461
Someone manipulated the timeline
to drive me insane.

655
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,798
Turns out, in order to fix it,

656
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,008
I had to start Armageddon.

657
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,261
Only this time,
I didn't destroy the world.

658
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,473
How is that possible?

659
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:31,435
You left 2031 before the world ended.

660
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,564
What you didn't know
was that Eobard Thawne,

661
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,775
the Reverse-Flash, was chasing me.

662
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,195
He wanted to stop me
from restoring the timeline.

663
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:43,948
The speed wake created by us both.

664
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,035
That is what caused
the destruction you saw.

665
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,581
If that's happened, what stopped you
from tearing this world apart?

666
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Iris.

667
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,253
She helped me reconnect
to the Speed Force.

668
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,047
Now the future's safe.

669
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,886
I can see you believe it to be true.

670
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:07,638
And as a traveler in time,

671
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,766
my senses confirm this world
has been altered.

672
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:14,687
But as for the true reason...

673
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,983
well, that remains to be seen.

674
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,278
Maybe you should go to 2031

675
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:24,405
and see for yourself.

676
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:35,915
I shall.

677
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,210
But if you're wrong
or if I find any evidence

678
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:41,839
that this world is still in danger,
I will return,

679
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,550
and you will die.

680
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,306
[Chester] Yeah.

681
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:54,810
- [Iris West] Gluten-free? Cecile.
- [Cecile] Gluten-free.

682
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,855
- Here you go.
- Nice.

683
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,482
[Iris West] You have yours, right?
Is there drinks?

684
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,651
Hey, babe!

685
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,423
Uh, I would've got you something,
but I thought you were

686
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,167
working through lunch
at the precinct today.

687
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:09,491
Don't worry, there's plenty.

688
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,155
Got a burger for you, boss.

689
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,002
I missed you so much.

690
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,005
[chuckles] Not that I don't love
this attention, but...

691
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,382
where's this coming from?

692
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:29,053
Barry, you okay?

693
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,681
Something happened, didn't it?

694
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:36,851
What was it?

695
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,231
Later, all right?

696
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,095
I just want to be here with you.

697
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,109
With all of you.

698
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,071
[Iris West] Okay.

699
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:49,782
Want me to call Dad? Frost?

700
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:52,910
Dad. Here we go.

701
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Joe...

702
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:55,371
Can I call him?

703
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,957
Uh, I mean, yeah, it's ringing. So...

704
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:05,088
Joe?

705
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:08,675
It's really you.

706
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:11,844
You're really there.

707
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:37,121
Nobody uses time against me.

708
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,372
[device beeps]

709
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,750
I will live.

710
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,337
I will change what's about to happen.

711
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,425
And you will help me.
