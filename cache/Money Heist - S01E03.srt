1
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,110
Can I get a decaf, please?

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,614
Hello, this is Mariví's
answering machine.

3
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:26,559
Leave a message after the beep.

4
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:28,952
Mom, I just finished. It's 6 am...

5
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,344
Excuse me, do you have a
cellphone charger on hand?

6
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,145
No. Sorry.

7
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:44,197
You want to use mine?

8
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:49,392
<font color="#b20000">20 hours into the robbery</font>

9
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:54,056
- really? You don't mind?
- No, no.

10
00:00:54,332 --> 00:00:56,377
Are you sure? Thanks.

11
00:00:57,853 --> 00:00:59,077
I have to make a few calls.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,213
- That's all right.
- Thanks again.

13
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:06,801
<font color="#b20000">Saturday 6:25 am</font>

14
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:12,421
mom, I just finished. I'm on my way.

15
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,741
Chief Sánchez, leave a message.

16
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:21,887
This is inspector Murillo.

17
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:24,881
It's late, but... I
wanted to tell you that

18
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:27,258
if this is being
handled by intelligence,

19
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:29,376
because of some sort of
diplomatic interests,

20
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:33,258
I'm not going to be your puppet inspector
while those gorillas storm the place.

21
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,585
So I feel obligated...

22
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,120
to step down. Good night, sir.

23
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:41,294
Good morning.

24
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:47,109
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,996
The number of hostages is unknown...

26
00:01:54,474 --> 00:01:57,795
The only information so
far is that Alison Parker...

27
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,196
Oh, but you're up there...

28
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,986
Are you...

29
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:07,825
If I started off telling
a kidnapping story.

30
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:11,703
It's because everyone remembers
those days under siege at the royal mint.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,135
Streets in downtown
Madrid were closed,

32
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,326
television broadcasted
live 24 hours a day,

33
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,874
the police threw their operation
manuals out the window

34
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,362
and didn't know what to do
about the balls on those bastards

35
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:23,629
trying to print their own money.

36
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,230
But actually, lots of things
happened that no one remembers,

37
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:29,080
things that changed us all

38
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,455
to the point of not knowing
who were the bad guys...

39
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:32,719
And who were the good ones.

40
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,491
When you negotiate with those people,

41
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:36,094
do you give them
what they ask for,

42
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:38,614
or do you just go along
to buy time...?

43
00:02:40,164 --> 00:02:42,675
- Well, you don't have to answer...
- Each case is different.

44
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,520
Of course, I'm sorry.

45
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:46,122
Though...

46
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:48,876
We buy some time.

47
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,890
We try to defuse the situation
and end it peacefully.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,541
Thank you.

49
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,265
Actually, we were the ones buying time,

50
00:02:57,448 --> 00:03:00,378
the phrase time is money
has never been so appropriate.

51
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,400
And what a load of money.

52
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:05,684
Each hour we printed
eight million Euros,

53
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:08,480
1,400 sheets of currency grade paper

54
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:11,906
each producing 140,000
50 Euro bank notes.

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,777
Everything was so calm at dawn

56
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,151
that it seemed like the
plan was right on track.

57
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:27,747
The professor was our big brother.

58
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:30,836
He controlled the police radio
and 18 cameras,

59
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:33,720
so if someone wanted
to screw us over,

60
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:35,315
we'd know well in advance.

61
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,173
We took shifts
watching the hostages,

62
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:45,591
all entryways and of
course the production.

63
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,973
After only 20 hours in

64
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,318
the printers had already
spit out 52 million Euros,

65
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:54,635
so at that point we all
thought it was gonna work.

66
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:57,946
But all that peace was only
the calm before the storm.

67
00:03:58,152 --> 00:03:59,952
Things were about
to get so fucked up,

68
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:02,319
that we came very
close to losing it all.

69
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,182
And if you ask me why,

70
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,878
I'll say it was because
of a simple love story.

71
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,233
In the end,

72
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:11,073
love is a good reason
for everything to fall apart.

73
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:38,208
I would like to ask you a favor.

74
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:40,030
Alright?

75
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:46,066
All units on alert,

76
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:48,865
Deputy inspector,
they're opening the doors.

77
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:58,086
Several men are coming out,
armed with M-16s, sir.

78
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:00,200
Nobody moves, you got that?

79
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,264
This could be our break.

80
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,931
I said, nobody moves.

81
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:05,098
Take off the mask.

82
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:17,256
I ask you to please not shoot.

83
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:20,053
My name is Mónica Gaztambide.

84
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:21,840
She's a hostage.

85
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:24,561
I'm only here to
read a statement.

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,840
I'm speaking on behalf of the hijackers.

87
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:31,893
There are 67 hostages,

88
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,779
all of us are in perfect health

89
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:37,168
and are well taken care of.

90
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:41,015
There are no
casualties or wounded.

91
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,190
We're all dressed the same way

92
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:46,809
and it's impossible to tell
us apart from the hijackers,

93
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:50,360
so any attempt at a raid

94
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:53,712
- could cost many lives...
- The guy with the megaphone

95
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:54,784
 is giving orders, sir.

96
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:56,781
Sir, I have the shot.
Should I take it?

97
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:01,769
Requesting green light, sir.

98
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:06,332
I have a clear shot.

99
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:10,191
They're going back in.
Last chance, sir.

100
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:12,840
Last chance, sir.

101
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,184
They're going in, I repeat,
they're going in.

102
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:16,526
No, nobody fires.

103
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:18,344
Nobody fires, did you hear me?

104
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,266
Let them go in,
let them go back in.

105
00:07:21,618 --> 00:07:23,493
You copy? Everyone stand down.

106
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,000
As we all just witnessed live,
the hijackers just read a statement

107
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:32,080
where they expressed regret
for wounding the policemen.

108
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:35,059
Apparently, all the
hostages are in good health

109
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:37,800
and the hijackers have
no intention of being violent.

110
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:02,160
Dear, I know that you don't like
it when Paula sleeps in your bed,

111
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:04,931
but she insisted and I
didn't want to argue with her.

112
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,011
Don't get upset.

113
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:38,464
We're locked in

114
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,401
and we don't know how
much longer this will last,

115
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:45,538
but as long as they don't shoot
me in the head, I'll take care of you.

116
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:50,298
As long as you don't trick me, or try
to communicate with the outside world,

117
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,480
everything will be fine.

118
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,917
From now on, we'll get organized.

119
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:00,016
You'll be assigned some tasks

120
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,240
so you don't get depressed.

121
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:05,954
What's your name?

122
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,626
Pablo.

123
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,720
Do you play sports?

124
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:11,464
Yeah, captain of the
track team at school.

125
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:16,313
One step forward, captain.

126
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:25,406
One step forward.

127
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:28,596
Hey.

128
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,000
Little Arturo.

129
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,058
How did you sleep?

130
00:09:33,842 --> 00:09:34,842
Fine, fine.

131
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:35,591
Great.

132
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,760
Tell me, are you handy
around the house?

133
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,225
No, no. No, sir. I'm a mess.

134
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,744
Actually, when I get a flat,
my wife changes the tire.

135
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:47,120
So you're saying
you don't own a drill?

136
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,187
- No. No.
- Think hard,

137
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,929
because I have a fucking
lie detector right here.

138
00:09:58,028 --> 00:09:58,628
Yes.

139
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:06,466
Second chance.
Are you handy around the house?

140
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,800
- I manage.
- One step forward.

141
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,693
Would you feel better if we
brought a sedative to you?

142
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,816
- Yes, please.
- Okay, very well.

143
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:26,693
- Anyone else need medication?
- I do. I'm diabetic.

144
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:30,520
- All right, come up here, then.
- I do too. I take Sertraline.

145
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,345
That's fine.

146
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:33,794
Anyone else?

147
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:35,115
I do.

148
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,280
I would like to have an abortion pill.

149
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:44,101
We don't know how
long we'll be here

150
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,724
and I want to solve
this as soon as possible.

151
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:46,898
You'll get that today.

152
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:48,533
All of you, come with me,

153
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,554
I'll take you to Mr Román's office,
it's more comfortable there.

154
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:52,888
Excuse me, I have a request too.

155
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:56,146
Yes?

156
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,362
I would like to go on the
internet to delete a photo.

157
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,247
Sorry, but that's not my responsibilty.

158
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,084
I was tricked,

159
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,119
someone took a photo of me naked earlier.

160
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:09,279
And now my parents, my teachers,

161
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:10,842
everybody can see it now.

162
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:13,526
You can send a message, a video,

163
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:15,080
so they don't worry.

164
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:16,253
We'll send it for you.

165
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:24,120
All of you can record
messages for your families.

166
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:26,674
Nairobi, they're all yours.

167
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,114
Alright, macho guys

168
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:35,044
hands behind your heads
and to the left in a straight line,

169
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:36,510
chest out

170
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:38,544
like the national soccer team.

171
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,302
Come on, athlete.

172
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,360
Do you guys see this dotted line?

173
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:44,511
You're going to break
the concrete here

174
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:46,473
remaining perfectly
within the line,

175
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,015
just like

176
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,040
cutting out paper dolls.

177
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,072
It's 160 feet straight
down to get to the collector.

178
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:56,266
We'll work in three hour shifts.

179
00:11:56,461 --> 00:11:58,211
And when you're
done with your shift,

180
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,658
you go back with the hostages,

181
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:03,140
and not a fucking word about
what you're doing down here.

182
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:05,613
- Got any questions?
- No.

183
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:07,920
That's very good, that
means I explained it clearly.

184
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:10,184
Alright then, get to work.

185
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:12,668
You, put on those
hearing protectors

186
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,103
and grab the jackhammer.

187
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:15,360
I've never used one of those.

188
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:16,837
First time for everything.

189
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:28,264
Hey, careful.

190
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,800
Wouldn't be the first time
someone lost a foot doing this.

191
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:46,204
- Dad, mom, I'm fine.
- Just make it brief.

192
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:50,891
Hi, dad. Hi, mom.

193
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:55,808
I'm okay, they feed us
and we get to rest.

194
00:12:57,482 --> 00:13:00,480
Mom, this is not horrible.
No one got hurt.

195
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,200
Mom, I'm fine.

196
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,240
I figure you've seen the
picture that's on the internet.

197
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:10,360
I didn't upload it, and it has nothing
to do with what's going on here,

198
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,530
it was a classmate who tricked me and...

199
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:19,763
I can't.

200
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:21,210
Don't give too much
weight to that picture.

201
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,235
It's like when you go
topless at the beach.

202
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:26,873
No one cares about it.

203
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,201
I'm not the type that goes topless.

204
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,520
Nor the kind that gets
with a guy in a restroom.

205
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,956
Breaking my arm at school was
my most exciting thing this year.

206
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:42,309
A robbery is more exciting.

207
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:53,428
Well, you think about what
you want to tell your parents.

208
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:56,828
And relax, take your time.

209
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,159
You're quiet.
What's the matter?

210
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:08,796
What the fuck do you care?

211
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,272
I'm just a kid,

212
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:13,160
your fuck partner for
the last five months.

213
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:17,800
The idot with the dog tags.

214
00:14:19,343 --> 00:14:21,632
I said that you were a kid
and I'd never would be with you

215
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:22,884
so you wouldn't get shot

216
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,198
because I couldn't care less

217
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,592
- If they shot me.
- That's a load of shit,

218
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:27,852
you didn't do that for me.

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,308
What's wrong with all of you?

220
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,852
Ever since I came back in
everybody gives me grief.

221
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:35,515
A phone is on, sir.

222
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,265
It's Alison Parker's.

223
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:41,991
Hack it.

224
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:44,336
You know what's wrong with me?

225
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,680
That I'm completely
sure that you waited

226
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,109
till we left Toledo

227
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,520
to begin all this bullshit
about me being a kid.

228
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:51,931
She's trying to access her profile.

229
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,285
Come on, come on, come on.

230
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,941
If I was your fucking
gigolo, just tell me.

231
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,589
You were my gigolo.

232
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,760
And everything else.

233
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:10,316
- I'm in.
- Record it.

234
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,220
I can't talk about this.

235
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:17,453
You have the nerve to tell me
that you're mourning your boyfriend.

236
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,028
You didn't seem to
be mourning him

237
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,869
when you asked me to
fuck you against the wall.

238
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:24,040
I didn't see any rosaries
through your fingers.

239
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:27,099
You talk to me like that
again, I'll kick your ass.

240
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,480
Switch the camera to selfie mode.

241
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:37,937
Hey, hey!

242
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:39,235
What the hell are you doing?

243
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:40,400
No, no, no!

244
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,040
What the fuck is wrong with you?

245
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,680
We lost the signal.

246
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:48,058
Play it back.

247
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,500
Pause it. Improve the image.

248
00:15:58,634 --> 00:15:59,440
We have it.

249
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,520
- They're going to kill us.
- What are you saying?

250
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,040
- They're going to kill us.
- Hush!

251
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,140
And then they'll escape through
the tunnel we're digging for them.

252
00:16:22,165 --> 00:16:24,000
It's gonna be a
fucking bloodbath.

253
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,800
Be quiet, you
don't know anything.

254
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,145
Use your head.

255
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:33,080
You think these people
are stupid enough to let us go

256
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,941
so we can go to the
police and identify them?

257
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,453
Use your head, damn it.

258
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:38,830
We're fucked.

259
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:42,323
Twice. So far I've been told
twice that I'm a dead man.

260
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,600
- Go see what's under the canvas.
- Huh?

261
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,094
Go look. I'm not sitting
here like a guinea pig

262
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,137
waiting for them to kill
me without doing anything.

263
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:54,123
Do you understand?

264
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:55,975
Look under the tarp,
see if there's some guns

265
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,840
or something we can use, come on.

266
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:07,853
- Yes?
- Listen up Raquel.

267
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,534
You call me at 6 o'clock in the morning
and you leave a confusing message

268
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,055
saying something about a puppet inspector,

269
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,699
and gorillas and other bullshit.

270
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:18,280
Nothing I give a damn about.

271
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:22,040
Then you walk out and leave
the situation with 67 hostages.

272
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,636
So I'm just calling you so you
can tell me to my fucking face

273
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,155
that you're not taking care of this.

274
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,003
I'm taking care of it.

275
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:34,388
Raquel, this whole thing
is bigger than either of us.

276
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,138
Homeland security,
state, intelligence...

277
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,944
But, keep this in mind,

278
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:43,347
you're the only person
that I can really trust

279
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,165
who can solve this without violence.

280
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:49,843
I understand, thank you.

281
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:52,919
Get back to mobile
command and take charge.

282
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,138
We've got a photo of one of them.

283
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:58,365
I'll cover you.

284
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:01,152
Come on, grow a pair of balls.
Grow a pair, would you.

285
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:02,262
What's wrong?

286
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:05,367
- I don't want to do it.
- Aren't you the captain of a rugby team?

287
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:06,130
Track and field.

288
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:06,905
Then run.

289
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:22,458
Containers.

290
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:26,800
- It's gasoline.
- Seriously?

291
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:32,429
- And ammunition.
- Holy shit!

292
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,497
What's that?

293
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,527
Drugs?

294
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,760
This is heroin. Dude, it's heroin.

295
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:49,200
Leave that alone, leave it. It's plastic
explosive, for fucks sakes.

296
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,440
Come back here, come back, come on.

297
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:59,032
Why in the hell isn't
this machine working?

298
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,200
We're taking a break, chief.

299
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,600
You take a break when I tell you
to take one. Or when it's your turn.

300
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,945
Alright, alright. We're
coming. We're coming.

301
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,531
Inspector, is there a conflict
between intelligence and the police?

302
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,482
Did you step down from the negotiations
due to your domestic violence complaint?

303
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:41,473
Huh, what?

304
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:43,251
Alright, that's enough. Back off.

305
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:47,198
- How does this scum know everything?
- I don't know.

306
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:52,744
Back so soon?

307
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:02,784
Do you have a minute?

308
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:04,214
Of course.

309
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:10,575
Colonel Prieto.

310
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:15,473
Look, I've been a little
nervous these last hours, but...

311
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,165
I would like to establish a more
fluid communication between us.

312
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,540
I think we both have a lot
to contribute to this crisis.

313
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,096
I'm glad you realize your error.

314
00:20:25,264 --> 00:20:26,132
I am here,

315
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:29,371
at your service.
But I want you to know,

316
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,940
before there's any
misunderstanding, I'm...

317
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,800
well, I'm a married man.

318
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,947
Raquel, Raquel.

319
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:43,200
Male, 25 at the most, we got him
with Alison Parker's cellphone.

320
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,134
Identity?

321
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:47,876
We're on it, the facial recognition team
are searching the police profiles.

322
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:49,808
I want to watch
the whole video.

323
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,090
Pull up the image.

324
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:58,499
We couldn't get more than six seconds.

325
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,050
Pause it there.

326
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,946
It looks like a makarov.

327
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:05,431
No, it's a strizh 9mm, it's also Russian.

328
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:07,731
It's actually rare to see them around here.

329
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,392
Talk to judicial.

330
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:13,522
Tell them to ask every informants with
ties to the Eastern European black market.

331
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:15,846
- What's that on the wall?
- Cellphones.

332
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,731
Pull up the images of the rear camera.

333
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:25,051
What's that on the tags? Zoom in.

334
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:28,120
The list?

335
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,622
Those are their cellphones.

336
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:37,688
Recognition team will have
his identity in one or two hours.

337
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:39,836
No, we're not
waiting that long.

338
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,359
You don't find this special
connection quite peculiar?

339
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,712
I was actually about
to call you, just now.

340
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:39,689
And here you are.

341
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:43,420
Well, considering that I'm the
negotiator and you're holding hostages...

342
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,379
Yes, but we shouldn't allow this
felony to interfere in our relationship.

343
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:48,916
I don't know you, but I
see an opportunity here.

344
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:50,872
A opportunity for what?

345
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:51,880
To get to know each other.

346
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:54,840
I'm sure you that if you
and I had met in a bar,

347
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:56,691
you'd have completely ignored me.

348
00:22:57,561 --> 00:22:58,475
Tell me, inspector.

349
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,383
Have you ever faked an orgasm?

350
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:08,658
No.

351
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,700
Please, inspector,
don't lie to me.

352
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,640
Think about it, for
a bit, would you.

353
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:20,160
I might have. I might have done it, yes.

354
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:25,081
You see, a man is programmed to
ejaculate in the least time possible.

355
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:27,829
Whereas a women, to make
it last as long as possible.

356
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,698
And sometimes, that small license from
nature gets resolved with a fake orgasm.

357
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,371
Which is nothing more than a small scam.

358
00:23:37,356 --> 00:23:38,265
A lie.

359
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,615
Like last night's intervention,

360
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:43,400
with a team of elite forces.

361
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:46,049
Inspector, I asked you
not to lie to me,

362
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:48,070
you're endangering innocent people.

363
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:51,876
I wouldn't lie. And now tell me,
why were you going to call me?

364
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:55,215
Look, we need food and several medication:

365
00:23:55,659 --> 00:24:00,092
Insulin, Sertraline, Albuterol,
an abortion pill

366
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,067
- and some sedatives.
- An abortion pill?

367
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:05,094
These are requests from the hostages.

368
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:08,656
We all have personal problems,
don't you agree?

369
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:11,899
- You'll get your requests.
- Good.

370
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,336
Civil protection will make the delivery,

371
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,803
in clear bags to avoid
the use of weapons.

372
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:19,099
Now, you tell me,

373
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:22,619
- you were calling me for...
- For you to surrender immediately.

374
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:26,390
I have images from the inside,

375
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:28,760
I've found the identity of one of you.

376
00:24:28,785 --> 00:24:29,953
And if I keep digging,

377
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:32,443
I'll get the identities of
everyone in your gang.

378
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,484
Inspector, it seems to me...

379
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:36,499
I'm offering you a
deal with the DA.

380
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:40,619
I can reduce your sentences
from 16 to 8 years,

381
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:42,171
only if you get out now.

382
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:44,971
No casualties yet,
so we can deal.

383
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:47,223
I don't believe that is
a fair deal on our part.

384
00:24:47,248 --> 00:24:48,317
You've already lost.

385
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,179
Look, in the unlikely
event that you get out,

386
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,692
your faces will be all over the news,

387
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:56,280
police stations and borders.

388
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:58,308
You no longer have a plan b.

389
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:00,288
Then we'll activate plan c.

390
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,627
You think I'm bluffing, right?

391
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,885
Frankly, yes.

392
00:25:03,527 --> 00:25:05,771
To show you that I'm not
lying, I'll give you some info.

393
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,060
You have 67 phones
stuck to the wall with velcro.

394
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:15,040
You have one hour to consider my deal.

395
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:17,011
Listen, inspector...

396
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:27,723
We need to let
the police know

397
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:29,343
and we must guide
them through the raid.

398
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:31,218
Listen to me. There's
a phone in my office,

399
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:33,124
inside a coat hanging
from a clothes rack.

400
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,168
Listen, you've got about 30 or
40 seconds. Don't waste any time...

401
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:36,995
No, you go!

402
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,040
I can't, you have to go.

403
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,771
You know what would
happen if someone's there?

404
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:41,953
They'd shoot me, dude.

405
00:25:41,978 --> 00:25:42,772
They're gona shoot you anyway.

406
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:45,246
Hey, I said I want to hear
that machine working, dammit!

407
00:25:45,465 --> 00:25:47,120
I'm not gonna say it again!

408
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
please forgive me.

409
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:52,352
- He's very tired. Please.
- I can't.

410
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,178
I can't go on.

411
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:57,000
- I'm going to die, I'm sorry.
- Come on, get out of there.

412
00:25:57,453 --> 00:25:58,453
Get out and rest.

413
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:07,402
Yes, professor?

414
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:10,676
They have an image of
all the phones on the wall.

415
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,653
There's no security
camera inside, right?

416
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,635
No, of course not, just
the ones we installed.

417
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,019
Then it was one of the hostages.

418
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:22,752
You missed one of the phones.

419
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:25,352
Find it or we're all screwed.

420
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,960
Give me the go-ahead
to punish them.

421
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:29,883
We shut them down with fear
or they'll continue to play the hero.

422
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,115
- Like what?
- Make an example.

423
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,280
- We execute one.
- No.

424
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Just find the phone.

425
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,621
Are you really going to abort it?

426
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,629
Please forgive me for everything, Mónica.

427
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,100
I was way out of line, I was a prick to you

428
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,806
I've never been a
brave man, you know?

429
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:20,931
I've spent all my fucking life
doing what other people want,

430
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
never what I wanted.

431
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,489
And I end up in a
situation like this,

432
00:27:31,393 --> 00:27:33,680
with bullets and bad guys,

433
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:36,384
so I now realise what I need.

434
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,811
It's no longer just me.

435
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
It's me and you.

436
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:45,411
And the child that you're carrying.

437
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,080
I love you, Mónica.

438
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:52,031
I love you, that I know.

439
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,810
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

440
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,752
And I want you
to keep it, alright.

441
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:03,079
I want to be a parent.

442
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,726
We're having a baby.

443
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,000
And I want us to become a
family if we get out of here.

444
00:28:17,753 --> 00:28:18,880
- What do you mean, if...?
- Quiet

445
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:23,257
- They're digging a tunnel.
- What?

446
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:28,120
Yes, they have a bunch of plastic
explosive and gasoline tanks.

447
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:30,429
- Stand up!
- It's gonna be a bloodbath, for sure.

448
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:33,842
But there's a way to contact the police
and guide them through the raid.

449
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,520
I have a cellphone in
my office, inside my coat.

450
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,080
I don't know how to get there, though.

451
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:43,920
- I'll go.
- No, no, no.

452
00:28:49,224 --> 00:28:51,000
There's always a hero...

453
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:55,781
Who believes that he can save the others.

454
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:58,803
Who thinks that...

455
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:06,273
That no one will discover that
he's plotting a strategy to contact

456
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:08,101
the police.

457
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,347
Bravo.

458
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:15,145
Congratulations,
because one of you

459
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:16,760
already did it,

460
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,179
He recorded an image from inside

461
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,225
and he sent it to the police.

462
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,733
Aníbal Cortés, he's from Getafe.

463
00:29:25,994 --> 00:29:27,722
He's an expert in alarm systems,

464
00:29:27,747 --> 00:29:29,724
he worked for two
years in security firms.

465
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:32,356
He's been linked to the
robbery of a mansion in Geneva,

466
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,997
and has a warrant issued by Interpol.

467
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,384
So I would like

468
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:39,853
to give him or her the
chance to step forward

469
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,600
so you all of you can thank him or her.

470
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,003
And, while we're at it, give me the phone.

471
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,490
He must have scouted out the Royal Mint
to analyze the alarm systems.

472
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,211
See what's in the hard drives
of the security firm.

473
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:54,109
If we're lucky...

474
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:56,560
maybe he was there
with another member of the gang.

475
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:57,661
Helsinki.

476
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,539
Undress him.

477
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,400
- Come on.
- Are you crazy or what?

478
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:03,605
Pay attention.

479
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:06,950
The shirt, too.

480
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:08,187
Come on.

481
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,880
- The rest.
- It was one of you.

482
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:19,280
Anyone want to confess?

483
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:24,756
Denver, take her clothes off.

484
00:30:35,454 --> 00:30:38,400
You recorded a video

485
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:41,843
in the phone's room, right?

486
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,493
- No, wait.
- Please no.

487
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,162
- What's wrong?
- I can't breathe.

488
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:56,364
Just take me with the girls.
Please can I go?

489
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:58,080
Berlin, I'm taking her.

490
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,269
- Berlin, wait.
- What is it now?

491
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:07,363
I know what happened.

492
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,213
I got distracted for a second, then I
saw Alison trying to delete the picture.

493
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:13,450
It was just a slipup.

494
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:16,680
What's wrong, are you ADHD?

495
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:19,112
Because if you're one of
those kids with problems,

496
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:20,853
I should know about it.

497
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:22,508
I don't have any problems.

498
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,728
Tokyo came in, all right?

499
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:30,604
And we exchanged a
few words, and that's it.

500
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,280
- It won't happen again.
- Now I get it.

501
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:38,280
Everything comes down, once
again, to an emotional matter.

502
00:31:41,452 --> 00:31:43,507
You really remind me of myself.

503
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:45,388
I was...

504
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:50,365
18, she was 44, she
was my French teacher.

505
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:52,444
- I was her favorite.
- I don't know what's your point,

506
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:55,200
- Tokyo's not 44.
- She's older than you by 15 years.

507
00:31:57,572 --> 00:31:59,476
And when you're young
and you're with a woman

508
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,228
that's about to hit her prime,
everything's incredible.

509
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:06,123
She has the experience
that the younger girls lack

510
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:09,000
and they're far more grateful
than the ugly ones.

511
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,260
My teacher surrendered
her mature flesh

512
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,680
every time like it was
my fucking birthday.

513
00:32:19,257 --> 00:32:20,091
You know why?

514
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:24,056
Because with you

515
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:26,959
they can once again
taste the lost youth,

516
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:29,540
before throwing themselves
off the cliff of aging.

517
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:43,391
Of course...

518
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:47,944
there's a small difference

519
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:50,722
between your love
story and mine.

520
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:53,685
I wasn't involved in a hostage situation,

521
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,323
risking the lives of my partners.

522
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:00,204
Teach him a lesson.

523
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,269
A heist at the epicenter of money,

524
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:13,956
the biggest heist in history.

525
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:17,064
Strange robbery claims
international attention.

526
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:18,120
How about that?

527
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,072
- You want some coffee?
- Fuck.

528
00:33:20,212 --> 00:33:21,823
We have a policeman in the ICU,

529
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:24,311
67 hostages, a load
of heavily armed guys

530
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,178
and for the media
this is like a circus.

531
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:28,027
Yeah, I don't care about that.

532
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:30,932
what worries me is that they
have too much information,

533
00:33:30,956 --> 00:33:31,667
it doesn't help.

534
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:32,431
Are you alright?

535
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:36,009
I'm going out to get
something to eat, alright?

536
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:37,440
I'll be back
in a few minutes.

537
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:38,348
All right.

538
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:40,892
Attention, inspector out.

539
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:42,576
Clear the paparazzis.

540
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:12,307
Leave the packages on the ground
and move back slowly.

541
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:46,674
I have a cellphone in
my office, inside my coat.

542
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,543
It's hot in here.

543
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,988
The medication.

544
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:31,467
May I?

545
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:33,029
What?

546
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:35,217
Water.

547
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:42,754
Sit down.

548
00:35:44,745 --> 00:35:46,120
Sit down!

549
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,090
We got the medication.

550
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,651
Distribute them.

551
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:11,804
- I'll go now.
- Wait.

552
00:36:15,267 --> 00:36:16,467
I want you to come with me.

553
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:19,521
Come with me.

554
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,116
Look, you might not think it's
worth a shit what I'm about to tell you.

555
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:55,146
but I don't think it's a good
idea for you to have an abortion.

556
00:36:59,728 --> 00:37:00,346
Thank you.

557
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,819
The lastest on the
hijackers at the Royal Mint...

558
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,011
They're not leaving, huh?

559
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:22,443
Those people...

560
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:24,960
must be desperate to do
something like that, right?

561
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,520
That's what makes them so dangerous.

562
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:29,811
Yeah, but they don't want to hurt anyone.

563
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,226
Well, that's what they're saying.

564
00:37:33,764 --> 00:37:36,371
Then they wouldn't
carry guns, would they?

565
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:38,827
Of course, I guess you're right.

566
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:43,870
On the other hand, no one gets to
rob the Royal Mint with a slingshot.

567
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,760
The assailants were surprised by a patrol

568
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,960
while they were trying
to escape with bags of money

569
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,880
and they shot
the two officers who tried to...

570
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,140
The check, please.

571
00:37:57,979 --> 00:38:01,591
And...? Do you know how many there are?

572
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,680
Because some say there are seven.

573
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,680
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

574
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,331
Yes?

575
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:16,142
Raquel, the kid was at the museum.

576
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,483
When was that?

577
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:19,424
Three months ago.

578
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:21,563
Cameras got them during a tour.

579
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,379
Was he alone?

580
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,808
No, no. You were right,
he was with someone.

581
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,779
Listen, we've identified
another hijacker.

582
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:32,131
I'm sending the
picture to you right now.

583
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,800
Ah!

584
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:51,040
- Where is it?
- What are you talking about?

585
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:54,613
- Where is the recorder?
- But what recorder?

586
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:56,735
It's just a coincidence
that you're here every day

587
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,560
- asking questions, right.
- I don't know...

588
00:38:58,585 --> 00:38:59,643
What media outlet are you from?

589
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:01,584
What fucking media
outlet are you with?

590
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,710
I'm not a reporter, my
name is Salvador Martín.

591
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:05,520
- Please look my wallet. Right, Antonio.
- What's going on, sir?

592
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,162
Please.

593
00:39:06,498 --> 00:39:08,403
I know him, he
comes here every day.

594
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:39,436
You need money for the kid, don't you?

595
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,050
- Yes.
- No, no...

596
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:43,882
Yes. Listen, we're in
the middle of a heist.

597
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:46,143
You can get
something for yourself.

598
00:39:46,696 --> 00:39:47,840
No, really.

599
00:39:52,994 --> 00:39:54,619
Go ahead and hide this in your bra.

600
00:39:54,905 --> 00:39:57,120
20,000 bucks, enough to get the kid diapers

601
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,867
- until he graduates.
- Thanks.

602
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:02,744
It's not that, really.
I appreciate it, but...

603
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,316
Give me the pill
and I'll get back there.

604
00:40:09,346 --> 00:40:10,000
Alright.

605
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:16,777
Then what is it?

606
00:40:19,522 --> 00:40:21,237
- That he'll fuck up your life.
- Who?

607
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:22,392
Your son.

608
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:24,636
Better to have your life
fucked up by your son

609
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:26,848
than any of these
motherfuckers, or me.

610
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:29,596
- I don't see how...
- The life you choose is the life you lead.

611
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:31,840
One day you're at work,
minding your own business,

612
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,546
and assholes show up here just like Dali,

613
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:38,695
then one of those guys loses it, a
bullet flies, and everything goes to hell.

614
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,280
That... fucks your life up.

615
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:45,684
Not a kid.

616
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:49,604
What do you know about
what fucks me up? Nothing.

617
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:54,200
My mom was gonna abort me.

618
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:56,474
It's just...

619
00:40:57,484 --> 00:41:00,197
She inhaled the heroin she
was gonna sell to pay for it all.

620
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,120
And in some shitty alleyway
she was caught by the police.

621
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,040
and with the drugs and jail
and the police and all, I was born.

622
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,827
What about you?

623
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,646
Because it seems like
this job isn't very exciting,

624
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,580
and when you leave,
it's not that great, either.

625
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:19,137
What is it?

626
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:20,942
- Do you do kilates?
- Pilates...

627
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:23,227
Well that's even better then.
And Friday night drinks, right.

628
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:24,247
What a fucking drag,

629
00:41:24,372 --> 00:41:25,774
another plan ruined by the kid.

630
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:27,095
But who do you go out with?

631
00:41:27,497 --> 00:41:28,769
Where are your friends?
You want to know?

632
00:41:29,707 --> 00:41:31,517
At their homes, with their kids.

633
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:32,592
Are they fucked up?

634
00:41:33,775 --> 00:41:34,600
No, right?

635
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,244
What do you do that's so crazy
that you can't do it with a child?

636
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:44,716
Look, if the father is stupid
enough to lose all of this, then fine.

637
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:46,600
All that kid's love can be for you.

638
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:49,241
What are you doing?

639
00:41:51,768 --> 00:41:53,528
I'm giving her the abortion pill.

640
00:41:57,562 --> 00:41:58,376
What's wrong?

641
00:42:00,002 --> 00:42:02,400
She needs you to help her put
it in her mouth with some water?

642
00:42:02,435 --> 00:42:04,035
An abortion is a private thing.

643
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,346
It's for a woman to decide,
but not in here in public.

644
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,027
Anyways...

645
00:42:12,757 --> 00:42:14,861
I'll think about it
til we get out of here.

646
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,920
Very good news.

647
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,250
I'm glad you want to carry on
with the pregnancy. Really.

648
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,400
Now go back to the office with the rest.

649
00:43:37,465 --> 00:43:39,315
You were just at a bachelor party?

650
00:43:41,412 --> 00:43:42,492
Or on your way?

651
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,360
That wasn't the first time
that Berlin put his hands

652
00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:52,120
inside the panties of an honest woman,

653
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,517
though that was the first time
he took them out so quickly.

654
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,137
Perhaps Mónica was hoping he
would get carried away by instinct

655
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:02,443
and forget about that phone
that rang between her legs,

656
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:04,603
but that was not the case.

657
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,760
Denver.

658
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:15,866
What's going to happen to our authority
when she tells all the others?

659
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:18,758
Because even Berlin

660
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,093
could tell the difference
between pleasure and duty.

661
00:44:23,052 --> 00:44:23,956
Kill her.

662
00:44:26,092 --> 00:44:26,954
And be quick

663
00:45:01,476 --> 00:45:02,602
Let's see.

664
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,681
For the first time

665
00:45:39,705 --> 00:45:41,930
I realised that in
all my love affairs,

666
00:45:41,985 --> 00:45:43,000
there was one flaw.

667
00:45:44,347 --> 00:45:46,080
I was the one being taken care.

668
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:50,851
But this time would be different.

669
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:06,080
What's happening? Tokyo, Tokyo!

670
00:46:06,345 --> 00:46:07,267
Go, get Berlin.

671
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:35,872
No!

672
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,792
Listen to me.

673
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:48,692
If anyone lays a hand
him again, I swear to God

674
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:50,837
that the next bullet
will be for Helsinki,

675
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:53,087
for Berlin or for you.

676
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:57,280
You're out there, free,

677
00:46:57,471 --> 00:46:59,087
we are risking our fucking lives

678
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:01,135
inside this rat trap,
don't you get that.

679
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,410
I suggest you put your
weapon on the table.

680
00:47:03,645 --> 00:47:04,379
Put it down.

681
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,423
Put the fucking gun on the table.

682
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:09,684
Helsinki, stay out of this.

683
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,819
What the hell is going on?

684
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:14,700
Helsinki.

685
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:21,083
Helsinki.

686
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:23,470
Put the gun down.

687
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:26,611
No!

688
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,227
No!

689
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:32,200
Don't do it, please.

690
00:47:32,418 --> 00:47:34,595
Why did you have to grab
that fucking cellphone?

691
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,960
Why the fuck did you have to fool me?

692
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,000
Rio, no!

693
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:44,544
Where do you think you're going?

694
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:46,380
You've done enough for today.

695
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:48,288
Helsinki.

696
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,500
Put it down. Do it.

697
00:47:57,726 --> 00:47:59,704
You know what will
happen if I don't kill you?

698
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:00,701
No.

699
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:04,070
They're gonna kill me first.

700
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,010
And then they're gonna kill you.

701
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:08,682
And now what?

702
00:48:12,368 --> 00:48:14,536
I couldn't even hear
what I was yelling,

703
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,998
I just wanted to write
a fucking love letter.

704
00:48:17,365 --> 00:48:19,642
While shotguns and
knives were pointed at me,

705
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:22,006
reality bit like a
like a hungry wolf

706
00:48:22,385 --> 00:48:25,459
and I knew that those the five months
where I believed in something

707
00:48:25,577 --> 00:48:26,428
came to an end.

708
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,676
Your love story has sent
our escape plan to hell.

709
00:48:31,402 --> 00:48:32,442
They have you.

710
00:48:32,593 --> 00:48:33,663
And they also have Rio.

711
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,280
The police know who you are.

712
00:48:43,341 --> 00:48:45,101
You're all over the news.

713
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,299
Holy fucking shit.

714
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:08,973
Fuck, come on, do it.

715
00:49:11,327 --> 00:49:12,487
Come on, man.

716
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,620
Come on, man.

717
00:49:21,674 --> 00:49:22,659
On your knees.

718
00:49:24,716 --> 00:49:25,716
No.

719
00:49:27,095 --> 00:49:28,275
Don't look at me.

720
00:49:30,649 --> 00:49:31,898
Don't look at me.

721
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:34,191
- Please.
- Don't look at my fucking face.

722
00:49:34,216 --> 00:49:36,160
Don't look at my fucking face.
