1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:06,041
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:09,253
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,256
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,009
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,131
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,972
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,518
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats</i>

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,690
<i>and I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,276
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,854
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,406
Each of these heat scans
indicates a human body.

12
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,324
Twelve markers, twelve metas.

13
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,698
They identified the target
sooner than we planned.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,570
Perhaps.

15
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,624
There's nothing within miles of here
capable of even creating dark matter.

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,916
There was three weeks ago.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,705
<i>This is where I came
out of the Speed Force.</i>

18
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,415
And a wave of dark matter
washed out with you.

19
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,833
You think the guy
behind the Samurai robots...

20
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:52,963
Samuroid.

21
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,760
He wanted us to create
a busload of metas.

22
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,962
I think it's all connected.

23
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,427
Hello, gorgeous.

24
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,470
<i>You ready to get your schmoopy on?</i>

25
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,014
Joe, I'm pregnant.

26
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,147
Look, I was thinking.

27
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,528
No, no, less thinking, more kissing.

28
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,070
Okay, but hold on a minute.

29
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,746
This thing we got going on,
this is real good.

30
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,957
- It's okay.
- What?

31
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,625
I'm just kidding, it's better than okay.

32
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,248
Yeah, that's right,
it's better than okay.

33
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,502
And because of that, I think
we're at a place in our relationship

34
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,252
where the guy says to his girl,
those three magic words.

35
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,258
What three words?

36
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,432
What's your name?

37
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,727
Um... Oh.

38
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,396
Well, that is technically four words.

39
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,269
Actually, technically, it's three words

40
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,021
'cause contractions are one word,
it's how grammar works.

41
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,525
That's not the point, though.
What's your name?

42
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,486
Gypsy. My name is Gypsy.

43
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,614
For real? You were born and somebody
was like, "I'm gonna name you Gypsy"?

44
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,696
Gypsy is what I like to be called.

45
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,826
It is mysterious and it's moody.

46
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,578
Hmm. Moody's right.

47
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,658
All right.

48
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,203
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
and when I get back,

49
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,289
you better stop asking me my real name.

50
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,506
And be wearing less clothes.

51
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,002
I don't need to know your name.

52
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,637
<i>This girl
She 'bout to rock your world</i>

53
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,065
You're a dead man.

54
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,983
Those were collectibles!

55
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,793
Who are you?

56
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,621
Daddy!

57
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,750
Pleased to meet you, sir.

58
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,754
Is he gonna put me down?

59
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,138
You know, some of you may not realize,
but before I was mayor,

60
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,394
I was a cop in this very precinct.

61
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,231
And it's because of these men and women,

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,904
every family in Central City
can sleep comfortably at night.

63
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,106
What's happening?

64
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,942
Mayor Bellows is on his
reelection campaign.

65
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,195
...Detective Joe West.

66
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,575
Keep up the good work.
What do you say, Joe?

67
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,086
I'll do that.

68
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,960
And that's why he's not a politician.

69
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,503
I hate that.

70
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,585
Yeah? How about running against him?

71
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,046
Can you picture yourself
shaking hands and kissing babies?

72
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,130
What?

73
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,261
- Ain't nobody talking about babies.
- I was...

74
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,344
You said you had a lead
on this meta bus situation.

75
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,804
Yeah, I do.

76
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,559
<i>Bellow for Bellows!</i>

77
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,272
You took the photos down
from your mother's case.

78
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,695
Yeah, well, the case was solved.
This one isn't.

79
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,857
<i>We got these two, Kilg%re and Hazard.</i>

80
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,319
But that still leaves 10 meta-humans

81
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,367
that were created
when I came out of the Speed Force.

82
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,288
How hard can it be to track down
ten bus passengers?

83
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,491
Well, according to
the Department of Transportation,

84
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,952
over 900 people rode that bus that day.

85
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,081
What about the bus driver?

86
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,875
That's where things
get more interesting.

87
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,049
He's dead. Drowned. In his own bathtub.

88
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,801
That's not too suspicious.

89
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,970
Harry said it was all connected,
I think he's right.

90
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,889
The Samuroid pushing you guys
to bring me back,

91
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,262
and me not coming out at the place
that you thought I would,

92
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,845
the bus being at the exact right place
to be hit by dark matter...

93
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,815
- It was planned.
- Yeah, by somebody smart.

94
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,651
- We're pretty smart.
- Well, I think so.

95
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,400
Okay, let's look closer
into the bus driver's death,

96
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,480
it may give us a lead.

97
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,941
I'll have Iris pull up the autopsy
report from the coroner's office.

98
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,950
Sounds good.

99
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,820
What?

100
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,124
I don't know, this morning,
you're like...

101
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,084
Glowing.

102
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,665
What do you mean, "glowing"?

103
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,746
I just mean, like,

104
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,878
you got like a warmth about you,
like a Lite-Brite.

105
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,386
There's no warmth, no glow,
and I ain't no damn Lite-Brite.

106
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,963
You're wasting time. S.T.A.R. Labs.

107
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,674
Glowing and irritable.

108
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,096
How's Cecile?

109
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,934
Fine. Same. I mean, nothing's changed.
If something changes, I'll let you know.

110
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,358
All right.

111
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,575
This facility is poorly guarded.

112
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,401
Clearly.

113
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,538
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

114
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,458
Okay, power down, Buckaroo.

115
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,160
Good. You're both here.

116
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,290
Cisco, who is this?

117
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:42,166
This is Breacher, AKA Gypsy's father.

118
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,591
Oh.

119
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,261
Yeah, I can see the resemblance.

120
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,054
There is no resemblance.

121
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,508
So, you know how Gypsy's kind of
a big deal collector on Earth-19?

122
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,764
Well, her boss is her dad.

123
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,439
Who decided to pay us
a surprise visit at the <i>perfect</i> time,

124
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,983
which is why I decided
to show him around,

125
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,059
where I work, you know.

126
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,439
I'm Barry Allen.

127
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,112
Cisco's personal assistant.

128
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,230
His what?

129
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,032
And he is the best personal assistant
I've ever had,

130
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,405
stays late, starts early.

131
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,532
- One day, I'll be working for him.
- What are you doing?

132
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,488
I wanted to impress him,
and now, I can't stop.

133
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,906
Joe West.

134
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,912
A fellow law man.

135
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,710
You, I can respect.

136
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,163
And Harry Wells, back there.

137
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,299
You look like someone I once sent
my daughter to kill.

138
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,255
I get that a lot.

139
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,263
I thought maybe someone would
want to give him the old look-see.

140
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,217
Great idea, Allen, Detective West,

141
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,770
why don't you give Gypsy's father here
the nickel tour of the facilities?

142
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,179
Joe.

143
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,600
I've had to pee for, like, three hours.

144
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,106
- What is wrong with you?
- Have you seen his face.

145
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,819
The guy's killed people with that face.

146
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,993
I'm not even joking.
Gypsy said that literally happened.

147
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,694
- You want his approval, right?
- Yes, I want his approval.

148
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,778
He's my girlfriend's father.

149
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,034
Of course, Cisco, listen,

150
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,707
you're a fine upstanding, smart,
well-groomed young man.

151
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,911
Any father would be happy to have
you date his daughter except me.

152
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,454
Can't date my daughter, right?

153
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,039
Can't date Jesse, Jesse's off-limits.

154
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,749
Went for the compliment,
didn't stick the landing.

155
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,460
Just take him for coffee, okay?

156
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,386
Go for coffee,
get to know him a little bit better.

157
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,760
I bet
that you'll be pleasantly surprised

158
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,057
at how much you have in common, right?

159
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,967
You both have the same powers,
you're breachers,

160
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,644
you have ridiculous hair,
he has ridiculous hair.

161
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,643
- Okay, but...
- And you both love Gypsy.

162
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,143
Are you actually giving me
decent relationship advice right now?

163
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,727
I am. You'll be fine.

164
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,816
I don't want to be here anymore.

165
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,616
And we're leaving.

166
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,283
- Help me.
- Have fun storming the castle.

167
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,451
Why is the scariest person
I have ever seen roaming our halls?

168
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,534
Cisco.

169
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,001
Okay, so, I've got the coroner's report
for the death of the bus driver,

170
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,050
but it doesn't seem like
there's any signs of foul play.

171
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,376
Aside for him being the one guy

172
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,052
that could've told us
who else was on that bus.

173
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,471
They logged his personal effects,
let's see.

174
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,674
Credit cards, cash, receipts. Um...

175
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,092
Wait, go back.

176
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,520
- Ralph Dibny.
- I'll be damned.

177
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,310
<i>Who is Ralph Dibny?</i>

178
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,523
He used to be a cop.

179
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,234
Dirty cop. Got kicked off the force.

180
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,440
- For what?
- It's a long story.

181
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,323
- That's him.
<i>- Oh.</i>

182
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,498
He's handsome in a square-jawed,
Oliver Queen kind of way.

183
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,573
For real?

184
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,876
Babe, you know
I've only got eyes for you.

185
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,206
The IOU is dated the same day
that I came out of the Speed Force.

186
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,292
You think Dibny was on the bus that day?
Maybe he's a meta-human now?

187
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,547
Let's pay him a visit.

188
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,338
Hey, you seem... Something.

189
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,139
What's up with you and this Ralph guy?

190
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,342
It's like Joe said, it's a long story.

191
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,187
- Oliver Queen is hot.
- Amen and hallelujah.

192
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,850
<i>I promised there wasn't
a single case I couldn't crack.</i>

193
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,902
<i>And a promise made is a promise kept.</i>

194
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,106
Dibny detects.

195
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,534
Your husband didn't die
in that plane crash, Mrs. Broome.

196
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,986
He didn't? Then where is he?

197
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,823
Well, that brings us
to the difficult part.

198
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,617
Turns out he got remarried,
and moved to Minnesota.

199
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,835
Has two kids now, twins.

200
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,295
Twins in the Twin Cities.

201
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,300
Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey...

202
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,972
No, don't... Don't cry for that jerk.

203
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,853
He doesn't deserve it.
The sun still shines.

204
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,851
The birds, they still chirp.

205
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,937
Chirp, chirp.

206
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:33,067
Mrs. Broome,
you are a very attractive woman,

207
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,194
and you will find someone else.

208
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,366
Someone who will hold you,

209
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,530
someone who will wipe away those tears.

210
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,165
Do you like shrimp?

211
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,255
This is definitely his place.

212
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,056
Reconsidered, huh?

213
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,892
<i>- Ralph.</i>
- Joe West.

214
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:14,020
Barry Allen. Been a long time, rookie.

215
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,152
Well, I'm not a rookie anymore, Dibny.

216
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,449
You look healthy.

217
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:22,529
Yeah. Got the spare tire
out of the trunk. It happens.

218
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,122
<i>Might even happen to you, too,
one day, Slim Jim.</i>

219
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,291
So, what brings you boys
to <i>Casa de</i> Dibny?

220
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,621
Were you on the 405 bus
four weeks ago, around noon?

221
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,380
That's a very specific question.

222
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,757
<i>We found your IOU</i>

223
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,960
from the deceased
bus drivers' personal effects.

224
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,089
"Deceased"?

225
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,512
Hey. That's one less "U" I owe.

226
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,256
What's it to you two?

227
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,595
It's a simple question,
why don't you just answer it?

228
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,604
You walk into my office after
five years like nothing ever happened,

229
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,101
<i>and ask me for a favor?</i>

230
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,350
I smell a mystery.

231
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,943
It's not a favor, it's information.

232
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,737
And how much is this information worth?

233
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,985
Are you shaking us down?

234
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,817
I know something you don't.

235
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,116
And you need to know it badly.

236
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,869
Otherwise, you'd never
swallow your pride and face me

237
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,200
after what you did.

238
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,785
After what I did?

239
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,040
Ralph.

240
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,498
The people on that bus were exposed
to a dangerous substance.

241
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,790
"Dangerous"?

242
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,672
Dangerous like what? Like... Ebola?

243
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,222
Were you on the bus?

244
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,258
No.

245
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,093
Okay.

246
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,307
Let's go.

247
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,765
Hey, I heard you shacked up
with that hot DA. She got a sister?

248
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,726
Okay.

249
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,403
<i>Good luck. All the best.</i>

250
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,204
So, what's it worth?

251
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,127
Ah, crap.

252
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,339
You don't wanna do this!
I know what you want!

253
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,591
Let's talk about this! Put me down!

254
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,473
Don't put me down! Don't put me down!

255
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,149
- That guy hasn't changed a bit.
- You really expect him to?

256
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,873
Guess he was on that bus.

257
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,055
Hey, guys, what the hell?

258
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,136
Yeah, yeah...

259
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,266
What's happened to me?

260
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,598
- Breathe, okay?
- I'm breathing.

261
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,103
Clearly, this guy is a bus meta.

262
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,776
This is interesting. The dark matter
polymerized Dibny's cells.

263
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,230
What the hell is dark matter
and why is it in my cells?

264
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,441
You're saying the walls of every cell
in his body have elasticized?

265
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,618
It seems they formed an unbreakable
bond at an atomic level,

266
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,445
and now, you can stretch these cells
and stretch these cells.

267
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,201
- Like Silly Putty.
- Like Silly Putty.

268
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,078
- I'm Silly Putty?
- No.

269
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,745
- Kind of.
- I'm Silly Putty?

270
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,914
Ralph, who were the guys on the roof?

271
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,668
Is it really the issue right now?

272
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,874
Look at me!

273
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,340
Allen, you and your S.T.A.R. Labs
nerds better put me back together.

274
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,887
- We're trying to help you.
- You're not trying to help me.

275
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:27,963
Shut up! Oh, my God!

276
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,223
- Give him a second!
- Look at him!

277
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,517
- You're lucky, man. I would...
- Try me. Come on!

278
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,386
You can do this later,
I just need a sample of blood.

279
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,287
Oh... Is that my face?

280
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,832
Four years seeing this stuff,
I finally puked.

281
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,671
Can I plug in?

282
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,968
Daddy.

283
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,271
<i>I know you love me and I love you.</i>

284
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,020
I really like Cisco,
and I need you two to get along.

285
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,522
So, do you think
that you can try to do that?

286
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,729
I'll do anything for you, petal.

287
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,907
Ah! Three coffees.

288
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,864
How about you, huh?
Ready for some hot java?

289
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,950
We don't have coffee on my Earth.

290
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,706
<i>Crops were destroyed,</i>

291
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,416
my world was attacked, invaded,

292
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,918
<i>by the worst,
most evil creatures in the multi-verse.</i>

293
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,249
I'll never drink coffee again.

294
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,713
- Two for me.
- It's okay.

295
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,215
Daddy, why don't I get you a tea?

296
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,637
- Like a relaxing tea?
- Yeah.

297
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,555
- Please. Thanks.
- Okay.

298
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,728
Ah...

299
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,812
I know from a friend
who is also a father,

300
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,109
how important his daughter is to him

301
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,608
and I just wanted to let you know

302
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,984
how important your daughter is to me.

303
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,951
And that after you and I
get to know each other a little,

304
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,362
maybe we might find that...

305
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,119
We're not so different.

306
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,993
I'm going to hunt you.

307
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,416
You're not worthy of her.

308
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,043
Isn't that for her to decide?

309
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,256
Ten.

310
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,886
Also, I could've sworn you said
you were gonna hunt me.

311
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,213
What, like a deer?

312
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,762
I've hunted some of the worst
breach criminals in history.

313
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,559
Maaldor, the Darklord,
Solumga of the Sheeda,

314
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,478
the Sand People of Quarrm.

315
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,272
You will be easy prey.

316
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,352
Nine.

317
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,861
Listen, I have tried
to be polite with you,

318
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,158
but this is going a little too far.

319
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,906
I get that you're overprotective.

320
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,862
- Eight.
- Are you counting?

321
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,538
In the next 24 hours,

322
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,866
I will be hunting you
throughout this city.

323
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,084
We'll not use our powers,

324
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,414
but when it's over,
my daughter will be free of you.

325
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:07,873
Seven.

326
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,424
Do you do this with all her boyfriends?

327
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,418
I hunted her last one, yes.

328
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,502
Where is he now?

329
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,179
- I don't know.
- He got away.

330
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,881
I don't know where you go when you die.

331
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,305
- Five.
- You just skipped six.

332
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,307
I know. Four.

333
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,475
And don't try to breach.

334
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,437
I'll know it if you do.

335
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,397
You can't hide from me.

336
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,899
So, if I were you...

337
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,231
I would start running.

338
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,444
Cisky.

339
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,042
Three, two, one.

340
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,049
Damn. He's hunting him.

341
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,260
I finally calmed him down.

342
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,717
It's amazing what 50 milligrams
of Lorazepam can do

343
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,176
when you get it in aerosol form.

344
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,307
Is there anything you can do
to put him back together?

345
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,229
Please, my stomach can't take much more.

346
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,104
I think I could stabilize his cells
if I had a sample of his DNA

347
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,278
from prior to when he was exposed
to the dark matter on the bus.

348
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,605
Why?

349
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,863
So, he can go out and start hurting
people like our other friends here?

350
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,744
I think we should lock him up
in the Pipeline.

351
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,116
He hasn't done anything.

352
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,322
Yet.

353
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,875
Trust me, I know this guy.
He's a bad guy.

354
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,330
Barry, I took an oath to help people.

355
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,837
I'm a doctor. I can't just
leave him in there like spaghetti.

356
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,501
"Villains"?

357
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,002
Yeah.

358
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,680
Every person that was on that bus
is now a thousand times

359
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,348
more dangerous than they were before.

360
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,424
Dibny included.

361
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,135
- What if he's changed?
- People don't change.

362
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,643
I did. When I became Killer Frost,
you still believed in me.

363
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,018
You're a good person.

364
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,099
He's...

365
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,268
Not.

366
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,854
Barry, how about you and I
go to Dibny's office,

367
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,530
find a DNA sample for Caitlin?

368
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,700
<i>Dad, you go back to CCPD,
see what you can dig up on Dibny.</i>

369
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,993
Yes, boss.

370
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,704
Looks like someone tossed this place.

371
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,788
Yeah.

372
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,374
Probably the same guys
that hung Dibny off the roof.

373
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,629
<i>Why do you think?</i>

374
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,385
I don't know, guy like that,

375
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,259
probably has a long list of people
that want to toss him off rooftops.

376
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,891
Why do you want to?

377
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:26,933
No, seriously.
What happened between the two of you?

378
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,938
It was one of my first cases
when I was a junior CSI.

379
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,190
Dibny was the lead detective.

380
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,112
What case?

381
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,487
A woman named Judy Gimlin
was stabbed to death.

382
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,739
<i>Her husband, Reagan,
was the prime suspect.</i>

383
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,579
But there was no evidence.

384
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,873
Nothing to tie him to the crime scene.

385
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,660
And then, Dibny

386
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,338
miraculously found a knife
with the husband's fingerprints.

387
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,461
<i>Case closed. Dibny was a hero.</i>

388
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,845
I don't know, maybe because my mom
was stabbed, I wanted to be sure.

389
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,341
<i>So, I analyzed the knife.</i>

390
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,140
The serrations on the blade
did not match the wound on the vic.

391
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,434
So, Dibny planted the knife.

392
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,510
Yeah.

393
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,313
And then he lied about it, under oath.

394
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,560
And you busted him?

395
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,187
I mean,
he didn't just bend the rules, Iris,

396
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,644
he committed perjury,
evidence tampering.

397
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,774
He was thrown off the force.

398
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,281
Point is, he was crooked then,
he's crooked now.

399
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,327
Hey, how much DNA
do you think Caitlin needs?

400
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,497
Not much.

401
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,033
Okay.

402
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,249
Oh... Think this'll work?

403
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,587
Hmm.

404
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,126
Barry!

405
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,769
I guess someone hates him
more than you do.

406
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,737
And that's what it feels like
to vibrate through solid matter.

407
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,031
I'm just glad that you two weren't hurt.

408
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,949
No thanks to your new buddy in there.

409
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,526
He's not my buddy, he's my patient.

410
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,361
Caitlin, I just don't understand
why you're defending him.

411
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,162
Because I know what it's like
to suddenly find yourself

412
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,117
with extraordinary powers
and be totally freaked out by it.

413
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,247
And so do you, for that matter.

414
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,503
You and I both woke up in this lab once

415
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,585
<i>knowing that our lives
would never be the same.</i>

416
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,632
<i>So, how about you give the guy
a little sympathy?</i>

417
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,255
- Hey.
- Guys.

418
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,086
I pulled the LUDS on Dibny's phone,

419
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,844
there were 15 phone calls
between him and the mayor's office.

420
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,059
What is Mayor Bellows doing
talking to Ralph Dibny?

421
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,064
Look, it's my good buddy, Barry Allen.

422
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,437
Someone just blew up your office.

423
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,607
Sweet. Insurance claim.

424
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,233
My fiancée and I almost died.

425
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,658
You landed West's daughter?

426
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,111
- Well...
- Wow.

427
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,411
Everything's coming up Allen.

428
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,829
The job, the girl.

429
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,531
Who's trying to kill you, Dibny?

430
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,786
Do you know how many people

431
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,960
I have pissed off
in the last five years?

432
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,707
<i>Angry husbands, angry wives.</i>

433
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,835
Not exactly dealing with high society
taking photos of cheating spouses.

434
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,461
Then why are you talking to the Mayor?

435
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,718
- Who says I am?
- Your phone records.

436
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,135
Did...

437
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,011
Did you get a warrant for that
'cause I know you're all by the book.

438
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,808
What's your business with Mayor Bellows?

439
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,885
Nothing.

440
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,847
Just call and tell him
what a swell job I think he is doing.

441
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,976
Fifteen times.

442
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,483
Twelve of those were butt dials.

443
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,777
All right, look, whatever.
We'll go talk to the Mayor ourselves.

444
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,104
He's a huge fan of Joe's.

445
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,398
- Yeah, you go do that.
- All right.

446
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,573
I'm gonna stay here.

447
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,826
<i>Stretch my legs.</i>

448
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,785
Ramon, do you think it's wise
to be sneaking around

449
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,741
a technologically weaponized facility?

450
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,211
It's a lot safer than what
I'm up against out there. So...

451
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,129
Coffee didn't go well, I take it.

452
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,247
Well...

453
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,797
Gypsy's dad wants to hunt me
for 24 hours

454
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,220
to see if I'm worthy of his daughter.

455
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,470
No powers.

456
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,924
So, don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to do about that.

457
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,099
Fight back.

458
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,223
I swear,
it's like you're trying to listen,

459
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,854
but you just nod while you're
thinking of something else.

460
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,102
You're doing it right now.

461
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,024
Fight back, Ramon. What did you say?

462
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,772
You said no powers?

463
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,978
Yeah, go ahead.

464
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,689
Well, in addition to being Vibe,
you have another superpower.

465
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,524
You're smart, in here, all right?

466
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,860
Outwardly, you're weak, all right?
Too much.

467
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,697
But use your outwardly weak
appearance to your advantage.

468
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,122
He's gonna anticipate a pathetic target.

469
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,079
Well, you're pathetic...
You're pathetic, you're weak.

470
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,330
Not helping, just hurting.

471
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,207
All I'm saying is set a trap, okay?

472
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,414
Beat him at his own game, set a trap.

473
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,296
- Set a trap.
- That's right, a trap.

474
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,382
A trap, I can do.

475
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,339
'Cause he may be the Predator,

476
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,634
but I'm the Schwarzenegger.

477
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,597
<i>Where is he?</i>

478
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,644
He was here.

479
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,192
Yeah, he went that way.

480
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,326
I farted.

481
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,534
I'm not sure everything is still
where it's supposed to be down there.

482
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,369
- Drink this.
- What is it?

483
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,246
I don't just drink stuff.

484
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,089
My body is a temple.

485
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,798
Clearly. Drink it.

486
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,217
I want to know what it is.

487
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,669
It's 17% alcohol.

488
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,048
You should've led with that, sister.

489
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,807
Oh!

490
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:14,966
What was that?

491
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,393
It's a serum of sulfur, zinc oxide,

492
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,971
and steric acid
to cross-link your polymerized cells.

493
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,393
In English.

494
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,564
It's gonna fix you.

495
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,324
You did it! I'm cured!

496
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,400
Well, not cured.

497
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,451
All I did was introduce
a stabilizing enzyme

498
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,827
to reset your body to default shape
through vulcanization.

499
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,829
It's like muscle memory.

500
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,995
Muscle memory, huh? Huh...

501
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,964
How far back memory, you think?

502
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,167
I don't know.

503
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,129
Think about the shape you wanna be
and just be it.

504
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,022
I'm back. I look like a Hemsworth.

505
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,736
- Joseph.
- Thank you for meeting us.

506
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,868
Quick stop on my way to a hospital
ribbon cutting, no problem.

507
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,446
What's with you? You're glowing.

508
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,992
No.

509
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,415
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

510
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,710
Well, how can I help you, gentlemen?
I got a lot on my schedule today.

511
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,662
We won't take up
much of your time, Mr. Mayor.

512
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,088
Do you know a man named Ralph Dibny?

513
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,585
Doesn't ring a bell. Who is he?

514
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,510
He is a former cop
turned private investigator.

515
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,676
I don't think so.

516
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,176
Really? He called your office
over a dozen times.

517
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,183
Oh, I'm gonna have to check
with my secretary.

518
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,060
Anthony, you used to be a cop.

519
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,195
We're not talking to the Mayor here,
it's three cops talking.

520
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:54,654
Whatever cops say to each other,
they don't say to anybody else.

521
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,952
What's going on with you and Dibny?

522
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,989
I...

523
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,910
- Made a mistake.
<i>- "Mistake"?</i>

524
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,163
You mean, like,
the kind of mistake you make

525
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,589
with a woman who's not your wife?

526
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,050
It was only that one time, Joe.

527
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:20,221
I regretted it the moment I did it
and I broke it off right away.

528
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:25,935
And then, Dibny shows up,
and he's got pictures of us.

529
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,860
And he threatens to show them
to my wife unless I pay him.

530
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,983
- How much?
- Not enough.

531
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,568
<i>All those phone calls,</i>

532
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,200
it was him negotiating
for a bigger price.

533
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,070
<i>I love my family, Joe.</i>

534
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,457
Just let me pay him
and I'll be done with it.

535
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,159
No, Mr. Mayor,
you're not gonna have to do that.

536
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,369
We're gonna take care of it.

537
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,041
Joe, Barry, thank you.

538
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,510
So much for Dibny changing.

539
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,724
Dibny's alive and talking. Find him.

540
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,769
- I want those pictures and his head.
- And the cops?

541
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,438
What do I care about the cops?
Waste them.

542
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,728
- Your vitals are fantastic.
- Good.

543
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,605
You're blackmailing the Mayor?

544
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,487
Classic Barry Allen, enters the room
and accuses wildly.

545
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,863
We know about the photos, Ralph.

546
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,319
Bellows told us everything.

547
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,905
Hey, I'm not the one who told him
to step out on his wife.

548
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,500
That's your defense? It's his fault
that you're extorting him.

549
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,078
Isn't that a little easy for you to say?

550
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,461
Your fancy lab, your good job,
and your hot girlfriend.

551
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,839
People like me are just trying
to get from one bill to the next.

552
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,215
And I wouldn't
have to be living like that

553
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,092
if you hadn't cost me my job.

554
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,798
You got yourself fired.

555
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,350
You tampered with evidence,
you framed that guy.

556
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,768
Because he was guilty.

557
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,267
And he was gonna get away
with killing his wife,

558
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,814
and then you let him go.

559
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,234
I was a good cop,
I was a good detective.

560
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,521
I lost everything.

561
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,117
Mayor's got plenty of money,
he can afford to spare a little.

562
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,371
Consider it the pension you cost me.

563
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,172
Good people don't destroy lives
and call it noble.

564
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,885
You were dirty then, you're dirty now.
Live with that.

565
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,847
- You're not going anywhere.
- Get off me.

566
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,314
Are you kidding me?

567
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,689
Thanks for ruining my life twice, Allen.

568
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,079
<i>Cisky.</i>

569
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,048
Show yourself.

570
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,672
No one can avoid me forever.

571
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,179
I'm not going to.

572
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,632
Are you kidding me?

573
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,017
Say goodbye, my little enemy.

574
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,143
What the Sheol?

575
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,945
Guess who's got a hologram?

576
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,115
Ho, ho, ho.

577
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,074
Bet you're wondering
what this is.

578
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:30,077
This is an anti-vibrational force field
with an oscillating power grid.

579
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,875
Good enough for the Reverse-Flash.
Good enough for you.

580
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,040
<i>So, you might as well
wave your white flag</i>

581
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,747
'cause you aren't
getting out of this thing

582
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,424
until the clock strikes Cisco's victory.

583
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,676
Oh, victory.

584
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,503
Feels good.

585
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:48,926
I pulled this from the body
of an Earth-48 hunter-killer.

586
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,306
You can't trap a trapper.

587
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,330
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

588
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,251
I just needed to cool off.

589
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,828
I figured.

590
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:22,091
Dibny seemed to have
gotten under your skin.

591
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,506
Why is it so important
to you that he be the bad guy?

592
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:33,432
When I first started at CCPD,
all I cared about was the rules.

593
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,229
<i>But, you know, these last few years,</i>

594
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,853
<i>we've locked up meta-humans
without a trial,</i>

595
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:41,695
played with time and space,
messed with other worlds.

596
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,109
Yeah, but what does that
have to do with Dibny?

597
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:48,076
Just that everything we've done, we did
because we were trying to help people,

598
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,322
keep them safe.

599
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,028
Hmm.

600
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,575
Is that all Dibny was
trying to do back then?

601
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,251
"Good people don't destroy lives
and call it noble."

602
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,630
Did I make a mistake back then?

603
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,424
Did I cost a good man his life?

604
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:08,963
I don't know, Barr.

605
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,056
<i>He did break the law, cross the line.</i>

606
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,759
You didn't make him do that.

607
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,429
And you didn't make him
blackmail the Mayor.

608
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,473
<i>But maybe Caitlin was right.</i>

609
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,016
Everyone who has gone through

610
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,103
what you and her
and now Dibny has gone through...

611
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,192
<i>Maybe he deserves a second chance.</i>

612
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,317
I got it.

613
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,698
Allen.

614
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,750
Detective West.

615
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,078
Aren't you two on the Mayor's detail?

616
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,043
Sorry to bother you at home,
but dispatch just radioed.

617
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,466
Captain Singh needs you
down at the station ASAP.

618
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,877
All right, let me get my jacket.

619
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,046
Barr!

620
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,193
That never gets old.

621
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,525
Those two work for the Mayor.

622
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,329
- They just tried to kill us.
- Dibny's next.

623
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,166
Cisky, Cisky, Cisky.

624
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,503
Cisky.

625
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,048
Cisky.

626
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,010
<i>Come out.</i>

627
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,133
Come out and meet your end.

628
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,010
Plastoid.

629
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,809
You creatures destroyed my planet.

630
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,939
Now, I will kill every last one of you.

631
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,030
<i>Guys! Anyone there?</i>

632
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,992
Barry, I'm here, it's me!

633
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,167
What's up?

634
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,712
<i>I need you to activate the tracker
I put on Dibny.</i>

635
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,255
You put a tracker on Ralph?

636
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,217
Plastoid.

637
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,169
<i>Cisco, do you know where he is?</i>

638
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,008
<i>He's at City Hall.</i>

639
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,282
You lost weight.

640
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,160
Lap-band surgery.

641
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,204
Since killing you didn't work out...

642
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,286
What we agreed upon, 200K.

643
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,413
Let me have the photographs.

644
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,624
Here's the pictures.

645
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,847
- Keep the money.
- What?

646
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,923
I take it back.

647
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,304
"Take it back"?

648
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,226
I take my blackmail back.

649
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,555
Is this some kind of a trick?

650
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,847
I'm not dirty.

651
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,604
And I don't want
any part in this anymore.

652
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,027
And don't you forget.

653
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,652
I can tie you to that bomb you had
your goons plant in my office,

654
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,031
so, if you don't walk away,
I will go to the cops.

655
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,986
That's still blackmail.

656
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,537
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

657
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,115
You're telling me
if I don't give you this money,

658
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,325
you won't go to the cops.

659
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,034
Okay, fine.

660
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,586
I am blackmailing you
into not being blackmailed.

661
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,214
So, we're good, then?

662
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,625
Yeah, we're good.

663
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,846
Bullet booger. Super gross.

664
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,852
<i>Sorry, Mr. Mayor...</i>

665
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,897
It's over.

666
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,575
Die, Plastoid, die!

667
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:09,709
You will not infest this world
as you did mine, Plastoid!

668
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,630
Plastoid? What? Is he talking to me?

669
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,503
Breacher, stop.

670
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,753
Okay.

671
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,010
He dies, speedster.

672
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,884
Joe, get in there, Joe.

673
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,435
- You're coming with me, come on.
- Flash!

674
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,522
Look, you don't have to do this.

675
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,316
Yes, I do!

676
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,494
Leave him alone.

677
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,086
This guy didn't invade your planet,
he didn't do anything wrong.

678
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,631
He's like this 'cause of me and my team.

679
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,008
So, if you've got a problem
with him and his powers,

680
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,551
then you deal with me.

681
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,138
Hey, are we good here?

682
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,815
Because I definitely
got to change my drawers.

683
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,612
The Mayor took Joe.

684
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,024
I can't run fast enough right now.

685
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,405
I'll never have enough speed
to jump off a building.

686
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,986
Can you breach me up there?

687
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,618
There's no way, the event horizon would
rip the helicopter apart.

688
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,744
<i>We got to save Joe.</i>

689
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,870
What do we do?

690
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:32,996
You can get me up there.

691
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,375
- Me?
- Yeah.

692
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,958
- How?
- You can stretch, grab it!

693
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,759
Are you crazy? I can't do that.

694
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,381
Yes, you can. All right?

695
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:44,136
I know that you have it inside you
to help someone other than yourself.

696
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,466
I know you, Ralph.

697
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,052
How could you possibly know me?

698
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,609
Dude, are you kidding me?

699
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,936
You're the Flash?

700
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,987
Everyone else gets
struck by lightning and dies,

701
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,031
- and you get superpowers?
- Yeah, that's right.

702
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,741
Your assistant's a speedster?

703
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,864
I liked the Flash,
now I have to hate the Flash.

704
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,368
Ralph, focus. I need you to do this.

705
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,700
Joe needs you to do this, please.

706
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,376
Show me I was wrong about you.

707
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,921
You said you were a good cop,
be one, right now.

708
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,528
What the hell?

709
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:40,646
I got it!

710
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,107
Whoa-whoa!

711
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,078
<i>- Help!</i>
- Hold on, Ralph.

712
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,762
Cecile's pregnant.

713
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,294
Well, we've reached the end of our road.

714
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,967
We had some stumbles along the way,

715
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,761
but we pulled it together,
we made it home.

716
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,256
I hate you.

717
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,467
Wow, really thought that one would work.

718
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,426
But I respect you.

719
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,387
You're a steadfast warrior

720
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,690
who would fight the fiercest
of enemies to protect your friend,

721
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,021
and the only person I love.

722
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,727
With my dying breath, sir.

723
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,903
I know that, but I still hate you.

724
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,786
I have never seen him gush like that.

725
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:11,988
That's gushing?

726
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,038
I'm terrified
to experience him loving me.

727
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,245
- Well, that's my job.
- That's right. It is.

728
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:25,426
I feel a code-17 breach in progress.
We have to leave now, Cynthia.

729
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,136
Cynthia? Cynthia?

730
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,550
What's your dad's name?

731
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,968
Josh.

732
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,723
Cynthia and Josh!

733
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,558
<i>That's great.</i>

734
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,393
Not so scary now, Cynthia.

735
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,069
Keep calling me that, see what happens.

736
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,646
All right.

737
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,941
See you around, Gypsy.

738
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,995
- I fixed up your office.
- Sweet fancy Moses!

739
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,790
Thanks for screwing up
my insurance claim.

740
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,165
No payout, no Mayor money,
I got to pick up a case soon.

741
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:44,164
What if I had a job for you?

742
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,498
I want to laugh really hard right now,

743
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,584
but I'm afraid my face
will fall off again.

744
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,761
I can't change what has happened
between us in the past,

745
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:54,090
<i>but I can offer you a chance
to change what happens in our future.</i>

746
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,173
How?

747
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,181
Let my team and I study your powers,

748
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,264
figure out how to improve them,
see what your limitations are.

749
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,811
And let me train you.

750
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,401
Train me? For what?

751
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,735
To do what I do.

752
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,607
To be a detective again, Ralph.

753
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:12,862
<i>A real one.</i>

754
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,319
<i>Look, it's not gonna be easy,
I'm gonna push you to your limit.</i>

755
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,496
It's safe to say some days,
you're gonna hate me.

756
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,915
Allen, it's safe to say
that I always hate you.

757
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,619
Do I get a cool superhero name?

758
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,421
What do you think about Plastic Man?

759
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,207
I think that's the dumbest name
I've ever heard.

760
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,837
It's Cisco who comes up with the names.

761
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,214
Yeah, it's better that way.

762
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,419
What do you say?

763
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,520
There's just one thing I got to ask you.

764
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,604
What made you look into Mayor Bellows
in the first place?

765
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,155
It was a client who
asked me to follow the Mayor.

766
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,233
Never met him, though,
he did everything over the phone.

767
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,317
Who was it?

768
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,198
Only gave me his last name.

769
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:58,829
DeVoe.

770
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,408
<i>You and I have been
enemies for years.</i>

771
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,414
You've had others, of course.

772
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,420
There's Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe.

773
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:10,625
This is where we came up
with the cerebral inhibitor

774
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,463
to use against DeVoe.

775
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,056
What's wrong?
The name "DeVoe" mean something to you?

776
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,845
I smell a mystery.

777
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:30,869
