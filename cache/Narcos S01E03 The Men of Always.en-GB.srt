00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,405
A PAISA ROBIN HOOD

2
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,245
My name is everywhere.

3
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,668
Newspapers …

4
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,463
magazines …

5
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:23,055
Everyone is talking about
the “Paisa Robin Hood.”

6
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,932
Pablito, I’m sorry. If I had known that--

7
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:27,309
You’re going to have
to pay for that, my love.

8
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,312
Anything you want, Pablito.

9
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,356
Anything I want?

10
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,817
Yes, my love, whatever you want.

11
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,443
You sure?

12
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,921
Then …

13
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,219
you’re going to help me
get into Congress.

14
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,681
Yes, Pablo.

15
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,142
Yes.

16
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,532
Those shitty oligarchs …

17
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,828
those people, all of their lives …

18
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,209
don’t know what it’s like to wonder
where their next meal is coming from.

19
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,839
I come from nothing, Valeria …

20
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,052
and I have more money
than any of those sons of bitches.

21
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:47,014
If you run for Congress, you put yourself
in the public eye, you become a target.

22
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:52,436
“I made my money from taxis” isn’t going
to work when you face the press.

23
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,357
Pablo, you need a party that supports you.

24
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,569
You need a proper political campaign.

25
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,906
I buy the press, my love.

26
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,742
And as far as a political party,

27
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,494
I am quite sure
that I can buy one of those as well.

28
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,414
I don’t want to be good.

29
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,753
I am going to be great.

30
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,004
A PAISA ROBIN HOOD

31
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,314
WELCOME TO THE PABLO ESCOBAR
NEIGHBOURHOOD

32
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,731
A PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT

33
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,934
I should have gotten
into the taxi business. Holy cow …

34
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:16,228
—Valeria, how are you doing?
—Well, thank you.

35
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,729
Mr Duque …

36
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,150
It gives me great pleasure to invite you
to the Hacienda Nápoles.

37
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,776
—Nice to meet you.
—Please, come.

38
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,778
After you, Valeria.

39
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,907
Please.

40
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:35,122
Look, I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

41
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,125
And for that reason, I think that …

42
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,461
Well, I think that I understand the people

43
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,755
to whom the New Liberalism
wants to give a voice.

44
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,427
The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say, Mr Escobar.

45
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,639
There is a great deal of talk
about how you have made your money.

46
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,268
I need guarantees
concerning the origins of your fortune.

47
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,565
And Valeria told you …
how much I am going to donate?

48
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,567
—No, no--
—Look, I am not a politician.

49
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,572
I am not a successful lawyer like you.
I come from the street … brother.

50
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,784
I want to reassure you
that you will receive your piece.

51
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,204
—It’s not about that--
—Assuming your piece is ten percent,

52
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,747
your piece would be what?

53
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,291
Three hundred thousand dollars
just for you.

54
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,631
Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee
for the Justice Minister or what?

55
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,134
—Most definitely.
—All right, then.

56
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,053
Let’s go look at the hippos. Come on.

57
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,390
Blackie.

58
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,184
Pablo?

59
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,397
—And what about me?
—What about you?

60
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,316
I don’t get my piece?

61
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,236
No, my queen. The thing is that you …

62
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,697
you’re in this for love, right?

63
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,160
Look, Minister …

64
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,081
Escobar has founded schools, clinics.

65
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,500
He has created sources of employment
throughout Medellín.

66
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,169
The people love him,
and he loves the people.

67
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,964
And from a legal point of view,
his money is clean.

68
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,759
And according to Forbes Magazine,
he’s a drug trafficker.

69
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:15,013
Are you going to believe all of that
American imperialist propaganda?

70
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,098
Take a look.

71
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,273
These are property holdings papers.

72
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,607
Look.

73
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,279
He’s the owner of hundreds of properties
in Colombia and also the United States.

74
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,491
In addition,
this man has no criminal record.

75
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,952
If there was,
there would be proof of his background.

76
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,334
How much is he paying you?

77
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,212
I am thinking about our party, Minister.

78
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,842
Escobar is prepared to contribute
millions of dollars.

79
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,430
We already support Jairo Ortega
so that he can campaign in Antioquia.

80
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:59,141
Let’s let Escobar be his alternate.

81
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,811
What do you prefer …
rumours and insinuations,

82
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,272
or fewer representatives in Congress?

83
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,250
Who is the gringa?

84
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,960
A child of God, just like you.

85
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:51,836
Got it.

86
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,888
Let’s see, you are here for a cat?

87
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,890
This isn’t just any cat.

88
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,476
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.

89
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,856
And what you want
is for me to find a cat killer.

90
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,236
It was the narcos, Suárez.
We don’t take this shit lightly.

91
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,406
Your friend is a little crazy.

92
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,285
I don’t speak English.

93
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,831
Get me some information, Suárez.

94
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,667
Look, I don’t have enough people

95
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,753
to go through hundreds of hours
of chatter over a fucking cat.

96
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,631
If this was information
about the narcos, yes.

97
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,549
My people are interested.

98
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,343
But they won’t give a fuck about the cat.

99
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:47,184
But if you want to put
all my people to work

100
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,980
to find out who killed the fucking cat,
that is going to cost you more.

101
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,109
They broke into the house to kill his cat.

102
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,779
I think they made him
when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.

103
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,072
Find out.

104
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,131
This gentleman is an employee of
the American Embassy in our country,

105
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:22,135
and he assures me that you gave out his
personal information to certain criminals.

106
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,596
That’s not true.

107
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,141
These guys killed his cat.

108
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,395
Maybe you don’t know this,
but the mistreatment of animals

109
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,812
is a federal crime.

110
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,440
Is this funny to you?

111
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:40,820
They can bring formal charges against you,
and you could lose your job.

112
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,699
Do you not need your job, Santiago?

113
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,950
Yes, I need it.

114
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,256
Mr Murphy, do you recognize these men?

115
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,931
—What?
—May I?

116
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,975
You both are being
accused of conspiring

117
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,062
against a federal agent
of the United States.

118
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:18,858
The cat is under the jurisdiction
of the American government.

119
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,653
And to kill it is the same
as to kill a police dog.

120
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,491
This is absurd.

121
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,622
Look, I’m a Colombian citizen,
and I know exactly my--

122
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,874
You will not disrespect them!

123
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,669
Is that clear?

124
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:43,508
If I open my mouth, they kill me,
and they kill my wife.

125
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,010
He’s having problems with his wife.

126
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,095
Shut up!

127
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,223
—Imbecile.
—OK, gentlemen.

128
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,726
This is quite simple.

129
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:00,150
I can get the phone number of the person
to whom you sent those documents,

130
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,904
and I can tell him that you accused him
of being the cat killer.

131
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,490
How does that sound?

132
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:17,751
I sent a copy of that passport
to a man they call …

133
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:20,629
“Poison.”

134
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,550
OK, Poison.

135
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,846
You’re going to take this money
to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.

136
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,722
And this is the address.

137
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,141
If they stop you on the road,
just salute the official,

138
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,686
give them a little bribe
and continue forward.

139
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,729
No violence.

140
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,731
And you call me every two hours.

141
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:42,108
—Of course, boss. Whatever you say.
—OK, then. No showing off.

142
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,653
No showing off!

143
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,323
—Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.
—Got it.

144
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,494
What the fuck are you doing?

145
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,246
Getting ready, right?

146
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,000
You are meeting up with politicians,
not with gangsters.

147
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,129
Aren’t they the same thing, boss?

148
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,175
Politicians scare easily.

149
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,260
You’re fine with just a pistol.

150
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,638
Go to it, then. Go to it, dumbass.

151
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,792
Hey, hey, hey, hold on. Sixty-five?

152
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,334
Sixty-five.

153
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,545
Hey, brother, that’s a lot.

154
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,255
You sure?

155
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,925
I counted every single son of a bitch.

156
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,551
All right!

157
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,220
Sure, but are you counting
what happened last night?

158
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,014
Of course, that was number sixty-five.

159
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,643
Don’t bullshit.
I was the one who shot that faggot.

160
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,479
—Bullshit.
—Bullshit …

161
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,355
if I was the one
who killed that little man.

162
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,776
You only shot him
once he was already on the ground, dead.

163
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,653
I shot him first.

164
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,451
Come in.

165
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,871
Did you give information about Poison
to the DEA?

166
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,164
So?

167
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,625
I’m still listening
to their phone conversations

168
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,585
and it’s not a shipment of drugs.

169
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,379
They’re carrying three million dollars
to Bogotá,

170
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,007
and if two guys from the DEA
stop that car,

171
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,800
Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.

172
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:20,517
—You don’t have 65, Poi.
—Yes, I do.

173
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,857
What are you doing, Gonorrhœa‽

174
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,192
Look, 65, man!

175
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,239
Now we’re going
to have to wash the car, man!

176
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,534
Son of a bitch.

177
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:39,744
Yes?

178
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,371
Hi, Pablo.
I have good news for you.

179
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,915
I’m going to help you
avoid an enormous loss.

180
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,458
And how much is it going to cost me?

181
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,587
Ten percent.
Three hundred thousand dollars.

182
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,635
How did you find out?

183
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,678
One of your men.

184
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:00,139
That Poison … he talks too much.

185
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,475
You should take his phone away.

186
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,810
Five percent.

187
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,359
Suspicious vehicle approaching.

188
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:25,957
Hello?

189
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,500
Poison?

190
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,461
You bring your fucking mouth
back here immediately!

191
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,090
—Yes. I’m sorry, boss.
—Now!

192
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,510
The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

193
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:42,015
—These fags.
—You have a very big mouth, Poison.

194
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,683
Pablo is really pissed off.

195
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,812
Shut that mug, or you will never reach 66,
you hear?

196
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,476
He has been called the “Paisa Robin Hood,”
but he is much more than that.

197
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,979
He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal.

198
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,354
All of us.

199
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:56,380
I am tired … of the people with power
running this country.

200
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:02,595
This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people, weak people.

201
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,474
And this fight must begin here.

202
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:15,650
To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

203
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,027
If I am elected …

204
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,531
if my friend, Jairo, is elected …

205
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,660
those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

206
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:31,791
Those who are hungry will have food.

207
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,294
Those who want to learn will have schools.

208
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,006
And those who have dreams

209
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,677
will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

210
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:48,266
In me, you have a friend
whom you have always had,

211
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,978
the friend of today, the friend
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.

212
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,357
Thank you very much.

213
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,029
Thank you very much.

214
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,205
My friend, Jairo Ortega!

215
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,300
Thank you very much.

216
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,768
—You were marvellous, my love.
—Sure?

217
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:32,977
Yes.

218
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,062
Very good, Pablo.

219
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,815
There are a few things we can improve,
but we’ll work on them.

220
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:38,816
OK, whatever you say.

221
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,694
—Congratulations.
—Thank you so much, Valeria.

222
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,029
Congratulations, ma’am.

223
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,365
Excuse me.

224
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:01,547
To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

225
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,097
What’s wrong?

226
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,853
Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

227
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,105
What are you talking about?

228
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:22,026
—Valeria Velez.
—My love …

229
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,656
She’s a newspaper woman,
a reporter, who follows the news.

230
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,533
And right now, I’m the news.

231
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:35,206
When you win, don’t disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

232
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,042
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

233
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,170
Slowly. Come on.

234
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,005
Let’s go …

235
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,595
You are going to be the First Lady
of this country one of these days.

236
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,766
Therefore, you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

237
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,769
That woman is not on your level, Pablo.

238
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,062
She degrades you.

239
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,815
Please, don’t worry about Valeria.

240
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,113
Pablo!

241
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,782
A car, please!

242
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,036
A car to the hospital, now!

243
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:24,463
You know what, Pablo?

244
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,885
To me, it looks like
you are handling things very badly.

245
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:35,892
You need to start thinking more
about your family … and about business.

246
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,103
Thing is, you can’t be a politician.

247
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,147
Says who?

248
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,403
You can’t go strutting around
giving things to people

249
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,196
simply so they will love you.

250
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,117
We … are bandits.

251
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:02,501
If you run for Congress, find someone else
to manage the laboratories.

252
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,003
Señor Escobar?

253
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,756
Come meet your daughter.

254
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,933
God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo.

255
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,439
How beautiful.

256
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,262
Pablo is out of control.

257
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:00,851
Mother Mary, man.
What do you want us to do?

258
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:05,315
You can’t give Pablo Escobar a spanking
as though he were some spoiled brat.

259
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,607
Oh, no?

260
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:08,609
And why not?

261
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,446
Careful with the threat
you cannot execute.

262
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,869
You know what he’s doing, right?

263
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:23,958
According to Colombian law,
a congressman has total immunity.

264
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:28,254
Do you think he’s protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?

265
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:31,590
I do. He thinks he’s that fucking
“Paisa Robin Hood.”

266
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,759
So what do we do?

267
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,094
Well …

268
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:39,140
we fulfil our duties,
stuffing the ballot box,

269
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:44,270
and later we let Pablo receive
the applause, and take the risk.

270
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:49,817
We continue with our business …
in the shadows, like always.

271
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,863
Carlos, what are the guys saying?

272
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,700
I imagine that they’re worried, right?

273
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,370
They are not politically conscious,
brother.

274
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,543
How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?

275
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,673
You do understand me, brother.

276
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:18,679
Imagine … a state governed by us.

277
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,307
Immunity for everyone, brother.

278
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:25,144
We, Carlos, belong to the people.

279
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:28,481
I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.

280
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,608
If you win,
you don’t need to explain anything.

281
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:34,487
And if you lose …
there’s nothing to explain.

282
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:35,905
I like that.

283
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,492
—Hitler said it.
—Fuck off.

284
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,160
Yes.

285
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,828
He also said that no politician

286
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:46,249
should ever let his picture
be taken in a bathing suit.

287
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,438
Well, that’s what he said.

288
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,026
And if I tell you, Carlos …

289
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,781
that what I want, sincerely …

290
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,201
is to help the poor people
of this country …

291
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,288
do you believe me or what?

292
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:31,895
As soon as the results come out,
Jairo Ortega will resign.

293
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:35,274
I say he’s running toward his death.

294
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,091
—Sixty-six.
—Bullshit. I shot him first.

295
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:23,233
Ladies and gentlemen, with clear use
of my mental and physical faculties …

296
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:27,279
I wish to communicate to you my decision

297
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:31,116
to resign from my seat
in the Congress of the Republic …

298
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,829
for reasons of family and health.

299
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:39,124
But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria

300
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:43,128
is going to continue
our social and political ideas,

301
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:47,090
because Pablo is the voice of the people.
Thank you very much.

302
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,175
Thank you very much, Jairo.

303
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,928
I will give my best effort.
Thank you very much.

304
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:57,226
Oh, unfading glory!
Oh, immortal jubilee!

305
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,947
Congressman Escobar …

306
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,615
Sir!

307
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,283
Excuse me.

308
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,911
Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

309
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:41,246
You cannot enter the hall
if you don’t have a tie.

310
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,459
All right.

311
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,920
—What is your name?
—Juan.

312
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,588
Look, Juan …

313
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,467
that is a really nice tie.

314
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,011
—My girlfriend gave it to me.
—Really?

315
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,428
Yes.

316
00:34:56,512 --> 00:35:00,098
Well, she’s in the history books now.

317
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,768
—Thank you very much, my son.
—Thank you, sir.

318
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,186
—Thank you.
—All right.

319
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,211
Good morning.

320
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:34,132
I inform you we have a quorum
to begin our session.

321
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:42,140
The Minister of Justice, Rodrigo
Lara Bonilla, is present here today

322
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:45,061
to address this honourable Congress.

323
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,731
I give the floor to you, Mr Minister.

324
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,232
Thank you very much.

325
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:59,950
Much has been made
of the issue of drug money,

326
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:05,581
“hot money,”
in our national political process.

327
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:10,544
I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions

328
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:14,339
from the narcotics traffickers
who have bought influence in these halls.

329
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,972
To this charge, I plead guilty.

330
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:28,186
In my eyes, the sin of turning a blind eye

331
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,606
is as great as the sin
of outright corruption.

332
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,401
We are a nation of the blind,
and in our blindness,

333
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,529
we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

334
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,952
It’s time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

335
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:51,710
Congressman Escobar …

336
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:57,091
you stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.

337
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:03,430
This photograph clearly
contradicts your claim.

338
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,725
For this reason,
I demand your resignation.

339
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,978
You are not welcome in this chamber.

340
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,354
You don’t belong here.

341
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,237
Thank you very much, Juan.
Very kind.

342
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,659
What interests the narcos isn’t
just the fall of the Minister of Justice,

343
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:09,663
but also to impede the strategy
of the government to combat his interests.

344
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:13,625
His two arms: silver or lead.

345
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:19,923
I want to inform the people that
the Minister of Justice has 24 hours

346
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:23,802
within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

347
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,847
the day before yesterday
in the Hall of Representatives.

348
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,101
To the contrary, I will proceed
to denounce him legally

349
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:33,979
before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.

350
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:43,363
I am not looking for, nor do I long for a
confrontation before the Colombian people.

351
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,950
I look for peace,
I have always preached peace,

352
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:50,954
and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.

353
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,583
It’s important to realize
that when members of Congress

354
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,711
can be threatened or bought at will,

355
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:02,258
we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.

356
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,426
What are required are honest men,

357
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:51,181
men who are able to put themselves
up against drug traffickers,

358
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:58,147
who with complete tranquility buy or kill
any person or government institution

359
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,023
who is against their interests.

360
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:54,054
Oh, Pablito. We knew
they wouldn’t accept you in that circle.

361
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:58,975
Damned bastards.

362
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:07,776
You’re too good for them, Pablito.

363
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:33,343
This is a fight
that you cannot win, cousin.

364
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,391
You need to think more
about your family and the business …

365
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,937
and abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

366
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,528
I will fix it.

367
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:06,751
Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

368
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:10,130
by Minister Lara and his cronies,

369
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:13,842
I’ve decided to announce my resignation
from Congress of the Republic.

370
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:19,515
I ran as a representative
for the common man,

371
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,476
a voice for those who had no voice,

372
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,937
but that has happened
through much of our history.

373
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:30,275
The powerful have conspired to silence me.

374
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,819
I dreamt of doing good.

375
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:36,323
Those dreams are over.

376
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:43,246
But make no mistake …
I will not go quietly.

377
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,623
I will fight.

378
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,960
“The Men of Always” are mistaken

379
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:53,340
if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!

380
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:05,685
Thank you very much.

381
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:07,122
I brought this for your friend’s wife.

382
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,167
—I hope she likes it.
—No, gracias.

383
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:12,461
You’re fucking crazy, asshole.
