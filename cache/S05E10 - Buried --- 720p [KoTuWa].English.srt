1
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,350
Mariano, it's me.

2
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,350
I need you to get Skyler on the line.

3
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,110
No, no, I need you to get her

4
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,110
on the phone right now.

5
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,470
Tell her it's urgent.

6
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
No-- What do you mean

7
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
she won't get off the phone?

8
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,670
I am giving you permission, Mariano.

9
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,670
You make her get off the phone.

10
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,390
Mariano, who is Skyler

11
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,390
on the phone with?

12
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,440
Yeah.

13
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,910
Okay.

14
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,590
Where is she? Where's Skyler?

15
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,590
She just kind of left.

16
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,030
She didn't say

17
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,030
where she was going.

18
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,830
Skyler, my-- My head is spinning.

19
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,390
And yours, I...

20
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,990
I can't even imagine.

21
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,430
So much makes sense to me now.

22
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,590
You jumping in the pool,

23
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,590
you sending us your kids, I get it.

24
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,420
I just wished I'd seen it sooner.

25
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,310
He's a monster.

26
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,240
He's a...

27
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,190
Look, I don't know what he did to you

28
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,190
to force you to keep his secrets.

29
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,790
If he threatened you,

30
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,790
or whatever mind games he played...

31
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,830
I don't know if there was abuse.

32
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,270
But I want you to know that

33
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,270
you can be open with me.

34
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,470
Don't hold anything back, okay?

35
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,420
I mean, I don't even understand

36
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,420
if you know the full extent of this,

37
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
what he's done.

38
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,470
Not just the meth cooking,

39
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,470
but the lives he's destroyed.

40
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,900
But, look, that's all behind you,

41
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,900
starting now.

42
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,030
You're done being his victim.

43
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,190
Because here's

44
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,190
what we're gonna do.

45
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,120
Sky, here's what we're gonna do.

46
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,470
You and the kids will

47
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,470
move back to our house,

48
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,790
where you'll be safe,

49
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,790
where he can't get to you.

50
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,550
Hank, does Marie...?

51
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,630
No. We'll get to that soon enough.

52
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,750
It's just you and me right now, okay?

53
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,150
Okay.

54
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,030
Before we, um...

55
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,520
Before we get you

56
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,520
back to the house, I...

57
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,030
I'm gonna ask you to tell me

58
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,030
everything you can.

59
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,190
Um, take as long as you like.

60
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,430
Just start from the beginning

61
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,430
when you first became aware

62
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,430
of Walt's activities

63
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,310
and just try to be

64
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,310
as detailed as you can.

65
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,710
What, right-- Right here?

66
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,710
Right now?

67
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,710
Sure. Why not?

68
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,030
While it's still fresh, you know?

69
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,590
And just remember to state your name

70
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,590
and the date before you start.

71
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,430
Hank, do...?

72
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,150
Do we have to do this right now?

73
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,830
No, we don't have to do this

74
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,830
right now, no.

75
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,230
Here's the thing,

76
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,230
I need something solid

77
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,230
that I can bring to my people.

78
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,510
A statement, on the record.

79
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,140
So you testifying to Walt's

80
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,140
criminal activity,

81
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,870
whatever you know,

82
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,870
goes a long, long way here.

83
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,630
Okay? I mean, you see,

84
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,630
building a case this big,

85
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,550
gathering evidence,

86
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,550
enough to get a conviction,

87
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,870
we're talking a long-haul proposition.

88
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,960
I don't want that bastard running out

89
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,960
the clock. But with your testimony--

90
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,390
What do you mean,

91
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,390
running out the clock?

92
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,150
His cancer. His cancer is back.

93
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,830
So he says.

94
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,550
He didn't tell you?

95
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,750
Who's to say it's even true?

96
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,750
Lying piece of shit.

97
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,270
Look, regardless,

98
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,270
I mean, we'll just assume.

99
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,550
Fine. Okay?

100
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,550
That son of a bitch looks me in the eye

101
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,550
and he says if what I know is true-- "If."

102
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,760
--he'll be dead before I can prove it.

103
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,950
The balls on that son of a...

104
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,510
I got all these little pieces.

105
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,510
They're all part of the story.

106
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,430
They don't mean much on their own,

107
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,430
but when you tell me what you know,

108
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,390
we start filling in the gaps,

109
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,390
I'll have him in lockup

110
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,390
before the sun goes down.

111
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,350
Hank, I...

112
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,150
I think maybe...

113
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,990
Maybe I need a lawyer.

114
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,910
What?

115
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,990
No, no, no, you don't.

116
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,720
Yeah, I think maybe I do.

117
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,070
Skyler, understand,

118
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,070
I am here to help you.

119
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,590
But to do that, I need your help.

120
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,800
We start bringing in lawyers

121
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,800
and they start putting up roadblocks

122
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,710
where they don't need to be

123
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,030
and my ability to control

124
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,030
this situation diminishes.

125
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,430
Just for my own protection,

126
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,430
and just...

127
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,550
You know, it seems to make sense

128
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,550
that I should have someone to talk to.

129
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,590
Skyler, I'm your biggest advocate here,

130
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,590
and I'm telling you, for your own good,

131
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,520
you need to get out

132
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,520
ahead of this thing.

133
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,150
I mean, you start, you know,

134
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,150
getting defensive--

135
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,670
I'm not saying it's right,

136
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,670
but I'll tell you it's a fact,

137
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,630
the DA will look at you differently.

138
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,990
But you don't know that.

139
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,990
Skyler, yes, I do.

140
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,670
I've been around long enough to know.

141
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,670
It's in your best interest

142
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,190
to get out there and show the world

143
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,190
you have nothing to hide.

144
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,400
Look,

145
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,070
no one in the world

146
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,070
is more important to me

147
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,350
than your sister.

148
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,200
So believe me when I tell you

149
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,030
that your best interests

150
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,030
and mine are the same.

151
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,910
But, Hank, you telling me

152
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,910
not to talk to a lawyer

153
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,430
doesn't sound like that at all.

154
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,670
It sounds like what you want...

155
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,110
What you want is to get Walt

156
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,720
at all costs.

157
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,670
Okay.

158
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,550
Okay, let's just...

159
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,960
slow down. Slow down.

160
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,910
You can...

161
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,360
You can talk to a lawyer later.

162
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,190
But right now, what we need to do,

163
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,030
we need to go get the kids.

164
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,190
We need to bring them to my house

165
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,190
so that they're safe,

166
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,560
and then we need to help each other

167
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,560
put that animal away, okay?

168
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,630
Come on.

169
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,630
Hank.

170
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,670
Let's go to the house

171
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,670
and we'll deal with it there.

172
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,870
Am I under arrest?

173
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,510
What?

174
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,510
Am I under arrest?

175
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,830
Skyler, I--

176
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,830
You're not thinking straight about this.

177
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,270
You have to listen to me. I--

178
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,270
Skyler. Skyler. Skyler.

179
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,630
Am I under arrest?

180
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,630
No.

181
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,310
Am I under arrest?

182
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,310
No. Sky--

183
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,470
Hank, are you arresting me?

184
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,470
Sky--

185
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,790
Am I under arrest?!

186
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,870
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

187
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,030
I gotta do it, man.

188
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,590
Dude.

189
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,590
Mm.

190
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,070
What are you doing? Huell.

191
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,270
Hey, quit screwing around.

192
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,270
Mm.

193
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,190
We are here to do a job,

194
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,190
not channel Scrooge McDuck.

195
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,510
You hearing me?

196
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,230
I hear you.

197
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,470
Dude.

198
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,640
Aw, screw it.

199
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,230
Mexico.

200
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,670
All's I'm saying.

201
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,310
Guy hit 10 guys in jail

202
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,310
within a two-minute window.

203
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,390
All's I'm saying.

204
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,830
Yeah, it's me again.

205
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,830
Listen, you've got to hide those bags.

206
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,030
The monkey is in

207
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,030
the banana patch, capiche?

208
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,910
So call me.

209
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,430
That's the third message.

210
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,430
Where the hell is that kid?

211
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,110
That's her.

212
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,110
Don't.

213
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,270
I have to talk to her.

214
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,270
You don't.

215
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,950
Answer that phone and Schrader's

216
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,950
on the line with a wiretap

217
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,390
recording everything.

218
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,390
You're not doing anybody any favors.

219
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,910
Why do you still have a battery

220
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,910
in that thing? Take it out.

221
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,750
They might be trying

222
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,750
to triangulate your movements.

223
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,190
I'm not being paranoid. Do it.

224
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,110
I can't believe she went to him.

225
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,110
She just panicked.

226
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,110
She went right to him

227
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,110
without even talking to me.

228
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,630
I'm not saying it's not bad.

229
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,630
It's bad, but it could be worse.

230
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,990
Really? How much worse could it be,

231
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,990
exactly, in your estimation?

232
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,230
What does she actually know?

233
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,230
What has she seen? Hm?

234
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,990
Nothing. It's hearsay.

235
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,990
It's all he said, she said.

236
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,430
The only real evidence that

237
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,430
she can lead them to is your money.

238
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,510
Once we take care of that,

239
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,510
well, yeah, then they got nothing.

240
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,830
Nothing? Hank knows.

241
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,830
That's not nothing.

242
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,470
Yeah. I can't exactly see him

243
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,470
turning the other cheek.

244
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,620
Of course there's always, um...

245
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,720
Always what?

246
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,480
Have you given any thought to,

247
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,480
um, sending him on a trip to Belize?

248
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,470
Belize?

249
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,470
Yeah, Belize.

250
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,470
You know, where, uh...

251
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,990
Where Mike went to,

252
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,990
off on a trip to, uh, Belize.

253
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,950
Saul, you better not be saying

254
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,950
what I think you're saying.

255
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,030
It's just conjecture on my part.

256
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,030
Hank is family.

257
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,790
Okay, it's an option that--

258
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,790
You understand that?

259
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,990
It's an option that has worked well

260
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,990
for you in the past.

261
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,870
Jesus. What is wrong with you?

262
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,870
My mistake. Family, off limits, of course.

263
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,430
I'm just throwing thoughts out there.

264
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,430
This is a safe room, right?

265
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,350
Jesus. Send him to Belize.

266
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,350
I'll send you to Belize.

267
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,520
Finally.

268
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,190
It's about time.

269
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,190
Have you two been followed?

270
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,710
Are you sure?

271
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,710
If they had, we'd all be

272
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,710
in handcuffs right now.

273
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,270
I took the tops off.

274
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,270
Figured you'd wanna check

275
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,270
to make sure it's all there.

276
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,870
You figured right.

277
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,070
Close enough.

278
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,510
If you need any help on the other end...

279
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,510
These things are a bitch to move.

280
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,240
I'll manage.

281
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,240
And we don't mind overtime.

282
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,750
Ain't no thing.

283
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,270
Pay Huell and Kuby

284
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,270
and take your cut.

285
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,390
The rest is mine.

286
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,390
Insurance in case I need you.

287
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,590
In case you need me?

288
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,590
I'm thinking the probability is high.

289
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,240
Just find Jesse.

290
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,990
Keys.

291
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,310
Saul Goodman, please. Skyler White.

292
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,790
No, no, please don't tell me

293
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,790
he isn't there.

294
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
I know he's been avoiding my calls.

295
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,670
All right, well,

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,670
has my husband been there?

297
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,830
What do you mean you don't know?

298
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,830
Either he has or he hasn't. I don't--

299
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,190
Sweetie.

300
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,150
Sky?

301
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,510
Sky, I know you're home.

302
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,150
Let me in. Let me talk to you.

303
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm just gonna wait here

304
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,520
until you open the door.

305
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,870
So let me in now

306
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,870
or three hours from now,

307
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,600
but I'm not leaving until I see you.

308
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,590
Skyler, please.

309
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,360
Just you.

310
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,630
Not Hank.

311
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,630
Tell me Hank is crazy.

312
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,190
Tell me he doesn't know

313
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,190
what he's talking about.

314
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,510
You gotta give me something, Skyler.

315
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,240
Anything to help me understand.

316
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,630
It can't be true.

317
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,670
Oh, my God.

318
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,670
How long have you known?

319
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,470
Hank said that when you walked

320
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,470
into the pool, that's when you knew.

321
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,310
When you had your...

322
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,480
But not then. Before that.

323
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,430
Since Gus Fring?

324
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,350
The money.

325
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,190
All that money that Walt made

326
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,910
when you bought your car wash.

327
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,070
And your whole gambling story.

328
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,880
That was a lie.

329
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,880
I...

330
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,390
Did you know then?

331
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,430
You had to.

332
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,070
Skyler...

333
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,360
did you know

334
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,360
since before Hank was shot?

335
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,270
Skyler?

336
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,430
Marie.

337
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,350
I am so sorry.

338
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,070
You're sorry.

339
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,350
You're...

340
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,270
I'm sick of--

341
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,470
You won't talk.

342
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,750
You won't talk to Hank

343
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,750
because you think that Walt

344
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,750
is going to get away with this.

345
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,120
Oh, God.

346
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,670
Come on, baby. Come on.

347
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,590
Let's go.

348
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,590
Marie. Marie. Hey.

349
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,070
What are you doing?

350
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,070
Hey, what are you doing?

351
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,870
She's coming with us.

352
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,870
No, she is not.

353
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,470
Give her back to me. Marie.

354
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,470
Hank. Hank, help! Hank!

355
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,780
You are not leaving this house

356
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,780
with my daughter.

357
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,550
Give her back to me.

358
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,030
Marie, give her back to me.

359
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,030
Stop it.

360
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,430
You're scaring her.

361
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,790
Give her back.

362
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,790
I'm trying to protect her.

363
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,150
I'm her mother.

364
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,150
She's not gonna live in this madhouse!

365
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,230
You don't know what you're

366
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,230
talking about. Give her back.

367
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,430
Marie.

368
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,430
Listen, I will call the police.

369
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,070
You call them. You call them, Skyler.

370
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,070
I will. Give me my baby.

371
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,700
Marie, put her down.

372
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,700
You can't take her away.

373
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,830
Marie.

374
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,830
Give me my baby.

375
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,710
We are not leaving without her.

376
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,190
Give me my baby now!

377
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,190
Marie!

378
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,880
Do it now.

379
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,670
Give her back.

380
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,230
That's right. It's okay. It's okay.

381
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,990
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

382
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,830
It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

383
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,950
Okay, Mama has you now.

384
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,230
Mama has you now.

385
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,230
Mama has you. Shh.

386
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,110
It's okay. It's okay.

387
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,270
Shh.

388
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,190
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

389
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,990
It's okay.

390
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,310
You have to get him.

391
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:13,110
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

392
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,230
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

393
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,270
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

394
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,230
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

395
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,630
Walt.

396
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,590
Where have you been?

397
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,790
Oh, my God.

398
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,950
What happened?

399
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,200
You moved the money, didn't you?

400
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,200
You buried it somewhere.

401
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,150
Did you get my messages?

402
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,750
I told Hank nothing.

403
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,590
Walt, I swear I didn't.

404
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,550
Say something.

405
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,630
Please.

406
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,830
Oh, my God.

407
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,040
Walt. Walt.

408
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,520
Hey.

409
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,040
How--? How long was I out?

410
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,830
Four or five hours.

411
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,830
Oh.

412
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,590
How are you feeling?

413
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,990
It's true.

414
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,230
The cancer is back.

415
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,470
Is this it?

416
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,150
Does that make you happy?

417
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,990
I can't remember

418
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,990
the last time I was happy.

419
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,310
Just tell me.

420
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,790
I know you talked with Hank.

421
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,390
I know you made a deal.

422
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,510
Skyler, I'll make this easy.

423
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,710
I'll give myself up

424
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,710
if you promise me one thing.

425
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,590
You keep the money.

426
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,630
Never speak of it.

427
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,030
Never give it up.

428
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,320
You pass it on to our children.

429
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,950
Give them everything.

430
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,830
Would you do that?

431
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,990
Please.

432
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,950
Please don't let me

433
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,950
have done all this for nothing.

434
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,030
How did Hank find out?

435
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,630
Did somebody talk?

436
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,310
No, no one talked.

437
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,430
It was me.

438
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,350
I screwed up.

439
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,990
The way Hank talks,

440
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,030
he's got his suspicions.

441
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,230
Not much else.

442
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,590
You can't give yourself up

443
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,590
without giving up the money.

444
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,430
It's the way this works, Walt.

445
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,550
So maybe our best move here...

446
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,630
is to stay quiet.

447
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,190
Okay, you can take it off now.

448
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,870
All right, what's so important

449
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,870
you had to come way out here?

450
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,670
The amount of money

451
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,670
I'm bringing in,

452
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,070
I deserve to see why

453
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,070
it's all going wrong.

454
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,990
You an expert on meth labs now?

455
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,670
You gonna tell us

456
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,670
how to fix our operation?

457
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,950
And what if I can help?

458
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,950
What will it hurt to show me?

459
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,790
I don't like my time being wasted.

460
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,790
Well, I'm here, and 10 minutes

461
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,790
is a small sacrifice

462
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,670
when we're talking about

463
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,670
a $50 million shortfall.

464
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,560
So?

465
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,270
Safe to come down?

466
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,590
Yeah. You're good.

467
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,630
Ladies first.

468
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,270
Okay, now you've seen it.

469
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,270
Yeah, now I've seen it.

470
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,190
What?

471
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,910
Well, how about

472
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,910
we start with it's filthy.

473
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,070
What are you, my mother?

474
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,070
What filthy? It's just dimly lit.

475
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,950
Do you seriously think this is up to

476
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,950
the standards of your predecessor?

477
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,190
Because it's not. Not even close.

478
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,190
Well, the product we're making,

479
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,190
it's selling just fine.

480
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,670
Heisenberg's standards

481
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,670
don't matter anymore.

482
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,230
To whom? A bunch

483
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,230
of scabby Arizona tweakers?

484
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,990
They matter to my buyer in the Czech

485
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,990
Republic, therefore, they matter to me.

486
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,120
Look, I cannot move what this person

487
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,120
is making if it's substandard.

488
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,430
And it is. It just is. No offense.

489
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,990
If you can do better, do better.

490
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,990
I don't know what to tell you.

491
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,110
You tried to get the man back, right?

492
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,030
He said no, so...

493
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,030
I mean, what do you want me to do?

494
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,310
Todd. Use Todd again.

495
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,260
Look, he learned from him, all right?

496
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,390
At least Todd's first two cooks

497
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,390
were at 74 percent.

498
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,550
On his third cook, he started a fire.

499
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,710
Look, I tried Heisenberg's way.

500
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,710
It didn't work out.

501
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,190
I wanna cook in my territory.

502
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,190
I wanna use guys that I trust,

503
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,230
not Todd, who I don't.

504
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,950
And that's the end of the conversation

505
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,950
as far as I'm concerned.

506
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,230
I really wish you'd have

507
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,230
given him a chance.

508
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,550
Hey. We have a problem.

509
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,920
You stay here.

510
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,590
Get down!

511
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,670
Hello? Ma'am, you okay?

512
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,070
Hello?

513
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,070
Safe to come up whenever you want.

514
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,200
I...

515
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,190
I don't want to see.

516
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,430
Okay.

517
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,590
Cool, so I guess maybe, um...

518
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,660
Maybe just close your eyes.

519
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,670
Okay.

520
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,470
This way.

521
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,230
To the right.

522
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,270
Ha-ha. Are you kidding me with this?

523
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,310
Heh.

524
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,310
Uncle Jack.

525
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,710
Fire in the hole.

526
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,670
It's okay. Sorry about that.

527
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,120
It's cool, lady.

528
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,390
Okay, boys, let's take it all.

529
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,390
Let's get everything.

530
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,590
Hey.

531
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,590
You...

532
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,150
going into work today?

533
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,550
You're kidding, right?

534
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,230
What about you?

535
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,790
Are you going to the office?

536
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,070
You have to tell them, Hank.

537
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,560
Today.

538
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,390
Marie, I just-- I just don't have it yet.

539
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,590
The piece I need to prove it all,

540
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,590
it's just not here.

541
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,550
Then let them help you.

542
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,470
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.

543
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,520
You've got enough to get them

544
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,520
to believe your story at least.

545
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,510
Put the whole DEA on it.

546
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,240
That's how this is

547
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,240
supposed to work, right?

548
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,620
No.

549
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,510
No?

550
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,150
What no? What are you,

551
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,150
Lone Wolf McQuade?

552
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,040
Look, baby--

553
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,040
You've gotta go in with this, Hank.

554
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,070
Look, the day I go in with this...

555
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,500
that's the last day of my career,

556
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,500
all right?

557
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,550
I'm going to have to walk in there,

558
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,550
look those people in the eye

559
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,630
and admit that the person

560
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,630
I've been chasing the past year

561
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,590
is my own brother-in-law.

562
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,150
It's over for me.

563
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,500
Ten seconds after I tell this story,

564
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,500
I'm a civilian.

565
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,270
And then how can we help Skyler

566
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,270
if she comes to her senses?

567
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,710
When I go in there...

568
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,510
I'm bringing proof, not suspicions.

569
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,750
I can be the man who caught him,

570
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,750
at least.

571
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,350
What if you wait

572
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,070
and they catch Walt without you?

573
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,830
If they find out that you knew

574
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,830
and you said nothing?

575
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,310
Hank, wouldn't you go to jail too?

576
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,910
Hey, Hank. Welcome back.

577
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,720
Morning.

578
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,950
Hey.

579
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,950
Hey, boss.

580
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,590
How you doing, Hank?

581
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,590
Hey.

582
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,350
Hey. Look who's back.

583
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,590
I had to see it with my own eyes.

584
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,470
How you doing?

585
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,470
Good. Yeah, yeah. You miss me?

586
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,030
Miss you? Like my balls

587
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,030
miss jock itch, maybe.

588
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,990
Yeah? I didn't know you had balls.

589
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,670
All right, don't make me sorry

590
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,670
I stopped by here.

591
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,710
Anyway, you got

592
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,710
a budget meeting in an hour,

593
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,550
then a meet-and-greet with

594
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,550
the new prescription task force guys.

595
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,910
All right. Hey, you know, listen.

596
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,960
Let's see if we can get

597
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,960
that budget meeting pushed

598
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,310
and instead see if you could set up

599
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,310
a conference call with Ramey.

600
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,830
What for?

601
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,670
Just a "getting back up to speed" thing,

602
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,670
you know, for me.

603
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,990
All right. You got it.

604
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,630
Oh, hey. Did you hear

605
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,630
about that money thing?

606
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,000
No, what money thing?

607
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,390
Oh, you're gonna love this.

608
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,390
It involves your old pal Jesse Pinkman.

609
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,560
Pinkman?

610
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,920
I'll give you this.

611
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,920
Jesse, you're never boring.

612
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,670
Not boring at all.

613
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,830
So come on, buddy, share with us.

614
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,990
Why were you tossing

615
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,990
millions of dollars all over Albuquerque?

616
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,190
I promise you we can hold out

617
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,190
just as long as you can.

618
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,630
That's a fact. I got a bladder

619
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,630
the size of a hot water bottle.

620
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,870
Man, all that cash. I wouldn't

621
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,870
be able to stop talking about it.

622
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,550
I know. But I don't think I'd be

623
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,550
tossing it out my car window.

624
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,940
Heh-heh. Yeah.

625
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,230
My take-home doesn't allow

626
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,230
for that whole Robin Hood thing.

627
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,190
But apparently Jesse is raking it in.

628
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,190
Yes, indeed.

629
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,190
I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable

630
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,190
explanation for where he got it.

631
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,910
Sure. He found it.

632
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,590
Or won it in a card game, maybe.

633
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,590
That's it. Won it in a card game.

634
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,430
Lucky night at the casino.

635
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,710
Jesse, did you have a lucky night?

636
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,310
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna let you

637
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,310
gather your thoughts

638
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,190
so we can continue

639
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,190
this stimulating conversation.

640
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,670
Can we get you anything?

641
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,670
Coffee? A soda?

642
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,990
Right.

643
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,990
Yeah. Thought not.

644
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,960
I have a history

645
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,960
with Jesse Pinkman,

646
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,080
and I think he can be helpful to me

647
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,080
on another active investigation.

648
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,990
Look, I'm only asking

649
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,990
for a couple minutes here.

650
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,910
You said he wasn't talking?

651
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,910
Let me tell you, that kid hates my guts.

652
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,910
Despises me, okay?

653
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,230
Maybe I can get him cranked up

654
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,230
enough that he starts yapping.

655
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,870
Then you guys go in, get what you need

656
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,870
from the little shit-stain, finish him off.

657
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,150
Gives me anything useful

658
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,150
while he's with me,

659
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,150
I'll share it, 100 percent.

660
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,590
I could use a smoke break.

661
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,590
Yeah. How about you?

662
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,190
Yeah. Maybe you could keep

663
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,190
an eye on our suspect for us,

664
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,190
just for a few minutes.

665
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,670
Absolutely.

666
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,670
I can do that.

667
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,990
Okay.

668
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,640
All right, guys.
