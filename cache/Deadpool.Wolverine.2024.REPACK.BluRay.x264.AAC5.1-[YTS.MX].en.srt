1
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,679
<i>That logo music just gets
you pumped. Right?</i>

2
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:42,557
<i>I'm sorry. I just, I'm excited
to be here. It's been a while.</i>

3
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:45,560
<i>You know, for a long time,
I wasn't sure I'd ever be back.</i>

4
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:46,686
<i>Disney bought Fox...</i>

5
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,605
<i>there was a whole boring rights issue,
blabbity-blabbity-blah.</i>

6
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:52,525
<i>But then, it turned out,
they wanted me.</i>

7
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:55,110
<i>The one guy who shouldn't
even have his own movie...</i>

8
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:56,920
<i>much less a franchise.</i>

9
00:00:57,261 --> 00:00:59,589
<i>Marvel's so stupid.</i>

10
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:02,284
<i>Look, we know
the title of this thing. So...</i>

11
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:03,786
<i>I know what you're wondering.</i>

12
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,847
<i>How are we gonna do this
without dishonoring Logan's memory?</i>

13
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:09,683
<i>And I'll tell you how.</i>

14
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:11,643
<i>We're not.</i>

15
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:15,590
<i>I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.</i>

16
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:18,008
<i>Wolverine is not dead.</i>

17
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:21,179
<i>Sure, it made for a perfect ending
to a very sad story.</i>

18
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:24,474
<i>But that's not how
regenerative healing factors work.</i>

19
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:28,018
<i>You think I wanna be out here
in beautiful downtown North Dakota...</i>

20
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:31,079
<i>digging up the one and
only Wolverine? No, thank you.</i>

21
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:33,816
<i>But the fate of
my entire world is at stake.</i>

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,753
<i>He may not be living his best life,
but he sure as hell ain't dead.</i>

23
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:45,260
Bingo.

24
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:47,054
Yahtzee.

25
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:53,227
Yes, yes, yes.

26
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:57,814
Damn it!

27
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:01,526
Son of a bitch!

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,404
You...

29
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:10,061
Christ. Motherfucker!

30
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:11,829
My world is fuck...

31
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:14,289
That was weird.

32
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,166
I'm much calmer now.

33
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:20,196
Look, I'm not a man of science.

34
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,048
But you seem incredibly passed away.

35
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,329
But it's good to see ya.

36
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:31,417
I gotta be honest, I've always
wanted to ride with you, Log.

37
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:36,547
You and me getting into it.
Deadpool and Wolverine just fuckin' shit up.

38
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:39,883
Can you imagine the fun, the chaos...

39
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:41,066
the residuals?

40
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:43,262
"G'day, mate.

41
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:45,096
"There's nothing that'll
bring me back to life faster...

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,782
"than a big bag of Marvel cash."

43
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,618
Me too, Hugh.

44
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,579
But, no. No, no, no.

45
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:59,919
You had to get all noble and
die for real. Goddamn it!

46
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:03,714
I could really use your help right now.

47
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:15,643
Wait!

48
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,380
I'm warning you, I'm not alone.

49
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:20,065
Wade Winston Wilson...

50
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:23,469
you are under arrest
by the Time Variance Authority...

51
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:25,471
for too many crimes to list.

52
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:26,472
Come out...

53
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:27,974
and we'll extend you the courtesy...

54
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:30,226
- of taking you in one piece.
- Death by day-player.

55
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,367
Last chance.

56
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:34,579
Throw out your weapons
and come out peacefully.

57
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,983
I'm not gonna give you my weapons...

58
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,250
but I promise not to use them.

59
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:42,864
There are two hundred and
six bones in the human body.

60
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45,256
Two hundred and seven
if I'm watching <i>Gossip Girl.</i>

61
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:48,176
Here we go. Maximum effort.

62
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:58,269
Okay, peanut. Guess we're
getting that team up after all.

63
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,176
Maradona from outside the box!

64
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,719
{\an8}Goal!

65
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,644
Come on, big fella.

66
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,186
I am soaking wet right now.

67
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,426
<i>To be clear, I'm not
proud of any of this.</i>

68
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,471
<i>The wanton violence, the whiff
of necrophilia. It isn't who I am.</i>

69
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,973
<i>It isn't who I wanna be.</i>

70
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,391
<i>Who I wanna be?</i>

71
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,143
<i>Well, to help you understand that...</i>

72
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,352
<i>I've gotta take you back.</i>

73
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,105
<i>A little joyride I took
through space and time...</i>

74
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,874
<i>to the day that changed everything.</i>

75
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,581
{\an8}I can't believe I'm finally here.

76
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,348
{\an8}I've waited for this moment for so long.

77
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,811
Thank you, sir, for seeing me.

78
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,715
I firmly believe...

79
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,174
that my services could be of...

80
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,094
great use to your organization.
Now I know...

81
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,555
I was caught smashturbating
in the lobby of Stark Tower...

82
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,931
- but I can assure you that...
- Smashturbating?

83
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,350
I'm sorry, what, what was that?

84
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:39,728
No, I'm sorry. That, that's
when you get those toy...

85
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,621
Hulk hands, right? And then you just,
you look down, and you just...

86
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,485
you brace yourself,
and you ravage the midsection.

87
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,153
- Pinch the... Yeah. Okay.
- I get it. Okay, thank you.

88
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,197
- The picture's painted.
- You get the gist.

89
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:52,532
What exactly brings you here today?

90
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,410
Why am I... Wow. Okay.

91
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,511
I care.

92
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,223
I know I turn everything
into a joke, but I...

93
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,935
I care, and I, I wanna use that feeling...

94
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,855
for something important.

95
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,607
I, I wanna matter.

96
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,237
I need to show my girl that I matter.

97
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,614
And...

98
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,268
you know, I feel like
I'm wasting the good stuff here.

99
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:21,353
- Is the man not gonna be
joining us? - The man?

100
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,704
Yeah. I should save this
if he's gonna...

101
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,066
As, as far as you're concerned
right now, I'm the man.

102
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,416
- No.
- The man is me.

103
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:30,795
I am the man in this circumstance.

104
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:33,533
He doesn't do this kind of thing anymore.

105
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:34,534
- Cameos?
- Meetings.

106
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:36,243
- Meetings.
- Entry-level meetings.

107
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,201
Entry-level?

108
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,203
Aren't you the chauffeur...

109
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,373
- maybe?
- I... Common misconception.

110
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:44,627
- Okay. - I did begin
my career as Mr. Stark's driver.

111
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:45,795
- Okay.
- Quickly pivoted to...

112
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:47,337
- Chauffeur.
- ...the Head of Security.

113
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,340
The Head of...
Of course, yes, yes, yes.

114
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:52,385
And why I am vetting your résumé.

115
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,637
You seem to have left out
whether or not you had...

116
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:56,306
any experience as a member of a team.

117
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,683
Could you maybe
add a little bit of perspective there?

118
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:01,018
No, yes, of course. I was Special Forces...

119
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,688
- Okay.
- but I was... Mainly, I was team leader...

120
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:04,939
founder, really, of X-Force.

121
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:07,024
Sadly, they, they all
perished in action though.

122
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,484
How exactly did that happen?

123
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:10,528
Well, the police say gravity, but if...

124
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:11,529
Just between us...

125
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:13,281
- they didn't test well in
the focus group. - I see.

126
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:15,200
- Particularly Cable.
- X-Force.

127
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:17,243
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look,
I can see this isn't going well.

128
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:18,786
Please stop writing. Look, I, I...

129
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,845
I'm just... I wanna be an Avenger.

130
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:24,349
I wanna be an Avenger.

131
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:27,644
Why do you wanna be an Avenger?

132
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:31,091
Look around you. I mean, they're the,
they're the best of the best.

133
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,051
And, and what they do matters.

134
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:35,527
I need to be an Avenger.

135
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:39,349
Sir, my girl has kinda had it with my shtick,
and I, if I don't, you know...

136
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:42,143
turn things around
and do something with my gifts...

137
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,854
I don't think it's gonna
really work out for me...

138
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:45,329
and I wouldn't blame her.

139
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:50,750
Avengers are a very unique group
of superheroes...

140
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:52,070
that stand for something...

141
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,823
more than just fighting
and wearing costumes.

142
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,909
I mean, people look up to us.
Kids look up to us.

143
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,285
- They...
- I'm sorry. "Us?"

144
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,261
I wasn't aware that
you were an Avenger.

145
00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:03,456
- Avengers-adjacent, technically.
- Oh, wow.

146
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,726
What's your superpower?
Is it parallel parking? I am so sorry.

147
00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:08,419
That was cruel.

148
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:10,714
I lash out when I'm nervous.
Won't happen again.

149
00:10:10,738 --> 00:10:12,173
- Let's cut to the chase.
- Please.

150
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:13,675
You just said moments ago...

151
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:17,820
that you wanted to be an Avenger
because you need it.

152
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,515
Yes, sir, I do.

153
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:22,518
But the Avengers don't do the job
because they need it.

154
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,660
They do the job because
people need them.

155
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,287
Do you see the distinction?

156
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,541
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,861
Please, Mr. Hogan.

158
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:36,338
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
like an annoying one-trick pony.

159
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:40,217
All right.

160
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,788
Oh, my God, you're standing.

161
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,290
Yeah, now's the time that we stand.

162
00:10:44,314 --> 00:10:45,291
Damn it.

163
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:46,917
Now, the problem might be that you're...

164
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:49,336
reaching a little, little too high.

165
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,922
Aim for the middle, and you'll never miss.

166
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:54,315
Right? I think you got a good heart.
I believe what you're saying.

167
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:58,361
But not everybody's the world-saving type.
I'm not, and I'm happy.

168
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:00,780
Right? I found my place.

169
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:02,865
Find your place.

170
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:05,451
- All right? Get back out there.
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:09,038
- We'll keep an eye on you.
Good luck. - Okay.

172
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,502
Fetch the car. I wanna hit Shake Shack.

173
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,712
Rejection makes me hungy.

174
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:19,033
- Really? No?
- No, no. Please.

175
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,842
- Yeah, no, no, no. Okay, thank you.
- Oh, okay.

176
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:27,140
<i>You know what they say.
When one door closes...</i>

177
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,517
<i>your locker at work opens.</i>

178
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:42,906
Now let's go sell some certified
pre-owned vehicles, motherfu...

179
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,328
Technically, the,
the Carnival's not a minivan.

180
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,523
It's an MPV.

181
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:52,274
So how does the Kia compare to...

182
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:53,735
- the Honda Odyssey?
- The Odyssey?

183
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,502
That's a great question.
It doesn't fucking suck.

184
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,324
You know, you can answer
the question without swearing.

185
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:01,466
I'm sorry, Tammy,
I don't, I don't have kids.

186
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,703
Not that I haven't dreamt of that...

187
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:05,971
but I don't have a lot of vaginal sex.

188
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,793
{\an8}You'll get 'em next time, pal.

189
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:13,421
And look, you can always
go back to superhero-ing.

190
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:15,522
I mean, I know I'd like to
see you back in the suit.

191
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:18,650
I don't keep it in my locker
so that I can wear it.

192
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,513
I keep it in my locker in case
we need to saddle up again.

193
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:24,615
Hey, hey, hey. What?
What is that doing in there?

194
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:25,782
I'm done.

195
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,494
I'm done.

196
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,439
And I'm fine with being done.

197
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:33,108
Look, is sales the best match?

198
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:34,109
Probably not.

199
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:37,711
Is this the life that I always
imagined for myself? Fuck no.

200
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,298
But this is the right fit
for me, Sugar Bear, it is.

201
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,008
Okay, Mr. Wilson.

202
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:47,080
I'm just saying, once a month,
we could go on a little mission.

203
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:49,749
We're human beings. We crave purpose.

204
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:51,584
After all, we're Deadpool.

205
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:55,771
Please stop saying that. We're not Deadpool.
I'm not even Deadpool anymore.

206
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,509
Well, if you're gonna have
a midlife crisis, go big.

207
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:00,678
A few years ago...

208
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:03,847
a friend of mine got his nipples pierced
with a titanium chain...

209
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,033
that goes down and
attaches to his Van Johnson.

210
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:14,206
Are, are you feeling grumplestiltskin
'cause it's your birthday?

211
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,043
What?

212
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:18,878
No.

213
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:20,880
No.

214
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:26,260
Surprise!

215
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,930
Hey, you guys are lucky I'm not armed.

216
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:30,708
Get in here.

217
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:33,126
If this were six years ago,
you'd all be dead.

218
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,088
So then, he gets out of the cab,
and you will not believe it.

219
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:38,591
- I turn around, and
what do I find? - AirPods.

220
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:40,050
- His AirPods. Come on.
- His AirPods!

221
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:41,134
Crazy story.

222
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:43,736
- Every time. Come on.
- Every single time.

223
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:47,183
Make any sales today?

224
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:48,726
You know I didn't.

225
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,020
Did you sell any dreamcatchers on Etsy
or whatever it is that you do?

226
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,647
Our rent's due in three days, Wade.

227
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:55,066
I can't keep carrying you.

228
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,859
Relax. I have the money.

229
00:13:56,883 --> 00:14:00,503
I sold some old blood pressure medication
I found lying around.

230
00:14:00,678 --> 00:14:02,198
You tryin' to kill me, motherfucker?

231
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:04,492
I'm not the one dousing everything
in salt, motherfucker.

232
00:14:04,516 --> 00:14:06,702
I pray every day that...

233
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,537
fire finds your body...

234
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,081
and finishes the job...

235
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:12,708
- God didn't have the nuts to do.
- That's hurtful.

236
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:15,711
If you could hear the look on my face,
you'd smell how sad I am.

237
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:17,005
You watched anything good?

238
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:18,756
<i>Great British Bake Off.</i>

239
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,216
Oh, goddamn.

240
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,718
That show stood between me
and suicide for ten years.

241
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:25,263
Those are my feelings
on abortion, religious freedom...

242
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,515
animal rights, privacy rights, vaccines...

243
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:29,893
free-market capitalism,
global climate change.

244
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,244
Yeah, duh-duh-duh.
No, no speaking lines, Buck.

245
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:33,730
Hi, Yukio.

246
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:34,814
Hi, Wade.

247
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:36,748
Nice fake o'clock shadow.

248
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:40,945
It's a summer balayage. From the French.

249
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:44,282
It's meant to mimic the
natural highlights of the sun.

250
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,159
- It's a toupée.
- It's a hair system.

251
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:49,636
- I love your hair system, Wade.
- Thank you.

252
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,581
Wanna do some cocaine?

253
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:54,709
Hey, cocaine is the one thing
that Feige said is off limits.

254
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:57,546
- What about Bolivian marching powder?
- They know all the slang terms.

255
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,672
They have a list.

256
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:00,507
- Even snowboarding?
- Even disco dust.

257
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:02,258
- White girl interrupted?
- Even Forrest Bump.

258
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:04,302
- Booger sugar?
- I wouldn't even try powdered gonuts.

259
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:07,988
- You wanna build a snowman?
- Yes. But I can't.

260
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:10,365
Pull here.

261
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,034
- Here?
- Yeah.

262
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,912
- What happened?
- That's the fun part.

263
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:17,399
Thanks for coming.

264
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:18,483
Yeah.

265
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:19,708
How's work?

266
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,209
Oh, I got a promotion.

267
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,029
No way.

268
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:26,408
Yeah. It's mind-numbing middle
management, but I'm happy.

269
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:27,675
That's great.

270
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:30,969
- You seeing anyone?
- How about you?

271
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:33,472
Yeah.

272
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:36,460
A guy from work. Dermot.

273
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:37,669
Dermot.

274
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:39,171
- He's kind.
- Good.

275
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:40,839
Likes to go hiking.

276
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:42,382
Hasn't gotten me shot yet.

277
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:44,733
Well, it's early days.

278
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:50,614
What about you? You seeing anyone?

279
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:54,993
No, no, I live in a one-bedroom apartment.
I share a bed with Blind Al.

280
00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:59,915
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

281
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:04,780
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

282
00:16:04,804 --> 00:16:06,490
- Speech! Speech!
- Yes!

283
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:08,507
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

284
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,410
Birthdays.

285
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:13,247
Boy, every spin around the moon
is a new adventure indeed.

286
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:15,514
- Sun, dumbass.
- Okay, round-earther.

287
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:19,044
- Where was I?
- The adventure of life.

288
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,212
Right.

289
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:21,839
It's been a challenging few years.

290
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:23,883
Haven't seen you guys in a while.

291
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:26,135
Been through a lot, change of life.

292
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,220
- Menopause?
- Bitch, are you improv-ing?

293
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:30,029
- Mm-mm.
- Sorry.

294
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,307
I'm sorry that you had to see that, Yukio.

295
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:33,617
It's okay.

296
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,953
But I'm happy.

297
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,564
You know, and that's, that's...

298
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:41,583
because of each and every one of you.

299
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,361
I guess, what I'm trying to say is...

300
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:44,904
how proud I am, how grateful I am...

301
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,322
to be standing in a room...

302
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:49,215
with every single person I love.

303
00:16:54,604 --> 00:16:56,431
I'm the luckiest man alive.

304
00:16:58,733 --> 00:16:59,960
Make a wish, buddy.

305
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:01,520
Ten-four, good buddy.

306
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:03,855
Going down.

307
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:11,055
Wade Wilson?

308
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,199
Oh, yeah. Dancers.
Dopinder must have ordered you.

309
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:16,033
Are those supposed to be cop costumes?

310
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,369
Never mind.

311
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:21,373
Take your clothes off but leave the helmets.
And this isn't <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

312
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:23,567
We're kissing. All right?

313
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:25,418
What song do you guys
normally dance to?

314
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:29,631
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

315
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:31,076
Is that supposed to be scary?

316
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,928
Pegging isn't new for me, friendo.
But it is for Disney.

317
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,180
Ah, ta, ta, ta!

318
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:40,251
Okay, I've never been a natural bottom,
so we're gonna take things real slow.

319
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,295
And I want some crazy eye contact.

320
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,562
Not you.
You.

321
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:45,757
Can't see your eyes through
the mask, but I can feel them.

322
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,508
We're gonna move on down the hallway...

323
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:50,846
so we can spare a cleanup on aisle asshole.
How does everyone feel about this plan?

324
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,974
- I don't like you.
- Yes. Let's hold on to that attitude.

325
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:55,908
And we're gonna do it angry.

326
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:15,219
Mr. Wilson...

327
00:18:16,937 --> 00:18:19,958
you appear to have soiled yourself
while unconscious.

328
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:22,434
I wasn't unconscious. Who are you?

329
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,505
I go by the name of Paradox.

330
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:28,091
Mr. Paradox.
And you're sitting here at the TVA.

331
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:30,261
The Time Variance Authority.

332
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:32,679
We're really a watchdog organization...

333
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:36,558
except we're more lighthearted
than that sounds with a sort of...

334
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,810
throwback, ironic twist.

335
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:43,190
And we're in charge of defending
what's known as the Sacred Timeline.

336
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:46,527
Holy fuck. That is a shit-ton of exposition
for a threequel.

337
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:48,570
Is this because I used
Cable's time machine?

338
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,365
Brought a couple of people
back to life, then I destroyed it.

339
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:52,909
- That was a long time ago.
- Yes...

340
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,744
we're aware of your abuse of your timeline.

341
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,096
And you were so abusive of it.

342
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,707
No, it has nothing to do with that.

343
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:02,017
Walk with me.

344
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:12,110
I brought you here, Mr. Wilson,
to tell you that you're special.

345
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,682
In fact, you've been
chosen for a higher purpose...

346
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,615
a purpose unclear even to me.

347
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,019
But one that could...

348
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:23,105
save the entire Sacred Timeline...

349
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,858
from a possibly grisly fate
sometime in the future...

350
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:30,378
which may very well need to be... avenged.

351
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,047
This Sacred Timeline...

352
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:35,050
I assume I'm going to marvel...

353
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,592
at how...

354
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,955
cinematic it feels?

355
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,123
Gratuitous cameos...

356
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,125
indiscriminate use of Variants,
the whole package?

357
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,476
Well, you tell me.

358
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:53,109
Cap!

359
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,812
You are no longer lost, Wade.

360
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,497
You can be a hero among heroes.

361
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,151
We've been surveilling you
for quite a while.

362
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:11,127
- Subway station.
- A TVA outpost, yes.

363
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,464
- And what is that?
- Hmm?

364
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:17,884
Is that me? Is that Thor?

365
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,538
Is he crying?

366
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,499
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

367
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,001
That happens in the distant future.

368
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:26,378
- Why is Thor crying? Quick! Tell me.
- Do not speak to her.

369
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:27,379
Stop that. Eyes on me.

370
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:29,756
I brought you here
to offer you an opportunity.

371
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,176
The opportunity you sought years ago,
but for which you were not ready.

372
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,970
We believe you're ready now.

373
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:37,014
Ready for a chance to
leave your timeline...

374
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,516
and join the greatest universe of all.

375
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,226
I am about to give you the thing
you've always wanted.

376
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,936
Oh, I smell what you're steppin' in.

377
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,579
The power in the Marvel Universe
is about to change forever.

378
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:49,625
I am the Messiah...

379
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:53,587
I am...

380
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:56,423
Marvel Jesus.

381
00:20:57,642 --> 00:21:00,552
Can you excuse me for just a moment?
I'm just gonna go over here.

382
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:05,292
Suck it, Fox!

383
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:06,809
I'm going to Disneyland.

384
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:08,227
Get fucked!

385
00:21:11,781 --> 00:21:13,884
- Where do I sign?
- Oh, there's no need for paperwork.

386
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:16,261
Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.

387
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:19,405
- Oh. - There is one thing
I will need, though.

388
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,938
Oh, fuck off!

389
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:28,122
Adorn me, Beardo.

390
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:49,727
Fuckin' A!

391
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,548
It's perfect! FYI...

392
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:55,551
your tailor is a predator,
but I love it. Snug.

393
00:21:55,575 --> 00:22:00,155
No camel toe. New car smell
and adamantium katanas?

394
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,989
You shouldn't have.

395
00:22:02,124 --> 00:22:04,393
Go ahead. Take it in.

396
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:07,063
And yes, your underwear is getting tighter.

397
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:08,857
That guy knows what I'm talking about.

398
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:10,524
His clothes says middle management...

399
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:13,152
but his eyes say fuck-y fuck-y.

400
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:14,988
Yes. You look very nice.

401
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:18,199
"Nice?" Your buddy here is ready to
throw it all away for me.

402
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:19,575
- You callin' your wife?
- HR.

403
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,910
Does your wife work in HR?

404
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:23,220
I'm really glad you're taking this so well.

405
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:25,289
Oh. I'm taking it well.

406
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:28,417
I have never had a problem
traveling for work. That said...

407
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,810
we should talk vacation days.

408
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:32,547
I'm more of a
one-week-on-one-week-off kind of guy.

409
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:34,048
I think it's what they do in Denmark.

410
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:36,676
You know, you'll never see a
Danish flag on the moon, but...

411
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,927
goddamn it, they're happy.

412
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:40,597
Now, let's power up your little
Amazon Fire phone there...

413
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:43,975
and zip me back home so I can let my friends
know that they've been upgraded...

414
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:45,184
to disciples.

415
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:48,411
Yeah. I don't think you...
quite understand.

416
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:53,402
You will not be returning to your home
because there will be no home to return to.

417
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:54,403
Come again?

418
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:55,669
This time in my ears.

419
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:02,968
This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.

420
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:04,788
That...

421
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:09,042
is what happens when a universe
loses their Anchor Being.

422
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:11,295
See how it decays from the inside?

423
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:14,131
- This is how a reality dies.
- What's an Anchor Being?

424
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:17,634
An Anchor Being is an entity of
such vital importance that when they die...

425
00:23:17,658 --> 00:23:21,305
their whole world slowly
withers out of existence.

426
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:24,099
You've just won the lottery
because I didn't die.

427
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:25,976
It was just a little midlife crisis.
I'm better now.

428
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,618
Oh, no, no, no.

429
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:34,985
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, I love to laugh.

430
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:37,920
Can you imagine if
you were the Anchor Being?

431
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,383
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.

432
00:23:43,017 --> 00:23:47,513
Your Anchor Being died
in an act of self-sacrifice so epic...

433
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,058
that it sent shivers down the Timeline.

434
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:53,269
I am referring, of course, to...

435
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:58,399
Logan. The Wolverine.

436
00:24:01,745 --> 00:24:04,280
<i>Don't be what they made you.</i>

437
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:16,835
<i>So this is what it feels like...</i>

438
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,671
Logan.

439
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:21,589
Of course.

440
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,174
Logan.

441
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:27,330
Logan?

442
00:24:27,354 --> 00:24:29,457
The guy with forks for hands?

443
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,932
That Wolverine?

444
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:36,297
Yeah, I got it. You can turn your retro
graphics of death off now. Make it stop.

445
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:38,982
We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson.
We certainly can't stop it.

446
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:42,303
How long have we got?

447
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,805
In most cases, couple thousand years.

448
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:46,974
- Well, sweet.
- Well, most cases aren't fast enough.

449
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:48,157
Not for me.

450
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:49,685
What does that mean?

451
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,937
It means that I have been tasked...

452
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:54,357
with overseeing the end of your universe.

453
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:57,152
And regardless of what the
pencil pushers upstairs would prefer...

454
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:58,502
I will not...

455
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,198
waste my life watching it die slowly
of natural causes.

456
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:04,534
We used to just prune these things. Simple.

457
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:06,411
Elegant. Efficient. But I'm told the TVA...

458
00:25:06,435 --> 00:25:08,829
doesn't like to do that anymore.
Well I do.

459
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:11,332
And no matter what my so-called
superiors say, the multiverse...

460
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:13,168
does not need a babysitter.

461
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:15,128
We need a mercy killer.

462
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:16,712
And in this instance...

463
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:19,356
I am the mercy killer.

464
00:25:24,244 --> 00:25:26,306
What in the MacGuffin is that?

465
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,641
That's a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.

466
00:25:28,665 --> 00:25:30,351
An accelerant.

467
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:35,106
Once completed, it will allow me to destroy
the spacetime matrix of your universe.

468
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,275
You see, I don't want to work for the TVA.

469
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:39,527
I want to be the TVA.

470
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:42,238
And the first step involves
showing this organization...

471
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:44,074
how much more efficient it can become.

472
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:48,537
To wit, I will be giving your universe
a swift and compassionate end.

473
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:50,121
And don't worry,
your friends won't feel a thing.

474
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:52,139
It'll be over just like this.
"Oh, what's that?"

475
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:54,599
Trust me.

476
00:26:07,121 --> 00:26:09,433
You're gonna Old Yeller
my fucking universe?

477
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:11,810
Mm... In your parlance, yes.

478
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,077
Two in the heart, one in the head.

479
00:26:13,294 --> 00:26:15,397
Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.

480
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:18,775
You can either rejoin your loved ones
and collectively cease to exist in...

481
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,778
I'd say, seventy-two hours. Or...

482
00:26:21,802 --> 00:26:24,490
you join the Sacred Timeline.

483
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:26,908
And you end your days
of insignificance...

484
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:28,994
and mediocrity.

485
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:30,135
Wade.

486
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:32,498
Wade, you can finally...

487
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:35,140
finally, matter.

488
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,888
That's all I've ever really wanted.

489
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,363
I know.

490
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:49,989
I know.

491
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:54,452
And you know I'm,
I'm nothing if not morally flexible.

492
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:57,913
Yep, yep.

493
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,193
I'll do it.

494
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:03,780
Wise choice. The Sacred
Timeline's happy to have you.

495
00:27:03,804 --> 00:27:05,782
I was actually talking about
finding the Wolverine...

496
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:07,090
and breaking your fucking nose.

497
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:23,215
Find him. Find him!

498
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:25,191
<i>And boy, did he ever.</i>

499
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:28,486
<i>Which brings us back to this.</i>

500
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:32,616
<i>The desecration of the sacred corpse.</i>

501
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:38,163
Oh, my God!

502
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:42,208
Oh! My own fucking arm!

503
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:47,324
Now we're talkin'!

504
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:48,783
Not like this!

505
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,910
No, dear God! No!

506
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:53,246
I'm sorry! Wolverine-ing is hard!

507
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,414
Make it stop!

508
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:56,390
Mangold tried.

509
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:00,545
You sick fuck!

510
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:01,937
Logan was a hero.

511
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:05,023
And the only thing worth a shit
to ever come out of Canada.

512
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:17,286
Get my country's name
out of your fuckin' mouth.

513
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:19,996
And my sword. Give me that.

514
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:25,752
Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.

515
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:27,504
An alive one.

516
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:29,923
Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself out.

517
00:28:37,314 --> 00:28:38,349
Logan!

518
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:43,729
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

519
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:46,023
Who's asking?

520
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,178
Oh, look at this little Hairy Lou Retton.

521
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,988
Did you stick the landing, little guy?

522
00:28:52,454 --> 00:28:53,431
Yes, you did!

523
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:55,518
Comic accurate short king.

524
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:57,770
Such a cute wittle Wolvie.

525
00:28:57,794 --> 00:28:59,704
Cue the fuckin' montage, baby.

526
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:03,316
Ahoy! Everything seems to be on fire.

527
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,626
You have a dragon?

528
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,295
You have Anchor Being written all over...

529
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,640
Patch!

530
00:29:20,483 --> 00:29:21,934
Now we're talkin'.

531
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,853
Oh, yeah.

532
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,398
That's the whole goddamn
package right there.

533
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,426
Howdy!

534
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,095
I'm just... I'm auditioning Anchor Beings.

535
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,863
Oh. Yeah, that's gonna
need some coconut oil.

536
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,077
What in the fuck?

537
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:41,996
Are you okay?

538
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:43,482
Oh, yes, yes.

539
00:29:43,506 --> 00:29:45,484
Classic John Byrne brown and tan.

540
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:47,669
Now, you fought the Hulk
in this outfit. No?

541
00:29:50,347 --> 00:29:52,257
I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull creature,
and I will not...

542
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:05,687
It's not you. We're just going
in a different direction.

543
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:11,052
You know, from behind,
you look a little bit like Henry...

544
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,485
Oh, my fuck!

545
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,530
The Cavillrine. The legends are true.

546
00:30:15,998 --> 00:30:18,893
And may I say, sir,
on behalf of all humanity...

547
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,770
this just feels right.

548
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:24,023
We will treat you so much better
than those shit fucks down the street.

549
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:25,233
You were just leavin'.

550
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,625
No, sir. Not while
the fate of my universe is at...

551
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:33,867
This one looks promising.

552
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:34,925
Down you go.

553
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,552
Again.

554
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,582
I told you. You're not welcome here.

555
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,166
You're not welcome anywhere.

556
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,543
Now get the fuck out of my bar.

557
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:46,170
Just give me one more drink
and then I'll leave.

558
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:47,964
That's not how it works.

559
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:50,384
It does now. Leave the bottle.

560
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:51,385
I know you, bub?

561
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:53,694
Nope. But I know you.

562
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:55,488
Everybody knows me.

563
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:58,183
I'm the Wolverine.

564
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,144
Yes, you are.

565
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:02,661
And I'm gonna need you
to come with me right now.

566
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:05,399
Look, lady, I'm not interested.

567
00:31:05,423 --> 00:31:08,334
- Really gettin' into your cups here.
- Why would I go with you?

568
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:11,321
Because, unfortunately...

569
00:31:11,345 --> 00:31:12,406
I need you...

570
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:16,717
and even more unfortunately,
my entire world needs you.

571
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:19,011
You two gonna fuck or fight?

572
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:24,183
You gonna take that from him?

573
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:25,393
Yep.

574
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:27,254
I can tell you have a sort of...

575
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:29,882
don't-get-too-close-I'll-only-
break-your-heart vibe going here...

576
00:31:29,906 --> 00:31:32,301
but every other Wolverine
would've really hurt me by now.

577
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:35,345
And, I'm sort of on the tick-tick.
So upsy-daisy. Here we go.

578
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,780
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!
- Up you go. I got you, big guy.

579
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,269
Whiskey dick of the claws.

580
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:44,897
- It's quite common in Wolverines over forty.
- You don't want this.

581
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:47,607
You're right. I don't.
And you don't want this.

582
00:31:47,631 --> 00:31:50,402
Unless you wanna take a deep breath
through your fuckin' forehead...

583
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:52,446
I suggest you reconsider.

584
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,754
Let's go, peanut.

585
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:00,136
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

586
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:01,679
Watch this.

587
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:04,849
All right. That... Whoa.

588
00:32:05,316 --> 00:32:06,350
Easy.

589
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:10,980
Good God.

590
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:13,482
Thirsty little honey badger, aren't ya?

591
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:16,136
It's okay. Keep goin'.

592
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,196
Audiences are accustomed to long run times.

593
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,704
Guess you'll have to do.

594
00:32:25,962 --> 00:32:27,163
Okay, here we...

595
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:30,709
Oh! Look at those jammies.

596
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:34,379
That only took twenty fucking years.

597
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:36,699
One Anchor Being coming right up!

598
00:32:36,723 --> 00:32:39,008
On your left, baby girl.

599
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,580
This Logan has the same
he-can-do-anything-even-musicals look.

600
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:43,748
And bonus...

601
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:45,208
he's actually wearing a costume...

602
00:32:45,232 --> 00:32:47,085
like he's not embarrassed to be in
a superhero movie for once.

603
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:48,586
I don't understand.

604
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,171
You said my universe is dying...

605
00:32:50,195 --> 00:32:52,757
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

606
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:55,468
- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

607
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:59,639
You actually think
you can replace an Anchor Being...

608
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:01,281
with this?

609
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:05,103
I wouldn't have accepted any
other Wolverine BT dubs. But you...

610
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:08,689
have outdone yourself and
brought me the worst Wolverine!

611
00:33:08,713 --> 00:33:09,816
What do you mean, the worst one?

612
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,000
Mr. Wilson.

613
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:14,794
This Wolverine let down his entire world.

614
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,547
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

615
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:19,159
And what he did...

616
00:33:19,183 --> 00:33:20,535
well...

617
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,887
some things are just beyond forgiveness.

618
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:26,249
Okay.

619
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:29,143
How do I... How do I make
this right? I'll do anything.

620
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:32,548
I gave you a chance at greatness.

621
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:35,008
Because my superiors deemed you special.

622
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:36,677
Clearly not special in a good way.

623
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:39,680
Apparently you have some
important future purpose to serve.

624
00:33:39,704 --> 00:33:40,972
With Thor. He holds me.

625
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:45,101
But, I did my duty. I gave you
the opportunity to be somebody.

626
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:48,480
And instead of accepting my offering
with humility and gratitude...

627
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:49,538
you broke my nose.

628
00:33:49,714 --> 00:33:52,401
- It looks great.
- And you decimated dozens of my men...

629
00:33:52,425 --> 00:33:54,194
with the exhumed corpse of a hero.

630
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:56,405
Dishonoring not only his remains
but his memory.

631
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:57,614
What are you, the Internet?

632
00:33:57,638 --> 00:33:59,950
Your world is dying!

633
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,175
Thank you very much.

634
00:34:01,476 --> 00:34:02,802
And there's no stopping it.

635
00:34:04,895 --> 00:34:06,540
The humane thing to do...

636
00:34:06,564 --> 00:34:07,583
is to make it quick.

637
00:34:07,607 --> 00:34:10,461
Is the thought of vaporizing my universe
making you peckish?

638
00:34:10,485 --> 00:34:11,670
I'm eating my feelings.

639
00:34:11,694 --> 00:34:14,881
I'm about to lose everything that I've
ever cared about because that hairy...

640
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:16,800
thundercunt from down undercunt...

641
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:20,069
finally dies and he's standing
right behind me, isn't he?

642
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:22,071
Welcome to the MCU, by the way.

643
00:34:22,497 --> 00:34:24,114
You're joining at a bit of a low point.

644
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:26,810
As for you, I wanna talk to your boss.

645
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:30,147
I want you to get him on the phone
and you tell him, her, or them...

646
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:32,498
that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.

647
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:38,838
Holy shit.

648
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:43,452
I just heard a symphony
of buttholes clenching all at once.

649
00:34:43,476 --> 00:34:44,495
You're off grid.

650
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,998
Your bosses don't know what you
sick fucks are doing down here.

651
00:34:47,022 --> 00:34:50,209
Well, I'll tell you what.
I have a black belt in Karen...

652
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:51,669
And I'm gonna go upstairs...

653
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:53,853
and I'm gonna tell 'em all about
you and your...

654
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,548
Silence is nice, isn't it?

655
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:57,717
Where the fuck did he go?

656
00:34:57,741 --> 00:34:59,650
To the trash heap. You'll fit right in.

657
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:03,738
That was close.

658
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,137
Don't just stand there, you ape.

659
00:35:27,563 --> 00:35:28,805
Give me a hand up.

660
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:32,476
Nope. I'm actually okay.
Thank you very much...

661
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,797
Where the hell are we?

662
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:38,508
I don't know. Looks kind of Mad Max-y.

663
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:40,552
But that would be IP infringement, right?

664
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:41,943
Fucking jokes.

665
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:46,641
Fuck! Fuck.

666
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:48,143
Were you even listening back there?

667
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:51,036
If we don't make it back to that
Mr. Paradox asshole...

668
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,480
everyone I know is gonna die.

669
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,316
Not my fuckin' problem.

670
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,749
Oh, is that all you got?

671
00:35:56,592 --> 00:35:58,794
Is that what you said
when your world went to shit?

672
00:36:01,055 --> 00:36:02,032
Come again?

673
00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:03,632
Yeah, I heard all about you.

674
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:06,161
How you screwed up everything.

675
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:09,054
You should be thankin' me
for pulling you out of that bed you shit in.

676
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:11,473
You back-stabbing son of a bitch!

677
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:18,939
Are you ready to be calm now?

678
00:36:25,872 --> 00:36:28,574
Rest in pieces, Fox.

679
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:44,841
I don't want to fight you, peanut.

680
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,509
Doesn't matter what you did.

681
00:36:47,602 --> 00:36:48,845
I just need your help.

682
00:36:50,522 --> 00:36:52,306
I don't fuckin' care.

683
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:55,559
Uh-oh.

684
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:03,442
Fuck. This is gonna hurt.

685
00:37:07,414 --> 00:37:08,948
All right.

686
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:10,116
Fuck it.

687
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,910
Let's give the people what they came for.

688
00:37:13,503 --> 00:37:15,455
Let's fuckin' go.

689
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:18,567
Get your special sock out, nerds.

690
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:20,627
It's gonna get good.

691
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,681
Gotcha!

692
00:38:21,071 --> 00:38:22,105
Baby Knife!

693
00:38:26,827 --> 00:38:28,763
Let's see you grow your fuckin' head back.

694
00:38:28,787 --> 00:38:30,974
Wait, wait, wait!
I can fix it! I can fix it.

695
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:32,991
- Fix what?
- Whatever it is that you did.

696
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,285
Whatever made you so bad.

697
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:39,582
Those, those pricks in the TVA.
You heard him.

698
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:42,026
They have the power to end my universe...

699
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,337
but they also have the power
to change yours.

700
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:48,074
We get back there...

701
00:38:48,098 --> 00:38:51,344
and we can fix your world.
Together.

702
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:53,762
I promise.

703
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:56,515
They can fix it.

704
00:38:57,441 --> 00:38:58,835
Hey!

705
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,004
We fight each other, we lose.

706
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:02,422
Dear God, it's him.

707
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:04,648
- Who?
- The one.

708
00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:07,360
The superhero equivalent
to comfort food, or Molly.

709
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:11,280
White guys' answer to all the
disappointments. And another A-lister.

710
00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:13,267
Fair warning, gorgeous.

711
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,394
You're going to encounter
some indelicate language...

712
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:17,897
a smidge of ass play,
but we've been prohibited...

713
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:19,439
from using cocaine. On camera.

714
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:20,498
They're coming.

715
00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:22,250
Who's "they?"

716
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,258
Oh, they're driving angry.

717
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:38,141
Now that's a superhero landing.

718
00:39:44,906 --> 00:39:46,357
I got this.

719
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:10,882
Stay close.

720
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,383
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

721
00:40:13,768 --> 00:40:14,928
You got this.

722
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:20,684
Cassandra is gonna be giddy
when she sees what we caught.

723
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:22,670
You can't run.

724
00:40:22,694 --> 00:40:24,046
Everybody knows that.

725
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,398
You see anyone runnin',
dick for brains?

726
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,135
You're not gonna love
what happens next.

727
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,819
Oh. Oh, my God.

728
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:32,055
Oh, my God.

729
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,432
- Oh, my God, he's gonna say it.
- Ah! Fuck.

730
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:36,726
- Oh, my God! He's gonna say it!
- Say what?

731
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,893
Avengers, assemble...

732
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,369
- Flame on!
- I'm sorry, what now?

733
00:41:02,317 --> 00:41:03,352
Fuck!

734
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,217
We don't know that guy.

735
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:10,317
We thought we did.

736
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,986
I know you.

737
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,570
Holy...

738
00:41:15,915 --> 00:41:17,157
Sabretooth.

739
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:18,700
Your brother.

740
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:21,522
Ready to die?

741
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,998
Wait, wait, wait!
Time!

742
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:26,250
You look ridiculous.

743
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,945
People have waited
decades for this fight.

744
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:30,781
It's not gonna be easy.
Baby Knife.

745
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:32,699
Shoot the double, you take him down.

746
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,868
Side control, then full mount...

747
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,996
and you ground and pound
till he makes no sound because he's dead.

748
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,997
Shut the fuck up!

749
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:40,123
Oh, my God!

750
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:41,974
Okay. Good luck. I'm a huge fan.

751
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:56,056
What is it, girl?

752
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,407
Is there trouble at the well?

753
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:04,481
Big trouble.

754
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:06,233
Behold!

755
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,278
The head of your precious queen...

756
00:42:09,302 --> 00:42:10,503
Furiosa!

757
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:13,282
I have the Wolverine!

758
00:42:13,306 --> 00:42:16,535
I alone control her!

759
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:18,678
You come for me...

760
00:42:18,979 --> 00:42:21,556
you come for her.

761
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:26,879
So sorry. I know it's pronounced "him."
I'm gender blind. It's my cross to bear.

762
00:42:26,903 --> 00:42:28,063
Who's next?

763
00:42:28,238 --> 00:42:29,423
Toad!

764
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,523
You're up.

765
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:40,325
- Uh-oh. Oh, holy...
- Fuck.

766
00:42:51,052 --> 00:42:53,213
God of Thunder.

767
00:42:56,933 --> 00:42:58,369
How long was I asleep?

768
00:42:58,393 --> 00:43:00,329
Not all of you was asleep.

769
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:01,873
Don't bother.

770
00:43:01,897 --> 00:43:03,890
They're very thorough.

771
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:06,392
If you know where we are, start talking.

772
00:43:06,943 --> 00:43:08,144
You're in The Void.

773
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,063
Think of it as purgatory.

774
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:13,300
Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard.

775
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,653
Where anything useless goes
before it gets annihilated forever.

776
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:21,142
And where the TVA sends people that don't
play nice with the rest of the multiverse.

777
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,727
- Like you?
- And you.

778
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,327
What does the annihilating?

779
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:25,688
Alioth.

780
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:29,526
Alioth is in this thing? From
<i>Loki</i>, season one, episode five?

781
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,668
Everyone here is on the run from Alioth.

782
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:33,738
Most don't make it.

783
00:43:33,762 --> 00:43:35,255
There's a resistance, though.

784
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:38,800
Other people like us
that managed to survive.

785
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:42,914
They're hidin' out in the borderlands,
trying to find a way the fuck outta here.

786
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:44,416
Then that's where we go.

787
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,293
"We?" Us? A team?

788
00:43:46,317 --> 00:43:48,310
The answer is yes.
Shake on it.

789
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,255
Fuck! You nicked it.

790
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:52,257
Just got the tip with
your little steak knife.

791
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:54,384
These "others" can help us
get back to the TVA.

792
00:43:54,408 --> 00:43:55,526
Make 'em fix things.

793
00:43:57,619 --> 00:43:58,820
Something funny, bub?

794
00:43:59,246 --> 00:44:01,099
She might have somethin'
to say about that.

795
00:44:01,123 --> 00:44:02,283
Who's "she?"

796
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,660
In The Void...

797
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,578
you're either food for Alioth...

798
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:09,415
or you work for her.

799
00:45:21,621 --> 00:45:23,781
Huh. Paul Rudd finally aged.

800
00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:26,284
You must be this year's Juggernaut.

801
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:28,146
- Thank you.
- I'd keep your voices down.

802
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,438
She don't like the chatter.

803
00:45:29,462 --> 00:45:30,913
She's gonna love you.

804
00:45:46,855 --> 00:45:48,473
Is it... Is that Charles?

805
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:50,877
Hey... Hey, Chuck! It's us!

806
00:45:50,901 --> 00:45:52,211
That's not Chuck.

807
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:53,561
Ah, shit.

808
00:45:54,822 --> 00:45:56,424
Oh, ableism. Great.

809
00:45:56,448 --> 00:45:59,010
That's not gonna go over well
with the woke mob.

810
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:00,693
A Wolverine.

811
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:03,488
I wondered when I'd get one of you.

812
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:05,349
You're one of Xavier's.

813
00:46:05,373 --> 00:46:06,976
You-You know him?
You know Chuck?

814
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,285
Oh, I knew him.

815
00:46:08,376 --> 00:46:10,063
We shared a womb.

816
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:13,733
Tried to strangle the sly little fellow
with my umbilical cord.

817
00:46:13,757 --> 00:46:16,960
Amen. I've never loved roommates.
Mine's blind.

818
00:46:17,094 --> 00:46:18,671
Except she can see cocaine.

819
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:20,365
For some... reason.

820
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:23,242
You want to chime in, Your Majesty?
I'm dying here.

821
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:24,536
Who are you?

822
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,470
Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.

823
00:46:27,605 --> 00:46:29,181
- Bullshit!
- I was an anal birth.

824
00:46:29,857 --> 00:46:31,266
You two are cute.

825
00:46:31,984 --> 00:46:33,519
I have a good feeling about this.

826
00:46:36,364 --> 00:46:37,632
And I've been trying to catch...

827
00:46:37,656 --> 00:46:39,567
this little firefly for years.

828
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,886
Haven't I, Johnny?

829
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,265
Aw... You picked the wrong time
to make new friends.

830
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:47,767
Oh, Johnny told us all about you.

831
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,228
- Maybe shut up now.
- Yeah, maybe don't...

832
00:46:49,252 --> 00:46:50,479
We're just talkin' here.

833
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:53,815
Yeah, Johnny told us
you're a psychotic megalomaniacal asshole.

834
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,733
His words, not mine.

835
00:46:54,757 --> 00:46:57,335
Hellbent on domination and pain.

836
00:46:58,344 --> 00:47:00,447
- You said all that about me?
- No!

837
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:04,007
- No! I don't... I didn't say any of that!
- Sticks and stones, Johnny!

838
00:47:05,434 --> 00:47:07,579
Don't let her intimidate you.

839
00:47:07,603 --> 00:47:09,331
It's like you said in the convoy.

840
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:12,334
This finger-lickin' dead-inside
pixie slab of...

841
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:14,211
third rate dime-store nut-milk...

842
00:47:14,235 --> 00:47:16,171
can eat your delicious cinnamon ring...

843
00:47:16,195 --> 00:47:18,340
- and kick rocks all the way
to bald hell. - Okay.

844
00:47:18,364 --> 00:47:20,342
I have never said any of those words...

845
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:22,552
- in my entire life!
- Ha! The modesty.

846
00:47:22,576 --> 00:47:25,654
People think I'm a shit talker.
But this guy...

847
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:26,807
Next level.

848
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:28,893
What? This... I... We...

849
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:30,477
I don't even know what
half of that means!

850
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:33,147
- This... I... What? This...
- My hat's off to you, sir. Truly.

851
00:47:33,171 --> 00:47:34,580
I didn't... He's... That's...

852
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:36,457
I don't...

853
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:42,865
Not my favorite Chris.

854
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:45,535
You stupid piece of shit.
You just got him fucking killed!

855
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:47,453
Hey! We're all grieving!

856
00:47:47,477 --> 00:47:49,721
PS, do you know what
he was doing to the budget?

857
00:47:52,231 --> 00:47:54,267
Alioth is hungry.

858
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:56,712
There's been some kind of mistake.

859
00:47:56,736 --> 00:47:58,589
Big yellow is a back up Anchor Being...

860
00:47:58,613 --> 00:48:01,175
and I'm Marvel Jesus. MJ, if you're nasty.

861
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:02,385
This may be hard to hear...

862
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:05,221
but there's another British villain
who's gonna destroy my universe...

863
00:48:05,245 --> 00:48:06,389
and I'm gonna stop him.

864
00:48:06,413 --> 00:48:09,491
Oh, honey, you don't really strike me as
the world-saving type.

865
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:12,994
Did I hit a nerve?

866
00:48:13,878 --> 00:48:15,372
I didn't want it to come to this.

867
00:48:16,047 --> 00:48:17,108
Either you help us...

868
00:48:17,132 --> 00:48:20,236
or my friend here is gonna sing
the entire second act of <i>Music Man...</i>

869
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,628
with zero warm-up.

870
00:48:22,304 --> 00:48:23,656
Where'd you get the chair?

871
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,383
Well, once in a while,
I do get a Charles through here.

872
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,119
Never mine, though.

873
00:48:28,143 --> 00:48:31,513
No. He didn't care to find me.

874
00:48:32,481 --> 00:48:35,126
Gen Z and their trauma-bragging!

875
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,837
Can't you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment...

876
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:39,630
or cancer like the rest of us?

877
00:48:39,654 --> 00:48:41,466
But I'm not like the rest of you.

878
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,384
Except maybe the Wolverine.

879
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:46,012
Now, we could be truly
terrifying together.

880
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:47,430
You're that scary, huh?

881
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:49,489
The TVA certainly thought so.

882
00:48:49,874 --> 00:48:52,201
They sent me here
before I could walk.

883
00:48:52,459 --> 00:48:55,329
And you know, it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

884
00:48:55,587 --> 00:48:56,647
I love it here.

885
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:58,274
You live in a garbage dump.

886
00:48:58,298 --> 00:49:01,251
I think we both know who lives
in the garbage dump.

887
00:49:01,426 --> 00:49:03,087
The Void is a paradise.

888
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,257
I can wield my power here
without shame.

889
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:10,928
Unfortunately I had no Charles Xavier
to teach me temperance.

890
00:49:11,436 --> 00:49:13,414
What about your Charles?

891
00:49:13,438 --> 00:49:14,765
Did he protect you?

892
00:49:15,357 --> 00:49:17,586
Did he make you feel safe?

893
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,729
We're mutants. We're never safe.

894
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:30,030
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't... I don't want the smoke.

895
00:49:30,498 --> 00:49:33,269
I don't have any beef with you.
I just want to save my friends.

896
00:49:33,293 --> 00:49:34,770
I just... I want to go home.

897
00:49:34,794 --> 00:49:36,605
Well, the thing is, I could get you home.

898
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:38,357
- Good.
- But I don't want to.

899
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:39,874
Not good.

900
00:49:42,843 --> 00:49:45,337
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

901
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:49,160
Your... fingers are inside me,
but not in a good way.

902
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:52,288
My brother could
enter one's mind with a thought.

903
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:54,847
I have to get my hands dirty.

904
00:49:57,525 --> 00:49:59,059
I've got you.

905
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:02,605
<i>I've got you...</i>

906
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:06,151
<i>What do you mean?</i>

907
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:10,681
I can't, I can't reach you.
You're not here.

908
00:50:10,705 --> 00:50:12,323
I'm right here.

909
00:50:12,582 --> 00:50:15,561
- No, you're not. I can't...
- I'm right here.

910
00:50:15,585 --> 00:50:17,787
Then show me.
You got to do something.

911
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:20,081
Show you what?

912
00:50:20,465 --> 00:50:23,418
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

913
00:50:24,344 --> 00:50:28,339
<i>Ever since they turned you down,
you took a knee.</i>

914
00:50:28,974 --> 00:50:31,134
Baby, you never got back up.

915
00:50:33,144 --> 00:50:36,932
I know you're going through something.
Let me go through it with you.

916
00:50:38,149 --> 00:50:40,351
- Your crazy matches my crazy.
- Your crazy matches my crazy.

917
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,981
Where'd you go?

918
00:50:45,406 --> 00:50:46,942
Oh, my God.

919
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,612
<i>You just say it. Okay?</i>

920
00:50:52,456 --> 00:50:53,433
<i>Say, "I don't want you.</i>

921
00:50:53,457 --> 00:50:54,950
<i>"I don't want to be with you."</i>

922
00:50:55,917 --> 00:50:57,395
<i>Go ahead. Say it.
Say, say, "I don't..."</i>

923
00:50:57,419 --> 00:50:58,704
Say it. You don't wanna be with me.

924
00:50:58,962 --> 00:51:01,497
<i>Tell me that and I'll walk away.
Say, "I don't want you."</i>

925
00:51:08,138 --> 00:51:09,115
Fuck...

926
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:11,883
You'll never fucking matter.

927
00:51:15,562 --> 00:51:17,473
What?

928
00:51:17,648 --> 00:51:20,601
- You'll never fucking matter.
- Fucking matter.

929
00:51:26,865 --> 00:51:28,885
- <i>You'll...</i>
- <i>You'll...</i>

930
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:30,486
- never...
- <i>never...</i>

931
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:32,180
- fucking...
- <i>fucking...</i>

932
00:51:32,204 --> 00:51:35,199
- matter.
- <i>matter...</i>

933
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:38,561
She never said that.

934
00:51:38,585 --> 00:51:39,687
No.

935
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:41,788
But I bet she thought it.

936
00:51:43,715 --> 00:51:45,485
You are so mean!

937
00:51:45,509 --> 00:51:48,337
My brain could taste your fingers,
and they tasted like hate!

938
00:51:48,846 --> 00:51:51,491
And where in God's name
is the intimacy coordinator?

939
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:53,967
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

940
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,762
And long before you came here.

941
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:00,682
This is Baby Knife. She's gonna
fuck you in the face now.

942
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:03,895
If you want to kill me, it's going
to take more than a little blade.

943
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:05,062
How about six?

944
00:52:06,864 --> 00:52:08,900
My boy's wicked strong.

945
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,943
That's my big boy.

946
00:52:11,035 --> 00:52:12,569
Yes, you are.

947
00:52:18,209 --> 00:52:19,994
Well, this has been fun.

948
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:22,579
But the big guy needs to eat
and the rent is due.

949
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,777
By the way...

950
00:52:26,801 --> 00:52:28,419
you're the rent.

951
00:52:48,406 --> 00:52:50,384
Come on! Fuck!

952
00:52:50,408 --> 00:52:51,635
You comin' or what?

953
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:52,735
Coming!

954
00:53:12,764 --> 00:53:13,907
What you thinkin' 'bout?

955
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:15,175
Get the fuck off of me!

956
00:53:15,517 --> 00:53:16,535
Almost done.

957
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,786
Almost done what?

958
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,331
Getting my knife out of
your buttocks, pervert!

959
00:53:20,355 --> 00:53:21,415
Fuck!

960
00:53:21,439 --> 00:53:23,292
Get your mind out of my pants!

961
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:24,293
I'm telling Blake.

962
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:25,560
New rules.

963
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:26,880
I talk now.

964
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:30,523
- That's gonna be very hard on
the audience. - Shut the fuck up!

965
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,150
Let me fuckin' think.

966
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,277
Now we gotta get back to Paradox, right?

967
00:53:36,163 --> 00:53:37,197
Right?

968
00:53:38,874 --> 00:53:42,369
- Am I allowed to speak now or...
- Just nod, asshole.

969
00:53:43,796 --> 00:53:44,856
Right.

970
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,859
Then we find the others that poor kid, Johnny
was talking about before you got him killed!

971
00:53:47,883 --> 00:53:49,653
"Poor kid." He's like fifty!

972
00:53:49,677 --> 00:53:52,321
Yeah, if there's a chance they know
how to get out of here, we find 'em.

973
00:53:52,345 --> 00:53:55,867
And make those TVA fuckers fix my shit
like you fucking promised!

974
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:57,300
I smell quest.

975
00:53:59,853 --> 00:54:01,054
I smell food.

976
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:07,811
So what made you finally wear an
honest-to-God costume?

977
00:54:09,321 --> 00:54:11,550
Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.

978
00:54:11,574 --> 00:54:14,386
But I could see how
yellow would be useful too.

979
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:16,095
Have you been checked for ADHD?

980
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,362
Mm-mm.

981
00:54:17,413 --> 00:54:19,683
But I've had several STDs, which...

982
00:54:19,707 --> 00:54:21,560
were probably caused by ADHD.

983
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:22,584
Fuck!

984
00:54:23,836 --> 00:54:24,995
What are you looking for?

985
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:27,289
Thank fuck.

986
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,068
No, no, no. That's rubbing alcohol.

987
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:32,878
You don't want to drink...
Oh, yeah. There you go. Fuck that liver.

988
00:54:34,388 --> 00:54:36,299
Good. Okay.

989
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:38,467
What the fuck are those?

990
00:54:39,935 --> 00:54:42,930
Back in civilian life, I wear a toupee,
but nobody knows.

991
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,518
Everybody knows.

992
00:54:50,113 --> 00:54:51,966
Wanna talk about what's haunting you, or...

993
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:54,108
should we wait for a third act flashback?

994
00:54:54,575 --> 00:54:56,026
Go fuck yourself.

995
00:54:59,163 --> 00:55:00,198
You know...

996
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:03,492
in my world, you're...

997
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:06,787
You're well regarded.

998
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,372
Yeah, well, not in mine.

999
00:55:09,382 --> 00:55:12,793
- They don't like me much in mine either.
- You don't say.

1000
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:14,670
I wanted to be something, you know. I...

1001
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:17,423
Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.

1002
00:55:17,473 --> 00:55:19,508
- Fuck the Avengers.
- Yeah.

1003
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:22,095
I didn't make the cut, though.
Same with the X-Men...

1004
00:55:24,022 --> 00:55:25,165
When my girlfriend left me...

1005
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:26,515
- and then I just...
- You had a girlfriend?

1006
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:28,101
Yeah.

1007
00:55:28,401 --> 00:55:29,435
Vanessa.

1008
00:55:29,903 --> 00:55:31,520
When we met, she was a dancer.

1009
00:55:32,531 --> 00:55:33,732
We had a whole life.

1010
00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:36,025
It was good.

1011
00:55:36,618 --> 00:55:38,194
But, oh, boy, I just...

1012
00:55:39,954 --> 00:55:41,656
Fucked that right up.

1013
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:43,518
But you.

1014
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:44,868
You were an X-Man.

1015
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:47,036
Fuck that. You were the X-Man. You...

1016
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:50,123
The Wolverine.

1017
00:55:52,301 --> 00:55:54,043
He was a hero in my world.

1018
00:55:55,762 --> 00:55:56,796
Yeah, well...

1019
00:55:58,014 --> 00:55:59,383
he ain't shit in mine.

1020
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:07,432
You said, "Logan was a hero."
What happened?

1021
00:56:08,108 --> 00:56:09,142
He died.

1022
00:56:09,693 --> 00:56:10,727
How?

1023
00:56:11,403 --> 00:56:14,049
Well, technically, you were
chest-fucked by a tree, but...

1024
00:56:14,073 --> 00:56:16,801
really, you just ran out of batteries
trying to save someone.

1025
00:56:16,825 --> 00:56:17,859
Who?

1026
00:56:18,035 --> 00:56:21,530
The shitheels that grew her in a lab
called her "X-23." But...

1027
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:23,407
she was just a kid.

1028
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:27,562
A younger, daintier,
somehow meaner version of you.

1029
00:56:27,586 --> 00:56:29,163
You died trying to save her.

1030
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:30,372
It was beautiful.

1031
00:56:30,923 --> 00:56:33,417
Look, <i>mijo,</i> I know you're hurtin'.

1032
00:56:33,968 --> 00:56:37,738
My blind, elderly, African-American roommate,
Blind Al, always says that...

1033
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,574
pain teaches us who we are.

1034
00:56:39,598 --> 00:56:42,285
Sometimes we need to listen to that pain
instead of running from it.

1035
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:44,120
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, she's wise.

1036
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:46,665
No, no, no. That's her name?
You call her "Blind Al?"

1037
00:56:46,689 --> 00:56:47,890
Well, she's blind.

1038
00:57:25,353 --> 00:57:26,747
Look at you!

1039
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:27,914
She's coming with us.

1040
00:57:27,938 --> 00:57:29,958
- No, she's not. Fuck no!
- Oh, yes, she is.

1041
00:57:29,982 --> 00:57:32,101
- Oh, yes...
- Sorry!

1042
00:57:32,277 --> 00:57:33,853
Sorry about that!

1043
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:35,396
Come here, girl!

1044
00:57:36,156 --> 00:57:37,508
Who are you?

1045
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:38,967
Oh, I'm Deadpool.

1046
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:40,427
And I guess you're Deadpool too.

1047
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:42,653
But in here, everybody calls me "Nicepool."

1048
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:45,974
Oh, my goodness. Wait till you see Ladypool.
She is gorgeous.

1049
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:47,575
She just had a baby too. And...

1050
00:57:48,126 --> 00:57:49,103
Can't even tell.

1051
00:57:49,127 --> 00:57:50,604
I don't think you're supposed to say that.

1052
00:57:50,628 --> 00:57:51,662
That's okay.

1053
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:53,774
I identify as a feminist.

1054
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:54,874
Right.

1055
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:59,613
Are those gold-plated,
...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros?

1056
00:57:59,637 --> 00:58:00,963
'Course.

1057
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:02,449
To match my ear huggie.

1058
00:58:02,473 --> 00:58:03,549
Can I have 'em?

1059
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:05,843
Over my dead body.

1060
00:58:05,977 --> 00:58:06,996
You're fun.

1061
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:11,500
And I guess you've already met
Mary Puppins. AKA Dogpool.

1062
00:58:11,524 --> 00:58:12,709
Careful where you put your hands.

1063
00:58:12,733 --> 00:58:15,713
She's ninety percent g-spot,
and she'll let you know it.

1064
00:58:15,737 --> 00:58:19,300
You let this little flirt out of your sight
for one second and...

1065
00:58:19,324 --> 00:58:21,510
she starts shopping for a new papa.

1066
00:58:21,534 --> 00:58:26,197
If you can't be a responsible pet owner, then
maybe you don't deserve this little unicorn.

1067
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:28,158
Guilty on all charges, Your Honor.

1068
00:58:28,499 --> 00:58:29,644
Shan't happen again.

1069
00:58:29,668 --> 00:58:31,145
Why are you so nice?

1070
00:58:31,169 --> 00:58:32,689
Oh, it costs nothing to be kind.

1071
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:34,664
Shutting the fuck up is also free.

1072
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:36,150
This is Logan.

1073
00:58:36,174 --> 00:58:39,127
He's usually shirtless, but he's let
himself go since the divorce.

1074
00:58:40,261 --> 00:58:42,005
Where's your mask?

1075
00:58:44,516 --> 00:58:45,550
Come on, guys.

1076
00:58:47,018 --> 00:58:48,245
Ugh, this guy.

1077
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:49,914
We're looking for a group of survivors.

1078
00:58:49,938 --> 00:58:50,915
Oh, they're out there.

1079
00:58:50,939 --> 00:58:54,461
Yeah, but merc to merc, you better hope
that you don't run into the Deadpool corps.

1080
00:58:54,485 --> 00:58:55,587
Yeah, they're crazy.

1081
00:58:55,611 --> 00:58:58,715
They will chop you up into a thousand pieces
and hide you all over The Void.

1082
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:00,717
If they could only process
their childhood trauma...

1083
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:02,469
they'd go on one heck of a healing journey.

1084
00:59:02,493 --> 00:59:03,636
Look, we're headed for the borderlands.

1085
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,820
You know where it is?

1086
00:59:04,911 --> 00:59:09,267
Yeah, that... That's twelve klicks due west.
I can lend you my ride, if you like.

1087
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,201
It would be my honor.

1088
00:59:14,671 --> 00:59:16,858
No, no, no. Absolutely not.

1089
00:59:16,882 --> 00:59:18,901
Uh-uh. What the...
No! No!

1090
00:59:18,925 --> 00:59:19,986
Just get in the car.

1091
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,238
This isn't a car.

1092
00:59:21,262 --> 00:59:23,615
This is a Honda fuckin' Odyssey.

1093
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:25,658
Throttle response sucks a cock.

1094
00:59:25,682 --> 00:59:26,952
Dated infotainment system.

1095
00:59:26,976 --> 00:59:29,746
When Honda saw that untreated chlamydia
was makin' a comeback...

1096
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:32,707
they invented the Honda Odyssey to compete.

1097
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:35,642
Get in the fucking car.

1098
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:37,712
She'll get you there safe and sound.

1099
00:59:37,736 --> 00:59:39,396
Old Betsy always does.

1100
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:42,191
You're gonna have to
give me my dog back, though.

1101
00:59:42,366 --> 00:59:45,012
I know. Listen. Yes, child.

1102
00:59:45,036 --> 00:59:47,639
If you ever wanna give her up,
or if she needs a new home...

1103
00:59:47,663 --> 00:59:49,682
or if something
should happen to you...

1104
00:59:49,706 --> 00:59:51,117
I'd love to be her papa.

1105
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:53,395
What would ever happen to me?

1106
00:59:53,419 --> 00:59:54,661
Lots of stuff.

1107
00:59:58,174 --> 01:00:00,626
- Jesus.
- No! We're running away.

1108
01:00:01,468 --> 01:00:03,321
- Give me that.
- The corn was too dense, girl!

1109
01:00:03,345 --> 01:00:04,322
- There.
- Come here!

1110
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:05,798
- Fuck!
- Hello!

1111
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:09,093
Bye.

1112
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:35,912
Okay, I'm just gonna ask...

1113
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:37,398
What's with the suit?

1114
01:00:37,422 --> 01:00:39,024
First thing I did when I flamed out...

1115
01:00:39,048 --> 01:00:40,193
- I took mine off.
- Drop it.

1116
01:00:40,217 --> 01:00:41,319
It's not that ugly.

1117
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,070
- Stop talking about my suit.
- Did you make it yourself?

1118
01:00:43,094 --> 01:00:44,655
- Been there.
- Quit. Now.

1119
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:47,908
The X-Men make you wear it?
Those sons of fuckin' bitches.

1120
01:00:47,932 --> 01:00:49,577
They are not your friends,
I'll tell you that.

1121
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:50,744
Friends don't let friends...

1122
01:00:50,768 --> 01:00:53,789
leave the house lookin' like they
fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams.

1123
01:00:53,813 --> 01:00:55,041
Shut the fuck up about this, or...

1124
01:00:55,065 --> 01:00:57,418
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch your frown lines, angel baby.

1125
01:00:57,442 --> 01:00:59,753
- I'm just trying to bond a little bit.
- Yeah, well, then talk about somethin' else.

1126
01:00:59,777 --> 01:01:00,895
Fine.

1127
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:09,112
Stop it.

1128
01:01:10,622 --> 01:01:11,599
If they can fix your world...

1129
01:01:11,623 --> 01:01:13,392
what's the first thing you're gonna do
when you get out of here?

1130
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:16,687
Get some rubbing alcohol shots,
maybe a wiper fluid chaser?

1131
01:01:16,711 --> 01:01:17,772
What did you say?

1132
01:01:17,796 --> 01:01:19,565
I said when you get back,
what's the first thing you're gonna do?

1133
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:21,124
No, no, no. Before that.

1134
01:01:22,175 --> 01:01:24,044
If... they can fix your world?

1135
01:01:27,973 --> 01:01:29,632
What do you mean, "if?"

1136
01:01:30,267 --> 01:01:31,244
- I mean...
- You lied to me.

1137
01:01:31,268 --> 01:01:33,955
You don't have a fucking clue
if they can help me fix things, do you?

1138
01:01:33,979 --> 01:01:35,263
No. I, I mean...

1139
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:38,668
Fuck! Fuck! I didn't lie!

1140
01:01:38,692 --> 01:01:41,561
- You lied!
- No! I made an educated wish!

1141
01:01:43,238 --> 01:01:44,397
Because I need you.

1142
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:48,736
This. This is why. Right here.

1143
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:51,279
'Cause if we don't do something, they die.

1144
01:01:51,497 --> 01:01:53,558
I don't know anything
about saving worlds.

1145
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:55,268
And why would I even care?

1146
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:58,411
Because my entire world
is right here in this picture.

1147
01:01:58,671 --> 01:02:00,815
It's only nine people...

1148
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,083
and I have no idea
how to save it alone.

1149
01:02:04,009 --> 01:02:06,238
I know how to fuck people
up for money. But you...

1150
01:02:06,262 --> 01:02:08,046
you know how to save 'em!

1151
01:02:09,097 --> 01:02:10,508
At least the other Wolverine did.

1152
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:14,120
Fuck! I guess I'm stuck with the worst one.

1153
01:02:14,144 --> 01:02:16,540
Did you say you made...

1154
01:02:16,564 --> 01:02:20,001
an educated fucking wish?

1155
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:22,296
They call me "The Merc with the Mouth."

1156
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:26,399
They don't call me "Truthful Timmy,
the Blowjob Queen of Saskatoon."

1157
01:02:30,078 --> 01:02:31,194
One more word.

1158
01:02:32,288 --> 01:02:33,947
Please give me one.

1159
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:38,744
Gubernatorial.

1160
01:02:39,295 --> 01:02:40,496
Oh, fuck!

1161
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:43,541
You know what? You're a fucking joke.

1162
01:02:45,134 --> 01:02:46,695
No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.

1163
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:49,047
Or the X-Men.
And they'll take fucking anyone.

1164
01:02:49,347 --> 01:02:50,866
I mean, you are...

1165
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:54,635
a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.

1166
01:02:55,061 --> 01:02:56,914
I have never met...

1167
01:02:56,938 --> 01:02:58,290
a sadder...

1168
01:02:58,314 --> 01:03:00,835
more attention-starved,
jabbering little prick...

1169
01:03:00,859 --> 01:03:04,421
in my entire life. And that says a lot,
'cause I've been alive...

1170
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:08,425
for more than two hundred
fuckin' years, and I'll tell you...

1171
01:03:08,449 --> 01:03:12,805
that bald chick was right about one thing.
You will never save the world!

1172
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:15,474
You couldn't even save a relationship...

1173
01:03:15,498 --> 01:03:17,518
with a goddamn stripper!

1174
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:20,145
And motherfucker,
I wish I could say you'd die alone...

1175
01:03:20,169 --> 01:03:23,232
but it's one of God's best jokes
that you can't die...

1176
01:03:23,256 --> 01:03:24,958
except that's on all of us!

1177
01:03:28,845 --> 01:03:31,505
Oh, you got nothing to say, Mouth?

1178
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:41,850
I'm gonna fight you now.

1179
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,311
Oh, are you?

1180
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,032
Mm. Not talkin' now, are ya?

1181
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:05,749
You dirty bitch.

1182
01:04:21,273 --> 01:04:22,307
Whoo!

1183
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,117
No, no, no!

1184
01:04:58,769 --> 01:04:59,804
Baby Knife!

1185
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:06,644
I take it all back.
The Honda Odyssey fucks hard.

1186
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,464
Too bad you don't, needle dick.

1187
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:09,897
Oh, we're just gettin' started, bub.

1188
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,736
Oh, you... Fuck!

1189
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,540
Thor!

1190
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,487
Where are we?

1191
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,339
No clue, but... I like it here.

1192
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1193
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:16,358
Okay.

1194
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:20,111
Look at you... all. You must be the others.

1195
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:21,655
Terrific.

1196
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:25,268
So just to refresh, you are...

1197
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,869
- Wonder... Elektra? Yes.
Who could forget? - Elektra.

1198
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:33,360
And you. I was not expecting to see you here.
I thought you were, you know...

1199
01:07:33,384 --> 01:07:34,543
retired.

1200
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:36,628
Retarded?

1201
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:39,032
"Retired."

1202
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:41,409
I'm already in The Void.
I'm not trying to get canceled again.

1203
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:42,327
I don't like you.

1204
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:43,385
You never did.

1205
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:48,751
And who's this succulent reminder
of my own inadequacies?

1206
01:07:48,775 --> 01:07:50,059
Look at you.

1207
01:07:50,526 --> 01:07:52,812
You look like the
superhero version of Hawkeye.

1208
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:56,232
The name's Remy LeBeau,
<i>Le Diable Blanc.</i>

1209
01:07:56,741 --> 01:07:57,843
But you can call me the Gambit.

1210
01:07:57,867 --> 01:08:00,820
It's been a while since I've seen
<i>Sling Blade</i>. Hit me again.

1211
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:02,806
They call me the Gambit.

1212
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,434
Do they? Are you sure you didn't just
really, really want them to...

1213
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,784
but it never quite worked out?

1214
01:08:09,462 --> 01:08:11,956
You know, we never
had a Wolverine up in here.

1215
01:08:12,549 --> 01:08:15,653
But I can tell you now,
it's just a common courtesy to ask...

1216
01:08:15,677 --> 01:08:17,545
before you drink up all of my liquor.

1217
01:08:17,637 --> 01:08:19,881
Well, it's a good thing
I don't give a fuck.

1218
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:23,925
Fuck.

1219
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,179
So embarrassing.

1220
01:08:30,192 --> 01:08:33,003
Well, now that that's settled, look,
we came a long way to find you three.

1221
01:08:33,027 --> 01:08:33,961
There's four of us.

1222
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:36,062
There's four... Hey, wait.
Is it Magneto?

1223
01:08:36,698 --> 01:08:39,177
Dear sweet God in heaven,
let it be Magneto...

1224
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:40,218
- because with him...
- He's dead.

1225
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:42,263
Fuck!
Now Disney gets cheap?

1226
01:08:42,287 --> 01:08:45,558
It's like Pinocchio jammed his face
in my ass and started lying like crazy.

1227
01:08:45,582 --> 01:08:46,866
Ooh, you nasty!

1228
01:08:48,835 --> 01:08:51,689
Not a single word.
What do you do exactly?

1229
01:08:51,713 --> 01:08:54,442
Charge the playing cards
and make 'em go boom!

1230
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:56,569
Your power's close up magic.
That's good.

1231
01:08:56,593 --> 01:08:58,154
We're not totally fucked at all.

1232
01:08:58,178 --> 01:08:59,822
So who brought us here?

1233
01:08:59,846 --> 01:09:00,962
That would be me.

1234
01:09:11,108 --> 01:09:12,142
Don't make me regret it.

1235
01:09:14,194 --> 01:09:17,314
Holy shit. Logan. That's her.
That's X-23.

1236
01:09:17,614 --> 01:09:19,316
She's the one I told you about.

1237
01:09:23,661 --> 01:09:25,889
Hey, how did you all get stuck in The Void?

1238
01:09:25,913 --> 01:09:27,433
There was a knock at the door.

1239
01:09:27,457 --> 01:09:29,518
- TVA sent me here.
- Me, too.

1240
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:31,912
Well, maybe I was born here.
It's, it's hard to know for sure.

1241
01:09:32,044 --> 01:09:34,456
TVA decided our universe was dying.

1242
01:09:35,548 --> 01:09:37,624
And I never even got
a chance to fight for it.

1243
01:09:40,262 --> 01:09:42,491
People like us don't go quietly.

1244
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:44,549
TVA knows that, so they took us out.

1245
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:47,203
The answer is yes. I'm in.

1246
01:09:47,227 --> 01:09:48,846
- In what?
- A team.

1247
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:51,333
Me, you, you, and me. All of us together.

1248
01:09:51,357 --> 01:09:52,584
Let's get the fuck out of this place.

1249
01:09:52,608 --> 01:09:56,228
- Don't listen to him. He's a fucking liar!
- It was an educated wish!

1250
01:09:57,069 --> 01:09:58,105
Look.

1251
01:09:59,448 --> 01:10:01,316
We've been inside Cassandra's lair.

1252
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:04,137
The only way out of The Void
is through her.

1253
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:06,055
She can get us home.
She told us.

1254
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,823
Wait a minute, you've been inside?

1255
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:10,352
- And you made it out alive?
- Bullshit.

1256
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:12,104
- Nobody's ever done that.
- We did.

1257
01:10:12,128 --> 01:10:14,580
Every time one of us
has gone up against her...

1258
01:10:14,797 --> 01:10:15,831
they die.

1259
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:18,943
The Punisher, The Quicksilver,
The Daredevil.

1260
01:10:18,967 --> 01:10:20,445
Daredevil? I'm so sorry.

1261
01:10:20,469 --> 01:10:21,837
- It's fine.
- Okay.

1262
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:26,592
Even that sweet, baby angel,
Johnny Storm.

1263
01:10:27,143 --> 01:10:28,886
He up and gone missing like...

1264
01:10:28,978 --> 01:10:30,179
what, two days ago?

1265
01:10:30,688 --> 01:10:32,598
Ugh. That's so sad.

1266
01:10:33,107 --> 01:10:36,060
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1267
01:10:37,028 --> 01:10:40,257
Look, there's, there's strength
in numbers. All right? Us...

1268
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:41,801
plus, you guys.
We can put Cassandra...

1269
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:44,094
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1270
01:10:44,118 --> 01:10:45,846
I know what it means to feel self-doubt.

1271
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,431
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1272
01:10:47,455 --> 01:10:49,516
Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1273
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,351
It's like you're holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1274
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:54,146
You guys may not have been
able to save your universes.

1275
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:55,830
But you can avenge them.

1276
01:10:56,422 --> 01:10:57,942
It's what Johnny would have wanted.

1277
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,835
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1278
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:02,947
Oh, yeah.

1279
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:04,949
Dickhead here talked him
into a team up...

1280
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:07,493
and Johnny came down
with a little case of the deads.

1281
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:08,911
No, no, no.
We don't know that.

1282
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:11,205
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1283
01:11:11,229 --> 01:11:13,958
If he survived that, he is prayin' for death.

1284
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:16,419
- Thank you, Doctor Wolverine!
- Spill it!

1285
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:17,795
What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1286
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:19,171
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1287
01:11:19,195 --> 01:11:20,605
Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

1288
01:11:21,072 --> 01:11:22,049
Look.

1289
01:11:22,073 --> 01:11:24,510
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1290
01:11:24,534 --> 01:11:26,387
Then she zip-zapped his skin...

1291
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:28,598
leaving his organs to
splash crudely onto the ground...

1292
01:11:28,622 --> 01:11:31,309
while the soil greedily drank his blood.
It was horrible.

1293
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:32,867
He was like a brother to me.

1294
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:36,439
Look, he died before
he could make a difference. But...

1295
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:38,941
Look, maybe you couldn't
save your worlds, but...

1296
01:11:38,965 --> 01:11:41,652
but Jesus Christ, you can save mine!

1297
01:11:41,676 --> 01:11:44,280
I don't give a shit about
your world, but...

1298
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:47,367
if these two made it out of there alive,
maybe together...

1299
01:11:47,391 --> 01:11:49,160
we can get back in.
And take her down.

1300
01:11:49,184 --> 01:11:51,928
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, <i>Chère.</i>

1301
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:56,042
If we can block her psychic powers,
we can get a leg up. I know it.

1302
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:57,809
Now I know Magneto's dead.

1303
01:11:58,152 --> 01:12:00,213
But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet...

1304
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:02,757
- is lying around here somewhere...
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1305
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:04,050
- Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1306
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:05,135
Fuck!

1307
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:06,094
She don't play.

1308
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:09,180
She knows that helmet was the only way
to protect anyone from her powers.

1309
01:12:09,204 --> 01:12:11,682
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut's, but...

1310
01:12:11,706 --> 01:12:13,935
- he works for Cassandra.
- Juggernaut's helmet. That's it.

1311
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:15,645
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off...

1312
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:18,106
- without that dome gonna come off wit'it.
- I'm so sorry, beautiful.

1313
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:21,609
I want this to be gentle.
Who is your dialect coach? The Minions?

1314
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:24,669
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1315
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:28,883
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1316
01:12:29,975 --> 01:12:32,037
Let's face it, our worlds forgot about us.

1317
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:33,830
Or never learned about us.

1318
01:12:33,854 --> 01:12:35,290
The heroes we were.

1319
01:12:35,314 --> 01:12:36,583
Lives we saved.

1320
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,209
Or wanted to save.

1321
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:40,102
Maybe these two are our chance.

1322
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:42,813
To be remembered.

1323
01:12:43,072 --> 01:12:44,356
The way we deserve.

1324
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:46,427
Yes.

1325
01:12:46,451 --> 01:12:47,567
An ending.

1326
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:49,513
- Legacy.
- Yes!

1327
01:12:49,537 --> 01:12:51,264
Yes! Let this man cook.

1328
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:52,683
This is what I'm talking about.

1329
01:12:52,707 --> 01:12:54,685
Big slow-motion fights, sad music.

1330
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:57,813
Everybody working together. Who knows
if you live or die? That sorta thing.

1331
01:12:57,837 --> 01:12:59,981
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1332
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:01,149
Yes!
Gambit?

1333
01:13:01,173 --> 01:13:04,236
I ain't know my daddy, but
I'm sure I shot out of his dick ready.

1334
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,154
Jesus Christ, that is graphic.

1335
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:08,199
Yeah. He was layin' them buttery nuts
all up in my mama...

1336
01:13:08,223 --> 01:13:10,215
and I shot out there and I said,
"What's up, Doc?"

1337
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:14,261
Johnny must have loved you.
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1338
01:13:14,937 --> 01:13:16,081
The name's Laura.

1339
01:13:16,105 --> 01:13:19,126
- Let's fucking go.
- Let's fucking go!

1340
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:20,919
- It's on like chicken and corn.
- Yeah!

1341
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:23,004
- We're doing this.
- You're all fuckin' dead.

1342
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:25,273
My God! Read the room.

1343
01:13:36,209 --> 01:13:39,329
Hey, hey. I'm not lookin'
for company. Get out of here.

1344
01:13:41,339 --> 01:13:42,582
You remind me of him.

1345
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:44,667
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1346
01:13:44,843 --> 01:13:47,003
- Sounds like a great guy...
- Wasn't finished.

1347
01:13:48,805 --> 01:13:50,506
Showed up when it mattered the most.

1348
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,385
Couldn't help it.

1349
01:13:57,605 --> 01:13:58,764
You might not know it, but...

1350
01:14:00,025 --> 01:14:01,351
you're a good man, Logan.

1351
01:14:03,486 --> 01:14:06,397
You might not know it, but apparently,
I'm the worst Logan.

1352
01:14:08,408 --> 01:14:10,235
I got to have a life because of you.

1353
01:14:13,163 --> 01:14:14,781
I got to grow up because of you.

1354
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,118
A lot of kids did.

1355
01:14:18,585 --> 01:14:20,704
A lot of kids didn't grow up because of me.

1356
01:14:22,756 --> 01:14:24,457
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1357
01:14:25,676 --> 01:14:27,335
That suit says different.

1358
01:14:27,803 --> 01:14:29,254
Yeah. Do you like it?

1359
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,634
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1360
01:14:35,769 --> 01:14:38,472
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1361
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:41,600
All of them.

1362
01:14:42,693 --> 01:14:46,104
They wanted me to be part of
the team, but I wouldn't.

1363
01:14:46,405 --> 01:14:49,733
Told 'em they all look fucking
ridiculous. I mean...

1364
01:14:51,577 --> 01:14:54,237
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1365
01:14:59,876 --> 01:15:03,079
And then one day, while I was off
on my own, the humans came...

1366
01:15:03,755 --> 01:15:05,249
and went mutant hunting.

1367
01:15:06,383 --> 01:15:07,610
I can guess the rest.

1368
01:15:07,634 --> 01:15:08,669
No, no, let me...

1369
01:15:10,179 --> 01:15:11,338
Let me say it. I...

1370
01:15:13,933 --> 01:15:15,092
I need to say it.

1371
01:15:17,769 --> 01:15:21,098
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar, it was too late.

1372
01:15:25,527 --> 01:15:26,728
They were dead. Every...

1373
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:36,405
This suit's all I got to remind
me of who they were.

1374
01:15:38,207 --> 01:15:39,283
And what I did.

1375
01:15:52,388 --> 01:15:54,048
We're headed to Cassandra's at sunup.

1376
01:15:54,891 --> 01:15:56,884
Have fun. Not my fight.

1377
01:16:00,187 --> 01:16:01,764
We won't pull this off without you.

1378
01:16:08,863 --> 01:16:12,191
Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

1379
01:16:14,952 --> 01:16:16,278
You were always the wrong guy.

1380
01:16:42,314 --> 01:16:43,291
What?

1381
01:16:43,315 --> 01:16:44,974
Alioth didn't get them.

1382
01:16:45,733 --> 01:16:48,087
Cassandra wanted to
play with them herself first.

1383
01:16:48,111 --> 01:16:49,088
<i>They got away.</i>

1384
01:16:49,112 --> 01:16:50,882
- Did they find the others?
- No.

1385
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,258
Good. All right. Phew.

1386
01:16:52,282 --> 01:16:53,467
<i>The others found them.</i>

1387
01:16:53,491 --> 01:16:56,262
Oh, very cute. Well done, Pyro.
Classic bait and switch.

1388
01:16:56,286 --> 01:16:57,945
- <i>You really got me there.</i>
- Relax.

1389
01:16:58,705 --> 01:17:01,142
If they come after Nova, she'll handle it.

1390
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:03,352
Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.

1391
01:17:03,376 --> 01:17:05,203
Why do you think we put
her there in the first place?

1392
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:07,691
Thank God she's never
chosen to leave The Void.

1393
01:17:07,715 --> 01:17:10,401
The Time Ripper is hours away
from completion.

1394
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:11,695
I cannot take any chances.

1395
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:12,904
Well, maybe not.

1396
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,155
<i>But I can.</i>

1397
01:17:14,179 --> 01:17:15,281
For a price.

1398
01:17:15,305 --> 01:17:16,908
<i>Why do you have to
say it in that silly voice?</i>

1399
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,159
It's so icky.

1400
01:17:18,183 --> 01:17:19,160
<i>You want it done or not?</i>

1401
01:17:19,184 --> 01:17:20,161
All right. Your price.

1402
01:17:20,185 --> 01:17:21,636
<i>Take her out.</i>

1403
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,847
Ugh. Mutants.

1404
01:17:45,878 --> 01:17:47,105
Ooh! Look at that there!

1405
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,983
You see them biggum hands come closed.
Ain't not a wonna gettin' up inside there.

1406
01:17:50,007 --> 01:17:51,401
I think what Gambit's
trying to say is...

1407
01:17:51,425 --> 01:17:54,279
getting Juggernaut's helmet
ain't gonna be easy.

1408
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,072
I'm just making stuff up at this...

1409
01:17:56,096 --> 01:17:58,006
- Yeah. Tilt up to Blade.
- Gun!

1410
01:18:02,561 --> 01:18:03,971
Where'd he get that little beauty?

1411
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:06,458
That's Punisher's AT4.

1412
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:08,627
Which Punisher?
There's been like five of them.

1413
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:10,143
There's only been one Blade...

1414
01:18:10,528 --> 01:18:12,646
and there's only ever gonna be one Blade.

1415
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:17,860
Incoming!

1416
01:19:24,436 --> 01:19:26,747
Ooh, this is gonna be good.

1417
01:19:26,771 --> 01:19:29,167
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

1418
01:19:29,191 --> 01:19:31,502
Whoo! I'm about to make
a name for myself here.

1419
01:19:31,526 --> 01:19:33,504
I don't think you guys walk away from this.

1420
01:19:33,528 --> 01:19:35,673
You just make sure people
know what happened here today.

1421
01:19:35,697 --> 01:19:37,800
And when you get out of here,
you have a drink for me, yeah?

1422
01:19:37,824 --> 01:19:40,303
You just stay on our six and get inside.

1423
01:19:40,327 --> 01:19:42,446
We'll make sure you get the package.

1424
01:19:42,746 --> 01:19:44,239
And we'll get our ending.

1425
01:20:54,235 --> 01:20:55,478
And boom!

1426
01:21:27,018 --> 01:21:29,345
Some motherfuckers still
trying to ice skate uphill.

1427
01:21:36,194 --> 01:21:38,313
You two escaping, I could live with.

1428
01:21:38,488 --> 01:21:41,357
But coming back? Willingly?

1429
01:21:42,784 --> 01:21:44,679
Boys are so silly.

1430
01:21:44,703 --> 01:21:45,972
I just need to get home.

1431
01:21:45,996 --> 01:21:48,432
Well, that's not on the menu, I'm afraid.

1432
01:21:48,456 --> 01:21:51,853
It's death or enslavement.
À la carte, of course.

1433
01:21:51,877 --> 01:21:53,078
Upsy-daisy.

1434
01:21:58,717 --> 01:21:59,736
Finally...

1435
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,779
it's nice to give someone else
a chance to talk.

1436
01:22:01,803 --> 01:22:03,421
Not my strong suit.

1437
01:22:21,532 --> 01:22:22,941
You shouldn't have done that.

1438
01:22:46,348 --> 01:22:48,967
You are an interesting one, aren't you?

1439
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:53,514
I do feel like you get
lost behind all of his...

1440
01:22:55,649 --> 01:22:58,352
Deadpools are a dime
a dozen here in The Void.

1441
01:22:59,111 --> 01:23:00,687
But you...

1442
01:23:00,988 --> 01:23:04,191
What's going on in here?

1443
01:23:17,546 --> 01:23:18,872
Interesting...

1444
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:21,959
Not what I expected back here.

1445
01:23:22,844 --> 01:23:24,253
Behind the anger.

1446
01:23:28,182 --> 01:23:29,300
You're hiding.

1447
01:23:29,433 --> 01:23:30,467
From them.

1448
01:23:31,477 --> 01:23:33,345
From all the ones you let down.

1449
01:23:35,815 --> 01:23:37,224
So much pain.

1450
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:40,687
I walked away.

1451
01:23:41,904 --> 01:23:43,591
They called after me and I...

1452
01:23:43,615 --> 01:23:45,551
I walked away.

1453
01:23:45,575 --> 01:23:47,344
I always do.

1454
01:23:47,368 --> 01:23:49,278
- <i>Logan!</i>
- I know.

1455
01:23:50,497 --> 01:23:51,932
That's not all you did.

1456
01:23:51,956 --> 01:23:53,575
Is it?

1457
01:23:56,919 --> 01:23:58,496
You found them.

1458
01:23:59,297 --> 01:24:00,498
The X-Men.

1459
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,921
Dead.

1460
01:24:09,474 --> 01:24:10,883
Piled like wood.

1461
01:24:12,394 --> 01:24:13,761
<i>What did you do?</i>

1462
01:24:16,273 --> 01:24:17,682
I started killing.

1463
01:24:18,275 --> 01:24:20,977
And I couldn't stop. I didn't wanna stop.

1464
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:25,106
<i>All those bad men.</i>

1465
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,445
It's not just the bad ones.

1466
01:24:31,914 --> 01:24:33,281
My little animal.

1467
01:24:35,959 --> 01:24:38,953
And I turned the whole world
against the X-Men.

1468
01:24:39,129 --> 01:24:40,330
Blade!

1469
01:24:45,718 --> 01:24:47,129
Just once...

1470
01:24:48,889 --> 01:24:51,633
I wanna be the man
that Charles thought I was.

1471
01:24:52,642 --> 01:24:53,969
Logan...

1472
01:24:55,353 --> 01:24:59,224
in The Void you can be what you are.

1473
01:25:01,443 --> 01:25:03,103
I just wanna be free.

1474
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:05,355
I can set you free.

1475
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:22,122
I can silence all those voices.

1476
01:25:28,762 --> 01:25:29,963
I've got you.

1477
01:25:32,391 --> 01:25:33,592
I've got you.

1478
01:25:34,142 --> 01:25:35,177
No.

1479
01:25:36,437 --> 01:25:37,680
I got you.

1480
01:25:46,155 --> 01:25:47,924
Get it off!

1481
01:25:47,948 --> 01:25:51,220
You're gonna send us home,
or I'm gonna twist your fucking head off.

1482
01:25:51,244 --> 01:25:52,528
Why are you laughing?

1483
01:25:52,995 --> 01:25:56,990
I can't send you home
unless you get this thing off my head.

1484
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:58,643
And as soon as you do that...

1485
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:01,688
I'm going to boil your brains
on an atomic level whilst...

1486
01:26:01,712 --> 01:26:04,441
flicking my bean to the Enya box set.

1487
01:26:04,465 --> 01:26:05,650
There's an Enya box set?

1488
01:26:05,674 --> 01:26:07,069
Either you kill me...

1489
01:26:07,093 --> 01:26:08,419
or I kill you.

1490
01:26:09,303 --> 01:26:11,046
Both wonderful options.

1491
01:26:11,389 --> 01:26:12,423
You want me to do it?

1492
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:13,700
No, I'll do it.

1493
01:26:13,724 --> 01:26:15,911
I have her neck right here.
It's really no problem.

1494
01:26:15,935 --> 01:26:16,787
You'll screw it up.

1495
01:26:16,811 --> 01:26:19,555
Oh, come on, Mr. PG-13,
except the last one!

1496
01:26:20,231 --> 01:26:21,515
What the fuck?

1497
01:26:23,651 --> 01:26:26,046
You have no idea what it's like!

1498
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:29,133
Day after day. Shovel the shit.

1499
01:26:29,157 --> 01:26:30,635
Fetch the meats.

1500
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:32,818
I have spent my entire...

1501
01:26:35,622 --> 01:26:37,323
Not everyone gets a speech.

1502
01:26:39,083 --> 01:26:40,227
She's gonna die.

1503
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:41,854
Okay. Hey, hey.
If I take this helmet off...

1504
01:26:41,878 --> 01:26:43,814
- do you promise you won't kill us?
- Fuck!

1505
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:44,815
I promise...

1506
01:26:44,839 --> 01:26:46,776
I will kill you first thing.

1507
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,193
Why are you like this?

1508
01:26:48,217 --> 01:26:49,612
I wish I knew.

1509
01:26:49,636 --> 01:26:50,655
Take it off.

1510
01:26:50,679 --> 01:26:51,697
- What?
- Take it off.

1511
01:26:51,721 --> 01:26:52,698
- Why?
- Just take it off.

1512
01:26:52,722 --> 01:26:55,675
- This is our only chance
to fix our shit! - Take it off!

1513
01:26:57,394 --> 01:26:58,845
I am wearing this suit.

1514
01:26:59,854 --> 01:27:02,181
And that means a lot of things,
but most of all...

1515
01:27:03,483 --> 01:27:04,809
it means I'm an X-Man.

1516
01:27:05,735 --> 01:27:07,353
And I know your brother.

1517
01:27:09,489 --> 01:27:11,133
As much as I want to fucking kill you...

1518
01:27:11,157 --> 01:27:13,803
every bone in my body
wants to fucking kill you...

1519
01:27:13,827 --> 01:27:17,030
he would not let me stand here
and watch you die!

1520
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:20,700
Take your hands off.

1521
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:23,620
This is for him.

1522
01:27:25,339 --> 01:27:26,790
This is for Charles.

1523
01:27:37,226 --> 01:27:40,053
Hey, no, no, no!
Don't you dare do me like Johnny!

1524
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:47,477
My brother loved you.

1525
01:27:49,154 --> 01:27:50,439
He loved all of us.

1526
01:27:53,325 --> 01:27:54,609
Must be nice.

1527
01:27:55,535 --> 01:27:57,029
He would've loved you, too.

1528
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:01,075
If he knew about you...

1529
01:28:02,668 --> 01:28:04,312
if he knew where you were...

1530
01:28:04,336 --> 01:28:07,581
he would've torn a hole in the fucking
universe to bring you home.

1531
01:28:11,218 --> 01:28:12,502
This is my home.

1532
01:28:13,387 --> 01:28:15,840
Well, then at least let us save his.

1533
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:21,511
You want to hear something crazy?

1534
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:26,350
An amateur magician
rolled through here a while back.

1535
01:28:27,067 --> 01:28:28,728
I killed him, of course.

1536
01:28:29,236 --> 01:28:31,689
Wore his skin around for four days.

1537
01:28:32,532 --> 01:28:33,509
But...

1538
01:28:33,533 --> 01:28:35,093
I found this...

1539
01:28:35,117 --> 01:28:37,095
little trinket...

1540
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:39,390
on his lovely fingers.

1541
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:40,781
Strange!

1542
01:28:43,668 --> 01:28:45,995
- Marvel sparkle circle.
- What is that?

1543
01:28:46,712 --> 01:28:48,774
This is your way home.

1544
01:28:48,798 --> 01:28:52,403
I do owe you for saving my life.
But let's keep things interesting.

1545
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:55,921
I'd say you have about four seconds
before you're Alioth's food.

1546
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:01,636
Race ya.

1547
01:30:25,103 --> 01:30:26,831
{\an8}And as I said
we've got a standard three-year...

1548
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:28,291
{\an8}bumper to bumper warranty.

1549
01:30:28,315 --> 01:30:30,210
Glad you gave us a second chance.

1550
01:30:30,234 --> 01:30:33,979
And don't worry. Wade and I are a team,
so I'll see he gets half the commission...

1551
01:30:36,365 --> 01:30:38,718
That feels like a Kia.

1552
01:30:38,742 --> 01:30:40,569
It's a fucking Kia Carnival, isn't it?

1553
01:30:42,246 --> 01:30:45,225
Holy shit. That's Deadpool.

1554
01:30:45,249 --> 01:30:46,518
And that's Wolverine.

1555
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:47,769
You're damn straight it is.

1556
01:30:47,793 --> 01:30:48,853
Fox killed him.

1557
01:30:48,877 --> 01:30:51,622
Disney brought him back. They're going
to make him do this 'til he's 90.

1558
01:30:51,964 --> 01:30:53,124
Let's go.

1559
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:55,000
I'll clock you out!

1560
01:30:55,176 --> 01:30:56,585
Forever!

1561
01:30:57,094 --> 01:30:58,295
Forever.

1562
01:31:05,477 --> 01:31:06,830
Wakey-wakey.

1563
01:31:06,854 --> 01:31:08,055
God?

1564
01:31:09,606 --> 01:31:12,518
Now you put all
these bullets in my belly...

1565
01:31:13,027 --> 01:31:14,770
and I'm gonna find out why.

1566
01:31:16,989 --> 01:31:18,565
I'll just say it.

1567
01:31:19,075 --> 01:31:21,011
You don't have to stick
your fingers in me.

1568
01:31:21,035 --> 01:31:23,487
Jesus, just ask sometimes.

1569
01:31:23,663 --> 01:31:24,906
Fine.

1570
01:31:25,915 --> 01:31:27,116
Really?

1571
01:31:27,584 --> 01:31:29,035
Hands in pockets.

1572
01:31:30,377 --> 01:31:31,746
Guy named Paradox.

1573
01:31:32,464 --> 01:31:33,857
He said he'd get me out of The Void.

1574
01:31:33,881 --> 01:31:35,818
All I know is he works for the TVA.

1575
01:31:35,842 --> 01:31:36,985
The TVA.

1576
01:31:37,009 --> 01:31:38,252
We had an agreement.

1577
01:31:38,344 --> 01:31:40,087
I don't think this guy cares.

1578
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:42,423
He will.

1579
01:31:42,724 --> 01:31:43,966
Hey, people!

1580
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,370
How much longer
before the Time Ripper is active?

1581
01:31:46,394 --> 01:31:48,372
We're running the final safety checks.

1582
01:31:48,396 --> 01:31:50,499
Okay. All right.
Thanks for all your hard work, Ralph.

1583
01:31:50,523 --> 01:31:52,042
- Take your time.
- Really?

1584
01:31:52,066 --> 01:31:53,752
No, you drooling boob!

1585
01:31:53,776 --> 01:31:55,003
No! We have company.

1586
01:31:55,027 --> 01:31:58,230
Cancel the safety checks.
We need to be live now!

1587
01:31:58,365 --> 01:32:00,024
I hate you so much.

1588
01:32:02,034 --> 01:32:03,179
No! Stop!

1589
01:32:03,203 --> 01:32:04,930
Piss off! You're too late.

1590
01:32:04,954 --> 01:32:06,849
- You're fuckin' done.
- Why was Thor crying?

1591
01:32:06,873 --> 01:32:08,016
How dare you!

1592
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,353
No one comes back from The Void.

1593
01:32:10,377 --> 01:32:12,036
Tell that to Cassandra Nova.

1594
01:32:20,678 --> 01:32:22,672
Paradox.
We have a problem.

1595
01:32:25,558 --> 01:32:26,968
Paradox.

1596
01:32:29,104 --> 01:32:31,707
Well, you are doughier than
you looked in Pyro's head.

1597
01:32:31,731 --> 01:32:33,042
You tried to kill me.

1598
01:32:33,066 --> 01:32:34,267
I literally have no...

1599
01:32:35,027 --> 01:32:38,896
<i>You come for the king,
you better kill the king.</i>

1600
01:32:39,614 --> 01:32:42,135
Welcome to the skull fuck club, Paradox.

1601
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,486
You know she doesn't wash that hand.

1602
01:32:46,038 --> 01:32:47,364
What's this?

1603
01:32:48,498 --> 01:32:49,976
A Time Ripper?

1604
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,853
- Naughty boy.
- Oh, no. We're on it.

1605
01:32:51,877 --> 01:32:53,647
We're gonna head down
and dismantle that thing now.

1606
01:32:53,671 --> 01:32:56,107
We got ya, boo.
You just keep playing those keys.

1607
01:32:56,131 --> 01:32:57,833
I don't want to destroy it.

1608
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,835
I want to use it.

1609
01:33:00,177 --> 01:33:02,880
Now, shoo. Mummy and
Daddy are having a conversation.

1610
01:33:09,394 --> 01:33:11,330
You know, the funny thing is...

1611
01:33:11,354 --> 01:33:13,015
I was happy in The Void.

1612
01:33:13,857 --> 01:33:16,920
You sent your trash to me.
Alioth and I cleaned it up.

1613
01:33:16,944 --> 01:33:19,104
Everyone was happy.

1614
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:23,009
And then you had to go
and piss on my side of the fence.

1615
01:33:23,033 --> 01:33:25,402
And so now the fence must come down.

1616
01:33:25,911 --> 01:33:27,889
I'm going to use your little Time Ripper.

1617
01:33:27,913 --> 01:33:30,642
And I'm going to destroy this universe...

1618
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:33,520
and the next and the next
and the next...

1619
01:33:33,544 --> 01:33:37,274
until all that's left is The Void.

1620
01:33:37,298 --> 01:33:39,375
And I get to play God.

1621
01:33:39,717 --> 01:33:40,918
Come on.

1622
01:33:41,177 --> 01:33:44,156
Now you're going to show me how
to use this fancy gadget of yours.

1623
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:47,758
And don't worry, I've called some friends
to make sure we're not disturbed.

1624
01:33:51,145 --> 01:33:53,889
Sorry to bother, madam,
but there's something you need to see.

1625
01:33:54,232 --> 01:33:58,436
We're getting indications of an unsanctioned
Time Ripper activating on Earth-10005.

1626
01:34:00,529 --> 01:34:01,939
Whose district is that?

1627
01:34:02,115 --> 01:34:03,232
Paradox.

1628
01:34:15,086 --> 01:34:17,439
Well, thank you so much
for your help, darling.

1629
01:34:17,463 --> 01:34:20,025
God. Good to get out of that head.

1630
01:34:20,049 --> 01:34:21,750
What a mess!

1631
01:34:28,892 --> 01:34:29,926
Stop!

1632
01:34:30,226 --> 01:34:32,371
Let's give it a beat
for the extras to clear.

1633
01:34:32,395 --> 01:34:34,638
Go, go, go!
Oh, my God!

1634
01:34:39,235 --> 01:34:42,105
- Oh. My. God.
- Fuck.

1635
01:34:49,663 --> 01:34:51,239
It's her!

1636
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:53,617
Come on, girl!

1637
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,250
Come on, girl!

1638
01:35:16,815 --> 01:35:18,084
That's my girl!

1639
01:35:18,108 --> 01:35:21,546
We don't have to be apart ever,
ever again. Never, ever...

1640
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:22,854
- Sorry!
- Fuck!

1641
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,716
What's Café Gratitude doing here?

1642
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:27,135
Sorry about that.

1643
01:35:27,159 --> 01:35:30,695
Tremble not, sweet Mary Puppins.
I'll handle him.

1644
01:35:31,121 --> 01:35:32,307
Come here, girl.
Papa's here.

1645
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:34,949
Hey, do not insult
this animal's autonomy.

1646
01:35:35,459 --> 01:35:37,645
She can decide who her papa is.

1647
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:38,855
What's it gonna be, girl, huh?

1648
01:35:38,879 --> 01:35:41,581
Original recipe or Van Milder here?

1649
01:35:42,007 --> 01:35:45,085
That's funny. I can
gently tap the fourth wall too.

1650
01:35:45,385 --> 01:35:46,753
<i>The Proposal.</i>

1651
01:35:48,305 --> 01:35:49,449
The fuck was that?

1652
01:35:49,473 --> 01:35:51,841
- Bitch, you think that's what I do?
- Both of you shut up.

1653
01:35:53,143 --> 01:35:54,287
You smell somethin'?

1654
01:35:54,311 --> 01:35:55,345
Yeah, you.

1655
01:35:56,021 --> 01:35:57,807
A lot of you.

1656
01:36:12,788 --> 01:36:15,240
Told you there were
a lot of Deadpools over there.

1657
01:36:26,594 --> 01:36:27,962
That's bad.

1658
01:36:50,285 --> 01:36:51,595
I take it they're not friendly.

1659
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:52,638
Goodness, no.

1660
01:36:52,662 --> 01:36:54,848
Sorry about this, boys.
Mission over.

1661
01:36:54,872 --> 01:36:57,684
Cause of death,
one hundred kill-thirsty Deadpools.

1662
01:36:57,708 --> 01:36:58,936
They're dumb.

1663
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,854
But they can fight.
Not me, though.

1664
01:37:00,878 --> 01:37:03,232
Would love to get in the mix
but I have low bone density...

1665
01:37:03,256 --> 01:37:04,957
and I have to keep my face safe.

1666
01:37:05,716 --> 01:37:06,861
- Hold, please.
- Oh, God.

1667
01:37:06,885 --> 01:37:08,294
All right. Look.

1668
01:37:08,761 --> 01:37:09,962
Guys!

1669
01:37:10,972 --> 01:37:12,867
Deadpool Prime here.

1670
01:37:12,891 --> 01:37:14,493
- Our fight isn't with you...
- Hey!

1671
01:37:14,517 --> 01:37:18,289
When I want your opinion,
I'll take Wolverine's dick out of your mouth.

1672
01:37:18,313 --> 01:37:20,041
That's Kidpool.
She's the dirtiest.

1673
01:37:20,065 --> 01:37:21,458
Can we just be done?

1674
01:37:21,482 --> 01:37:23,169
We're just getting started.

1675
01:37:23,193 --> 01:37:26,687
No, no, no.
With the whole multiverse thing.

1676
01:37:27,405 --> 01:37:28,549
It's not great.

1677
01:37:28,573 --> 01:37:30,233
It's just been miss...

1678
01:37:30,491 --> 01:37:32,136
after miss...

1679
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,070
after miss.

1680
01:37:34,245 --> 01:37:36,724
Look, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>
did the multiverse first...

1681
01:37:36,748 --> 01:37:39,242
and they did it best.
The gays knew it.

1682
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,895
But we didn't listen.

1683
01:37:40,919 --> 01:37:43,815
Let's just take the L and move on.

1684
01:37:43,839 --> 01:37:46,317
I think it's been steadily great
since <i>Endgame.</i>

1685
01:37:46,341 --> 01:37:47,944
What are you talking about?

1686
01:37:47,968 --> 01:37:49,571
The multiverse is over.

1687
01:37:49,595 --> 01:37:52,615
Cassandy gonna destroy
the fuck outta every timeline.

1688
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:55,076
- Y'all can't do shit about it.
- Do you not get it?

1689
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,454
If we don't go down to the subway
and stop her, we all die.

1690
01:37:57,478 --> 01:37:59,872
Say, the boss lady don't want
no disturbances.

1691
01:37:59,896 --> 01:38:02,750
You wanna get down to the subway,
you gotta go through us.

1692
01:38:02,774 --> 01:38:03,934
Uzi time, baby.

1693
01:38:04,025 --> 01:38:05,169
Uzi time, baby.

1694
01:38:05,193 --> 01:38:06,394
Look alive!

1695
01:38:15,662 --> 01:38:17,474
- I think I'm hit.
- No shit.

1696
01:38:17,498 --> 01:38:18,558
You did that on purpose.

1697
01:38:18,582 --> 01:38:20,268
I did no such thing!

1698
01:38:20,292 --> 01:38:21,436
Listen to me, gorgeous.

1699
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:22,854
How long does it take
for you to regenerate?

1700
01:38:22,878 --> 01:38:24,330
Regenerate?

1701
01:38:30,344 --> 01:38:32,280
You really are God's perfect idiot,
aren't you?

1702
01:38:32,304 --> 01:38:33,823
- I'm okay.
- How dare you!

1703
01:38:33,847 --> 01:38:35,909
You insensitive son of a bitch!

1704
01:38:35,933 --> 01:38:37,995
How was I supposed to know
he doesn't regenerate?

1705
01:38:38,019 --> 01:38:39,345
I'm not a medicine woman.

1706
01:38:39,603 --> 01:38:40,998
Look. A donut cart.

1707
01:38:41,022 --> 01:38:42,249
- They're practically hospitals.
- What?

1708
01:38:42,273 --> 01:38:44,251
- They sell portable triage units.
- They don't.

1709
01:38:44,275 --> 01:38:45,961
- I'm gonna get you to safety.
- He's not.

1710
01:38:45,985 --> 01:38:47,353
Deep breath.

1711
01:38:55,536 --> 01:38:57,681
Hey, why are we stopping?

1712
01:38:57,705 --> 01:38:59,057
I'm just catching my breath.

1713
01:38:59,081 --> 01:39:01,810
What, are your legs on vacation?
You're dead weight!

1714
01:39:01,834 --> 01:39:03,561
That's because I'm paralyzed.

1715
01:39:03,585 --> 01:39:05,731
We all have problems.
Listen to me.

1716
01:39:05,755 --> 01:39:06,956
You're gonna live.

1717
01:39:07,882 --> 01:39:09,333
Look at me, Nicepool.

1718
01:39:13,095 --> 01:39:14,463
You're gonna live.

1719
01:39:14,972 --> 01:39:16,423
Say it!

1720
01:39:16,766 --> 01:39:18,300
I'm gonna live.

1721
01:39:18,392 --> 01:39:20,579
Say it with me.
You're gonna live.

1722
01:39:20,603 --> 01:39:22,972
I'm gonna live!

1723
01:39:24,106 --> 01:39:26,293
Say it louder!

1724
01:39:26,317 --> 01:39:27,685
I'm gonna live...

1725
01:39:36,411 --> 01:39:37,612
Hold your fire!

1726
01:39:39,747 --> 01:39:41,240
Sweet little puppy.

1727
01:39:51,884 --> 01:39:54,488
God damn it!
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1728
01:39:54,512 --> 01:39:56,740
God, he loved his face.

1729
01:39:56,764 --> 01:39:59,285
I can taste his final thought.

1730
01:39:59,309 --> 01:40:00,995
He was so afraid.

1731
01:40:01,019 --> 01:40:02,121
But he died a hero.

1732
01:40:02,145 --> 01:40:04,207
He died from murder, you dumb fuck.

1733
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:06,224
And all I have to remember him by...

1734
01:40:06,941 --> 01:40:10,812
are these two gold-plated,
...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros.

1735
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:12,230
This is for him.

1736
01:40:12,655 --> 01:40:14,023
Are you ready?

1737
01:40:14,407 --> 01:40:16,302
I get to kill a hundred yous?

1738
01:40:16,326 --> 01:40:17,735
Fuck yeah, I'm ready.

1739
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:20,056
Hey, you don't want to see this, bub.

1740
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,573
That's a good girl.

1741
01:40:58,326 --> 01:40:59,846
Holy shit.

1742
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:02,098
You save the good stuff
for special occasions?

1743
01:41:02,122 --> 01:41:03,517
Killing mostly.

1744
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:06,076
What's the wind resistance
on those blowjob handles?

1745
01:41:07,169 --> 01:41:10,565
I'm sorry. I'm just
a catty bitch when I'm jealous.

1746
01:41:10,589 --> 01:41:12,040
All right, let's do this.

1747
01:41:12,215 --> 01:41:13,626
Maximum effort.

1748
01:41:53,132 --> 01:41:54,417
You're dead.

1749
01:42:20,118 --> 01:42:21,569
Motherfucker.

1750
01:42:22,286 --> 01:42:24,113
I wish I were deaf.

1751
01:42:43,767 --> 01:42:45,745
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

1752
01:42:45,769 --> 01:42:47,011
I don't wanna...

1753
01:43:00,492 --> 01:43:01,802
Come on.

1754
01:43:01,826 --> 01:43:02,970
I blew it.

1755
01:43:02,994 --> 01:43:05,181
After all that, the only thing
they're gonna remember...

1756
01:43:05,205 --> 01:43:07,115
is that God awful dismount!

1757
01:43:11,753 --> 01:43:13,455
What you laughing at,
you little fucker?

1758
01:43:13,588 --> 01:43:14,857
Uh-oh.

1759
01:43:14,881 --> 01:43:16,124
Uh-oh.

1760
01:43:20,137 --> 01:43:21,921
I guess these ones regenerate.

1761
01:43:23,849 --> 01:43:26,369
Come on.
We don't have time for this.

1762
01:43:26,393 --> 01:43:27,578
Deadpools!

1763
01:43:27,602 --> 01:43:28,887
Stand down.

1764
01:43:39,198 --> 01:43:40,842
This Deadpool's with me.

1765
01:43:40,866 --> 01:43:42,218
Oh, no.

1766
01:43:42,242 --> 01:43:43,594
Holy shit.

1767
01:43:43,618 --> 01:43:45,029
That's fuckin' Peter!

1768
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,018
Wait, you...
You guys know Peter?

1769
01:43:50,042 --> 01:43:52,312
You kidding me?
Every Deadpool has a Peter.

1770
01:43:52,336 --> 01:43:56,066
Shit. Peter's a goddamn legend
in every Deadpool's world.

1771
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:57,374
Peter<i>-san.</i>

1772
01:44:05,558 --> 01:44:07,843
Peter. Peter. Peter.

1773
01:44:13,691 --> 01:44:15,434
Enjoy my Peter.

1774
01:44:42,803 --> 01:44:45,407
Oh, now you're here.
Oh, well, you're too late. It's all over.

1775
01:44:45,431 --> 01:44:46,408
Not yet, it's not.

1776
01:44:46,432 --> 01:44:48,244
Whoa. No, no, no.
We're very close.

1777
01:44:48,268 --> 01:44:49,745
Homestretch, folks. Promise.

1778
01:44:49,769 --> 01:44:51,413
Quick, let's up the stakes.

1779
01:44:51,437 --> 01:44:52,915
If she steals the Time Ripper's energy...

1780
01:44:52,939 --> 01:44:55,542
she has the power to
shred the fabric of all realities...

1781
01:44:55,566 --> 01:44:57,336
until there is nothing left but The Void.

1782
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,519
How do we shut it down?

1783
01:44:58,736 --> 01:44:59,854
I don't know.

1784
01:45:01,406 --> 01:45:02,633
How about now?

1785
01:45:02,657 --> 01:45:04,135
The mask is really intimidating, huh?

1786
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,303
It's like Batman,
except he can move his neck.

1787
01:45:06,327 --> 01:45:07,946
Okay, look, look, look.

1788
01:45:09,205 --> 01:45:11,726
The Ripper is fed from
a secure chamber below ground.

1789
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:16,022
It is powered by twin matter and anti-matter
feeds converging inside the device.

1790
01:45:16,046 --> 01:45:17,314
<i>Now, Cassandra Nova...</i>

1791
01:45:17,338 --> 01:45:19,651
<i>is redirecting the Ripper's power
to eliminate all timelines...</i>

1792
01:45:19,675 --> 01:45:20,818
starting with this one.

1793
01:45:20,842 --> 01:45:22,319
Theoretically, you could stop her...

1794
01:45:22,343 --> 01:45:24,321
by short-circuiting the feeds
in the chamber below.

1795
01:45:24,345 --> 01:45:26,866
One of you were to create a
circuit between the two feeds...

1796
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:30,244
then the released power
would destroy the machine.

1797
01:45:30,268 --> 01:45:32,204
- But, well, but...
- Come on, man.

1798
01:45:32,228 --> 01:45:34,373
If you're not gonna swallow, spit it out.

1799
01:45:34,397 --> 01:45:37,585
Whoever formed the bridge
would be annihilated.

1800
01:45:37,609 --> 01:45:39,379
- I could live with that.
- Yeah, I could live with that, too, actually.

1801
01:45:39,403 --> 01:45:41,255
You know, we survive anything.
We're like cockroaches.

1802
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:42,339
Not this time.

1803
01:45:42,363 --> 01:45:45,176
This is matter and anti-matter.

1804
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,261
They do not play nicely with each other.

1805
01:45:47,285 --> 01:45:50,238
When they mix in your body
you will be atomized.

1806
01:45:50,622 --> 01:45:52,767
Trust the laws of physics
if you don't trust me.

1807
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:54,977
Even if you lived long enough to
make the circuit...

1808
01:45:55,001 --> 01:45:57,746
you will die down there.

1809
01:46:22,904 --> 01:46:24,382
Hold off. Hold.

1810
01:46:24,406 --> 01:46:26,051
You heard that asshole upstairs.

1811
01:46:26,075 --> 01:46:30,321
Even if we pull this off,
we're dead. Permanently.

1812
01:46:30,746 --> 01:46:31,932
That's why it's got to be me.

1813
01:46:31,956 --> 01:46:32,989
What?

1814
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:37,744
Look, man...

1815
01:46:38,796 --> 01:46:40,747
you didn't ask for any of this.

1816
01:46:41,007 --> 01:46:42,333
You were right.

1817
01:46:42,466 --> 01:46:43,584
I lied.

1818
01:46:44,343 --> 01:46:46,196
I lied right to your face...

1819
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:48,297
just to get you to help me.
And you did.

1820
01:46:49,015 --> 01:46:50,674
You didn't lie.

1821
01:46:52,476 --> 01:46:54,053
You made an educated wish.

1822
01:46:56,939 --> 01:46:57,974
Come on.

1823
01:46:59,191 --> 01:47:01,143
You got a whole world to go back to.

1824
01:47:02,612 --> 01:47:03,645
I got nothin'.

1825
01:47:05,782 --> 01:47:06,816
I got nothin'.

1826
01:47:11,871 --> 01:47:12,905
Give me this.

1827
01:47:19,879 --> 01:47:21,288
Hey.

1828
01:47:25,593 --> 01:47:27,629
I waited a long time for this team up.

1829
01:47:29,722 --> 01:47:30,882
You know something?

1830
01:47:32,725 --> 01:47:34,427
You were the best Wolverine.

1831
01:47:43,111 --> 01:47:45,104
Say hi to your friends for me.

1832
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,227
No!

1833
01:47:58,251 --> 01:47:59,353
Open the door!

1834
01:47:59,377 --> 01:48:02,148
I can't hear you over all the
noble sacrifice.

1835
01:48:02,172 --> 01:48:03,441
Why are you fucking doing this?

1836
01:48:03,465 --> 01:48:06,793
Because I'm Marvel Jesus.

1837
01:48:08,303 --> 01:48:09,504
Or Spock.

1838
01:48:10,555 --> 01:48:11,756
Hard to say.

1839
01:48:16,186 --> 01:48:17,220
Wade!

1840
01:48:17,771 --> 01:48:19,932
You fucking idiot!

1841
01:48:24,903 --> 01:48:26,172
Sorry, I'm just stalling.

1842
01:48:26,196 --> 01:48:28,690
I think I'm nervous about dying.

1843
01:48:29,324 --> 01:48:30,650
This should be me.

1844
01:48:31,159 --> 01:48:32,971
Say hi to my friends for me, peanut.

1845
01:48:32,995 --> 01:48:34,138
Wade!

1846
01:48:34,162 --> 01:48:36,349
You want to be an annoying prick,
do it this side!

1847
01:48:36,373 --> 01:48:38,616
You're gonna die in there,
you dumb fuck!

1848
01:48:45,424 --> 01:48:47,292
Hey! You don't need to do this.

1849
01:48:47,510 --> 01:48:49,336
I'm not doing it 'cause I need it.

1850
01:48:50,178 --> 01:48:52,380
I'm doing it because they do.

1851
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:04,602
No!

1852
01:49:33,764 --> 01:49:35,466
He's not gonna make it.

1853
01:49:43,983 --> 01:49:45,268
It's over.

1854
01:50:52,594 --> 01:50:54,128
<i>The Wolverine.</i>

1855
01:50:55,013 --> 01:50:57,006
<i>He's a hero in my world.</i>

1856
01:50:59,101 --> 01:51:01,803
<i>Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.</i>

1857
01:51:03,147 --> 01:51:05,098
<i>You were always the wrong guy...</i>

1858
01:51:06,441 --> 01:51:08,268
<i>till you weren't.</i>

1859
01:51:10,112 --> 01:51:11,813
<i>Wade.</i>

1860
01:51:13,532 --> 01:51:18,320
<i>Wade. You can finally,
finally, matter.</i>

1861
01:51:34,178 --> 01:51:35,379
Vanessa.

1862
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,674
<i>I wanna see Vanessa.</i>

1863
01:51:45,773 --> 01:51:50,185
For the first time in my life,
I am proud to wear this suit.

1864
01:51:51,195 --> 01:51:53,063
<i>It means I'm an X-Man.</i>

1865
01:51:55,365 --> 01:51:57,151
I am the X-Man.

1866
01:52:41,037 --> 01:52:42,780
Paradox.

1867
01:52:44,415 --> 01:52:45,783
You've been busy.

1868
01:52:46,001 --> 01:52:47,186
Well, somebody had to be.

1869
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:49,313
We had some strange
readings from this location.

1870
01:52:49,337 --> 01:52:52,332
You wouldn't know anything about an
unsanctioned Time Ripper, would you?

1871
01:52:53,174 --> 01:52:56,445
No. No. I wouldn't know anything
about an unsanctioned Time Ripper.

1872
01:52:56,469 --> 01:52:58,114
Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova.

1873
01:52:58,138 --> 01:52:59,198
Because I was assured...

1874
01:52:59,222 --> 01:53:01,868
that she was safely held
in The Void. But no...

1875
01:53:01,892 --> 01:53:04,078
she was here.
And she fondled my brain.

1876
01:53:04,102 --> 01:53:05,162
How did you let this happen?

1877
01:53:05,186 --> 01:53:06,205
You weren't involved at all?

1878
01:53:06,229 --> 01:53:08,875
In stopping her, yes!
Yes. I was.

1879
01:53:08,899 --> 01:53:10,585
But, not nearly enough.

1880
01:53:10,609 --> 01:53:13,019
Not as much as the men
who went down there after her.

1881
01:53:13,486 --> 01:53:14,771
My men.

1882
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:16,522
My friends.

1883
01:53:17,741 --> 01:53:18,843
I warned them.

1884
01:53:18,867 --> 01:53:22,237
That they would be completely obliterated
if they went. But they went anyway. Like...

1885
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:25,115
Like heroes.

1886
01:53:27,042 --> 01:53:28,910
Because that's who they were.

1887
01:53:31,588 --> 01:53:33,206
They just did what they had to do.

1888
01:53:34,425 --> 01:53:36,209
With no concern for their own safety.

1889
01:53:39,262 --> 01:53:46,052
The fact that we are all still standing here
is a testament to their heroism.

1890
01:53:49,565 --> 01:53:52,142
Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do
to bring them back now.

1891
01:53:53,777 --> 01:53:55,922
He has risen, baby girl.

1892
01:53:55,946 --> 01:53:56,946
Fuck!

1893
01:54:16,258 --> 01:54:17,668
Found your new Anchor Being.

1894
01:54:17,969 --> 01:54:20,129
And we're doing just fine,
you piece of shit.

1895
01:54:20,346 --> 01:54:21,630
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1896
01:54:21,805 --> 01:54:23,408
Fine indeed.

1897
01:54:23,432 --> 01:54:27,636
All right. Put your greasy tits away,
you preening slut.

1898
01:54:28,312 --> 01:54:29,832
I don't understand.

1899
01:54:29,856 --> 01:54:31,166
How are you two still alive?

1900
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:33,418
You were right.
One of us would have been killed.

1901
01:54:33,442 --> 01:54:36,546
But you put a Deadpool
and a Wolverine together...

1902
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:38,799
make 'em hold hands
while listening to Madonna...

1903
01:54:38,823 --> 01:54:41,108
indestructible, motherfucker.

1904
01:54:41,408 --> 01:54:43,762
Let's get this Deadpool Variant
back to The Void.

1905
01:54:43,786 --> 01:54:45,764
- Wait, hold on. What?
- Nope. Actually...

1906
01:54:45,788 --> 01:54:47,474
This one's homegrown, like me.

1907
01:54:47,498 --> 01:54:48,783
He belongs here.

1908
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:50,102
And you are?

1909
01:54:50,126 --> 01:54:52,870
Peterpool.
But you can call me Peter.

1910
01:54:54,296 --> 01:54:55,539
And I hope that you do.

1911
01:55:01,846 --> 01:55:03,407
What the fuck is happening here?

1912
01:55:03,431 --> 01:55:05,242
You are under judgment...

1913
01:55:05,266 --> 01:55:07,285
for operating an
unsanctioned Time Ripper.

1914
01:55:07,309 --> 01:55:08,537
- Take him.
- I was just doing what...

1915
01:55:08,561 --> 01:55:10,137
you don't have the guts to do.

1916
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:13,083
Get your insolent hands off me!

1917
01:55:13,107 --> 01:55:14,141
Get off!

1918
01:55:15,192 --> 01:55:17,061
I'm grateful, gentlemen.

1919
01:55:17,695 --> 01:55:18,922
Let's hold the bows.

1920
01:55:18,946 --> 01:55:21,509
You led an Omega-level
mutant to this timeline.

1921
01:55:21,533 --> 01:55:23,261
- You're welcome.
- And you...

1922
01:55:23,285 --> 01:55:25,362
- shouldn't even be near this timeline.
- He's welcome.

1923
01:55:25,453 --> 01:55:28,849
And you look damn good in that suit.

1924
01:55:28,873 --> 01:55:30,074
I'm so sorry.

1925
01:55:34,379 --> 01:55:38,151
I wanna show you something.
Something huge.

1926
01:55:38,175 --> 01:55:40,293
That's what Scoutmaster Kevin
used to say.

1927
01:55:41,719 --> 01:55:42,920
Do you see that?

1928
01:55:43,471 --> 01:55:45,423
Your universe is regenerating.

1929
01:55:46,141 --> 01:55:47,675
Whatever you did here...

1930
01:55:47,892 --> 01:55:49,969
you not only saved your world.

1931
01:55:50,312 --> 01:55:52,889
You spared your timeline
from extinction.

1932
01:55:54,524 --> 01:55:55,808
I'd rest up.

1933
01:55:55,984 --> 01:55:58,504
I have a feeling your work
is only just getting started.

1934
01:55:58,528 --> 01:56:00,214
Till you're 90.

1935
01:56:00,238 --> 01:56:01,273
Wait!

1936
01:56:02,532 --> 01:56:05,443
We couldn't have made it out of
The Void without some help...

1937
01:56:06,078 --> 01:56:10,157
from some people that
the world kind of forgot.

1938
01:56:10,457 --> 01:56:14,036
Is there any way that you could maybe
find a way to bring them home?

1939
01:56:15,921 --> 01:56:17,205
I'll see what I can do.

1940
01:56:17,756 --> 01:56:19,833
And I promised my friend here...

1941
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:23,738
that the TVA could undo some
pretty awful shit in his timeline.

1942
01:56:23,762 --> 01:56:24,922
What would you say to that?

1943
01:56:25,055 --> 01:56:26,298
Change the past?

1944
01:56:26,724 --> 01:56:28,884
Well, he did help me save the world.

1945
01:56:29,017 --> 01:56:31,553
And his past made him
the man who did it.

1946
01:56:32,438 --> 01:56:34,890
There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.

1947
01:56:36,149 --> 01:56:37,392
Logan.

1948
01:56:40,696 --> 01:56:41,631
Shawarma?

1949
01:56:41,655 --> 01:56:42,690
- I could eat.
- Yeah.

1950
01:56:52,333 --> 01:56:54,827
You know, the Avengers
discovered shawarma.

1951
01:56:55,628 --> 01:56:57,455
They'd be lucky to have you.

1952
01:57:04,637 --> 01:57:06,781
- Oh.
- Oh, come on.

1953
01:57:06,805 --> 01:57:08,048
Fuck off!

1954
01:57:09,016 --> 01:57:13,929
Come here, my little cunchkin.
Yes, it's you. You're a survivor.

1955
01:57:15,148 --> 01:57:17,140
Oh, all is right in the world.

1956
01:57:18,234 --> 01:57:19,435
Yes, it is.

1957
01:57:21,029 --> 01:57:22,396
So what are you gonna do next?

1958
01:57:23,822 --> 01:57:26,024
I'll figure it out. I always do.

1959
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,735
All right.

1960
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:30,321
So I'll probably see you around?

1961
01:57:35,168 --> 01:57:36,202
Probably not.

1962
01:57:39,505 --> 01:57:40,539
See you, bub.

1963
01:57:50,099 --> 01:57:51,300
Logan.

1964
01:57:57,691 --> 01:57:59,558
Al. I'm back.

1965
01:57:59,943 --> 01:58:01,394
About damn time.

1966
01:58:01,570 --> 01:58:02,547
You holdin'?

1967
01:58:02,571 --> 01:58:04,465
I'm all outta devil's dandruff...

1968
01:58:04,489 --> 01:58:07,342
- and I'm shaking like an angry vibrator.
- Thank you, Al.

1969
01:58:07,366 --> 01:58:08,442
We have company.

1970
01:58:09,118 --> 01:58:10,820
Althea, this is...

1971
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:12,557
This is Logan.

1972
01:58:12,581 --> 01:58:13,766
Nice to meet you, Logan.

1973
01:58:13,790 --> 01:58:14,767
Nice to meet you, too.

1974
01:58:14,791 --> 01:58:18,479
And this little ancient anal
shit-knot is Mary Puppins.

1975
01:58:18,503 --> 01:58:20,940
Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.

1976
01:58:20,964 --> 01:58:22,832
You want to treat yourself
to a little stroke?

1977
01:58:24,301 --> 01:58:27,488
- Get the tongue. There it is.
- Oh, my God! Motherfucker!

1978
01:58:27,512 --> 01:58:31,367
Right? It's like an armadillo
fucked a gremlin, angrily...

1979
01:58:31,391 --> 01:58:32,827
in a bed of gonorrhea...

1980
01:58:32,851 --> 01:58:35,429
- Wow.
- ...and didn't stop till the sun came up.

1981
01:58:36,521 --> 01:58:38,307
<i>Everyone wants to matter.</i>

1982
01:58:39,023 --> 01:58:41,851
<i>Turns out that you don't
need to be Marvel Jesus to do it.</i>

1983
01:58:42,486 --> 01:58:44,938
<i>You just need to open
your eyes and look around.</i>

1984
01:58:45,447 --> 01:58:46,648
<i>And if you're lucky...</i>

1985
01:58:47,449 --> 01:58:49,067
<i>you'll find a few friends.</i>

1986
01:58:49,326 --> 01:58:50,652
<i>Old friends...</i>

1987
01:58:51,453 --> 01:58:53,363
<i>and some new ones too.</i>

1988
01:58:57,876 --> 01:59:00,036
Give me the fucking dog.
Talk to the girl.

1989
01:59:10,305 --> 01:59:11,574
Well, hi.

1990
01:59:11,598 --> 01:59:12,632
Hi.

1991
01:59:15,269 --> 01:59:16,470
You've been busy.

1992
01:59:19,356 --> 01:59:21,058
I did it for you.

1993
01:59:22,902 --> 01:59:25,395
And even if you don't want me,
I did it for you.

1994
01:59:34,622 --> 01:59:35,823
<i>It turns out...</i>

1995
01:59:36,331 --> 01:59:37,908
<i>I am the world-saving type.</i>

1996
01:59:38,668 --> 01:59:40,870
<i>Just look around this table
if you want proof.</i>

1997
01:59:41,671 --> 01:59:42,830
<i>And the best part?</i>

1998
01:59:43,589 --> 01:59:45,540
<i>Sometimes the people we save...</i>

1999
01:59:46,384 --> 01:59:48,753
<i>well, they save us right back.</i>

2000
02:00:28,051 --> 02:00:30,321
<i>You're not the only one with gifts.</i>

2001
02:00:30,345 --> 02:00:31,712
What is this place?

2002
02:01:00,541 --> 02:01:01,518
Nice suit.

2003
02:01:01,542 --> 02:01:02,618
Zip it, Stan Lee.

2004
02:01:11,344 --> 02:01:14,031
{\an8}I really like the,
the art in the Deadpool comics.

2005
02:01:14,055 --> 02:01:16,451
<i>You know, I just always felt a
kind of a kinship to him.</i>

2006
02:01:16,475 --> 02:01:19,385
And I just thought, I'd like
to play that guy someday.

2007
02:01:48,006 --> 02:01:50,709
I was there for three weeks
before I shot a single thing.

2008
02:01:50,926 --> 02:01:52,669
{\an8}At our first day of shooting...

2009
02:01:53,011 --> 02:01:54,713
<i>I was so nervous, man.</i>

2010
02:01:55,097 --> 02:01:57,325
Everyone was sort of going,
"Who's this guy?"

2011
02:01:57,349 --> 02:01:59,327
<i>You know, there was a lot of that and...</i>

2012
02:01:59,351 --> 02:02:03,013
you know, "Is he gonna deliver or not?"
You can feel all that kind of pressure.

2013
02:02:04,148 --> 02:02:07,601
It's always the suit's fault.
Never the actor.

2014
02:02:16,202 --> 02:02:17,778
- This is...
- The only way.

2015
02:02:27,004 --> 02:02:29,123
So this is what it feels like.

2016
02:02:31,467 --> 02:02:33,236
And there's the lights.

2017
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:34,711
For medical research.

2018
02:02:35,137 --> 02:02:37,256
- Bye-bye, video.
- Bye.

2019
02:06:51,105 --> 02:06:55,184
I'm tired of these absolutely vile rumors
that I got Johnny killed.

2020
02:06:56,068 --> 02:06:57,311
Let's look at the tape.

2021
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:59,672
<i>In The Void...</i>

2022
02:06:59,696 --> 02:07:01,632
<i>you're either food for Alioth...</i>

2023
02:07:01,656 --> 02:07:02,983
or you work for her.

2024
02:07:05,953 --> 02:07:07,071
Go on, Johnny.

2025
02:07:07,412 --> 02:07:08,738
And I'll tell you who "her" is.

2026
02:07:09,039 --> 02:07:10,058
Cassandra Nova.

2027
02:07:10,082 --> 02:07:12,393
A megalomaniacal, psychotic asshole.

2028
02:07:12,417 --> 02:07:16,272
A finger licking dead-inside pixie slab of
third rate dime-store nut-milk.

2029
02:07:16,296 --> 02:07:17,983
- And I'll tell you what she can do.
- I'm listening.

2030
02:07:18,007 --> 02:07:21,695
She can lick my goddamn cinnamon ring clean
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

2031
02:07:21,719 --> 02:07:24,072
In fact, I don't give a shit if
she removes all my skin and...

2032
02:07:24,096 --> 02:07:26,116
pops me like some nightmarish
blood balloon.

2033
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:29,244
If the last thing I do in this godforsaken
cum-gutter existence...

2034
02:07:29,268 --> 02:07:32,163
is light that fuck-box on fire,
I still won't die happy.

2035
02:07:32,187 --> 02:07:34,082
Holy shit, girl. You crazy.

2036
02:07:34,106 --> 02:07:35,876
That's right, Wade.
I won't be happy until...

2037
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:39,796
I've urinated on her freshly barbecued corpse
and husk-fucked the charred remains...

2038
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:41,715
while gargling Juggernaut's juggernuts.

2039
02:07:41,739 --> 02:07:43,258
- Wow!
- And you can quote me.

2040
02:07:43,282 --> 02:07:44,316
'Kay.

2041
02:07:44,867 --> 02:07:46,360
Got you, fuckface.
