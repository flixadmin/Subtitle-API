You cut a little hole in his mattress

and you stuff sheep dung inside.

51

Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

She is no longer yours to torment.

84

Everyone is mine to torment.

85
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,114
You'd do well
to remember that, you little monster.

86
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,074
Oh, I'm a monster.

87
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,578
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

88
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:57,418
Monsters are dangerous,
and just now kings are dying like flies.

89
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:08,012
I could have your tongue out for saying that.

Let him make his threats.

Hmm?

92
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,101
He's a bitter little man.

93
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,229
Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.

94
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:22,318
Unacceptable, disrespectful,
and in very bad taste.

95

I am the King!

96
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,780
I will punish you.

97
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:31,076
Any man who must say,
"I am the King," is no true king.

98
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,829
I'll make sure you understand that

99
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,581
when I've won your war for you.

100
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,960
My father won the real war.
He killed Prince Rhaegar.

101
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:44,006
He took the crown
while you hid under Casterly Rock!

The King is tired. See him to his chambers.

- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

104

We have so much to celebrate.

105
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,739
A wedding to plan. You must rest.

106
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:13,869
Grand Maester,
perhaps some essence of nightshade

107
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,330
to help him sleep.

108
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,750
I'm not tired!

(DOOR OPENING)

111
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,900
Not you.

112
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,702
You just sent the most powerful man

113
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,912
in Westeros to bed without his supper.

114
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:01,041
You're a fool if you believe he's the
most powerful man in Westeros.

115
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,169
A treasonous statement. Joffrey is King.

116
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,880
You really think a crown gives you power?

117
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,008
No.

118
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,845
I think armies give you power.

119
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,513
Mmm-hmm.

120
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,850
Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle,

121
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,728
and you defeated him all the same.

122
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,895
Mmm-hmm.

123
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,897
Oh, I know.

124
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,817
Walder Frey gets all the credit.

125
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,571
Or the blame, I suppose,
depending on your allegiance.

126
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:35,159
Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?

127
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,244
No.

128
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,831
He never would have risked such an action

129
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,292
if he didn't have certain assurances.

130
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,502
Which he got from me.

131
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,130
Do you disapprove?

132
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,090
I'm all for cheating. This is war.

133
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,301
But to slaughter them at a wedding...

134
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,137
Explain to me why it is more noble

135
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,432
to kill 10,000 men in battle
than a dozen at dinner.

136
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,186
So that's why you did it? To save lives?

137
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,439
To end the war. To protect the family.

138
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,192
Do you want to write a song
for the dead Starks?

139
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,944
Go ahead, write one.

140
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,615
I'm in this world a little while longer

141
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,410
to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.

142
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:20,954
The Northerners will never forget.

143
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,498
Good.

144
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:26,376
Let them remember
what happens when they march on the South.

145
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,255
All the Stark men are dead.

146
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,300
Winterfell is a ruin.

147
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,055
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden of the North

148
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:42,893
until your son by Sansa comes of age.

149
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:49,650
I believe you
still have some work to do on that score.

150
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:54,112
Do you think she'll open her legs for me

151
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:57,658
after I tell her
how we murdered her mother and brother?

152
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,869
One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.

153
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,247
I will not rape her.

154
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:08,001
Shall I explain to you
in one easy lesson how the world works?

155
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,963
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

156
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:14,132
The house that
puts family first will always defeat

157
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,343
the house that puts the whims and wishes

158
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,595
of its sons and daughters first.

159
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,140
A good man does everything in his power

160
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,476
to better his family's position,

161
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,814
regardless of his own selfish desires.

162
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,528
Does that amuse you?

163
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,989
No, it's a very good lesson.

164
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:40,200
Only it's easy for you

00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:48,333
When have you ever
done something that wasn't in your interest,

168
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,586
but solely for the benefit of the family?

169

The day that you were born.

170
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,845
I wanted to carry you into the sea

171
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,930
and let the waves wash you away.

172
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,643
Instead, I let you live.

173
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,314
And I brought you up as my son.

174
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,069
Because you're a Lannister.

BRANDON: Maybe we shouldn't stay here.

184

You'd rather be out there?

185
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,399
There are a lot of stories about this place.

186
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,901
Horrible stories.

187
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,028
I always quite liked the horrible stories.

188
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,781
So did I. Once.

189
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,328
You ever heard about the Rat Cook?

190
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,664
No. Who's he?

191
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,208
Just a cook in the Night's Watch.

192
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:58,046
He was angry at
the King for something, I don't remember.

193
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,174
When the King was visiting the Nightfort,

194
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,510
the cook killed the King's son,

195
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:08,265
cooked him into a big pie
with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and bacon.

196
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,436
That night he served the pie to the King.

197
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:18,108
He liked the taste of his son so
much, he asked for a second slice.

198
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,572
The Gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

199
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,033
who could only eat his own young.

200
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:31,455
He's been roaming the Nightfort ever
since, devouring his own babies.

201
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:37,669
But no matter what he does,
he's always hungry.

202
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:41,882
If the Gods
turned every killer into a giant white rat...

203
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,384
It wasn't for murder
the Gods cursed the Rat Cook

204
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,179
or for serving the King's son in a pie.

205
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,556
He killed a guest beneath his roof.

206
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,478
That's something the Gods can't forgive.

207
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:05,197
"The late Walder Frey," old Tully called me

208
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,909
because I didn't get
my men to the Trident in time for battle.

209
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,119
He thought he was witty.

210

Look at us now, Tully.

211
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,667
You're dead,
your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead,

212

his wedding night in a dungeon,

213

Who does he have?

219
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,772
As you say.

220
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,818
They all laughed at me, all those high lords.

221
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,904
They all thought they were better than me.

222

Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.

223

224

but who said a word
when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?

225
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,624
You'll be needing a new young girl.

No more Starks to bow and scrape to.

231

Must have been torture
following that stupid boy all over the country.

232
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,394
He ignored my advice at every turn.

233

If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...

the "Young Wolf." How's that for pomposity?

What happened up there?
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.

245
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:57,809
I heard he
killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing.

246
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,937
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.

247
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:06,318
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the
ironborn if they gave us Theon.

The ironborn turned on Theon,
as we knew they would.

251

They handed him over trussed and hooded.

What? Why in the world
would you want to go...

330
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,324
I don't want to. I have to.

331
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:47,700
How did you get through the Wall?

332
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,954
Does the well lead to an underground
river? Is that how you came here?

333
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,623
Come with us.

334
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,876
There are steps carved
into the south side of the Wall.

335
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,795
Hodor can carry you to the top.

336
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,130
We'll walk straight to Castle Black.

337
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,175
Come with us.
There's nothing north but death.

338
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:08,680
If Jon is alive,
then Castle Black's where he'll be.

339
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,682
It's the safest place for you.

340
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,268
There's nowhere
safe any longer. You know that.

341
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,436
SAMWELL: What I know is what I saw.

342
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,773
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

343
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:22,193
You saw the White Walkers
and the army of the dead.

344
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,779
How do you know all that?

345
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:27,448
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

346
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:30,868
The Kings of Westeros
and all their armies can't stop them.

347
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,210
(BABY CRYING)

348
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,088
But you're going to stop them?

349
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,673
Please, Sam.

350
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,843
I have to go north.

351
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,346
I have to.

352
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:23,963
"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron
Islands and invader of the North.

353
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,549
"I give you until the full moon

354
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,260
"to order all ironborn scum out of the North

355
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:33,723
"and back to those
shit-stained rocks you call a home.

356
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,435
"On the first night of the full moon,

357
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,438
"I will hunt down every islander

358
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,566
"still in our lands and flay them living,

359
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:49,739
"the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.

360
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,368
"In the box you'll find a special gift...

361
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,080
"Theon's favorite toy.

362
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,875
"He cried when I took it away from him.

363
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,649
"Leave the North now,
or more boxes will follow

364
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,276
"with more Theon."

365
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:32,031
Signed, "Ramsay Snow,
natural-born son of Roose Bolton,

366
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:35,201
"Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

367
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,997
Get that out of my sight.

368
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,090
Theon disobeyed my orders.

369
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,054
The boy is a fool.

370
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,768
He cannot further the Greyjoy line.

371
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,773
I will not give up the lands I have seized,

372
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:09,485
the strongholds I have taken.
Get this away from me.

373
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,071
He's your son.

374
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,740
Son?

375
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,869
He's not a man anymore.

376
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:20,997
He's your son. He's my brother.

377
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,083
He's a Greyjoy.

378
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,835
Watch yourself.

379
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,463
I've made my decision.

380
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,887
And I've made mine.

381
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,851
I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.

382
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,607
I'm going to choose
the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.

383
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:49,692
MAN: Get those ropes!

384
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,403
YARA: I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea,

385
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,697
all the way to the Weeping Water.

386
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:59,118
I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.

387
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,871
I'm going to find my little brother,

388
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,707
and I'm going to bring him home.

389
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,714
What is it?

390
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,424
Dragonglass.

391
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:15,218
We found them at the Fist.

392
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,221
Someone buried them a long time ago.

393
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,015
Someone wanted us to find them.

394
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,727
Why? What are they for?

395
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,192
Killing White Walkers.

396
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,985
How do you know that?

397
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,029
GILLY: The Walker came for my baby.

398
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,657
And Sam...

399
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,827
But no one's killed
a White Walker in thousands of years.

400
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,580
Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.

401
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,958
Take it, Hodor.

402
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,508
And the archer.

403
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:05,601
I got lucky with one of them.

404
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,436
There are more.

405
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,397
Many more.

406
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,359
And for every one of them,

407
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,444
the dead men,

408
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,114
more than you could count.

409
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,911
I wish you'd come with us.

410
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,706
I wish I could.

411
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:30,042
I really do.

412
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,175
How are you keeping?

413
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:23,721
Great. Never better.

414
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,098
It was just a bit of blood.

415
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,018
I should have known.

416
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,355
Every time
a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.

417
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,607
We're not really people to you.

418
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,442
Just ways to get what you want.

419
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,693
I'm not a highborn.

420
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,028
She called you "Ser."

421
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,488
I heard it.

422
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:45,409
A recent state of affairs.

423
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,666
I was born in Flea Bottom, just like you.

424
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:56,504
Sure, you were.
You're my friend. You're here to help.

425
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,506
I lived below the Street of Flour.

426
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,051
How far below?
How close to the Red Keep were you?

427
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,138
The shit that poured from their privy pipes

428
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,934
flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill,

429
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:13,854
along Tanner's Row
and right in front of my front door

430
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,940
- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

431
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:22,780
The Street of Steel,
with your armor and your knights?

432
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,073
(SCOFFS)

433
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,492
You lived in the fancy part of town.

434
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,164
And here we are now.

435
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:37,003
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

436
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,505
Yeah, we've come a long way.

437
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,675
We're all the same, really.

438
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,761
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

439
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:48,431
If you mistrust fancy people so much,

440
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:51,142
why were you in such a hurry to trust her?

441
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,061
You're me.

442
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,522
Never been with a woman.

443
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,316
Never talked to a woman, really.

444
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,860
And then she comes at you,

445
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,030
big words, no clothes.

446
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,198
What would you have done?

447
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,746
She does know her way
around a man's head, I'll give her that.

448
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,414
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

449
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,170
So how'd you become a lord?

450
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,255
Oh. That's a long story.

451
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,175
Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.

452
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,973
Many years ago I helped King
Stannis out of a difficult situation.

453
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,809
He rewarded me with a lordship.

454
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:36,979
And this.

455
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,983
You see?

456
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,444
Highborns.

457
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:51,869
I didn't want to be a lord.
I nearly didn't accept.

458
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,370
Why did you?

459
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,247
I did it for my son.

460
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,959
I didn't want him to step over a river of shit

461
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,504
every time he stepped through his front door.

462
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,591
I wanted him to have a better life.

463
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,511
Does he?

464
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:11,388
He's dead.

465
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,479
How'd he die?

466
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,024
Following me.

467
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,788
When did you come to this strange country?

468
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:39,542
When I was 13.

469
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,377
You were only a child.

470
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,089
I stopped being a child when I was nine.

471
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,842
My mother made sure of that.

472
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:53,556
You've been a good
influence on our mutual friend, you know.

473
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,393
He used to drink from sundown to
sunup, visit three brothels a night,

474
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,979
gamble away his father's money.

475
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,897
Now it's just the drinking.

476
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,317
And now I'm his wife's servant.

477
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:08,821
I brush her hair
and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.

478
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,824
She is a sweet young thing.
None of this is her fault.

479
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,243
I love that girl. I would kill for her.

480
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,787
Do you think that makes it easier for me?

481
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,123
No, I expect not.

482
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:25,713
She's young
and she's beautiful and highborn.

483
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:30,092
We break bread with them,
but that doesn't make us family.

484
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:34,263
We've learned their language, but
we'll never be their countrymen.

485
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,851
If you let yourself believe

486
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,103
that a foreign girl with no name

487
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,522
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister...

488
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:44,940
I have a name.

489
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,358
You have one name.

What do you want from me, Lord Varys?

492

Diamonds.

I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

but you know how to protect yourself.

495

Get on one of those

You can buy a house
with these diamonds, a very large house.

Why do you want me to leave?

501
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:30,236
Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive

502
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:32,655
who could make this country a better place.

503
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,824
He has the mind, the will,
and the right last name.

504
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,201
And you,

505
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:41,080
you are a complication.

And I know it's
true love, not bought by gold and silver.

508

I'm not asking you to leave him for money.

509
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,759
I'm asking you to leave

510
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:58,931
because your presence
in the capital endangers him.

511

This will never be your home, my lady.

I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

I seem to remember saying something
similar about my own marriage.

You want to make

So you can tell Father it was you
who finally talked me into it?

So she can have some happiness in her life.

You have children.

Not very.

But if it weren't for my children,

547
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,772
I'd have thrown myself
from the highest window in the Red Keep.

He was all I had once.
Before Myrcella was born.

552
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:37,005
I used to spend hours looking at him.

His wisps of hair.

554

555

Whenever he was with me, he was happy.

And no one can take
that away from me, not even Joffrey,

Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell.

669

I hope your penmanship
is better than your swordplay.

670

Miles better.

671

or because at war men die all the time,

but I do know that uniting
the Seven Kingdoms

with blood magic is wrong. It is evil.

And you are not an evil man.

this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?

Aegon Targaryen.

721
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:29,074
And do you know
how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?

722
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,117
On the back of his dragon,
Balerion the Dread.

723
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:34,496
He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced

724
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:37,791
and a smaller army, but he had three dragons.

725

Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.

726

no matter how thirsty you get,

don't drink seawater.

I know not to drink seawater.

Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

- No.

You can't stop him alone.

819
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,691
You need someone to
rebuild your army for you,

820
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:03,069
someone to convince
this lord and that lord to fight for you,

to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.

I've made my decision.

He's right. You need him.
He has a part to play in the war to come.

You've been saved

You're in His army now.

They will come, Your Grace.
When they're ready.

00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:04,714
Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.

You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.

Your freedom is not mine to give.
