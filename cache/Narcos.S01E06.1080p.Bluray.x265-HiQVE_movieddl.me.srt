Stop!

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,480
OK!

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,842
- How are you?
- Very well. How are you?

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,008
Your ID, please.

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,450
Certainly.

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,125
Give me that.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,444
How many times have I told you
not to throw the ball over there?

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,443
Are you trying
to scare your sister or what?

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,204
- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,850
Don't you see she's just a baby?

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,002
You yourself were a baby
not too long ago.

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,246
Yes, Dad.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,243
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,127
- What's wrong, Juan Pablo?
- I want her to die.

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,609
Never say that.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,849
We are a family and we have
to look out for each other, always.

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,605
You hear me?

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,842
Hello.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,366
Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,410
- Yes, go on. How many?
- Two.

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,960
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,048
Officers. You know Poison.

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,920
- Officers are a million each.
- OK, so two million?

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,083
- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- OK, talk to you later.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,525
All right.

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,289
What were you talking about?

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,283
Just business.

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,011
I want to be a businessman like you.

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,006
Pablo's path was total war.

48
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,127
He established a bounty system for killing
cops and over 200 were slaughtered.

49
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,482
The police had to build a special morgue
just to hold the bodies.

50
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,481
The cops, they took vengeance.

51
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,170
My name is Alba Borraga,
born 1962 in Popayán.

52
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,289
Father Sandoval, mother Maria.
We own a large tobacco farm.

53
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,042
I graduated Universidad del Cauca
with an emphasis in chemical engineering.

54
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,963
OK, try it again and look at me.

55
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,883
I've already done it 17 times.

56
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,844
You got me and my wife into this.

57
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,288
Now sit down and do it again
until you get it right.

58
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,404
My name is Alba Borraga,
born 1962 in Popayán.

59
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,131
Father Sandoval, mother Maria.
We own a large tobacco farm.

60
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,809
I graduated Universidad del Cauca
with an emphasis in chemical engineering.

61
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,690
What if they ask me
a question about chemistry?

62
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,449
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK...

63
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,961
Sit down. Do it again.
It's getting better.

64
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,925
We were protecting Elisa

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,527
because she could tie Escobar
to the Palace of Justice...

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,049
but by protecting a communist,
we were traitors.

67
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,485
Go figure.

68
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,651
Let's go.

69
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,843
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

70
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,843
Honey, thank you.

71
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,605
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead, too.

72
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,125
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?

73
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,726
You clearly don't know
your country's history in Latin America.

74
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,327
- Sorry, I didn't hear that...
- Honey, mellow out, OK?

75
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,046
Steve, I know you're mad,
but this is the right thing to do.

76
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,726
The right thing to do? I didn't really have
a choice in the matter though, did I?

77
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,048
This is the only choice.

78
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,441
You should
think about going back to Miami.

79
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,404
They're in their car. Hold on.

80
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,325
Wow. Maybe I will.

81
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,289
Just get in the car, OK?

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,210
OK, OK, they're on the move.

83
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,009
Go. Go, go, go.

84
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,361
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.

85
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,201
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- Don't do anything stupid.

86
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,329
Just keep your head down
and this'll all be over soon enough.

87
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,641
We're gonna cut him off
up here on the left.

88
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,685
Get out of the car, Murphy!

89
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,401
Get out!

90
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,921
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,446
- Move him away.
- Easy.

92
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,442
- Easy.
- Back!

93
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,204
- Come on. Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands...

94
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,770
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey!

95
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,171
- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!

96
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,163
Who the fuck were you talking to?

97
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,245
Where the fuck is she?

98
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,851
Stand down.

99
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,810
Who were you talking to, huh?

100
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,881
Peña.

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,650
I got wife troubles.

102
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,887
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.

103
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,123
Your husband was clever
to get them to follow him.

104
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,850
I hope he's OK.

105
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,291
Shit.

106
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,051
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?

107
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,920
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm American. I don't speak Spanish.

108
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,089
You speak Spanish?

109
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,366
Yes.

110
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,961
I asked where you are headed.

111
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,361
- Popayán.
- Popayán?

112
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,010
Your papers, please.

113
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,929
Uh, documents.

114
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,330
Ms. Connie Murphy.

115
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,126
Alba Borraga.

116
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,845
Have a nice trip.

117
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,485
- Thank you.
- Be well.

118
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,971
Gracias, señor.

119
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,124
Hello?

120
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,847
OK, yes.

121
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,321
OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.

122
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,851
Elisa's fine.

123
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,646
Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.

124
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,405
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?

125
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,289
I want you to call me
every other hour from the road.

126
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,964
Actually, call me every hour.

127
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,324
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

128
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,289
I love you, too.

129
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,681
I'm proud of you. Bye.

130
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,689
Now that I knew Connie was safe,
I could focus on César Gaviria.

131
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,123
At the time, the only thing more dangerous
than being a Colombian cop

132
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,885
was being a Colombian
presidential candidate.

133
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,571
Mm-hm.

134
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,723
Gaviria had come out
in favor of extraditing the narcos

135
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,488
to the United States, and it was in our
best interest that he win the presidency.

136
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,846
- But to win...
- Gracias.

137
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,042
...he had to survive until election day.

138
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,690
Uh, Señor Gaviria?

139
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,370
Through that door.

140
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,409
- You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.

141
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,606
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

142
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,162
I'm Eduardo Sandoval,
head of security of Dr. Gaviria.

143
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,287
What can we do for you?

144
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,290
I'm hoping that our agency
can offer some resources

145
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,324
to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.

146
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,769
Shouldn't the DEA be out
chasing traffickers or is just my thought?

147
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,650
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.

148
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,964
- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.

149
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,923
Please, have a seat.

150
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,607
Your Secret Service
has briefed us on security measures.

151
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,890
No open-air speaking engagements,
different routes home every day.

152
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,124
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán,
we needed an education on these things.

153
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,440
- Come on.
- Exactly.

154
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,085
These men will stop at nothing
to kill you.

155
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,569
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.

156
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,810
Your government even offers
the use of an armored Cadillac limousine,

157
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,723
built for your president.

158
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,486
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá
with an American-made tank

159
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,166
won't exactly endear us to the voters.

160
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,131
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.

161
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,688
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy,
I'd say thank you.

162
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,802
Well, thank you.

163
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,881
And this?

164
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,647
What are we supposed to do with this?

165
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,090
Bullet-proof pants.

166
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,322
I suggest that you wear them.

167
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,689
Thank you, Agent Murphy,
for your consideration.

168
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,161
And we'll keep in mind your advice.

169
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
Thank you for your time.

170
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,769
WITH GAVIRIA
THERE WILL BE A FUTURE

171
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,286
César Gaviria was riding
a wave of public support

172
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,324
for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.

173
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,080
But we had a target of our own:
José Rodriguez Gacha,

174
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,721
who we tracked to Cartagena
through one of our informants.

175
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,362
Have you heard
of this thing called a computer?

176
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,847
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.

177
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,324
It's a new kind of technology
that's coming out.

178
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,567
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.

179
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,882
Hey, honey.

180
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,089
You look very beautiful today.

181
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,804
Relax, baby. Relax.
We don't bite.

182
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,808
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.

183
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,525
- Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.

184
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,328
I want to fuck her.

185
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,485
We have more important things
to worry about right now, my son.

186
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,205
Understood?

187
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,846
Talk to me. What do you know?

188
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,810
Don Gonzalo,
we have people all over the property.

189
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,245
It's secure.

190
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,041
We've got a few men in town as well.

191
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,284
Now, what can you tell me
about Medellín?

192
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,609
The same, boss.

193
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,810
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc
is out looking for Pablo.

194
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,245
Thank you, Navegante.

195
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,364
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.

196
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,160
Don Freddy.

197
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,170
Son... a question.

198
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,524
Are we sheep or are we wolves?

199
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,964
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves! Right.

200
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,565
I like it.

201
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,965
They're in
a house outside of Cartagena, right here.

202
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,806
Just know there are
a lot of people guarding him.

203
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,046
Navegante, you've been
working for Gacha for many years.

204
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,045
I'm sure in that time you've
earned way more than we are giving you.

205
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,486
So tell me,
why do you want to betray him?

206
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,122
That fucker's crazy.

207
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,762
He's gonna get us all killed.

208
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,327
I don't believe him one bit.

209
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,131
What do you care
why he's doing it?

210
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,331
Because we have 23 agents with
outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.

211
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,564
And he has twice as many men
with brand new weapons.

212
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,369
And frankly...

213
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,889
I'm tired of sending young men
to face certain death.

214
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,088
So then we have to be smart.

215
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,242
We have to create a trap.

216
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,926
If we catch him alive,
he'll give us Escobar.

217
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,525
And the Ochoas.

218
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,366
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.

219
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,771
I want him dead.

220
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,968
He doesn't care about death.

221
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,169
He only fears rotting in jail.

222
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,451
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.

223
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,366
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?

224
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,249
These aren't your men.

225
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,641
You have no family here to lose.

226
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,240
If this goes badly, there will be
more widows and orphans,

227
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,489
and I'll have to carry that
on my shoulders.

228
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,609
Well...

229
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,251
I trust his information.

230
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,328
And I trust you.

231
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,081
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.

232
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,443
What do we got?

233
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,366
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.

234
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,008
Who's this guy?

235
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,481
I don't know, but if Poison
showed his face to pick him up,

236
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,164
he must be really important.

237
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,008
Here's your payment, sir.

238
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,761
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain
on a cargo ship.

239
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,322
From there, our trucks
will take it to the Basque country.

240
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,330
It's all set up.

241
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,402
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain
on the first flight.

242
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,325
What's that?

243
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,568
As far as I know, you and my cousin
have an agreement.

244
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,007
The agreement is for this amount.

245
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,730
What kind of bullshit is this?

246
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,321
5,000 kilos or no deal.

247
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,727
Then there is no deal. Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?

248
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,841
Forgive my cousin, sir.

249
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,851
5,000 it is, then.

250
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,805
We shouldn't go.

251
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,287
I want you in the US.

252
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,284
You'll be safe there,
far from all of this.

253
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,284
- What if something happens...
- Nothing is going to happen to me.

254
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,925
Let's go.

255
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,522
Please, protect him.

256
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,563
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.

257
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,202
Bye, Daddy, I love you!

258
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,401
Gaviria's life was on the line...

259
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,527
my wife was with Colombia's
most wanted fugitive,

260
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,961
and my partner was in Cartagena.

261
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,922
He had his own mission,
with a group of cops

262
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,210
who had seen their friends and relatives
die at the hands of Gacha.

263
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,804
Like Trujillo,
whose father and two brothers, all cops,

264
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,400
had died in gun battles with the cartel.

265
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,120
As hard as we were going after Gacha,
the narcos wanted Gaviria.

266
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,684
It killed me to ask for help
from this guy.

267
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,560
Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish,
with none of the charm.

268
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,689
- Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.

269
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,489
The Golden Gringo.

270
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,244
You don't call, you don't write.

271
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,205
I called your office.

272
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,850
I only speak to Peña.

273
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,008
I need to know who this is.

274
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,890
I need... l need...

275
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,842
I need to know who he is.

276
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,081
"I need to know who he is."

277
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,328
Don't make me laugh, faggot.

278
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,607
"I need to know who he is."

279
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,281
The fuck back! Fuck back.

280
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,491
OK.

281
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,569
You work for me, asshole!

282
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,530
Right? Clear? Is that clear?

283
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,889
You know who he is?
Gonna tell me? Gonna speak? Yeah...

284
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,762
Suárez knew exactly who
this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.

285
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,651
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody,

286
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,846
take 'em on a date.

287
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,331
What's going on?

288
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,164
I have reason to believe
the Medellín cartel

289
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,447
is planning an imminent attack
against Gaviria.

290
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,880
We have no intel to that effect.

291
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,760
Maybe you should do your job instead
of spying on other agency personnel.

292
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,201
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.

293
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,487
CIA's been so kind
to give us these documents,

294
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,882
but 90 percent of them
are too classified for us to read.

295
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,287
I need to get into the White Room.

296
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,845
What's that?

297
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,769
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.

298
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,367
You've been reading too many spy novels.

299
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,610
Spy novels...
Have you read The Spaniard?

300
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,530
Where the hell did you get that?

301
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,443
Ma'am, he has been in the country
for several days.

302
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,364
He's been escorted
by one of Pablo's top sicarios.

303
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,441
Let me see this.

304
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,204
I know the CIA has intel on this man.

305
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,763
Now, are you going
to give me access or not?

306
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,202
Technically, the room isn't white.

307
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,920
It's more of a... burgundy.

308
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,443
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.

309
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,211
The White Room
was a top secret repository

310
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,602
for the CIA's deepest,
darkest secrets.

311
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,890
So secret, in fact, that its
very existence was never acknowledged.

312
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,841
Sit here.

313
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,800
Agent Schroeder
will watch you the entire time.

314
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,524
Where are the files?

315
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,964
I feel like he's still too soft.

316
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,166
He'll be fine.

317
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,006
I don't know, Pablo.

318
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,731
I feel like we need
to suspend the operation.

319
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,361
- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.

320
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,806
That's the reason
your hair is falling out.

321
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,201
Very funny, motherfucker.

322
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,449
Keep laughing.

323
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,089
How's our boy doing, Mom?

324
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,403
He's learning,
with a little tough love.

325
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,448
- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?

326
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,809
That's so he can mix
with the sons of the oligarchs, right?

327
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,486
- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.

328
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,410
What about these clowns?

329
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,450
Are they treating you right?

330
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,209
More or less.

331
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,608
What do you mean "more or less"?
We treat you good.

332
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,809
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?

333
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,770
- Some rice?
- Yes.

334
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,811
Thank you.

335
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,281
Jaime.

336
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,602
Welcome to the family.

337
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,288
Thank you, boss.

338
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,889
Can't you do anything?

339
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,206
No.

340
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,407
While we're at war,
we can't do anything.

341
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,885
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day

342
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,169
and my friends
think my brothers are responsible.

343
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,726
Let's talk about something else, baby.

344
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,961
Yes.

345
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,884
All right,
let's talk about running away together.

346
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,008
Let's get away while we can.

347
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,768
"Let's get away."
Listen to this.

348
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,605
Why would you run away
with a criminal like me?

349
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,805
And why not?

350
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,449
I wish it was that easy.

351
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,285
- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.

352
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,283
I know.

353
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,840
You say that because of your wife.

354
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,366
I don't give a shit about my wife.

355
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,450
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.

356
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,801
Who is the woman
in that relationship?

357
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,291
You?

358
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,887
Gacha was always paranoid
when things were quiet.

359
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,248
And now, he began to wonder
about Navegante.

360
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,643
Hey, doll.

361
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,250
What are you doing?

362
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,326
I'm married, sir.

363
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,448
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.

364
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,961
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

365
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,566
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.

366
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,687
What's up?

367
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,327
The Search Bloc is here,
not in Medellín.

368
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,129
But Navegante said they were over there.

369
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,000
Navegante... Navegante is a liar.

370
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,651
He wouldn't betray you.

371
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,243
Freddy... think, think.

372
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,290
Everyone in the world has a price.

373
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,124
All right, let's go!

374
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,806
They want war, we'll give them war!

375
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,607
The Spaniard was a name
that got everyone's attention.

376
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,728
He was a member of ETA.

377
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,809
Never heard of 'em?

378
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,731
They made bomb-making
a goddamn art form.

379
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,165
They were a group of supposed
freedom fighters from the Basque country,

380
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,242
trying to secede from Spain.

381
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,241
Their specialty was
targeted assassinations of public figures.

382
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,761
ETA was responsible for the assassination
of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco,

383
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,122
returning home from Christmas Mass...

384
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,205
and a remote-controlled car bomb that
killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.

385
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,287
The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.

386
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,326
Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez,
a celebrity now, for hire.

387
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,482
Expensive, but the best.

388
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,971
'Cause Pablo only hires the best.

389
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,247
That was Pablo's plan,
to blow up Gaviria.

390
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,530
The question was,
where, when and how?

391
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,769
I appreciate your concern,
Madam Ambassador,

392
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,765
but canceling our campaign travel
is not an option.

393
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,760
Well, given the new information
that Agent Murphy has uncovered,

394
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,604
I hope you'll reconsider.

395
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,882
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá,
and a dozen other cities.

396
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,803
You are a target in every one.

397
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,483
Yes, and... we've done everything
your Secret Service

398
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,530
and Spain's Civil Guard
have recommended.

399
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,730
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs
at every campaign stop, so...

400
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,767
I think we're good.

401
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,241
You think the Spaniard
doesn't know that?

402
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,729
Yes, I know.

403
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,690
But tell me, Agent Murphy,
how do you expect him to win the election

404
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,764
if he hides like a scared rabbit
behind all this violence?

405
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,410
Tell me, how?

406
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,000
How do you expect him to win
if he's dead?

407
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,771
I'm not telling your wife
you died on my watch.

408
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,088
This is not your watch, OK?

409
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,890
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.

410
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,163
I'll take my chances.

411
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,406
His name is Steve Murphy. He's DEA.

412
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,801
I hope you'll pay for this information.

413
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,649
Suárez is talking to the DEA.

414
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,321
You know what you have to do.

415
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,324
He got away.

416
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,802
They killed the goddamn maid.

417
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,321
Colonel!

418
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,927
Colonel...

419
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,804
They called from the road block.

420
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,521
They have a car stopped
and they're saying the driver's a senator.

421
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,126
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.

422
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,690
So what's the problem?

423
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,245
They found a machine gun in the trunk.

424
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,405
Let's go.

425
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,203
Look at my credentials.

426
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,204
No, I don't know this Gacha person
you're referring to.

427
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,000
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?

428
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:53,922
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician
in this country carries a weapon?

429
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,729
Please.

430
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,724
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?

431
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,922
You're alone in the car, right?

432
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,602
Listen to me, officers...

433
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,322
if you don't let me go immediately,
you're going to regret it.

434
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,326
Uh-huh.

435
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,086
Thank you.

436
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,406
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.

437
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,208
I don't believe him.

438
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,964
I don't either.

439
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,521
He could have bought his credentials.

440
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,086
What if it turns out he is a senator?

441
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,924
We'll pay for that.

442
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,486
I can't run that risk.

443
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,403
It's true.

444
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,801
You can't.

445
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,641
The next one...
goes in your head!

446
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,484
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!

447
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,642
I'll talk, I'll talk!

448
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,166
I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.

449
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,244
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.

450
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,801
Hey, Jaime.

451
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,484
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?

452
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,564
- Your family?
- Yes, sir. Welcome.

453
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,926
Tell me about them.

454
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,651
This is my daughter Marcela.

455
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,007
Look at what a cute baby.

456
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,811
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.

457
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,803
Of course.

458
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,283
Very soon, they will have the money
to buy everything they want, Jaime.

459
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,930
Thanks a lot, boss.

460
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,923
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.

461
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,490
Thank you.

462
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,766
- What about you?
- Good, sir.

463
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,844
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.

464
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,841
Guys.

465
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,160
All right, Jaime.

466
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,609
This is for you to wear
during your mission.

467
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,250
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.

468
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,288
Seriously, Pablo?

469
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,084
Thank you very much.

470
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,288
Everything is so beautiful.

471
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,048
You have to be very careful,
and get by unnoticed.

472
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,369
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.

473
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,562
All right, then, son.

474
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,130
Sit down.

475
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,404
These guys are going to give you
very specific instructions.

476
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,529
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding
the plane that is leaving for Cali.

477
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,764
We want you to record a conversation.

478
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,571
It's very simple,
nothing to worry about.

479
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,563
All right.

480
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,848
- How are you feeling?
- I'm... I'm very happy.

481
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,766
Thank you very much for the opportunity,
Don Pablo. Seriously. And for the clothes.

482
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,605
Really, for me,
it's an honor to work for you.

483
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,364
Thank you very much.

484
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,244
Don't mention it.

485
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,370
OK.

486
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,011
Come here, give me a hug.

487
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,449
Thank you, Don Pablo.

488
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,365
Thank you.

489
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,522
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- Take care.

490
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,250
Thank you very much.

491
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,004
See you later, boys.

492
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,287
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

493
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,840
My love, look!

494
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,289
- Look at this jacket. Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful. What did Pablo say?

495
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,887
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.

496
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,961
You, me and the baby
are going to get ahead.

497
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,405
Thank you, my love.

498
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,165
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.

499
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,251
I have some news about Gaviria.

500
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,085
They're going to kill him
on the way to Cali.

501
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,365
Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?

502
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,090
Suárez, OK.

503
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,446
I can translate.

504
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,241
Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.

505
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,966
"Tu puerta"?

506
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,929
- "Door."
- Door.

507
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,731
Suárez! Suárez.

508
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,082
Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.

509
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,129
Suárez!

510
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,567
Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?

511
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,123
Hello?

512
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,281
Hel...

513
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,283
- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.

514
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,691
Carrillo and his men
arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.

515
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,331
And Peña still hoped
he could be taken alive.

516
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,884
It was her fault, Dad.

517
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,407
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.

518
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,451
All she had to do was say yes
and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!

519
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,806
Be a man!

520
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,923
Son of a bitch!
They found us!

521
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,646
Come on, son!

522
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,050
- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

523
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,407
- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.

524
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,209
Get me a radio, quick!

525
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,442
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal! A radio!

526
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,968
Dad, let's go! Hurry, Dad, hurry!

527
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,004
Hurry!

528
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,241
Stop!

529
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,923
Peña!
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!

530
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,611
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.

531
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,331
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?

532
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,243
You're a wolf, right?

533
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,402
Yes, I am a wolf.

534
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,045
It's a helicopter! It's a
helicopter! They're going to kill us!

535
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,481
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don't talk like that!

536
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,483
Take this. Take it!

537
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,411
- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!

538
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,803
Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!

539
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,611
No good.
We're going in again.

540
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,524
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!

541
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,124
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no. Never, son, never!

542
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,010
Breathe! Breathe!

543
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,128
Do you want this, asshole?

544
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,765
Do you want this?

545
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,041
We're taking fire!

546
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,726
We'll circle around
and approach from another direction.

547
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,050
You don't need to worry about anything,
my son. Nothing.

548
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,727
Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!

549
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,961
Copy.

550
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,044
Look. Look outside. Look outside!

551
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,285
What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?

552
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,251
We stopped him.
He's not moving.

553
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,244
Freddy. Freddy?

554
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,163
Let's go, Freddy.

555
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,086
Freddy?

556
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,291
Freddy?

557
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,164
Son!

558
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,685
You're a wolf. You're a wolf.

559
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,485
Asshole!

560
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,530
Asshole! Hey, asshole!

561
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,489
Freddy! Wake up, Freddy!

562
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,282
Hey, asshole! What are you gonna do?

563
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,290
What are you gonna do?
Asshole!

564
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,723
What are you gonna do?!
Asshole!

565
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,164
He's out of bullets.
We can take him alive.

566
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,763
It's your call.

567
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,011
What are you gonna do?!
Asshole!

568
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,005
Give him lead.

569
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,842
Affirmative. Maintain positions
and patrol the area again. Very good.

570
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,645
Are you OK?

571
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,483
I'll sleep tonight.

572
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,409
This was the first successful
major operation by the Search Bloc.

573
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,642
It signaled to the country
and to the world

574
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,088
that the fight against the narcos
had moved to a new level.

575
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,409
According
to recent polls, we're doing well.

576
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,290
We're gaining points
in six districts within Cali.

577
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,562
That's important,
because it means we could pull ahead.

578
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,644
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.

579
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,644
The last time,
we fell five points in one day.

580
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,563
- Yes. We...
- Dr. Gaviria!

581
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,285
Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!

582
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,369
Relax. Let him through.

583
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,085
- Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?

584
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,046
- No, no. He can't go, no.
- What?

585
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,728
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.

586
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,808
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

587
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,767
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.

588
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,410
Do you have proof?

589
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,171
I got my gut.

590
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,924
You got your gut.

591
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,088
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.

592
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,248
What if I'm right?

593
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,849
You nervous?

594
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,321
A little bit, but I'm fine.

595
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,289
Wait here, wait here.

596
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,488
You know what you have to do?

597
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,369
Yes, sir.

598
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,680
Remember, you have to record
the entire conversation. Don't forget.

599
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,327
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.

600
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,323
Aren't you coming with me?

601
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,566
No, the boss just told me
to bring you here.

602
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,768
Hey, but don't worry.

603
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,491
Tomorrow,
I'll come and meet you there.

604
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,690
- All right, then.
- All right. Don't be nervous.

605
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,603
You'll see how fun it is to fly.

606
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,170
All right?

607
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,691
Go on. The line is right there.

608
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,649
Good luck, then.

609
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,128
It's up to you, Eduardo.

610
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,885
Whatever you decide, I'll do.

611
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,965
Avianca announces
the departure of Flight 203 to Cali,

612
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,520
now boarding at Gate 6.

613
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,008
I'll follow your gut this time.

614
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,330
I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.

615
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,810
Well... it seems like
you and I are not the only ones afraid.

616
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,841
Put on your seatbelt, please.

617
00:47:08,865 --> 00:47:10,865
