1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,802
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,762
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,361
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,771
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,488
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,163
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,169
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,961
Previously on the Flash:

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,049
- Iris West.
- Eddie?

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,321
- The Man in the Yellow, he took Eddie.
- I promise I will find him, okay?

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,410
Barf)'-

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,650
Think about your best friend.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,009
It could be your wife, your father,
maybe someone you grew up with.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,327
It's the person you can't wait to talk to
at the end of the day.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,689
The person who knows everything about you,
who roots for you.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,130
Now imagine you discover
your best friend has a secret.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,603
No, not a secret. A universe of secrets.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,003
Would you confront him?
Would you stay silent?

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,647
Either way, you know nothing
will ever be the same again.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,281
Where is Thawne?

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,650
He took some personal time.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,366
Yeah, uh, Eddie's been
going through some stuff, captain.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,047
Yeah, aren't we all?
Got anything on these gold-store robberies?

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,811
Perps hit two more in the last week
and we got nothing.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,611
- We're working on it.
- Waiting on results from the lab.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,847
Pick up the pace.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,726
And see if somebody can contact the Flash,
maybe he can help speed things up.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,843
You know what I mean. Get going.

30
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,490
- Anything?
- No. I mean, I've looked everywhere.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,204
Keep looking.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,731
Of course, yeah.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,006
H9)'-

34
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,967
H9)'-

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,249
- Uh, I'm heading out right now. What's up?
- Something happened.

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,047
And I'm not supposed to say anything,
but I couldn't keep quiet.

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,600
What happened?

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,963
The Man in Yellow,
he took Eddie right in front of me.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,321
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,570
- Are you okay? Wha...?
- No. No, not at all.

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,489
- No, l...
- The Flash was there.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,207
He told me to go home and not to talk to
anyone because he would fix it, but he hasn't.

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,411
I think the police should be out
searching for Eddie.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,807
- No, Iris, I...
- My dad needs to know the truth.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,081
Uh...

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,163
I think that...

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,010
...the Flash is right.

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,046
Joe and the cops, they're no match
for the Man in Yellow, Iris.

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,480
They would just get hurt.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,362
So you think the Flash is out there,
right now, searching for Eddie?

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,847
I'm sure he's doing everything he can
to find him.

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,689
Yeah, well, I'm finding it pretty hard
to trust the Flash right now.

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,760
Well then, trust me. Okay?

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,081
Look, I'm so sorry about all of this. I...

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,210
Everything is gonna be okay.

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,450
I have to go.

57
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,330
Okay, back it up.

H9)'-

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,483
You planning on keeping all those cameras
Wells used to spy on us?

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,165
Kind of creepy, don't you think?

63
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,688
First rule of mechanical engineering, dude.
Never waste good tech.

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,641
- Central City Gold Reserve's under attack.
- Gold?

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,009
That's the case Singh wants us on.

66
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,281
I'll be right back.

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,521
You picked a bad day for this, pal.

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,041
What was that?

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,401
Your eye movement is normal.
No signs of neurological damage.

70
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,922
Think the thief might have been
a metahuman...

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,765
...who put the whammy on you or something?
I don't know.

72
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,043
When Rainbow Raider got in my head...

73
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,329
...all I felt was anger.

74
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,888
But this was not that. This was...

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,929
...just overwhelming fear.

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,127
Huh.

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,849
Looks like when you went down,
the thief got disoriented too.

78
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,721
Maybe we both got whammied.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,049
Then you know how it feels.

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,681
Hi, Barry.

81
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,007
Or should I say the Flash?

82
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,882
This is one of the few times
I would not wanna be Barry Allen.

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,650
I wonder what he's gonna say.

84
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,403
- We should absolutely not listen in.
- It's none of our business.

85
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,211
- But the Flash is our business.
- And Iris did just find out Barry's the Flash.

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,086
So by transitive property,
Barry and Iris are our business.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,764
How did you find out?

88
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,122
When I touched...

89
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,526
...the Flash...

90
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,446
...the other night, I felt
a jolt of electricity.

91
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,286
The only other time I've felt anything
like that was when you were in a coma...

92
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,687
...after the accident.

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,009
Heh. I can't believe
I didn't figure it out sooner.

94
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,569
I can only imagine how angry you are.

95
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,962
I'm not angry, Barry.

96
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,242
I'm just disappointed.

97
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,090
Okay.

98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,008
Does Eddie know?

99
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,611
Yes, he does.

100
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,970
Is that why he got kidnapped?

101
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,851
No, I don't know why Wells took Eddie. I...

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,207
Dr. Wells is the Man in Yellow?

103
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,807
Everything he's been doing...

104
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,689
...helping me...

105
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,121
...it was all a lie.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,004
Wells killed my mom.

107
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,769
- Is he gonna kill Eddie?
- No, he's not. I'm gonna get Eddie back.

108
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,809
- I swear.
- The Flash said the same thing.

109
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,760
Look, Iris, you have to believe me. There
were so many times I wanted to tell you.

110
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,526
You were the first person I wanted to tell.

111
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,241
But then everything started getting crazy.
And I thought maybe Joe was right...

112
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,524
Wait, wait, wait.
You're telling me that my dad knew...

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,921
...and he told you not to tell me?

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,243
He was trying to protect you.

115
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,522
We both were.

116
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,523
Yeah, well,
maybe it's time you both stopped.

117
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,686
Yeah. Uh-huh.

118
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,446
Yeah, if we could get another shipment...

119
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,610
...of the computers in here.

120
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,845
- I don't think that had anything to do with us.
- Nope.

121
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,969
I don't suppose you brought lunch.

122
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,809
Did you know that human beings...

123
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,923
...can survive up to two months...

124
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,361
...without food?

125
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,564
Is that how long you're planning
on keeping me here?

126
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,564
You know...

127
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,007
...I doubt it'll come to that.

128
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,082
You wanna tell me
what we're doing down here?

129
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,890
No.

130
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,847
You told me we're related,
that you're from the future.

131
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,886
- Prove it.
- Yeah, I don't have to prove anything...

132
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,844
...to anyone.

133
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,962
Well, I think you're full of crap.
And whatever you're trying to do...

134
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,931
...you're not gonna get away with it
because the Flash is...

135
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,966
Stop talking.

136
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,882
I heard you talked to Barry.

137
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,651
So this is what
my cold-shoulder treatment feels like.

138
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,565
Look.

139
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,966
Baby, the way I went about things, maybe...

140
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,367
No, I was wrong.

141
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,840
I was just trying to keep you safe.

142
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,002
You know, that excuse
is getting really old.

143
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,683
First, it was the police academy,
and then it was dating Eddie, and now this.

144
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,003
Sweetheart, you know
what the Man in Yellow is capable of.

145
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,089
He killed cops. He killed Mason Bridge.

146
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,330
Wells killed Mason?

147
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,162
- And you're covering that up?
- No.

148
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,767
No. No, no, no.

149
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,329
If the world finds out about Wells, they find
out about Barry. I'm trying to keep him safe.

150
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,246
Did you ever stop to think
that looping me in would keep me safe?

151
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,722
That if I knew what was going on out there,
I could prepare for it?

152
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,050
Maybe I could've helped you and Barry put the
bad guys away instead of being in the way.

153
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,043
I asked myself that question every day.

154
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,330
- Every time you post something on your blog.
- It's not just about Barry being the Flash.

155
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,889
You knew how he felt about me for God knows
how long, and you didn't tell me that either.

156
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,764
That wasn't for me to tell, Iris.

157
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,209
You know what? If any of you had been honest
with me, maybe Eddie would still be here.

158
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,563
He wouldn't have gotten involved in this
if I hadn't been dating him.

159
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,240
Are you saying
if you had known how Barry felt...?

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,728
What I am saying is that
what happened to Eddie is your fault.

161
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,651
This is work.

162
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,131
We can finish this talk.

163
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,164
Talking.

164
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,244
Yeah, that'll be new.

165
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,363
Yeah, boss.

166
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,764
I just got a call from Joe.

167
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,686
The Central City Gold Reserve is about
to transport $300 million in gold bars...

168
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,291
...to their Coast City vault.

169
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,444
Singh told Joe they think the Man in
the Mask is gonna make a play for it.

170
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,929
Okay, but we still don't know if he's
responsible for those weird images you saw.

171
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,685
How are they transporting the gold?

172
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,320
Sorry, no more ice cream.

173
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,802
But your music's playing.

174
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,361
Yeah, it means we're out.

175
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,167
Come on.

176
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,125
You might wanna kill the music.

177
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,449
We don't want any kids around
if our thief shows up.

178
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,841
Whoa, the truck just got hit by a landmine.

179
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,480
- Is Joe okay?
- We don't know yet.

180
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,524
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

181
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,249
Don't make me do this.

182
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,727
You Okay?

183
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,968
Yeah. You?

184
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,767
I didn't want you to have to shoot him
again. And I'm having a pretty bad day.

185
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,929
So is this guy.

186
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,363
Let's see what Goldfinger has
to say for himself.

187
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,611
General Eiling?

188
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,365
What is wrong with him?

189
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,729
- I pulled a bullet out of his shoulder...
- Which should hurt like hell.

190
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,888
And it didn't even seem like he felt it.

191
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,284
I did a complete body scan, and otherwise,
General Eiling is perfectly healthy.

192
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,011
So why is he just standing there
like a robot?

193
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,043
I just got off the phone with A.R.G.U.S.

194
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,722
- Officially, Eiling is on administrative leave.
- Unofficially...?

195
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,208
I spoke with Diggle's wife, Lyla,
and she said Eiling's been missing...

196
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,483
...for the past three months,
and A.R.G.U.S. is covering up for it.

197
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,363
Makes sense. Last time I saw the general was
when Ronnie and I broke Professor Stein...

198
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,882
...out of that military facility.
I'm sure they're covering that up too.

199
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,242
So where has he been since then?

200
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,202
General Eiling, why were you trying
to rob the gold reserve?

201
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,407
Maybe he's in some kind of a trance?

202
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,564
General?

203
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,887
Do you remember me?

204
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,649
Flash.

205
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,485
Ooh. How does he know you're the Flash?

206
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,324
I don't know.

207
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,561
- General...
- Eiling not here.

208
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,770
Eiling...

209
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,202
...bad.

210
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,842
Maybe it's some kind of psychotic break...

211
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,725
...presenting itself
as dissociative identity disorder?

212
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,921
Caitlin.

213
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,446
Caitlin...

214
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,971
...good.

215
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,885
Oh, uh, thank you?

216
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,171
Mm. Forget multiple personalities.
You guys have seen The Exorcist, right?

217
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,727
You and your movies.

218
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,686
Keep talking to him.
He seems to respond to you.

219
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,367
Uh, Why is Eiling bad?

220
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,130
Eiling...

221
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,204
...hurt me.

222
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,364
I hurt...

223
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,801
...Eiling.

224
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,927
Okay.

225
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,927
Uh, so if you're not Eiling,
then who are you?

226
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,084
I...

227
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,089
...am...

228
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,641
...Grodd.

229
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,202
Fear me.

230
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,961
What is a Grodd?

231
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,640
Oh. Grodd is a gorilla.

232
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,650
Five years ago, Eiling and Wells
were working on a project...

233
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,491
...to expand soldiers' cognitive abilities
during battle.

234
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,571
We didn't realize that Eiling was trying
to create soldiers with psychic abilities.

235
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,330
What do you mean, psychic?

236
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,242
Eiling was trying to create these super-soldiers
with telepathic and telekinetic capabilities.

237
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,728
When Wells found out about the terrible
experiments Eiling was doing...

238
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,445
...he shut down the project.

239
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,530
So our psycho-killer has a soft spot
for animals. That's sweet.

240
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,091
What happened to...

241
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,286
...Grodd?
We don't know.

242
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,768
After the particle accelerator exploded,
I went down to check on him...

243
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,206
...and his cage was empty.

244
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,728
So he could've been affected
by the same energy that hit Barry.

245
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,610
When the dark matter hit Grodd...

246
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,482
...all the drugs and serums that Eiling
injected him with could've activated.

247
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,281
Maybe the accelerator explosion
created a meta-gorilla.

248
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,205
I think we know what happens
when a super-intelligent ape...

249
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,641
...who's pissed off at humans
escapes captivity.

250
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,889
Cisc0's right. About the first part.

251
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,124
This is the first brain scan
that I did on Grodd.

252
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,564
Whoa. His primary motor cortex and Broca's
area are lit up like a Christmas tree.

253
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,205
From Eiling's experiments.

254
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,165
And this is the brain scan
that I just did on Eiling.

255
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,362
His brain is lit up in the exact same way.

256
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,530
So Grodd and Eiling
are connected somehow.

257
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,204
I think that somehow Grodd is transmitting
neural signals to Eiling's primary motor cortex.

258
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,887
Mind control. Telepathy.
Who knows what Grodd is capable of now?

259
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,369
What do we think Grodd wants? Revenge?

260
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,961
I do not like the fact
that Wells rescued Grodd.

261
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,050
I don't think it's a coincidence
that this gorilla shows up...

262
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,245
...at the same time we're looking for Wells.
Grodd and Wells did have a special bond.

263
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,728
It wouldn't surprise me
if Wells was using Grodd to distract us.

264
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,531
If we find Grodd, we find Wells.

265
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,326
- If we find Wells...
- We find Eddie.

266
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,080
And I'm gonna help.

267
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,124
Know anything about gorillas?

268
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,203
I just might.

269
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,410
There have been reports
of some sort of animal down in the sewers.

270
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,881
Mm. Alligators...

271
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,285
...C.H.U.D.'S...

272
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,930
...R.O.U.S.'s.

273
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,403
Am I the only one
who watches movies around here?

274
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,962
Uh, a few months ago,
two sewer workers went missing.

275
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,489
The search party reported hearing strange,
animal-like noises down in the tunnels.

276
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,688
Where exactly did they go missing?

277
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,765
- Uh, Fifth Avenue and 10th Street.
- There's an access point to the sewers...

278
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,089
...about two blocks east of that intersection.
- I'll start there.

279
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,562
Not alone. I'm coming too.

280
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,171
Huh. Wading through miles of rats, roaches,
and human excrement? Count me out.

281
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,004
Count me in.

282
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,004
It's your monkey.

283
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,884
Cisco, take the rest of these flares, light
them, drop them as we go. It's our path back.

284
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,242
Give me that banana.

285
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,161
Okay.

286
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,326
- Stay close.
- Definitely.

287
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,682
I'm not going anywhere.

288
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,045
Thanks for sticking up for me.

289
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,406
Of course.

290
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,523
For what it's worth, Barry feels
really terrible about lying to you.

291
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,202
He should.

292
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,961
You lied too.

293
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,369
Your fiancé.

294
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,722
Ronnie. Yes.

295
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,408
Uh, I thought he died
in the particle-accelerator explosion...

296
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,202
...but it turns out he just caught on fire.

297
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,721
Oh.

298
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,530
But he's okay?

299
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,444
Yeah, he is.

300
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,369
Good, I'm glad.

301
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,920
I can't believe
I'm looking for a supernatural gorilla.

302
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,809
I'm terrified of regular gorillas.

303
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,041
What was that?

304
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,410
Oh. Oh.

305
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,651
Whoa.

306
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,966
Hey, hey, guys. Look at this.

307
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,522
Incredible.

308
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,248
Looks like we're in the right place.

309
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,565
Somebody wanna tell me
what we're looking at here?

310
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,930
Grodd. He's evolving.

311
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,569
He's getting smarter.

312
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,565
Getting smarter. Great.

313
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,001
If I hadn't seen Jurassic Park, I wouldn't
be nearly as frightened right now.

314
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,003
So if he's getting smarter,
you think he might be getting bigger too?

315
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,841
That must have been
a truck passing over, right?

316
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,244
Cisco?

317
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,240
Barf)'-

318
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,127
- We gotta get out of here.
- Barry's out cold.

319
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,441
Joe.

320
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,528
Dad.

321
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,085
What...? What are you doing to me?

322
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,331
Help!

323
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,961
Cisco, help me!

324
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,810
No help here.

325
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,281
I can... I can hear you in my head.

326
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,285
You are telepathic.

327
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,809
Please.

328
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,962
Please. No, no, no.

329
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,367
Father hate gun.

330
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,605
Father. Father. You mean... You mean Wells.

331
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,280
Wells? Is that what you mean?

332
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,331
Where is he?

333
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,211
$5235;;.

334
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,291
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Here. Is this what you want?

335
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,962
You can have it. It's yours. Take it.

336
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,009
Grodd hate banana.

337
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,531
Please, please.

338
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,801
You're experiencing a spike of activity
in your primary motor cortex.

339
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,685
It's the same thing we saw in Eiling.

340
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,845
The images you saw
were some kind of psychic attack by Grodd.

341
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,403
First, Eddie gets taken by the
Man in Yellow, and now my dad...

342
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,728
We're gonna save both of them.
I promise you.

343
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,601
I put a tracker in the tranq dart you shot
Grodd with. As soon as it activates...

344
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,207
I can't wait for that. I will search
every inch of that sewer if I have to.

345
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,771
What happens if you find them?

346
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,369
What happens if Grodd takes over your mind
the same way he did with Eiling?

347
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,204
Can you guys build me something?

348
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,522
Some kind of tech
so he can't get into my head?

349
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,249
I don't know.

350
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,930
Maybe if Doctor Wells were here.

351
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,761
I don't understand.

352
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,646
Every day you guys figure out
a way to help people.

353
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,201
All of the Flash's powers
and all this equipment...

354
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,243
...and you can't save Eddie and my dad?

355
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,563
We'll figure something out.

356
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,881
Fast.

357
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,047
- Iris.
- I can't get that sound out of my head.

358
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,049
My dad screaming.

359
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,441
Why did he insist
on going down there with you?

360
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,444
He's always preaching about being safe...

361
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,286
...but not once does he think about
running into danger himself.

362
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,240
- Iris...
- No, Barry. He's just a regular cop.

363
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,086
He's not some metahuman
with super powers.

364
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,248
He's not you.

365
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,721
You're right, he's not me.

366
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,851
And this isn't his fault.
None of this is his fault.

367
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,767
Look, yes, maybe Joe told me
not to tell you that I was the Flash...

368
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,440
...but I didn't have to listen.
I could've told you.

369
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,963
A hundred times I could've told you,
and I didn't.

370
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,605
Yes, I should've, so
you're right to be mad.

371
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,441
But don't be mad at your dad. Be mad at me.

372
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,445
Okay.

373
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,922
Okay, explain to me how the person
I thought I knew better than anyone...

374
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,849
...has been keeping secrets from me.

375
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,330
Big life-changing secrets.

376
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,126
You were supposed to be
my best friend, Barry.

377
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,482
- I am your best friend.
- How can you say that...

378
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,122
...when the most important things in
your life, things that matter most...

379
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,284
...things you're supposed to share,
you kept all of them from me?

380
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,444
You lied to me about everything.

381
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,369
I know, Iris. I know.

382
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,803
But you haven't been entirely honest
with me either.

383
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,364
What...? What are you talking about?

384
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,166
At Christmas, when I told you how I felt,
you said you didn't feel the same way.

385
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,281
But I just feel like, I don't know,
maybe things aren't that simple.

386
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,325
Am I wrong?

387
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,482
I'm gonna check on Cisco and Caitlin.

388
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,330
You know they're gonna find me.

389
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,522
And you, you're not as smart
as you think you are.

390
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,081
Oh, really?
Because I'm a genius where I come from.

391
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,009
Imagine how smart that makes me here.

392
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,089
- Because you're from the future?
- Mm.

393
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,330
With a name like "Eobard,"
I guess you'd have to be.

394
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,081
Oh, no. Eobard is a distinguished name
for a distinguished member...

395
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,600
...of a distinguished family.

396
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,606
Depressing to think all of my descendants
are as crazy as you.

397
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,842
No, no, no.

398
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,244
The Thawne bloodline is chockfull
of influential politicians...

399
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,090
...scientists, captains of industry.

400
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,608
Failures, such as yourself...

401
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,605
...are just the exception.

402
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,770
And what exactly makes me such a failure?

403
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,445
Tough question, Eddie. Where to start?

404
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,611
Oh, how about your career
as a police detective?

405
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,410
It's spectacularly uneventful.

406
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,562
Yeah, well, we'll see.

407
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,282
No, we have seen. I have seen.

408
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,565
I am from the future.
And you are the only Thawne...

409
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,406
...to be all but forgotten by history.

410
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,965
A waste of a life, a waste of a man and...

411
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,083
Oh, no.

412
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,244
You don't even get the girl.

413
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,010
What are you talking about?

414
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,091
Observe, if you will, the byline.

415
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,131
Barry marries Iris and not you.

416
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,491
We're just gonna have to give this ring...

417
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,091
...back to Grandma Agnes.

418
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,080
You, Eddie...

419
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,408
...won't be needing it.

420
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,610
An anti-telepathy strip.

421
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,765
It uses magnetic resonance to neutralize
any foreign neurological stimulus.

422
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,964
So it'll protect Barry
from being mind-controlled?

423
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,330
That's the hope. But we have no way
of knowing if it actually works.

424
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,524
It'll work.

425
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,007
The trackerjust came online.

426
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,244
We have Gr0dd's location.

427
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,684
Iris...

428
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,129
...I want you to know,
all the times I imagined you being here...

429
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,805
...it was not like this.

430
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,845
Get my dad back.

431
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,165
Barry, what's your ETA?

432
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,924
All right, I'm in position.

433
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,326
Wait for my signal.

434
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,324
- So the red, that's Barry?
- Yes.

435
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,482
And the blue?
ls Grodd.

436
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,129
Okay, here goes nothing.

437
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,401
- The steam's working. Grodd's on the move.
- I don't understand. What's the plan?

438
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,923
He's maneuvering Grodd into a tunnel
5.3 miles from Barry.

439
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,084
- So Barry can do what?
- Same thing he did to Girder.

440
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,047
Supersonic punch, baby.

441
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,930
Hit it.

442
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,770
The supersonic punch failed.

443
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,241
Here we go.

444
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,409
It's okay, Cisco. The headset's working.

445
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,491
Yes. Okay, uh,
try some speed punches on him.

446
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,603
- This isn't working.
- Okay, what if you try...?

447
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,931
Barf)'-

448
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,081
Barry.

449
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,489
- The headset's offline.
- Sounded like it impacted with something.

450
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,246
Human weak-

451
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,324
Barry's brain activity is off the charts.
Worse than last time.

452
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,801
- What's happening?
- Grodd's attacking psychically.

453
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,645
- He's paralyzed.
- Come on. There's a service train coming.

454
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,685
- Do something.
- I can't stop it.

455
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,649
You have to get out of there now.

456
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,326
What do we do?

457
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,487
Barry, listen to me, okay?
You have to concentrate on my voice.

458
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,411
Whatever is happening to you,
you have to fight it.

459
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,721
I know you can do this.
I know how strong you are.

460
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,961
Stand up to Grodd. You can do this.

461
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,727
Please.

462
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,490
Barry, do it for me.

463
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,008
Iris.

464
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,520
- Joe.
- Barry.

465
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,040
Please, get me out of here.

466
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,322
Barry.

467
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,011
I'm bringing him home.

468
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,449
Mr. Allen.

469
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,284
How nice of you to visit.

470
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,647
How long do you intend
to keep me prisoner?

471
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,770
Your brain scan's normal which means
Grodd is no longer controlling you.

472
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,727
This prison is for metahumans,
so you're free to go.

473
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,567
You will get what's coming to you
eventually.

474
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,684
I'm not ashamed of my actions, Mr. Allen.

475
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,241
You've seen what these metahumans
are capable of.

476
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,970
Soon your prison won't be enough.

477
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,561
Not all metahumans are dangerous.

478
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,042
You're afraid that I know you're the Flash?

479
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,806
Don't get your tights in a twist.
I've known for months.

480
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,611
If I wanted to come after you,
I'd have done it by now.

481
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,888
But you think you're gonna need me.

482
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,768
Harrison Wells turned
me over to that beast.

483
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,729
He used me like a damn puppet.

484
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,289
So like it or not, we have a common enemy,
you and I.

485
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,849
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a gorilla to hunt.

486
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,961
I said be still.

487
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,849
You have three fractured ribs.

488
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,445
I'll be fine.

489
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,961
Dad, you need to rest.

490
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,726
I can't believe Grodd became so violent.

491
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,727
What was his lair like?
Did he eat the banana?

492
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,810
Does he like King Kong?
He's more of a Planet of the Apes ape?

493
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,802
Uh, terrifying. No. And I didn't ask.

494
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,247
Hmm.

495
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,008
You mind if I talk to my daughter alone?

496
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,881
When I was with that gorilla...

497
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,840
...I thought: "I'm gonna die down here."

498
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,765
And all I could think about was...

499
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,247
...how you and me were in a fight.

500
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,763
Dad, I was so afraid that
something would happen to you.

501
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,847
My life started when you were born.

502
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,162
And sometimes...

503
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:05,367
...my incredible love for you,
it blinds me, and I forget...

504
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,361
I forget what a brilliant
young woman you are.

505
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,569
How you're capable
of making your own decisions.

506
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,327
Daddy, I know that everything that you do
is out of love.

507
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,081
So love me enough
to always tell me the truth.

508
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,924
- Yeah?
- Deal. Deal.

509
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,810
Okay.

510
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,201
- Ow.
- Oh.

511
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,362
Oh, my bad.

512
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,921
Oh, my bad. Oh, my God.

513
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,401
Maybe it's a good thing
we didn't catch Grodd.

514
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,881
Where would we put him?

515
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,211
I mean, the pipeline isn't exactly equipped to
hold a super-intelligent, telepathic gorilla.

516
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,926
Joe mentioned that
Grodd called Wells, "Father."

517
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,370
Wells must've ordered Grodd
to come after us.

518
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,723
It's why Grodd didn't kill Joe.

519
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:03,889
I think Joe was right. Everything Grodd
did, it was just to distract us.

520
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,251
What's going on? You okay?

521
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,091
Just thinking about this headset.

522
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,927
It wasn't strong enough.

523
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,923
You could've been killed out there, man.

524
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,122
No, dude, your tech worked.

525
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,926
And it proved that we don't need Wells.

526
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,567
The three of us took on Grodd
and rescued Joe.

527
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,046
Together, we can do anything.

528
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,251
Actually, it was the four of us.

529
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,930
Hey.

530
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,761
H9)'-

531
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,765
How did you know I was here?

532
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,964
This is your spot.

533
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,884
Yeah, it's a special spot.

534
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,410
It's where I first met the Flash.

535
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,808
All those times, you were standing
right in front of me and I had no idea.

536
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,322
I don't even know you anymore.

537
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,171
Iris, what you were saying to me...

538
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,846
...when I was down in the sewer...

539
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,970
You know why I wasn't afraid?

540
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,448
Because you were there.

541
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,405
Even though I really was scared,
having you there...

542
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,928
...is how I could stand up to Grodd.

543
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,169
Every time I falter...

544
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,205
...or make a mistake...

545
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,850
...the thought of you is what picks me up
and keeps me going.

546
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,202
Look, what I'm trying to say is...

547
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,524
...even though you didn't
know everything...

548
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,722
...about my life this past year...

549
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,447
...that does not mean
that you weren't a part of it.

550
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,204
You were.

551
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,203
Every single day.

552
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,488
Without you...

553
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,886
...there wouldn't be the Flash.

554
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,045
I've thought about what you said...

555
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,687
...and maybe you were right.

556
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,721
I have been thinking about you...

557
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,884
...about us.

558
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,247
...but I can't do that anymore.

559
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,969
Eddie is the man that I live with,
the man that I love...

560
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,531
...and he's still missing.

561
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,405
I know.

562
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,080
I'm gonna bring him back.

563
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,050
And after that?

564
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,923
I don't know.

565
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,288
I don't know.

566
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,691
- So now what?
- Now...

567
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,691
...I have the key.

568
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,361
The key to what?

569
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,361
Time to go home.

570
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:04,262
