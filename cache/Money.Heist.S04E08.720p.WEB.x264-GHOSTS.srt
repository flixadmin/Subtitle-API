1
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,750
How do I look?

2
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,333
Powerful.

3
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,416
Beautiful.

4
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,333
Martín...

5
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,250
you've been going around...

6
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,208
for years and years...

7
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,291
carrying that thing inside you.

8
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,625
I think it's about time you took it out.

9
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,666
I can take out some wine if you like. Hmm?

10
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,250
- Shall we have some?
- No.

11
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,458
No, I'm not gonna drink
that wine with you.

12
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going out for dinner with Tatiana.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,625
- Yeah.
- You'll think about me...

14
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:08,916
but...

15
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,375
I'm won't think about you.

16
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,083
You don't have to say another word.
I get it.

17
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,791
Come on!

18
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:25,000
You think I don't love you? I feel it too.
There's something between us, something...

19
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,791
extraordinary, unique, marvelous.

20
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,166
I know about love.
I've been married five times.

21
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,875
- Well...
- What I've never told you is that...

22
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,041
none of these women
ever made me feel something remotely...

23
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,750
similar to what I feel with you.

24
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,208
Not even close.

25
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,125
You and I are soul mates.

26
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,000
But just 99 percent. Hmm?

27
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,083
You know,

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,833
I really like women. I like them a lot.

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,833
And you like me too much.

30
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,250
And what's that one percent against 99?

31
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,625
Unless you're not brave enough to try it.

32
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,791
That one percent is a tiny mitochondrion,

33
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,916
but it defines my desire.

34
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,541
Mitochondrion.

35
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,000
Where is the desire?

36
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,541
Hey?

37
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,333
Here?

38
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,333
Where?

39
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,750
Don't worry.

40
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:43,833
Relax.

41
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,958
Don't be afraid.

42
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,750
Are you a coward, huh?

43
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,166
Where is it?

44
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,791
Huh?

45
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,458
Martín...

46
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,083
Listen... Hmm.

47
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:35,208
I'd give anything
so I could feel this, but...

48
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,416
it's impossible.

49
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,833
It's impossible.

50
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,250
I love you, Martín.

51
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,125
But my brother's right.
We have to part ways.

52
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,791
Mm?

53
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,250
And we have to give up the plan.

54
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,041
It was that son of a bitch,
your brother,

55
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,500
who didn't understand my love for you
and tore us apart.

56
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,125
You're gonna make photocopies
in that fucking mint.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,791
I offered to melt gold with you.

58
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,458
You're hanging onto something
that doesn't exist and never will!

59
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,833
I have to leave you. It's...

60
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,750
because of love.

61
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,333
And also for our friendship.

62
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,541
For the bond I have with you.

63
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,750
Now go away...

64
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,083
so you can heal your wound.

65
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,666
Sometimes distance
is the only way to find peace.

66
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,208
<i>Adiós,</i> my friend.

67
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,916
I'm confident that,

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,750
one way or another,
time will bring us back together.

69
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,333
<i>Alicia Sierra walked towards
the slaughterhouse,</i>

70
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,708
<i>and nobody noticed
the mysterious smile on her face.</i>

71
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,250
<i>That smile...</i>

72
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,125
<i>wasn't the look
of someone about to give up.</i>

73
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,958
Is it true that you used the daughter

74
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,833
of Ágata Jiménez, alias Nairobi,

75
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,416
to make her approach the window
and then shoot her?

76
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,916
<i>- Did she die from the shot?
- That is absolutely false.</i>

77
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,458
It wasn't her daughter. It was her son.
Nine years old.

78
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,333
And yes, I used him.

79
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,791
<i>My superiors knew about it
and authorized it, of course.</i>

80
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,541
- What are you doing, Alicia?
<i>- We shot her in the chest.</i>

81
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,000
Then they asked for a doctor,
and I didn't send one in.

82
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,666
Antoñanzas, turn up the volume!

83
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,125
<i>Her friends saved her,
but that didn't matter.</i>

84
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,083
<i>She was executed by the chief of security
for the Bank of Spain,</i>

85
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,041
Gandía, with the full support
of Colonel Tamayo.

86
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,500
- Alicia, you fucking bitch!
<i>- That's it.</i>

87
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,875
Next question.

88
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,041
<i>Is it also true that this guy Osman,</i>

89
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,833
I don't know if you know him,
that he buried Cortés alive?

90
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,291
Yes, we buried him alive.

91
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,500
<i>In Timimoun...</i>

92
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,791
<i>Tamayo's world
was falling to pieces.</i>

93
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,375
<i>And of course I know Osman.
He's a professional.</i>

94
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,625
<i>He's able to bury people alive...</i>

95
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,875
and make them shiver like dogs
without killing them.

96
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,916
<i>They were being eviscerated
in the eyes of the public,</i>

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,916
<i>and he was unaware of something worse.</i>

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,916
<i>In the bank,</i>

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,291
<i>his biggest hope was lying unconscious...</i>

100
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,375
Palermo.

101
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,750
- <i>How is he doing?</i>
- We're operating.

102
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,791
<i>...on a stretcher,
shards in his back.</i>

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,875
You have to save his life.

104
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,416
Drugs? We gave him drugs.

105
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,708
Inhaled, to be precise.

106
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,791
<i>Then we hung him up,</i>

107
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,458
<i>threw buckets of cold water at him,
and he shit himself.</i>

108
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,041
<i>Everything the kid said</i>

109
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,125
is absolutely, completely true.

110
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,328
And, since I'm being honest,

111
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,535
there's a bunch of other stuff
I think he forgot about.

112
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,541
And was the Government aware of this?

113
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,541
Aware?

114
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,041
The Government gave the orders.

115
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,961
It's not like
I just got up one morning and said,

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,375
"I'm gonna torture this kid."
I had everyone's approval.

00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,625
On the road between point A and point B.

163
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,333
- No.
- In the Supreme Court with the judge?

164
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:58,750
No.

165
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,625
Don't tell me we gonna make
a hole in prison?

166
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:05,000
No, but there is one place
that is vulnerable.

167
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,083
In fact, we've all seen it before.

168
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,791
<i>On TV.</i>

169

171
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,750
<i>They will take the prisoner...</i>

172
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,791
through the parking garage.

173
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,666
<i>Only the van goes in there.</i>

174
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,916
In 30 seconds, the armed convoy

<i>to six, and from seven vehicles...</i>

00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,416
POLICE

178
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,291
And a parking garage is not a bunker
or a prison with lots of security.

179
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,166
- A garage is...
- For parking.

180
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,458
Exactly.

181
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,166

183
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,791
there's exactly...

184
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,625
eleven meters
and 68 centimeters of sandstone.

185
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,166
Sandstone. You guys are Asturian miners.

186
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,125
The best ones.

187
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,528
- What's that for you?
- Nothing. Pick, shovel and grinder.

<i>Palermo, how is he?</i>

203
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,291
He's conscious.

00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,638
<i>What's his physical condition?</i>

205
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,875
One of his arms is completely immobilized.

206
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,250
He's lost a lot of blood.

207
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,708
He's breathing like a fucked up stuck pig.

208
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,250
Is he going to recover?

209
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,875
If I was his mother,
I'd be lighting candles for him, sir.

210
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,708
He'll recover. Don't you worry

211
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,833
I'm gonna take care of it personally,

212
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,876
<i>even if I have to get him to a hospital

I'll make sure you recover.

214
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,625
I'll spoon-feed you soup.

215
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,333
I'll take good care of you.

216
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,166
And when you're strong like a bull,

217
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,125
I'm gonna kill you.

<i>We have to kill him!</i>

00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,041
But if he wants to die,

Why is it up to him?

You've no right to say that

235

<i>because you have no idea

236

You don't know what it feels like

Tokyo...

238

<i>Don't talk to me like you're my father.</i>

239

Do you have any idea how I feel?

240

Do you have any idea how Helsinki feels?

241
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,250
Helsinki...

242
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,708
was sewing him up.

243
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,750
<i>He's treating him.</i>

244
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,958
<i>Do you know who Helsinki treated before?
No!</i>

245
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,291
No, you don't know.
Of course, you don't know.

246
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,833
You don't know anything because you sit
in a hole, hidden like a rat.

247
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,958
That's why they killed Nairobi,
and you're giving orders

248
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,226
without shedding a tear
because you don't feel anything!

249
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,916
- Tokyo...
- Because you don't feel anything!

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,416
You don't feel anything!

251
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,416
- You don't feel anything!
- Stop! Stop!

252
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,208
- No! Nothing!
- Stop!

253
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,875
Do you want to spoon-feed him soup too?

254
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,750
Look, Tokyo, if I could,

255
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,500
I'd impale him with a fucking hot iron.

256
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,750
I'd take him down to the foundry.

257
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,833
I'd shove his head
inside the fucking furnace.

258
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,333
You think what happened to Nairobi
doesn't hurt?

259
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,150
That it doesn't hurt the Professor?

260
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,416
It doesn't seem like it.

261
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,416
<i>Gandía's a prisoner,</i>

262
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,791
and we don't kill prisoners.

263
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,291
No matter how fucking hard it is,
we don't kill prisoners.

264
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,500
And we're not cold-blooded killers, Tokyo.

265
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,875
But he is!

266
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,583
He fucking killed Nairobi! She was sick,
unarmed. She'd surrendered!

267
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,958
We had a truce, for fuck's sake!

268
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,500
Now we have to save our own lives,
like we did with you.

269
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,708
<i>And that involves collateral damage,
including dealing with the pain.</i>

270
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,875
<i>We are running out of time.</i>

271
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,500
They've broken the truce,

But what could happen
when someone's incommunicado?

303
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,916
Or maybe she wasn't so incommunicado.

Should we go after Antoñanzas?

Clever kitty.

311
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,083
Well, to be honest,
it's more like a vacation.

00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,750
<i>That's not all. The minister, the director
of the CNI and their police chiefs</i>

322
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:28,041
<i>are preparing libel, slander
and defamation of character claims</i>

323
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,166
<i>against the inspector.</i>

324
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,291
<i>We've confirmed it, Colonel.
The ministry has ordered her arrest.</i>

325
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,166
Go get her!

326
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,375
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,583
I'm personally responsible
for all this shit.

328
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,958
I didn't realize the amount of pain
I'd cause, and I'm very sorry.

329
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,791
What do you know about pain, Palermo?

330
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,375
Pain is like a loan.

331
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,541
And no matter what you do,
you can never pay back the debt.

332
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,708
I can handle pain.

333
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,541
Lots of pain.

334
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,166
Oh, yeah?

335
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,583
Even the pain you're feeling right now?

336
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,458
This one's different, right?

337
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,958
I saw it in your eyes.

338
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,208
I saw it, and it reminds me of myself.

339
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,750
<i>You have no idea...</i>

340
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,708
<i>where the pain will take you, my friend.</i>

341
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,166
Get out of it while you can.

342
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,708
Otherwise, you could end up

343
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,750
becoming a piece of shit like me.

344
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,250
<i>A miserable monster.</i>

345
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,416
A guy who ruins everything he touches.

346
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,416
Someone who flirted with death for years.

347
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,583
Once you're there, you can't get out.
You can never get out.

348
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,041
Look, brother...

349
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,041
because of all that bullshit
boom, boom,<i> ciao,</i>

350
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,208
I treated you like trash.

351
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,375
I wasn't brave. I couldn't be.
I didn't have the strength.

352
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,333
But I'm telling you, I'm here with you.
You're not alone.

353
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:37,875
I know.

354
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,458
I've known that from the beginning.

355
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,833
I know who you are.

356
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,458
My name is Martín Berrote.

357
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,208
I was born in Buenos Aires,

358
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,416
but I live in Palermo, Sicily.

359
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,916
And I am going
to get you out of here alive,

360
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,666
even if I have to give my own life.

361
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,750
My name is Mirko Dragic.

362
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,291
I'm from Belgrade.

363
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,125
I lost Oslo at the Royal Mint of Spain,

364
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:09,791
and I lost Nairobi.

365
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,291
And I'm not gonna lose anyone else.

366
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,250
Not even you, Martín Berrote.

367
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,583
NATIONAL COURT
09:34 HOURS

368
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,625
<i>Lisbon is going to testify
in the Supreme Court.</i>

369
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,041
<i>She'll earn the judge's trust,
giving them information,</i>

370
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,000
<i>cooperating and being reliable.</i>

371
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,916
<i>She'll give every little detail
about the heist because all of this...</i>

372
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,541
is part of plan Paris.

373
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,000
What is plan Paris?

374
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,166
A rescue plan
in case one of us gets caught.

375
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,625
And why Paris?

376
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, it's...

377
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,916
It's the city of freedom.

378
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Mm.

379
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,291
And of love.

380
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,166
Who hasn't walked around Paris in love?
Right, boys?

381
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,458
What will Lisbon tell the judge?

382
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,333
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

383
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,916
And in fact, she'll start with love.

384
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,791
How did you reconnect after
the first heist with Sergio Marquina?

385
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:32,875
How was it arranged?

386
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,041
I met the Professor
one year after they escaped

387
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,833
<i>in Palawan, Philippines.</i>

388
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,750
<i>He left a puzzle with coordinates.</i>

389
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,666
He doesn't look like it,
but he's a romantic.

390
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,708
She'll tell them everything.

391
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:48,416
Everything! Where we live, how often we've
had to move, how we move.

392
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,208
After about an hour, an hour and a half,

393
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,916
she'll start to tell them the plan.

394
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,083
The plan?

395
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:54,926
- She can't tell them.
- She can.

396
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:58,291
Truth is the basis of any relationship,
and that's how she'll earn it.

397
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,625
The plan is to steal 90 tons of gold
from the national reserve,

398
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,958
and what we're doing now is melting it.

399
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,583
You're melting the gold in the bank?

400
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:09,791
As of now, they've melted about 50 tons.

401
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,041
We're using industrial furnaces
made by a company called Harmand.

402
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,125
Harmand.

403
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,833
German. They're the best.

404
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,458
Benjamín, how are we doing?

405
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,125
Seven and a half meters!

406
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,333
We need to go faster.

407
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,625
Go faster! Go faster!

408
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,958
We'll give them every single detail.

409
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,250
They reach 2,300 degrees.

410
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,250
- Gold melts at 1,064.
<i>- We'll overwhelm them</i>

411
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,166
with so many technicalities
that their poor brains

412
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,291
won't be able to process
that much information.

413
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,083
We knew that the vault would flood

414
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,166
with a water flow
of 7,500 liters per minute.

415
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,125
That information is very detailed.

416
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,875
And we're doing it so...

417
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,291
- they get tired?
- Exactly.

418
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,583
The biggest challenge
was the interconnection chamber.

419
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,500
Could I have a pen and paper?

420
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:54,291
Let's get you tired first.

421
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,833
- Meters?
- Nine meters!

422
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:00,750
Go faster.

423
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,541
<i>The door to the vault,</i>

424
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,875
fourteen tons of steel,

425
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,416
we had to drill through it in just a few
minutes. A perfect circle with a radius...

426
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
The bathyscaphe floods...
That's how the divers...

427
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,250
We weld the interconnection chamber...

428
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,809
There's a balance in pressure...
To compensate...

429
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,583
Twenty three hundred degrees Celsius...

430
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,291
And it comes out the other side.

431
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,916
Can we get some dinner in here, please?

432
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,500
<i>They say pregnant women
have a sharper sense of smell.</i>

433
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:35,083
<i>The Professor hadn't anticipated
Sierra would have that superpower.</i>

434
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,958
<i>It was the first time
someone was tracking his scent</i>

435
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,291
<i>without him realizing it.</i>

436
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,375
<i>Antoñanzas's wife
hadn't seen the news yet.</i>

437
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,875
- Marisa?
<i>- Sierra got all the information</i>

438
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,708
<i>she needed in under three minutes.</i>

439
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,708
I work with Benito.
I don't know if you know me.

440
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:54,791
I know you.

441
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,666
Okay, how do I say this?

442
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,625
I've just been feeling
like Benito hasn't...

443
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,375
been himself these days...

444
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,708
<i>Antoñanzas was acting nervous at home,</i>

445
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,541
<i>and then he was found in the pool
with two friends</i>

446
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,000
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

447
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,458
<i>And to top it off,</i>

448
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,125
<i>he was wasted.</i>

449
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:20,458
<i>Colonel, it looks like Alicia Sierra
isn't home. We can't find her.</i>

450
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:21,958
Fucking bitch!

451
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,416
Attention, all units. Orders are out for
the search and capture of Alicia Sierra.

452
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,166
It doesn't matter who you are.
I can't give you the videos.

453
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,250
I need authorization from a judge,

454
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,125
or at least the president
of the community.

455
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,000
Wait, wait a second. Someone's calling me.

456
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,708
Look at that.
The president of the community.

457
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,291
How are you doing, Mr. President?

458
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,500
That's great. Thank you so much.

459
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,625
He says yes.

460
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:58,000
He says give me the tapes,
the ones from the entrance,

461
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,291
the pool, parking lot, street.

462
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,750
Do it.

463
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,875
Listen, Amanda.

464
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,291
Shit. What you said earlier...

465
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,875
All those fake,
unfounded accusations about me, you know?

466
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,958
I don't wanna hear you.
I don't want you near me.

467
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,500
- Come on...
- Didn't you hear her?

468
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,041
Leave her alone, Mr. Arturo.

469
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,166
Don't force me to take you out
because I will.

470
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,416
What are you doing?

471
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,833
Everyone, shut up now!

472
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,875
Listen, you scumbag.

473
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,791
- You disgust me.
- You're calling me a scumbag?

474
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:45,958
You?

475
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:50,291
A banker.
A puppet of the system and capitalism.

476
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:53,250
You're gonna try and talk to me
about ethics?

477
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:57,083
You didn't even have enough balls
to stand up for your employees. Scumbag!

478
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,708
I said shut up now!

479
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
On the ground!

480
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,791
Hands where I can see them,
behind your head!

481
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,500
Come on! What are you gonna do?

482
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,666
You get over there!

483
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,083
Come on. Everyone up.

484
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,926
I'm gonna get you all out of here,
I promise.

485
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,208
Everyone!

486
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:14,851
See, that's the difference
between you and me, Governor.

487
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:18,250
I came here to save all these people.
To be a hero!

488
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:22,875
In the meantime, you can just stay
over there and piss your pants in fear,

489
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,250
- Mr. Governor.
- Arturo!

490
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:31,541
You're gonna put that G36 on the floor
in approximately three seconds

491
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,375
because If you don't, you're a dead man.

492
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,541
Who do you think are you,
if you don't mind me asking.

493
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,625
Manila. Undercover agent for the gang.

494
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,583
Well, listen, Manila.

495
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,416
I don't believe that bullshit.

496
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Besides, that gun's fake,
like the ones they gave us before.

497
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,166
You're not fooling me.

498
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:54,041
You have two seconds left.
Put the gun on the floor

499
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,583
and pray it's not true you raped Amanda.

500
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,746
You're really getting on my nerves, honey.
I'm almost running out of patience.

501
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,791
One!

502
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I didn't rape her!

503
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:11,000
I only gave her some pills
for the anxiety.

504
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,958
I'm bleeding to death!

505
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,625
I'm gonna die!

506
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,041
You're not gonna die.
It's just a surface wound.

507
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,625
It didn't hit any arteries,

508
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,541
or anything important.

509
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:24,666
Arturo, consider yourself under arrest,
accused of rape.

510
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,083
And...

511
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,125
I just remembered.

512
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:33,708
You offered me some pills too, didn't you?
You piece of shit.

513
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,541
<i>In the bank,
no one slept that night.</i>

514
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,125
<i>In the meantime, outside,</i>

515
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,375
<i>our biggest enemy was wide awake.</i>

516
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:51,958
<i>First, Sierra saw Antoñanzas fly
then crash into the diving board.</i>

517
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,375
<i>A few seconds later,
the Professor and Marseille appeared.</i>

518
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,250
<i>It was 3:11 in the morning.</i>

519
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:10,625
<i>Minutes later,</i>

520
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:13,250
<i>she had their license plate.</i>

521
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,375
Hey. What's up, sweetheart?

522
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,083
<i>Uh, for fuck's sake, Alicia.
What the fuck?</i>

523
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,166
Relax.

524
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:27,333
I have a license plate
from a car that drove on the M-30

525
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:29,250
at three in the morning on April 7th.

526
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,791
I need to know where it went.

527
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,541
<i>Alicia, the police are after you.
I can't do it. It's too risky.</i>

528
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,041
How many times
have I taken risks for you, Raúl?

529
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,416
Do you remember last time?

530
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,583
Cut the bullshit.

531
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,708
Meters?

532
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,000
Nine and a half!

533
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,416
Lisbon's mission...

534
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:56,083
is to give us the time that we will need.

535
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,166
Look...

536
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,708
An average person can concentrate
for about 50 minutes.

537
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,583
But no matter how important
the information is,

538
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:06,375
there always comes a point
when the brain gets too exhausted.

539
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:10,250
And all that's left to do
is come back the next day.

540
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:13,000
Do you know the only way
to cut metal underwater?

541
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,541
Have you ever heard about
underwater welding?

542
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,375
Because down there,
we cut metal with fire.

543
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,000
Fire? Underwater?

544
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,833
- Benjamín, how are we doing?
- Ten meters!

545
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,333
We need to go faster!

546
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:25,708
Go faster! Go faster!

547
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:28,708
Again, fire underwater
to get to the State secrets,

548
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,208
which are key for negotiation,
but it didn't work out.

549
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,541
- So we had to use the dolphin.
- Wait. A dolphin?

550
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,083
Ten and a half.

551
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,625
Flipper is the code name we assigned
to the governor of the Bank of Spain.

552
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:44,916
It was the fastest way of getting
hold of the secrets for negotiation.

553
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,916
That's an offense of coercion.

554
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,583
- I know.
- And it's also a disclosure of secrets.

555
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,625
We sent all the secrets
to an external server.

556
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:53,321
If I could get the pencil again,

557
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,625
I'll draw a diagram
of how the computer structure works.

558
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,875
It's almost one in the morning.

559
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,666
Maybe a recess would be a good idea,

560
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,416
if the prosecution
and the defense are in favor of it.

561
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,916
She'll go back to jail,

562
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,750
and we'll keep on digging...

563
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:17,000
and digging and digging.

564
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:22,083
And between 4:00 and 4:30 in the morning,
we're going to reach the end

565
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,916
of the 11 meters and 68 centimeters
of our tunnel,

566
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,708
which means that we're finally...

567
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:30,000
getting to the parking garage.

568
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,666
- Questions?
- How do we enter parking

569
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,166
without being seen?

570
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,333
Good! Good!

571
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,333
A good question. A very good question.

572
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,791
In two stages. First: Pakistan.

573
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:45,833
- Pakistan.
- That's right. And you'll give the order.

574
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,125
The mole's out for a walk.

575
00:33:58,875 --> 00:33:59,875
Shakir.

576
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,500
- Shakir, now.
- Perfect, Professor.

577
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,750
The guys from Pakistan
will switch the video signal

578
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,416
of the internal security's computers,

579
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,916
and from then on, the guards
will only be watching a recording.

580
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,375
Stage two:

581
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Marseille.

582
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:20,625
Marseille will be at the very peak
of his partying

583
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,583
when all the bars in Madrid have closed,
but...

584
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:28,000
he'll certainly want to keep dancing
with his new girl,

585
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,541
Sheila.

586
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,125
Marseille.

587
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,750
On the line.

588
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,250
- Benjamín?
- I'm listening.

589
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,708
That will provide us
with the acoustic cover we need

590
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,250
so they don't hear the grinders.

591
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:41,875
Stopwatches.

592
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:49,250
Three... two... one.

593
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,166
Now.

594
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,750
Now.

595
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:19,875
Good evening.

596
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,250
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

597
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,208
What the fuck are you doing?

598
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,541
<i>A party!</i>

599
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,208
They've closed all the bars,

600
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,708
so we're having a little party
here in my car, sir.

601
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,708
<i>Marseille, keep stalling.</i>

602
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,083
Keep stalling, Marseille.

603
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,791
One minute!

604
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:42,000
So what kind of party are you two having
with alcohol-free beer?

605
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,833
It's just I wanna make love tonight,

606
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,291
and with alcohol, ooh...

607
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:50,625
And no alcohol, hmm!

608
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:51,750
Turn off the music.

609
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,250
Benjamín!

610
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,375
Thirty seconds!

611
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:58,750
Don't turn it off, Marseille.

612
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,750
- What?
- Turn off the music.

613
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,875
<i>Twenty seconds!</i>

614
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:08,875
- Turn off the music!
- Keep stalling. Keep stalling.

615
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,083
- Get out.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

616
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
<i>Ten!</i>

617
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,333
- Get out of the car.
- Five!

618
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:25,125
<i>The rabbit hole is open.</i>

619
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,250
We're inside.

620
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,208
Okay! Okay! Okay, okay, okay!

621
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,083
Get out of here.

622
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,208
We are inside.

623
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:58,791
Benjamín...

624
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,041
<i>stage three.</i>

625
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,333
Roger.

626
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,458
Tell me.

627
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:14,750
<i>M-607.</i>

628
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,791
<i>The trail dies on the security camera
at kilometer 29,</i>

629
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,583
<i>the exit to Colmenar Viejo.</i>

630
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,250
Eight in the morning
on the second day...

631
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,416
we begin the final stage.

632
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:42,541
<i>At 8 a.m., Lisbon will depart
from Soto del Real prison,</i>

633
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,291
<i>and she'll be transferred
by the same convoy as the day before.</i>

634
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,875
Lisbon just left the prison.

635
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,583
<i>Get ready.</i>

636
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:55,625
Tokyo,

637
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,375
prepare Gandía.

638
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,416
<i>At 8:35,
he'll arrive at the Supreme Court,</i>

639
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,208
<i>and the entrance
will still be filled with journalists,</i>

640
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,583
so they'll have to repeat
the same procedure.

641
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,458
<i>They'll get in through the parking garage.</i>

642
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,208
<i>But this time, there's a difference.</i>

643
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,125
You guys will already be there,

644
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:17,458
but no one will be able to see you

645
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,583
because what you'll be doing overnight...

646
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,208
is constructing an entire fake wall.

647
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,875
Oh, my God! That's crazy.

648
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:28,458
<i>After you open the hole,
you'll have three hours to build the wall</i>

649
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,583
<i>before the first employees
at the Supreme Court</i>

650
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:32,333
<i>arrive at seven in the morning.</i>

651
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,750
Okay. So the wall

652
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:39,666
<i>has to be small enough
so that no one realizes it's there,</i>

653
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,250
<i>but big enough
so five of you can hide behind it.</i>

654
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,250
Perfect.

655
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,083
And now comes
the David Copperfield moment.

656
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,791
How do we extract

657
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,875
<i>a person coming out of a van</i>

658
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:16,416
<i>escorted by six vehicles
and surrounded by police officers</i>

659
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,583
<i>without...</i>

660
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:19,208
<i>anyone...</i>

661
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:21,000
realizing?

662
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,166
Life has to follow its course
after we do it...

663
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,541
as if nothing had ever happened.

664
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:33,750
We're going to have to move the next piece
on the board for that,

665
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,875
and this piece is fundamental.

666
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,916
Your moment has arrived.

667
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:51,416
Now you get to choose your own fate.

668
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,541
Life... or death?

669
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,708
We reconnected your little toys,

670
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:00,875
so you're gonna call the tent,
you'll talk to Tamayo,

671
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,500
and you'll tell him you murdered Nairobi.

672
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,625
You fucking son of a bitch.

673
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,208
And that you've killed me too.

674
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:16,625
Also we still haven't found
the panic room, but we're just about to.

675
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,291
That you're going out,
and you've got a radio.

676
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,458
What's wrong?

677
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,791
Do I still make you horny, like when
I stuck the grenade shard in you?

678
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,083
Let's go.

679
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,291
<i>This is the command center.</i>

680
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,291
This is César Gandía,

681
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:54,125
chief of security
for the governor of the Bank of Spain.

682
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,809
They've caught me. They're trying
to use me so they can trick you.

683
00:40:58,833 --> 00:40:59,958
It's a trap!

684
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,625
<i>Gandía...</i>

685
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:03,875
it's the Professor.

686
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:07,056
<i>We knew perfectly well you would do this,</i>

687
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:10,083
<i>but remember, this was
your only opportunity to get it wrong.</i>

688
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,666
<i>The next call is directly to Tamayo,</i>

689
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,541
<i>- and if you make the same mistake...</i>
- Think about your son Juanito.

690
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,208
<i>...Tokyo will execute you.</i>

691
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:20,375
You heard that, Tokyo?

692
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,500
- Loud and clear.
<i>- Listen to me, Tokyo.</i>

693
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,416
You'll hang up...

694
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,750
and you'll kill him.

695
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,250
<i>So I want you to understand
one thing, Gandía.</i>

696
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,750
<i>You can't win anymore.
You've already lost. Do you understand?</i>

697
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:39,208
The only heroic thing you can do
is see your wife and son again.

698
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,750
<i>Otherwise, they'll lose you.</i>

699
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,375
They'll lose you.

700
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,083
<i>Understood, Tokyo?</i>

701
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Let's go.

702
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,750
Suarez.

703
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,291
Martínez!

704
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:10,791
Colonel!

705
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:11,916
We have Gandía.

706
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,458
Gandía, talk to me.

707
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:17,041
Colonel, I'm in the panic room.

708
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,833
They're about to discover it.

709
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:22,083
I've eliminated Nairobi and Tokyo.

710
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,750
<i>I'm going on another attack.</i>

711
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,333
I'll take a radio.
I'll give you the frequency.

712
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,750
Suarez, I want all units ready to go.

713
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,625
Units alpha and beta, get in position.

714
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,125
<i>I want everyone on alert.</i>

715
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,083
462.662.

716
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:48,708
Time to go.

717
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,750
If we can't kidnap Lisbon when
she gets there, what should we do?

718
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,593
Wait in the wall
until she's done testifying?

719
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:58,666
This time Lisbon won't take more
than 20 minutes

720
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,458
to get back to the parking garage.

721
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,333
<i>They'll object. Of course they'll object,
but she'll be within her rights.</i>

722
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,916
I've decided against testifying.

723
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:13,666
Mrs. Murillo,
you incriminated yourself yesterday.

724
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,791
I advise you to still cooperate.

725
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,708
There could be benefits for you doing so.

726
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:22,581
So the judge will be forced to give
an early sentence and send her to prison,

727
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,416
and the same men who brought her in

728
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,625
will return to the parking garage
with her.

729
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,458
But this time, no one will be watching

730
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,083
<i>because the security guards</i>

731
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,875
<i>will be looking at the recording
from the previous night.</i>

732
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:41,166
<i>They'll watch Lisbon's first arrival,
and then...</i>

733
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,041
they'll cross paths with...

734
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:45,041
a judge...

735
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,625
a prosecutor...

736
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,208
a police officer...

737
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:53,291
and two lawyers.

738
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,125
Okay, maybe it's better
if you're a prisoner.

739
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,250
Benjamín.

740
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,125
- Everyone ready?
- We're prepared.

741
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,416
Now.

742
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,000
- <i>Benjamín.</i>
- I see her.

743
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,208
Twenty-five meters.

744
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,083
Ten meters.

745
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:42,791
The signal will be...

746
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:46,833
"Good morning."

747
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:47,916
Three meters.

748
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,000
Good morning.

749
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:07,958
Good morning, Ms. Lisbon.

750
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Hi.

751
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,333
Let's go.

752
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:15,083
We're going to complicate their lives
a bit because in 45 seconds

753
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:17,646
<i>we'll make them wear belts
with explosives around their chests.</i>

754
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:21,500
<i>In 55, we'll have two cameras
and two microphones monitor them</i>

755
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,583
<i>so that...</i>

756
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,416
if they decide to change the route...

757
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Boom!

758
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,708
If they give
even the slightest sign of alarm...

759
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,291
Boom!

760
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:36,500
If you don't bring the prisoner
to the prison...

761
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:37,583
Boom!

762
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:42,041
Wait, we're the ones
taking the prisoner, no?

763
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,541
We're going to give them another Lisbon.

764
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,125
Convoy unit.

765
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,291
<i>Everything okay down there?</i>

766
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,583
You're taking too long.

767
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,916
Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.

768
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,750
- We're on our way.
<i>- Okay, okay. Got it.</i>

769
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:14,958
<i>And that...</i>

770
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,333
<i>is when our greatest illusion begins.
Our David Copperfield moment.</i>

771
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:22,851
- Who's this guy Copperfield?
- The magician.

772
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:24,041
Magician? Like Harry Potter?

773
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:26,208
It'll look like everything's the same.

774
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,041
But it won't be.

775
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:39,541
<i>Because at that moment,</i>

776
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:42,458
<i>Lisbon will be crawling at full speed
through the tunnel we dug.</i>

777
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,208
Come on.

778
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,041
Come on.

779
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:18,291
Here we go.

780
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:25,541
Tokyo...

781
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,291
<i>Lisbon's on her way.</i>

782
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,875
<i>Start the countdown... now.</i>

783
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,083
Start running!

784
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,541
Colonel, they opened fire!

785
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:38,958
Gandía!

786
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,208
- <i>Gandía, respond!</i>
- "I'm here."

787
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,583
I'm here!

788
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:45,851
- "They're closing in on me."
- They're closing in on me, sir.

789
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:48,750
- I'm caught in the fucking cross fire!
- Very good.

790
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:50,708
Going up.

791
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:54,921
What's your position?
Can we give covering fire?

792
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,125
"Negative."

793
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,541
<i>Negative, Colonel.</i>

794
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:00,041
- "Heading to the roof."
- Heading to the roof, sir.

795
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:03,333
- "Requesting immediate evac."
- Requesting immediate evac!

796
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:05,750
Suarez, for Christ's sake,
send a fucking helicopter now.

797
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,875
- Let's go!
- Delta 1, get ready for takeoff.

798
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,000
Rescue operation
at the Bank of Spain now.

799
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,208
Hang in there, Gandía.

800
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,166
I have an M16 and three cartridges.

801
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,625
<i>I don't know how much longer I can last!</i>

802
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:19,958
Fire. Now.

803
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,333
- "They've started a fire."
- They've started a fire.

804
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:32,958
<i>I can't see anything!</i>

805
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,333
Colonel. Colonel!

806
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,096
<i>Smoke's coming through the roof.</i>

807
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,333
Hang on there, Gandía.
The helicopter's on its way.

808
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:55,291
- Lisbon.
- Marseille.

809
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:56,500
Marseille.

810
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,625
Professor, we have Lisbon.

811
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,333
Blue ammo clips.

812
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:13,666
Let's go!

813
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,833
<i>How are we gonna get
the military helicopter?</i>

814
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,125
<i>The same place</i>

815
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:34,848
we got the vehicles we used
to get into the bank: the black market.

816
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:38,500
And not just that, we're going
to intercept their communications

817
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,666
so that when they wanna talk
to their own chopper,

818
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,166
we're the ones that are going to answer.

819
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,166
<i>Where is that helicopter?</i>

820
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,500
Delta unit, position.

821
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:48,916
Time?

822
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,750
Two minutes, fifty seconds.

823
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:52,541
Two minutes, fifty seconds, sir.

824
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,500
Get up to the roof. We'll cover you.

825
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:57,416
Impossible!
There's plastic explosive on the door.

826
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,750
- Fuck! Where's the bomb expert?
- We need a bomb expert!

827
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,875
Gandía, describe the device.

828
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,333
"Blue wire to the starter."

829
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:08,666
There's a motion sensor,
a blue wire, to the starter.

830
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,291
Cut it. That's a basic bomb device.

831
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,375
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

832
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:18,656
- No!
- Cut it.

833
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,041
No, Colonel. Colonel!

834
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,333
"I've cut the wire."

835
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,041
I've cut the wire.

836
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,375
Denver, now.

837
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,400
- Go, go, go!
- "I'm wearing black. Hold your fire."

838
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:31,666
I'm exiting now.

839
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,208
I have a mask and I'm dressed in black.
Hold your fire!

840
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,305
Our man's dressed in black.
Give him cover.

841
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,958
<i>- Be ready for cross fire.
- Roger.</i>

842
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,458
<i>Blue ammo clips.</i>

843
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:47,958
Now!

844
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:50,166
Go, go, go, go!

845
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,753
They're on the roof.
They've opened fire!

846
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,583
We need cover fire!

847
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,506
<i>I can't see them.
There's too much smoke.</i>

848
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,541
- <i>Tokyo, now.</i>
- Palermo...

849
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:10,833
Open it.

850
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,392
<i>- Searching for target.
- Got a visual.</i>

851
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:31,583
<i>I can see them!</i>

852
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,666
<i>I repeat, I've got a visual.</i>

853
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,500
<i>Permission to fire, sir.</i>

854
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,500
<i>Permission to fire, sir.</i>

855
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,875
- <i>Don't shoot!</i>
- Those motherfuckers.

856
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:45,250
<i>We're exposed.</i>

857
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,333
- They're completely exposed!
<i>- Taking cover!</i>

858
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,166
<i>We're taking cover, sir.</i>

859
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,333
Delta unit, begin approaching our target.
Rescue protocol.

860
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:55,416
I want the extraction
to be quick and clean.

861
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:05,416
Marseille.

862
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,916
Arriving. Helicopter in position, sir.

863
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,791
Get them out of there, for fuck's sake!

864
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,708
Okay, Delta 1. Get in there.

865
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,041
- Permission to descend, sir!
- Go ahead.

866
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,458
Fall back to the helicopter now!

867
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,250
Lisbon!

868
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,166
Denver!

869
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,916
Welcome to the Bank of Spain!

870
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,958
Son a bitch!

871
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,333
Package delivered, Professor.

872
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,375
I'm out in two minutes.

873
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,750
Where is the helicopter going?

874
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,000
Delta 1, what happened?

875
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:09,041
<i>Delta 1, return to your position!</i>

876
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,708
- Delta 1, come in!
- Goddamn it!

877
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:22,875
There's a problem with the helicopter.
We're going in!

878
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:29,083
Where did that agent come from?
She's insane!

879
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,541
Colonel, they're pulling back!

880
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Are you okay?

881
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:55,833
Yes?

882
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,541
What?

883
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,790
They're calling from Soto del Real.
It's the convoy that transferred Murillo.

884
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,625
Colonel Tamayo? There's a woman
claiming she was kidnapped

885
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:05,828
on her way out of the salon.

886
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:09,416
What do I care, idiot?
This is the command center for the heist!

887
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,750
Take it, you moron.

888
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,083
Gandía, hang in there!

889
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:15,791
<i>Hold down the stairs
until the helicopter gets back.</i>

890
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:17,833
Suarez, where's the fucking helicopter?

891
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:21,875
Colonel...

892
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,541
- What?
- Colonel.

893
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:29,291
It looks like we've been... mislead.

894
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:46,583
Yes!

895
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:48,166
Come on!

896
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,666
Yeah!

897
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,125
Professor,

898
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:00,583
<i>Lisbon's here.</i>

899
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:03,708
<i>I repeat, Lisbon... We've got Lisbon!</i>

900
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,541
<i>Listen to me.</i>

901
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,250
This war...

902
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:31,708
we're going to win it.

903
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:35,375
For Nairobi.

904
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,583
For Nairobi.

905
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,625
For Nairobi.

906
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,625
For Nairobi.

907
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:44,875
<i>For Nairobi.</i>

908
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,208
<i>For Nairobi.</i>

909
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,250
For Nairobi.

910
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,458
For Nairobi!

911
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:55,583
For Nairobi!

912
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,875
For Nairobi!

913
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,791
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

914
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,958
For Nairobi! For Nairobi!

915
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,708
For Nairobi! For Nairobi!

916
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,166
For Nairobi!

917
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,500
For Nairobi!

918
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,333
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

919
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,500
Don't move.

920
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,583
