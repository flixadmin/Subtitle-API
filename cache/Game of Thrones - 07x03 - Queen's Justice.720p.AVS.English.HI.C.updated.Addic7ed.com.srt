3
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:31,225
The bastard of Winterfell.

4
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,397
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

5
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:41,771
I believe we last saw
each other atop the Wall.

6
00:02:41,772 --> 00:02:45,688
You were pissing off the edge
if I remember right.

7
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,146
Picked up some scars
along the road.

8
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:52,647
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

9
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:56,146
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

10
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:59,979
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

11
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,062
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

12
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:05,646
Unluckily for me.

13
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:08,689
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

14
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:12,062
Welcome to Dragonstone.

15
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:13,896
Our queen knows
it is a long journey.

16
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:17,271
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

17
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:20,022
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

18
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:27,022
Of course.

19
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:47,314
( men murmuring )

20
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:53,189
Please, this way.

21
00:03:57,897 --> 00:03:59,521
Where are you from?

22
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,812
I can't place the accent.

23
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:03,646
I was born on
the Island of Naath.

24
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:06,730
Ah. I hear it's
beautiful down there.

25
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:08,812
Palm trees and butterflies.

26
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,230
Haven't been, myself.

27
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:16,189
This place has changed.

28
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:25,688
TYRION: And Sansa? I hear
she's alive and well.

29
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:28,189
- JON: She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

30
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,771
A sham marriage.
And unconsummated.

31
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:36,937
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

32
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:38,854
Anyway...

33
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,688
she's much smarter
than she lets on.

34
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:44,062
She's starting to let on.

35
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:44,980
Good.

36
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:47,021
TYRION: At some point,

37
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:50,979
I want to hear how a Night's Watch
recruit became King in the North.

38
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,771
As long as you tell me
how a Lannister

39
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,563
became Hand
to Daenerys Targaryen.

40
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:57,688
A long and bloody tale.

41
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:00,439
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

42
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:05,605
My bannermen think
I'm a fool for coming here.

43
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,021
Of course they do.

44
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:09,731
If I was your Hand, I would
have advised against it.

45
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,271
General rule of thumb--

46
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,396
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

47
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:19,146
True...

48
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:21,271
but I'm not a Stark.

49
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:24,606
( screeching )

50
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:29,147
( panting )

51
00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:36,772
I'd say you get used to them...

52
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:40,980
but you never really do.

53
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:47,772
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

54
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:03,730
I wondered why you weren't
there to meet our guests.

55
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,730
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

56
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:09,188
Don't you want to see him again?

57
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:11,812
I've done my part.

58
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:14,229
I've brought
ice and fire together.

59
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,521
Strange.

60
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:19,021
You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,

61
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:22,688
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

62
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,062
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

63
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:29,271
My time whispering in the ears
of kings has come to an end.

64
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:31,688
Oh, I doubt that.

65
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:34,313
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

66
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:37,146
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

67
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,396
Nothing is ever so sweet again.

68
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:43,647
Neither of us
is common folk anymore.

69
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,563
I did not part on good terms

70
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:50,563
with the King in the North
or his advisor.

71
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:51,564
Why?

72
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,272
Because of mistakes I made.

73
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,272
Terrible mistakes.

74
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:04,229
I would only be
a distraction if I stayed.

75
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,438
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

76
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,438
Good.

77
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,688
If you don't mind my saying,

78
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:14,438
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

79
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,897
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

80
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,021
Oh, I will return, dear Spider.

81
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:23,812
- One last time.
- My lady--

82
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:27,396
I have to die
in this strange country.

83
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:29,230
Just like you.

84
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:13,104
MISSANDEI: You stand in the presence

85
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:15,896
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

86
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:18,104
rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

87
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:21,062
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

88
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:23,480
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,

89
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,188
the Mother of Dragons,

90
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:27,396
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

91
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:31,189
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

92
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:37,980
This is Jon Snow.

93
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,772
He's King in the North.

94
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:48,646
Thank you for traveling
so far, my lord.

95
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:50,896
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

96
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,480
The winds were kind, Your Grace.

97
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:56,480
Apologies, I have a Flea
Bottom accent, I know,

98
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:59,354
but Jon Snow is King in
the North, Your Grace.

99
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,188
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me--

100
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:03,438
Your Grace, this is
Ser Davos Seaworth.

101
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:05,354
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

102
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,979
I never did receive
a formal education,

103
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,313
but I could have sworn I read

104
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:12,605
the last King in the
North was Torrhen Stark,

105
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:15,771
who bent the knee to my
ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

106
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,979
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

107
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,021
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
House Targaryen in perpetuity.

108
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,521
Or do I have my facts wrong?

109
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:27,854
I wasn't there, Your Grace.

110
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:30,271
No, of course not.

111
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:32,854
But still, an oath is an oath.

112
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:35,271
And perpetuity means--

113
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:37,730
what does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

114
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:39,229
Forever.

115
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,313
Forever.

116
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,146
- So I assume, my lord...
- ( sighs )

117
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:46,355
...you're here
to bend the knee.

118
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:50,439
I am not.

119
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:53,563
Oh.

120
00:09:53,564 --> 00:09:55,397
Well, that is unfortunate.

121
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:58,396
You've traveled all this way

122
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,563
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

123
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:03,062
Break faith?

124
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:05,396
Your father burned
my grandfather alive.

125
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,104
He burned my uncle alive.

126
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,438
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms--

127
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:11,522
My father...
was an evil man.

128
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:15,564
On behalf of House Targaryen...

129
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:18,438
I ask your forgiveness

130
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,396
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

131
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:24,271
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

132
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:26,647
by the sins of her father.

133
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:31,605
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

134
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,480
and those were
the best centuries

135
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:35,605
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

136
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:38,104
Centuries of peace
and prosperity

137
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,937
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

138
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:44,937
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

139
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:48,688
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

140
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,104
Honor the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

141
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:54,771
Bend the knee and I will name
you Warden of the North.

142
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:56,979
Together, we will
save this country

143
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,606
from those who would destroy it.

144
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,480
You're right.

145
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:13,979
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

146
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,812
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

147
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,812
Then why are you here?

148
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,647
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

149
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:28,812
Did you see three dragons

150
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,771
flying overhead
when you arrived?

151
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:31,854
I did.

152
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:34,146
And did you see the Dothraki,

153
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:36,354
all of whom have sworn
to kill for me?

154
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,313
They're hard to miss.

155
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:42,354
- But still, I need your help?
- DAVOS: Not to defeat Cersei.

156
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:45,688
You could storm King's Landing
tomorrow and the city would fall.

157
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,937
Hell, we almost took it and
we didn't even have dragons.

158
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:52,062
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

159
00:11:52,063 --> 00:11:53,688
Why not?

160
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:55,396
The only reason I can see

161
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:57,646
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

162
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:59,688
It's the fastest way
to win the war,

163
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:01,521
but you won't do it,

164
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:04,730
which means, at the very least,

165
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:06,189
you're better than Cersei.

166
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:11,063
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

167
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:17,563
Because right now, you and I
and Cersei and everyone else,

168
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:19,188
we're children
playing at a game,

169
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:21,271
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

170
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:23,396
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

171
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:26,896
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

172
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:29,771
he's refused to bow, and now
he's calling me a child.

173
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:33,563
I believe he's calling all of us children.
Figure of speech.

174
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:36,896
Your Grace, everyone you know
will die before winter's over

175
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:39,062
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

176
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:41,730
As far as I can see, you are
the enemy to the north.

177
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:43,397
I am not your enemy.

178
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:46,730
The dead are the enemy.

179
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,272
The dead?

180
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,146
Is that another
figure of speech?

181
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:52,771
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

182
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,854
The Army of the Dead?

183
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:57,021
You don't know me well, my lord,

184
00:12:57,022 --> 00:13:00,354
but do you think
I'm a liar or a madman?

185
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,896
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

186
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:05,021
The Army of the Dead is real.

187
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,480
The white walkers are real.

188
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,396
The Night King is real.
I've seen them.

189
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:10,937
If they get past the Wall

190
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:13,439
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

191
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:18,063
we're finished.

192
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:25,938
I was born at Dragonstone.

193
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:30,271
Not that I can remember it.

194
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:33,730
We fled before Robert's
assassins could find us.

195
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,937
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

196
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:40,771
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

197
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:43,314
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

198
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,689
Not that it matters now,
of course.

199
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,771
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

200
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:54,146
So many men
have tried to kill me,

201
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:57,646
I don't remember
all their names.

202
00:13:57,647 --> 00:14:01,730
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

203
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:05,271
I've been chained and betrayed,

204
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:08,062
raped and defiled.

205
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:10,313
Do you know
what kept me standing

206
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:13,271
through all those years
in exile?

207
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:16,229
Faith.

208
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,480
Not in any gods,

209
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:22,021
not in myths and legends.

210
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:24,646
In myself.

211
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,812
In Daenerys Targaryen.

212
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:31,354
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

213
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,730
until my children were born.

214
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:38,521
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

215
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,896
They did for me.

216
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:45,354
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

217
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:47,481
and I will.

218
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:52,354
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

219
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:54,689
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

220
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:59,313
The war against my sister
has already begun.

221
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:01,688
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

222
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,521
and join you in fighting

223
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:05,022
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

224
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:09,438
You don't believe him.

225
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:12,354
I understand that.
It sounds like nonsense.

226
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:16,146
But if destiny has brought Daenerys
Targaryen back to our shores,

227
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:19,354
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

228
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:22,480
You were the first to bring
Dothraki to Westeros?

229
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:25,854
He is the first to make allies
of wildlings and Northmen.

230
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:27,937
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

231
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:29,021
He was named King in the North.

232
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:30,396
Not because of his birthright.

233
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,771
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

234
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:37,812
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

235
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,522
because they believe in him.

236
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:42,896
All those things
you don't believe in,

237
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:44,438
he faced those things.

238
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,646
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

239
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,229
He risked his life
for his people.

240
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,021
He took a knife in the
heart for his people.

241
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:51,772
He gave his own--

242
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:00,688
If we don't put aside our
enmities and band together,

243
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,771
we will die.

244
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:06,438
And then it doesn't matter whose
skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

245
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,771
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

246
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:10,937
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

247
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,563
help her to defeat my sister,

248
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,730
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

249
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:16,480
There's no time for that.

250
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,396
There's no time for any of this!

251
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:19,896
While we stand here,
debating--

252
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,854
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

253
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,688
Pledge your sword to her cause.

254
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,439
And why would I do that?

255
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:30,438
I mean no offense, Your Grace,

256
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,646
but I don't know you.

257
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:33,480
As far as I can tell,

258
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:36,771
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

259
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:40,105
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

260
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:43,896
The lords of the North

261
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,730
placed their trust
in me to lead them,

262
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:50,772
and I will continue to
do so as well as I can.

263
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:53,481
That's fair.

264
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,854
It's also fair to point out

265
00:16:56,855 --> 00:17:00,979
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

266
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,730
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

267
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,646
you are in open rebellion.

268
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:08,606
( footsteps approaching )

269
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:18,937
( whispering ) Your Grace,
please dismiss your guests.

270
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,022
I have grave news.

271
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,438
You must forgive my manners.

272
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,812
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

273
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,564
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

274
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:37,397
( speaking Dothraki )

275
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:41,355
Am I your prisoner?

276
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,647
Not yet.

277
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:05,771
Our ironborn and Dornish allies

278
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:07,229
were attacked en route to Dorne.

279
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,730
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

280
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:12,062
the rest, sunk or captured.

281
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:14,646
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
dead or captured.

282
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,229
The Greyjoys, dead or captured.

283
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,938
All of them?

284
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:22,188
( men shouting )

285
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:24,062
- Pull!
- Heave!

286
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:25,438
Pull!

287
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,937
( men grunt )

288
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:29,564
( grunts )

289
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:37,147
Your sister's dead?

290
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,688
Euron has her.

291
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:42,063
You saw him take her?

292
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:47,730
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

293
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,230
I tried.

294
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:52,606
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

295
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:58,979
MAN: Come, men!

296
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,314
Sails up!

297
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:06,731
( crowd cheering )

298
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,938
WOMAN: Murderer!

299
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:23,812
MAN: Whores!

300
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:26,147
- ( all shouting )
- Traitor!

301
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,272
This is the life.

302
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:36,146
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

303
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:37,646
( cheering )

304
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:40,480
- ( grunts )
- ( laughter )

305
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:42,062
I have to be honest,

306
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:44,022
this is making me hard.

307
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:48,730
Did you see Little Theon's face

308
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:51,104
right before
he jumped overboard?

309
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:53,646
"Oh, no!"
( laughs )

310
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:55,105
What a twat.

311
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:58,813
( crowd booing )

312
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:03,314
- ( crowd shouting )
- ( spits )

313
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,813
- MAN: Whore! Whore! Whore!
- MAN #2: Murderers!

314
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,731
( applause )

315
00:20:57,772 --> 00:20:59,104
( grunts )

316
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:02,438
My queen, please
accept this gift

317
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:06,272
on behalf of all of your loyal
subjects in the Iron Islands.

318
00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:08,397
( both grunt, gasp )

319
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,438
I give you what no
other man could give--

320
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,563
justice.

321
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:21,230
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

322
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:34,771
You've proven yourself the greatest
captain on the fourteen seas

323
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:37,438
and a true friend to the crown.

324
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:40,646
You deserve more
than a true friend.

325
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:44,146
And you deserve a proper
reward for your heroism.

326
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:46,813
There's only one reward I want.

327
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:50,813
You shall have
what your heart desires...

328
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,397
when the war is won.

329
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:04,229
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

330
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,396
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

331
00:22:07,397 --> 00:22:09,438
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

332
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:11,730
shall defend our country.

333
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,189
( crowd cheering )

334
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,979
There's nothing quite
like it, is there?

335
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,730
The love of the people.

336
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:24,854
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

337
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:28,188
This same mob spat at
my sister not long ago.

338
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:29,937
And if you turn on us,

339
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:33,146
they'll cheer to see your
head mounted on a spike.

340
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:34,646
Or yours.

341
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:37,771
They just like
severed heads, really.

342
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:41,021
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

343
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:42,605
I would love to hear it.

344
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:45,646
When we have an hour or two
to speak as brothers.

345
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:47,354
Advice?

346
00:22:47,355 --> 00:22:51,021
Does she like it
gentle or rough?

347
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:52,688
A finger in the bum?

348
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:55,980
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
We'll talk later.

349
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:16,771
CERSEI: I want you to
know I understand.

350
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,354
Even though we're
enemies, you and I,

351
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,022
I understand the fury
that drives you.

352
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,521
I was there that day

353
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:24,314
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

354
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:29,188
If I close my eyes,

355
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:32,188
I can hear the sound
of Oberyn's skull breaking.

356
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:34,396
The sound of your scream.

357
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:35,896
I never heard a sound like that.

358
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:37,855
I thought,
"That's true love."

359
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:41,730
Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
He really did.

360
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:43,104
No one moved like him.

361
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:46,229
No one had such skill
with a spear.

362
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,313
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

363
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:51,771
If only he hadn't taunted him.

364
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:55,730
He could've walked away and
left poor Ser Gregor to die.

365
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:57,771
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

366
00:23:57,772 --> 00:24:00,605
Now he's buried somewhere.

367
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,354
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

368
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,272
That must be difficult for you.

369
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,229
When my daughter
was taken from me,

370
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,354
my only daughter...

371
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:17,146
well, you can't
imagine how that feels

372
00:24:17,147 --> 00:24:19,396
unless you've lost a child.

373
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:22,062
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

374
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:24,771
to give her to the wet nurse.

375
00:24:24,772 --> 00:24:28,271
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

376
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:30,521
I never got to have a mother,

377
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:31,937
but Myrcella did.

378
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:35,605
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

379
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:37,647
Why did you do that?

380
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,606
Doesn't matter now.

381
00:24:54,189 --> 00:24:56,937
Your daughter's a beauty, too.

382
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:59,563
Those brown eyes.

383
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,272
Those lips.

384
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:04,937
Perfect Dornish beauty.

385
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,812
I imagine she's your favorite.

386
00:25:06,813 --> 00:25:09,979
I know, I know, we're not
supposed to have favorites,

387
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,147
but still, we're only human.

388
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,229
We love whom we love.

389
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,813
( muffled speech )

390
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:20,104
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

391
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:23,480
That gag makes it impossible to
understand what you're saying.

392
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,314
It must be frustrating.

393
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:31,480
We all make our choices.

394
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:33,896
You chose to murder my daughter.

395
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:36,146
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

396
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:38,355
- ( grunts )
- Do you feel powerful now?

397
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:46,313
I don't sleep very well.

398
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:48,688
Not at all, really.

399
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:50,605
I lie in bed
and I stare at the canopy

400
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:52,979
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

401
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,855
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the
woman who murdered my only daughter.

402
00:25:58,355 --> 00:26:00,021
I thought about
having Ser Gregor

403
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:02,188
crush your skull
the way he did Oberyn's.

404
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:06,896
It would be poetic, I
suppose, but fast, too fast.

405
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:09,855
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

406
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:12,689
She's so beautiful.

407
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:15,605
The thought of this lovely face

408
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:18,021
cracking open like a duck egg,

409
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:19,772
no, it's just not right.

410
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,397
- ( Tyene whimpers )
- ( gasps )

411
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,354
Mama.

412
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,104
( grunts )

413
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:32,063
( crying )

414
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:41,062
Qyburn here is
the cleverest man I know.

415
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:44,146
Clever enough to learn what poison
you used to murder Myrcella.

416
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:45,812
The Long Goodbye, was that it?

417
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,897
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

418
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,730
How long does the poison take?

419
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:56,396
QYBURN: Difficult to
say-- hours, days.

420
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:58,271
It depends on the
subject's constitution.

421
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:01,772
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

422
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:10,021
Your daughter will die
here in this cell,

423
00:27:10,022 --> 00:27:13,146
and you will be here
watching when she does.

424
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:15,938
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

425
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:21,771
If you refuse to eat, we'll
force food down your throat.

426
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:25,480
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

427
00:27:25,481 --> 00:27:28,771
- To watch that beautiful face collapse...
- ( sobbing )

428
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,897
...to bone and dust.

429
00:27:33,272 --> 00:27:36,230
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

430
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:41,937
Make sure the guards change
the torches every few hours.

431
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:43,355
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

432
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:50,855
( both crying )

433
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:15,606
No.

434
00:28:39,397 --> 00:28:41,397
( panting )

435
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,022
( birds chirping )

436
00:28:53,522 --> 00:28:54,731
( knocking on door )

437
00:28:57,855 --> 00:28:58,855
Don't.

438
00:29:10,897 --> 00:29:13,730
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

439
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:17,397
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
I'll do as I please.

440
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:24,062
Forgive me, Your Grace.

441
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:26,396
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

442
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:29,396
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

443
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:30,731
At once, Your Grace.

444
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,104
( chuckles )

445
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:36,105
( liquid pouring )

446
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:43,979
No, thank you.

447
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,688
My condolences, Your Grace,

448
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:47,646
on the death of your son.

449
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:50,354
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

450
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,104
The Iron Bank didn't send you
here to offer condolences.

451
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:56,605
Condolences and congratulations.

452
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:59,563
To become the first ruling
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

453
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,563
that's quite an accomplishment.

454
00:30:01,564 --> 00:30:05,354
The Iron Bank appreciates how you
cast off the yoke of superstition,

455
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:06,937
freeing the crown from elements

456
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,438
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

457
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:12,605
The destruction of the Sept of
Baelor was a tragic accident.

458
00:30:12,606 --> 00:30:16,812
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

459
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:19,188
to restore order
and rational leadership.

460
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:21,937
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

461
00:30:21,938 --> 00:30:24,521
Your father never
minced words either.

462
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,354
But, yes, your debts
are considerable.

463
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:31,229
And you're now engaged in a
conflict on several fronts.

464
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,146
We both know how
expensive war can be.

465
00:30:34,147 --> 00:30:36,354
And we both know gold wins wars.

466
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:37,812
Your vaults are empty.

467
00:30:37,813 --> 00:30:40,313
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

468
00:30:40,314 --> 00:30:43,646
Your wealthiest allies, the
Tyrells, are now your enemies.

469
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:47,229
You are surrounded on all sides
by rivals for the throne.

470
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,188
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

471
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:50,896
We don't make bets.

472
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:54,480
We invest in endeavors we
deem likely to be successful.

473
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:57,438
A fancy way
of saying "bet."

474
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,188
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

475
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:04,188
I decapitated the Dornish snake.

476
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:06,229
My armada owns the Narrow Sea.

477
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,688
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

478
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:10,188
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.

479
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:12,396
For now.

480
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:16,146
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

481
00:31:16,147 --> 00:31:20,480
How well do wooden ships fare
against fire-breathing dragons?

482
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:25,521
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

483
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:27,896
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

484
00:31:27,897 --> 00:31:29,812
You want to invest in her?

485
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:34,188
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

486
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:36,438
How are your profits

487
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,979
now that Daenerys
has freed all the slaves?

488
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,146
The slave trade has entered
a downturn, it's true.

489
00:31:43,147 --> 00:31:45,021
From what I gather,
she considers herself

490
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:48,354
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

491
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:52,271
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

492
00:31:52,272 --> 00:31:55,271
The Lannisters owe the Iron
Bank quite a lot of money,

493
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:57,438
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

494
00:31:57,439 --> 00:32:01,855
Do former slaves
or Dothraki or dragons?

495
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:07,438
Your father's daughter, indeed.

496
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,771
Give me a fortnight.

497
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:10,979
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

498
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,396
And when you return to Braavos,

499
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:16,855
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

500
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:44,314
I came down here to brood over my
failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

501
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:48,396
You're making it difficult.

502
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:52,063
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

503
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:56,313
You make me feel like I'm failing
at brooding over failing.

504
00:32:56,314 --> 00:32:58,021
I'm a prisoner on this island.

505
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:01,979
I wouldn't say you're
a prisoner on this island.

506
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,480
You're free to walk the castle,

507
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,396
the beaches,
to go wherever you want.

508
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:07,563
Except to my ship.

509
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:08,979
You took my ship.

510
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,937
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

511
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:13,438
I'm not playing
word games with you.

512
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:15,313
The dead are coming for us all.

513
00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:16,979
Why don't you
figure out what to do

514
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,062
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

515
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,937
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

516
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:24,146
It's hard for me to fathom.
It really is.

517
00:33:24,147 --> 00:33:27,272
If someone told me about the white
walkers and the Night King...

518
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:35,938
You probably don't believe me.

519
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:40,563
I do, actually.

520
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:42,105
You didn't before.

521
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,021
"Grumkins and snarks,"
you called them.

522
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:48,104
Do you remember?

523
00:33:48,105 --> 00:33:50,188
You said it was all nonsense.

524
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:53,313
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

525
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:56,438
But then Mormont saw them

526
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,854
and you saw them.

527
00:33:57,855 --> 00:33:59,521
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

528
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:01,522
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

529
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:05,104
How do I convince people
who don't know me

530
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:07,854
that an enemy they don't believe
in is coming to kill them all?

531
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:11,188
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

532
00:34:11,189 --> 00:34:13,354
I'm looking for an answer.

533
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:17,646
People's minds aren't made
for problems that large.

534
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:20,104
White walkers, the Night King,

535
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:22,188
Army of the Dead--

536
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:23,812
it's almost a relief to confront

537
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,689
a comfortable, familiar
monster like my sister.

538
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:31,980
I need to help prepare my
people for what's coming.

539
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:36,022
I can't help them from here.

540
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:38,772
I'd like to leave.

541
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,730
It seems unlikely that
you became King in the North

542
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:44,397
by giving up that easily.

543
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:49,688
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

544
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:51,480
Don't go south.

545
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:54,146
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

546
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:55,564
a foreign invader.

547
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:00,646
And here I am,

548
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:02,188
a Northern fool.

549
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:04,646
Children are not their fathers,

550
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:06,355
luckily for all of us.

551
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,062
And sometimes there's more
to foreign invaders

552
00:35:10,063 --> 00:35:12,271
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

553
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:16,480
Daenerys could have sailed for
Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

554
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,313
Instead, she stayed
where she was

555
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:20,979
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

556
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,313
some of whom are on this
island with us right now.

557
00:35:23,314 --> 00:35:24,896
While you're our guest here,

558
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:26,438
you might consider asking them

559
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:29,188
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

560
00:35:29,189 --> 00:35:32,271
She protects people
from monsters,

561
00:35:32,272 --> 00:35:33,812
just as you do.

562
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:36,271
It's why she came here.

563
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:37,812
And she's not about
to head north

564
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:39,271
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

565
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:41,771
on the word of a man
she doesn't know.

566
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,188
After a single meeting,

567
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:46,980
it's not a reasonable
thing to ask.

568
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:55,606
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

569
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:01,605
What do you mean?

570
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:03,854
Maybe you are a Northern fool.

571
00:36:03,855 --> 00:36:07,522
I'm asking if there's something
I can do to help you.

572
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:12,021
- Dragonglass?
- TYRION: Yes.

573
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:14,480
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

574
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:16,480
He says you have a tremendous
amount of it here.

575
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:18,271
Why are we talking about glass?

576
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:20,146
We just lost two of our allies.

577
00:36:20,147 --> 00:36:23,522
Which is why I was speaking to
Jon Snow, a potential ally.

578
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:29,646
And what does the King in the
North want with dragonglass?

579
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:31,979
Apparently, it can be
turned into weapons

580
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,104
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

581
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,271
Or stop them.

582
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:38,563
Destroy them.

583
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:40,189
Unsure about the nomenclature.

584
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:45,104
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

585
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:47,979
and white walkers
and Night Kings?

586
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,605
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

587
00:36:50,606 --> 00:36:53,854
But a wise man once said that you
should never believe a thing

588
00:36:53,855 --> 00:36:56,397
simply because
you want to believe it.

589
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:02,271
Which wise man said this?

590
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:04,146
I don't remember.

591
00:37:04,147 --> 00:37:07,564
Are you trying to present your own
statements as ancient wisdom?

592
00:37:08,772 --> 00:37:10,979
I would never do that.

593
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,022
To you.

594
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:17,521
The reason I believe Jon
Snow is because he's here.

595
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:19,937
All of his advisors would
have told him not to come.

596
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,021
I would have told him
not to come.

597
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:24,354
And he's here anyway.

598
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:26,771
You don't have to believe him.

599
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:28,812
Let him mine the dragonglass.

600
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,438
If he's wrong, it's worthless.

601
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:32,521
You didn't even know
it was here.

602
00:37:32,522 --> 00:37:35,062
It's nothing to you.

603
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:38,354
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

604
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:41,062
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

605
00:37:41,063 --> 00:37:43,646
with a possible ally.

606
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:47,021
Keep him occupied while we
focus on the task at hand--

607
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:48,397
Casterly Rock.

608
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:51,438
What was that Ser Davos said

609
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:55,480
about taking a knife in
the heart for his people?

610
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,271
Did you notice that?

611
00:37:57,272 --> 00:37:59,730
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

612
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:01,897
It's dreary in the North.

613
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:07,397
( screeching )

614
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:19,272
Amazing thing to see.

615
00:38:20,772 --> 00:38:23,813
I named them for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

616
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:26,439
They're both gone now.

617
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:30,105
You lost two brothers as well.

618
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:36,147
People thought dragons were gone
forever, but here they are.

619
00:38:37,897 --> 00:38:40,731
Perhaps we should all be
examining what we think we know.

620
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:48,979
You've been talking to Tyrion.

621
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,730
He is my Hand.

622
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:54,355
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

623
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:57,314
I don't.

624
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:05,313
You know I'm not going to let
Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

625
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:06,480
I never expected that you would.

626
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:07,730
And I haven't changed my mind

627
00:39:07,731 --> 00:39:09,812
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

628
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:11,647
I haven't either.

629
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:17,189
( sighs )

630
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,188
I will allow you to mine the
dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

631
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:28,189
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

632
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:32,689
Thank you.

633
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:42,855
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

634
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:48,731
You'd better
get to work, Jon Snow.

635
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,731
( chatter )

636
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:15,021
How much do we have?

637
00:40:15,022 --> 00:40:17,104
4,000 bushels, my lady.

638
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:18,271
What does that mean?

639
00:40:18,272 --> 00:40:20,354
For the current
occupants of the castle,

640
00:40:20,355 --> 00:40:24,021
it's enough food
for a year, perhaps more.

641
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:27,438
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

642
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:29,896
Uh, I'm not entirely certain.

643
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:31,730
I-I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

644
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:35,229
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

645
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,354
You're telling me
we don't have enough food,

646
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:40,564
especially not if the armies of the
North come back to defend Winterfell?

647
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:44,062
No, my lady, most likely not.

648
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:46,188
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

649
00:40:46,189 --> 00:40:48,271
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

650
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:50,563
this is the best place to be.

651
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:52,521
We need to start
building up our grain stores

652
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:55,104
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

653
00:40:55,105 --> 00:40:57,396
If we don't use it by winter's
end, we'll give it back to them.

654
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:59,730
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

655
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:03,438
they won't have enough time to bring
wagonloads of grain with them.

656
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:04,854
Very wise, my lady.

657
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:06,647
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

658
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:12,937
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

659
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,313
No, my lady.

660
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:17,396
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

661
00:41:17,397 --> 00:41:18,812
They should, indeed.

662
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:21,021
Pardon me, my lady.

663
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:23,606
You there, why isn't
there leather on these?

664
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:27,397
Command suits you.

665
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:31,188
The Northerners
are all facing north,

666
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,271
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

667
00:41:33,272 --> 00:41:34,812
So they should be.

668
00:41:34,813 --> 00:41:37,480
I know Cersei
better than anyone here.

669
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:39,563
If you turn
your back on her--

670
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:42,132
You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.

671
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:43,962
I only meant to say--

672
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:47,021
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

673
00:41:47,022 --> 00:41:49,105
Thank you for your wise counsel.

674
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:52,605
One of two things
will happen--

675
00:41:52,606 --> 00:41:54,896
either the dead
will defeat the living,

676
00:41:54,897 --> 00:41:56,854
in which case...

677
00:41:56,855 --> 00:41:58,937
all our troubles come to an end,

678
00:41:58,938 --> 00:42:01,313
or life will win out.

679
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:03,313
And what then?

680
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:07,314
Don't fight in the
North or the South.

681
00:42:08,897 --> 00:42:13,772
Fight every battle, everywhere,
always, in your mind.

682
00:42:15,689 --> 00:42:17,563
Everyone is your enemy,

683
00:42:17,564 --> 00:42:20,480
everyone is your friend...

684
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:24,605
every possible series of events
is happening all at once.

685
00:42:24,606 --> 00:42:28,188
Live that way and nothing
will surprise you.

686
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:30,771
Everything that happens
will be something

687
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:32,689
that you've seen before.

688
00:42:34,938 --> 00:42:37,689
Lady Sansa, at the gate.

689
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,980
( people murmuring )

690
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,397
Hello, Sansa.

691
00:43:18,689 --> 00:43:20,564
( sobbing )

692
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:34,396
I wish Jon were here.

693
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:37,272
Yes, I need to speak to him.

694
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,063
You're Father's
last living trueborn son.

695
00:43:45,897 --> 00:43:48,771
You're Lord of Winterfell now.

696
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:52,021
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

697
00:43:52,022 --> 00:43:53,854
I can never be lord of anything.

698
00:43:53,855 --> 00:43:55,105
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

699
00:43:57,189 --> 00:43:58,979
I don't know what that means.

700
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,396
It's difficult to explain.

701
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:03,606
Try.
Please, for me.

702
00:44:05,314 --> 00:44:08,271
It means I can see everything.

703
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:10,605
Everything that's ever
happened to everyone.

704
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,605
Everything that's
happening right now.

705
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:18,396
It's all pieces now, fragments.

706
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:20,605
I need to learn to see better.

707
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:24,021
When the Long Night comes again,

708
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:25,647
I need to be ready.

709
00:44:28,689 --> 00:44:31,104
How do you know all this?

710
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:32,646
The Three-Eyed Raven
taught me.

711
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:34,563
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

712
00:44:34,564 --> 00:44:37,313
I told you it's
difficult to explain.

713
00:44:37,314 --> 00:44:39,480
( sighs )

714
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:40,979
Bran--

715
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,354
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

716
00:44:43,355 --> 00:44:47,355
I'm sorry it had to
happen here in our home.

717
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,647
It was so beautiful that night.

718
00:44:56,647 --> 00:45:00,647
Snow falling, just like now.

719
00:45:03,897 --> 00:45:05,731
And you were so beautiful...

720
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:09,481
in your white wedding dress.

721
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:15,230
I have to go back inside, Bran.

722
00:45:16,606 --> 00:45:18,314
I'll stay a bit longer.

723
00:45:29,606 --> 00:45:32,021
( man coughing in distance )

724
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,564
Hmm.

725
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:43,897
Hmm.

726
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:51,229
Does it hurt?

727
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,938
A bit.
Less than before.

728
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:58,354
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

729
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,937
( sighs )

730
00:45:59,938 --> 00:46:01,771
Unusual.

731
00:46:01,772 --> 00:46:03,229
Unlikely.

732
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,229
One could almost be forgiven

733
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,812
for thinking that the entire upper
layer of diseased skin was debrided

734
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:13,188
and the underlying region treated
with some sort of unguent.

735
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:16,480
Don't know anything about that.

736
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:18,563
I just started feeling better.

737
00:46:18,564 --> 00:46:22,230
I assumed it was
the rest that did it.

738
00:46:24,189 --> 00:46:26,812
And the climate.

739
00:46:26,813 --> 00:46:28,771
The climate.

740
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:30,563
You're free to go, ser.

741
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:32,605
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

742
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:34,313
which you are no longer.

743
00:46:34,314 --> 00:46:37,813
Tarly, I'd like to speak with
you in my study this evening.

744
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:42,063
How bad is it?

745
00:46:43,731 --> 00:46:45,105
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

746
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,937
- Where will you go?
- ( grunts )

747
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:56,647
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

748
00:46:58,105 --> 00:47:00,937
I knew it would kill me

749
00:47:00,938 --> 00:47:03,605
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

750
00:47:03,606 --> 00:47:06,854
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

751
00:47:06,855 --> 00:47:10,480
The only place for me
is back with her.

752
00:47:10,481 --> 00:47:12,896
I owe her my life.

753
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:15,480
Her and you.

754
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,688
( chuckles )

755
00:47:17,689 --> 00:47:20,021
Your father saved me
more than once.

756
00:47:20,022 --> 00:47:21,813
It's the least I could do.

757
00:47:23,314 --> 00:47:26,688
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

758
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:28,105
I hope they do.

759
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:58,688
- EBROSE: You treated him?
- Yes.

760
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:01,188
Who told you to treat him?

761
00:48:01,189 --> 00:48:02,521
No one.

762
00:48:02,522 --> 00:48:05,812
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

763
00:48:05,813 --> 00:48:08,521
I seem to remember you.

764
00:48:08,522 --> 00:48:11,355
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

765
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:16,146
I forbade it because it is
dangerous and rarely successful,

766
00:48:16,147 --> 00:48:18,480
especially on
someone of that age.

767
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:20,688
You could have infected
yourself and others.

768
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,147
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

769
00:48:26,439 --> 00:48:28,354
But you didn't.

770
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:30,979
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

771
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,396
Many maesters whose chains
are heavy with healing links

772
00:48:34,397 --> 00:48:36,854
have attempted it and failed.

773
00:48:36,855 --> 00:48:38,937
Yet you succeeded.

774
00:48:38,938 --> 00:48:40,063
How?

775
00:48:42,063 --> 00:48:45,355
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

776
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:57,938
That man is alive
because of you.

777
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,855
You should be proud.

778
00:49:04,938 --> 00:49:07,438
Thank you, Archmaester.

779
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:08,439
Come here.

780
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:16,062
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

781
00:49:16,063 --> 00:49:18,731
I need you
to make copies of them.

782
00:49:23,022 --> 00:49:25,105
You were expecting a reward.

783
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:30,606
Your reward is not being immediately
expelled from the Citadel.

784
00:49:31,772 --> 00:49:33,771
You'd better get started.

785
00:49:33,772 --> 00:49:35,438
And careful of the paper mites.

786
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,772
They like flesh as well.

787
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,396
We need to find Euron
Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

788
00:49:47,397 --> 00:49:50,896
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

789
00:49:50,897 --> 00:49:52,438
To send our remaining
ships after him--

790
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:55,105
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

791
00:49:58,938 --> 00:50:00,480
Would you have to go yourself?

792
00:50:00,481 --> 00:50:02,480
Euron's ships could be anywhere

793
00:50:02,481 --> 00:50:04,480
or in more than one place.

794
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,896
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

795
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:07,937
for who knows how long.

796
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,563
I wouldn't be alone.

797
00:50:09,564 --> 00:50:12,146
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

798
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:13,937
What can anyone do to them?

799
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:15,937
MISSANDEI: They can still
do something to you.

800
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:17,730
It only takes one arrow.

801
00:50:17,731 --> 00:50:20,272
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

802
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:24,730
What about Casterly Rock?

803
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,688
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

804
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:29,271
And what will they face?

805
00:50:29,272 --> 00:50:31,688
A difficult situation.

806
00:50:31,689 --> 00:50:33,812
They know we're coming.

807
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:37,146
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

808
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:38,771
is to destroy House Lannister.

809
00:50:38,772 --> 00:50:40,522
She will be ready.

810
00:50:44,522 --> 00:50:47,146
- No one has ever taken the Rock.
- MAN: Archers!

811
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:49,521
TYRION: The Lannister Army is
still the army my father built.

812
00:50:49,522 --> 00:50:51,854
- Come on!
- TYRION: Well-trained and well-provisioned.

813
00:50:51,855 --> 00:50:53,646
10,000 men at least.

814
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:54,647
They will see us coming.

815
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,854
They will be ready.

816
00:51:00,855 --> 00:51:04,146
( men shouting )

817
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:06,189
- MAN: Draw! Loose!
- MAN #2: Loose!

818
00:51:08,397 --> 00:51:11,522
TYRION: The gates of Casterly
Rock are impregnable.

819
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:14,731
( men grunting )

820
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,480
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

821
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:23,022
We will be at a disadvantage.

822
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:26,063
- ( grunts )
- Many men will die.

823
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,272
Just as my father
said they would.

824
00:51:32,439 --> 00:51:35,062
Interesting thing
about my father--

825
00:51:35,063 --> 00:51:36,979
he built our house up
from near ruin.

826
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,146
He built our army, he built
Casterly Rock as we know it,

827
00:51:41,147 --> 00:51:43,229
but he didn't build the sewers.

828
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,313
That was beneath him,

829
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,188
so he gave the job to the
lowest person he could find--

830
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:49,730
me.

831
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,563
He was right, I was low.

832
00:51:51,564 --> 00:51:53,688
The company I kept, low.

833
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:55,229
Women, mostly.

834
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,896
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

835
00:51:56,897 --> 00:51:59,188
Father disapproved
of that sort of behavior.

836
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:00,812
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

837
00:52:00,813 --> 00:52:02,271
I couldn't have them
in my chambers,

838
00:52:02,272 --> 00:52:04,521
so in the process
of building the sewers,

839
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:07,272
I threw in something for myself.

840
00:52:09,314 --> 00:52:11,313
It was a passage that began

841
00:52:11,314 --> 00:52:13,021
in an out of the way cove
by the sea

842
00:52:13,022 --> 00:52:16,438
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

843
00:52:16,439 --> 00:52:19,647
No better place for low pursuits
than beneath the ground.

844
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:25,021
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

845
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:27,271
( grunts, wheezes )

846
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:30,937
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

847
00:52:30,938 --> 00:52:34,896
"Give me 10 good men
and I'll impregnate the bitch."

848
00:52:34,897 --> 00:52:37,439
- ( grunting )
- ( all shouting )

849
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:41,647
And so it begins.

850
00:52:48,397 --> 00:52:51,271
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

851
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:53,146
They will be outnumbered.

852
00:52:53,147 --> 00:52:55,481
They will have less armor
and fewer weapons.

853
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:04,229
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

854
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,188
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

855
00:53:07,189 --> 00:53:09,188
They will be fighting
for freedom

856
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,979
and the person
who gave it to them.

857
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,480
They will be fighting for you.

858
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,938
And that is why
they will triumph.

859
00:53:31,938 --> 00:53:33,689
_

860
00:53:35,147 --> 00:53:37,355
_

861
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:40,160
_

862
00:53:41,397 --> 00:53:44,355
( distant explosions )

863
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:03,896
Where are they?!

864
00:54:03,897 --> 00:54:06,522
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

865
00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:39,564
( men shouting )

866
00:55:01,439 --> 00:55:02,980
( chatter )

867
00:55:29,147 --> 00:55:31,355
( door opens )

868
00:55:35,397 --> 00:55:37,647
- It's done.
- It is.

869
00:55:39,522 --> 00:55:43,647
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

870
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,438
Did we fight well?

871
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:50,480
Uh, as well
as could be expected.

872
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:52,605
It was never our forte.

873
00:55:52,606 --> 00:55:54,689
Golden roses, indeed.

874
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:58,646
Your brother and his new queen

875
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:01,563
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

876
00:56:01,564 --> 00:56:04,854
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

877
00:56:04,855 --> 00:56:06,438
Well, it is to me,

878
00:56:06,439 --> 00:56:08,771
but my fond childhood memories

879
00:56:08,772 --> 00:56:10,313
won't keep Cersei on the throne.

880
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:12,438
So you just let them take it?

881
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:14,480
For now. They won't
be able to hold it.

882
00:56:14,481 --> 00:56:17,021
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

883
00:56:17,022 --> 00:56:19,021
we emptied the larders
before we left.

884
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:21,271
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

885
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:24,688
and march all the way
across Westeros.

886
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:27,854
And you took your army,
your real army,

887
00:56:27,855 --> 00:56:29,730
and went where they weren't.

888
00:56:29,731 --> 00:56:33,062
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

889
00:56:33,063 --> 00:56:35,104
There are always
lessons in failures.

890
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:38,689
Yes. You must be
very wise by now.

891
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,854
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

892
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:44,605
If he was so clever,

893
00:56:44,606 --> 00:56:46,354
why didn't he take Highgarden

894
00:56:46,355 --> 00:56:50,062
the moment your
gold mines ran dry?

895
00:56:50,063 --> 00:56:51,605
( scoffs )

896
00:56:51,606 --> 00:56:55,521
I suppose I'll be able to
ask him myself soon enough.

897
00:56:55,522 --> 00:56:58,606
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

898
00:57:01,063 --> 00:57:03,563
How will you do it?

899
00:57:03,564 --> 00:57:06,021
With that sword?

900
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,396
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

901
00:57:08,397 --> 00:57:10,730
Not that he ever used it.

902
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:12,397
What did he call it?

903
00:57:14,022 --> 00:57:16,354
Widow's Wail.

904
00:57:16,355 --> 00:57:18,564
He really was a cunt, wasn't he?

905
00:57:20,189 --> 00:57:25,563
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

906
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:29,605
Or watched them
being done on my orders.

907
00:57:29,606 --> 00:57:32,771
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

908
00:57:32,772 --> 00:57:34,812
They were necessary.

909
00:57:34,813 --> 00:57:36,854
And whatever
I imagined necessary

910
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:40,771
for the safety
of House Tyrell, I did.

911
00:57:40,772 --> 00:57:45,397
But your sister
has done things...

912
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,396
I was incapable of imagining.

913
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:52,229
That was
my prize mistake--

914
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,772
a failure of imagination.

915
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:58,563
She's a monster,
you do know that?

916
00:57:58,564 --> 00:58:00,730
To you, I'm sure.

917
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:02,605
To others as well.

918
00:58:02,606 --> 00:58:06,104
But after we've won and there's
no one left to oppose us,

919
00:58:06,105 --> 00:58:10,438
when people are living peacefully
in the world she built,

920
00:58:10,439 --> 00:58:14,147
do you really think they'll wring their
hands over the way she built it?

921
00:58:16,564 --> 00:58:18,771
You love her.

922
00:58:18,772 --> 00:58:20,563
You really do love her.

923
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:23,021
You poor fool.

924
00:58:23,022 --> 00:58:24,771
She'll be the end of you.

925
00:58:24,772 --> 00:58:27,313
Possibly.

926
00:58:27,314 --> 00:58:29,104
Not much to be gained

927
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,146
from discussing it with
you, though, is there?

928
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:33,854
What better person
to discuss it with?

929
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,771
What better guarantee
could you have

930
00:58:35,772 --> 00:58:39,812
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

931
00:58:39,813 --> 00:58:42,854
But perhaps you're right.

932
00:58:42,855 --> 00:58:44,438
If she's driven you this far,

933
00:58:44,439 --> 00:58:46,855
it's gone beyond your control.

934
00:58:48,147 --> 00:58:50,146
Yes.

935
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:51,606
It has.

936
00:58:52,689 --> 00:58:54,730
She's a disease.

937
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,688
I regret my role
in spreading it.

938
00:58:57,689 --> 00:58:59,271
You will, too.

939
00:58:59,272 --> 00:59:01,022
I think we're done here.

940
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:05,481
How will it happen?

941
00:59:07,022 --> 00:59:08,937
Cersei had several ideas.

942
00:59:08,938 --> 00:59:10,354
Whipping you through the streets

943
00:59:10,355 --> 00:59:13,021
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

944
00:59:13,022 --> 00:59:16,855
Flaying you alive and hanging you
from the walls of King's Landing.

945
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:21,813
I talked her out of those.

946
00:59:39,063 --> 00:59:40,480
Will there be pain?

947
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:43,062
No. I made sure
of that.

948
00:59:43,063 --> 00:59:44,397
That's good.

949
00:59:57,189 --> 00:59:59,189
I'd hate to die like your son.

950
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:01,854
Clawing at my neck,

951
01:00:01,855 --> 01:00:04,730
foam and bile spilling
from my mouth,

952
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:08,563
eyes bloodred, skin purple.

953
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:10,937
Must have been horrible for you,

954
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:14,396
as a Kingsguard, as a father.

955
01:00:14,397 --> 01:00:16,979
It was horrible enough for me.

956
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,646
A shocking scene.

957
01:00:19,647 --> 01:00:22,439
Not at all what I intended.

958
01:00:24,397 --> 01:00:28,980
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

959
01:00:33,938 --> 01:00:36,104
Tell Cersei.

960
01:00:36,105 --> 01:00:38,564
I want her to know it was me.

961
01:00:54,185 --> 01:01:04,813
